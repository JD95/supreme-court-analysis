CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1999

HARTFORD UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE CO. v.

UNION PLANTERS BANK, N. A.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 99-409. Argued March 20, 2000--Decided May 30, 2000
During attempted reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy

Code, debtor Hen House Interstate, Inc., obtained workers' compensation insurance from petitioner Hartford Underwriters. Although
Hen House repeatedly failed to make the monthly premium payments
required by the policy, Hartford continued to provide insurance. The
reorganization ultimately failed, and the court converted the case to
a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding and appointed a trustee. Learning of the bankruptcy proceedings after the conversion, and recognizing that the estate lacked unencumbered funds to pay the premiums
owed, Hartford attempted to charge the premiums to respondent bank,
a secured creditor, pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 506(c). The Bankruptcy
Court ruled for Hartford, and the District Court affirmed, but the
en banc Eighth Circuit reversed, concluding that $ 506(c) could not be
invoked by an administrative claimant.

Held: Section 506(c) does not provide an administrative claimant of a

bankruptcy estate an independent right to seek payment of its claim
from property encumbered by a secured creditor's lien. Pp. 4-14.

(a) As an administrative claimant, petitioner is not a proper party
to seek recovery under $ 506(c), which provides: "The trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the . . . costs

Syllabus

and expenses of preserving, or disposing of, such property . . . ." The
statute appears quite plain in specifying who may use $ 506(c)--"[t]he
trustee." Although the statutory text does not actually say that persons other than the trustee may not seek recovery under $ 506(c), several contextual features support that conclusion. First, a situation
in which a statute authorizes specific action and designates a particular party empowered to take it is surely among the least appropriate
in which to presume nonexclusivity. Second, the fact that the sole
party named--the trustee--has a unique role in bankruptcy proceedings
makes it entirely plausible that Congress would provide a power to him
and not to others. Further, had Congress intended the provision to be
broadly available, it could simply have said so, as it has in describing
the parties who could act under other sections of the Code. The Court
rejects as unpersuasive petitioner's arguments from $ 506(c)'s text:
that the use in other Code provisions of "only" or other expressly restrictive language in specifying the parties at issue means that no party
in interest is excluded from $ 506(c), and that the right of a nontrustee
to recover under $ 506(c) is evidenced by $ 1109. Pp. 4-9.

(b) The Court also rejects arguments based on pre-Code practice
and policy considerations that petitioner advances in support of its assertion that $ 506(c) is available to parties other than the trustee. It is
questionable whether the pre-Code precedents relied on by petitioner
establish a bankruptcy practice sufficiently widespread and well recognized to justify the conclusion of implicit adoption by Congress in enacting the Code. In any event, where, as here, the meaning of the Code's
text is itself clear, its operation is unimpeded by contrary prior practice.
Also unavailing is petitioner's argument that its reading is necessary as
a matter of policy, since in some cases the trustee may lack an incentive
to pursue payment. It is far from clear that the relevant policy implications favor petitioner's position, and, in any event, achieving a better
policy outcome--if what petitioner urges is that--is a task for Congress,
not the courts. Pp. 9-14.

Opinion of the Court
Robert H. Brownlee argued the cause for respondent.With him on the brief was

David D. Farrell.*

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, we consider whether 11 U. S. C. $ 506(c) allowsan administrative claimant of a bankruptcy estate to seek

payment of its claim from property encumbered by a secured
creditor's lien. I

This case arises out of the bankruptcy proceedings of
Hen House Interstate, Inc., which at one time owned oroperated several restaurants and service stations, as well

as an outdoor-advertising firm. On September 5, 1991, Hen
House filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of theBankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for

the Eastern District of Missouri. As a Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession, Hen House retained possession of its assets
and continued operating its business.Respondent had been Hen House's primary lender.

1 At

the time the Chapter 11 petition was filed, it held a secu-rity interest in essentially all of Hen House's real and

personal property, securing an indebtedness of over $4 mil-lion. After the Chapter 11 proceedings were commenced, it
agreed to lend Hen House an additional $300,000 to helpfinance the reorganization. The Bankruptcy Court entered
a financing order approving the loan agreement and author*Mark F. Horning, Sidney P. Levinson, Craig A. Berrington, and Phillip L. Schwartz filed a brief for the American Insurance Association et al.
as amici curiae urging reversal.

Carter G. Phillips and Shalom L. Kohn filed a brief for the Commercial
Finance Association as amicus curiae urging affirmance.

1 Respondent Union Planters Bank is the successor of Magna Bank,

which is in turn the successor of Landmark Bank of Illinois. Hen House
was originally indebted to Landmark Bank. For simplicity, we will not
distinguish between the various entities.

Opinion of the Court

izing Hen House to use loan proceeds and cash collateral to
pay expenses, including workers' compensation expenses.

During the attempted reorganization, Hen House obtained
workers' compensation insurance from petitioner Hartford
Underwriters (which was unaware of the bankruptcy proceedings). Although the policy required monthly premium
payments, Hen House repeatedly failed to make them; Hartford continued to provide insurance nonetheless. The reorganization ultimately failed, and on January 20, 1993, the
Bankruptcy Court converted the case to a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7 and appointed a trustee. At the
time of the conversion, Hen House owed Hartford more
than $50,000 in unpaid premiums. Hartford learned of Hen
House's bankruptcy proceedings after the conversion, in
March 1993.

Recognizing that the estate lacked unencumbered funds
to pay the premiums, Hartford attempted to charge the premiums to respondent, the secured creditor, by filing with the
Bankruptcy Court an "Application for Allowance of Administrative Expense, Pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 503 and Charge
Against Collateral, Pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 506(c)." The
Bankruptcy Court ruled in favor of Hartford, and the District Court and an Eighth Circuit panel affirmed, In re Hen
House Interstate, Inc., 150 F. 3d 868 (CA8 1998). The
Eighth Circuit subsequently granted en banc review, however, and reversed, concluding that $ 506(c) could not be invoked by an administrative claimant. In re Hen House Interstate, Inc., 177 F. 3d 719 (1999). We granted certiorari.
528 U. S. 985 (2000).

II

Petitioner's effort to recover the unpaid premiums involves two provisions, 11 U. S. C. $$ 503(b) and 506(c). Section 503(b) provides that "the actual, necessary costs and
expenses of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries,
or commissions for services rendered after the commence530US1 Unit: $U63 [10-22-01 17:06:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ment of the case," are treated as administrative expenses,which are, as a rule, entitled to priority over prepetition unsecured claims, see $$ 507(a)(1), 726(a)(1), 1129(a)(9)(A). Re-spondent does not dispute that the cost of the workers' compensation insurance Hen House purchased from petitioner isan administrative expense within the meaning of this provision. Administrative expenses, however, do not have priority over secured claims, see $$ 506, 725-726, 1129(b)(2)(A);
United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 378-379 (1988), and becauserespondent held a security interest in essentially all of the

estate's assets, there were no unencumbered funds availableto pay even administrative claimants.

Petitioner therefore looked to $ 506(c), which constitutesan important exception to the rule that secured claims are
superior to administrative claims. That section providesas follows:

"The trustee may recover from property securing anallowed secured claim the reasonable, necessary costs
and expenses of preserving, or disposing of, such prop-erty to the extent of any benefit to the holder of such
claim." $ 506(c).
Petitioner argued that this provision entitled it to recover
from the property subject to respondent's security inter-est the unpaid premiums owed by Hen House, since its furnishing of workers' compensation insurance benefited re-spondent by allowing continued operation of Hen House's
business, thereby preserving the value of respondent's col-lateral; or alternatively, that such benefit could be presumed from respondent's consent to the postpetition financing order. Although it was contested below whether, under
either theory, the workers' compensation insurance constituted a "benefit to the holder" within the meaning of $ 506(c),
that issue is not before us here; we assume for purposes of
this decision that it did, and consider only whether peti530US1 Unit: $U63 [10-22-01 17:06:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

PLANTERS BANK, N. A.

Opinion of the Court

tioner--an administrative claimant--is a proper party toseek recovery under $ 506(c).

2

In answering this question, we begin with the under-standing that Congress "says in a statute what it means and

means in a statute what it says there," Connecticut Nat.Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 254 (1992). As we have
previously noted in construing another provision of $ 506,when "the statute's language is plain, `the sole function
of the courts' "--at least where the disposition required bythe text is not absurd--" `is to enforce it according to its
terms.' " United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489U. S. 235, 241 (1989) (quoting

Caminetti v. United States,242 U. S. 470, 485 (1917)). Here, the statute appears quite

plain in specifying who may use $ 506(c)--"[t]he trustee."It is true, however, as petitioner notes, that all this actually
"says" is that the trustee may seek recovery under the sec-tion, not that others may not. The question thus becomes
whether it is a proper inference that the trustee is the only
party empowered to invoke the provision.3 We have littledifficulty answering yes.

Several contextual features here support the conclusionthat exclusivity is intended. First, a situation in which a
statute authorizes specific action and designates a particu-lar party empowered to take it is surely among the least
appropriate in which to presume nonexclusivity. "Where a

2 In addition to seeking recovery under $ 506(c), petitioner argued to
the Eighth Circuit en banc that it was entitled to recover under the terms
of the postpetition financing order itself. Petitioner sought to enforce
that order under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7071, which incorporates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 71 ("When an order is made
in favor of a person who is not a party to the action, that person may
enforce obedience to the order by the same process as if a party . . .").
The Eighth Circuit declined to address this issue, since it had not been
raised until the rehearing en banc, In re Hen House Interstate, Inc., 177
F. 3d 719, 724 (1999). We similarly do not reach the issue here.

3 Debtors-in-possession may also use the section, as they are expressly

given the rights and powers of a trustee by 11 U. S. C. $ 1107.

statute . . . names the parties granted [the] right to invokeits provisions, . . . such parties only may act." 2A N. Singer,

Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 47.23, p. 217 (5th ed.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also

Federal
Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action
Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 486 (1985). Second, the fact that the
sole party named--the trustee--has a unique role in bankruptcy proceedings makes it entirely plausible that Congresswould provide a power to him and not to others. Indeed,

had no particular parties been specified--had $ 506(c) readsimply "[t]here may be recovered from property securing an
allowed secured claim the reasonable, necessary costs and
expenses, etc."--the trustee is the most obvious party who
would have been thought empowered to use the provision.
It is thus far more sensible to view the provision as answering the question "Who may use the provision?" with "only
the trustee" than to view it as simply answering the question
"May the trustee use the provision?" with "yes."

Nor can it be argued that the point of the provision was
simply to establish that certain costs may be recovered from
collateral, and not to say anything about who may recover
them. Had that been Congress's intention, it could easily
have used the formulation just suggested. Similarly, had
Congress intended the provision to be broadly available, it
could simply have said so, as it did in describing the parties
who could act under other sections of the Code. Section
502(a), for example, provides that a claim is allowed unless
"a party in interest" objects, and $ 503(b)(4) allows "an entity" to file a request for payment of an administrative expense. The broad phrasing of these sections, when contrasted with the use of "the trustee" in $ 506(c), supports the
conclusion that entities other than the trustee are not entitled to use $ 506(c). Russello v. United States, 464 U. S.
16, 23 (1983).

Petitioner's primary argument from the text of $ 506(c) is
that "what matters is that section 506(c) does not say that

530US1 Unit: $U63 [10-22-01 17:06:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
8 HARTFORD UNDERWRITERS INS. CO. v. UNION

PLANTERS BANK, N. A.

Opinion of the Court

`only' a trustee may enforce its provisions." Brief for Peti-tioner 29. To bolster this argument, petitioner cites other

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that do use "only" orother expressly restrictive language in specifying the parties
at issue. See, e. g., $ 109(a) ("[O]nly a person that resides orhas a domicile, a place of business, or property in the United
States, or a municipality, may be a debtor under this title");

$ 707(b) (providing that a case may be dismissed for substan-tial abuse by "the court, on its own motion or on a motion

by the United States trustee, but not at the request or sug-gestion of any party in interest"). Petitioner argues that in
the absence of such restrictive language, no party in interest
is excluded. This theory--that the expression of one thing
indicates the inclusion of others unless exclusion is made
explicit--is contrary to common sense and common usage.
Many provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that do not contain an express exclusion cannot sensibly be read to extend
to all parties in interest. See, e. g., $ 363(b)(1) (providing
that "[t]he trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell,
or lease . . . property of the estate"); $ 364(a) (providing that
"the trustee" may incur debt on behalf of the bankruptcy
estate); $ 554(a) (giving "the trustee" power to abandon property of the bankruptcy estate).

Petitioner further argues that $ 1109 evidences the right
of a nontrustee to recover under $ 506(c). We are not persuaded. That section, which provides that a "party in interest" "may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue
in a case under [Chapter 11]," is by its terms inapplicable
here, since petitioner's attempt to use $ 506(c) came after the
bankruptcy proceeding was converted from Chapter 11 to
Chapter 7. In any event, we do not read $ 1109(b)'s general
provision of a right to be heard as broadly allowing a creditor
to pursue substantive remedies that other Code provisions
make available only to other specific parties. Cf. 7 L. King,
Collier on Bankruptcy || 1109.05 (rev. 15th ed. 1999) ("In general, section 1109 does not bestow any right to usurp the

Opinion of the Court
trustee's role as representative of the estate with respectto the initiation of certain types of litigation that belong

exclusively to the estate").

III
Because we believe that by far the most natural readingof $ 506(c) is that it extends only to the trustee, petitioner's

burden of persuading us that the section must be read toallow its use by other parties is " `exceptionally heavy.' "
Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U. S. 753, 760 (1992) (quotingUnion Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 156 (1991)). To support
its proffered reading, petitioner advances arguments basedon pre-Code practice and policy considerations. We address
these arguments in turn. A

Section 506(c)'s provision for the charge of certain admin-istrative expenses against lienholders continues a practice
that existed under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, see, e. g.,In re Tyne, 257 F. 2d 310, 312 (CA7 1958); 4 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, || 506.05[1]. It was not to be found in the textof the Act, but traced its origin to early cases establishing an equitable principle that where a court has cus-tody of property, costs of administering and preserving the
property are a dominant charge, see, e. g., Bronson v. La
Crosse & Milwaukee R. Co., 1 Wall. 405, 410 (1864); AtlanticTrust Co. v. Chapman, 208 U. S. 360, 376 (1908). It was the

norm that recovery of costs from a secured creditor wouldbe sought by the trustee, see, e. g., Textile Banking Co. v.
Widener, 265 F. 2d 446, 453-454 (CA4 1959); Tyne, supra,at 312. Petitioner cites a number of lower court cases, however, in which--without meaningful discussion of the point--parties other than the trustee were permitted to pursue such
charges under the Act, sometimes simultaneously with thetrustee's pursuit of his own expenses, see, e. g., First Western
Savings and Loan Assn. v. Anderson, 252 F. 2d 544, 547-548(CA9 1958);

In re Chapman Coal Co., 196 F. 2d 779,
780 (CA7 1952); In re Rotary Tire & Rubber Co., 2 F. 2d 364(CA6 1924). Petitioner also relies on early decisions of this

Court allowing individual claimants to seek recovery fromsecured assets, see

Louisville, E. & St. L. R. Co. v. Wilson,
138 U. S. 501, 506 (1891); Burnham v. Bowen, 111 U. S. 776,
779, 783 (1884); New York Dock Co. v. S. S. Poznan, 274 U. S.117, 121 (1927).

Wilson and Burnham involved equity receiverships, and were not only pre-Code, but predate theBankruptcy Act of 1898 that the Code replaced; while

New
York Dock was a case arising in admiralty.

It is questionable whether these precedents establish a
bankruptcy practice sufficiently widespread and well recognized to justify the conclusion of implicit adoption by the
Code. We have no confidence that the allowance of recovery from collateral by nontrustees is "the type of `rule'
that . . . Congress was aware of when enacting the Code."
United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S., at
246. Cf. Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U. S. 410, 418 (1992) (relying on "clearly established" pre-Code practice); Kelly v.
Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 46 (1986) (giving weight to pre-Code
practice that was "widely accepted" and "established"). In
any event, while pre-Code practice "informs our understanding of the language of the Code," id., at 44, it cannot
overcome that language. It is a tool of construction, not
an extratextual supplement. We have applied it to the
construction of provisions which were "subject to interpretation," id., at 50, or contained "ambiguity in the text,"
Dewsnup, supra, at 417. "[W]here the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code's text is itself clear . . . its operation is unimpeded by contrary . . . prior practice," BFP v. Resolution
Trust Corporation, 511 U. S. 531, 546 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). See, e. g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 563 (1990); United
States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., supra, at 245-246.

Opinion of the Court
In this case, we think the language of the Code leavesno room for clarification by pre-Code practice. If $ 506(c)

provided only that certain costs and expenses could be re-covered from property securing a secured claim, without
specifying any particular party by whom the recovery couldbe pursued, the case would be akin to those in which we
used prior practice to fill in the details of a pre-Code conceptthat the Code had adopted without elaboration. See,

e. g.,United States v. Noland, 517 U. S. 535, 539 (1996) (looking

to pre-Code practice in interpreting Code's reference to"principles of equitable subordination"); Midlantic Nat.
Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, 474U. S. 494, 501 (1986) (codification of trustee's abandonment
power held to incorporate established exceptions). Here,however, it is not the unelaborated concept but only a specifically narrowed one that has been adopted: a rule allowingthe charge of costs to secured assets by the trustee. PreCode practice cannot transform $ 506(c)'s reference to "thetrustee" to "the trustee and other parties in interest."

B
Finally, petitioner argues that its reading is necessaryas a matter of policy, since in some cases the trustee may

lack an incentive to pursue payment. Section 506(c) mustbe open to nontrustees, petitioner asserts, lest secured creditors enjoy the benefit of services without paying for them.Moreover, ensuring that administrative claimants are compensated may also serve purposes beyond the avoidance ofunjust enrichment. To the extent that there are circumstances in which the trustee will not use the section althoughan individual creditor would,

4 The frequency with which such circumstances arise may depend in
part on who ultimately receives the recovery obtained by a trustee under

$ 506(c). Petitioner argues that it goes to the party who provided the
services that benefited collateral (assuming that party has not already
been compensated by the estate). Respondent argues that this read530US1 Unit: $U63 [10-22-01 17:06:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

could encourage the provision of postpetition services todebtors on more favorable terms, which would in turn further bankruptcy's goals.Although these concerns may be valid, it is far from clear
that the policy implications favor petitioner's position. Theclass of cases in which $ 506(c) would lie dormant without
nontrustee use is limited by the fact that the trustee is
obliged to seek recovery under the section whenever hisfiduciary duties so require. And limiting $ 506(c) to the

trustee does not leave those who provide goods or servicesthat benefit secured interests without other means of protecting themselves as against other creditors: They may in-sist on cash payment, or contract directly with the secured
creditor, and may be able to obtain superpriority under$ 364(c)(1) or a security interest under $$ 364(c)(2), (3), or

$ 364(d). And of course postpetition creditors can avoidunnecessary losses simply by paying attention to the status
of their accounts, a protection which, by all appearances,
petitioner neglected here.

On the other side of the ledger, petitioner's reading would
itself lead to results that seem undesirable as a matter of
policy. In particular, expanding the number of parties who
could use $ 506(c) would create the possibility of multiple
administrative claimants seeking recovery under the secing, like a reading that allows creditors themselves to use $ 506(c), upsets
the Code's priority scheme by giving administrative claimants who benefit collateral an effective priority over others--allowing, for example, a
Chapter 11 administrative creditor (like petitioner) to obtain payment via

$ 506(c) while Chapter 7 administrative creditors remain unpaid, despite

$ 726(b)'s provision that Chapter 7 administrative claims have priority
over Chapter 11 administrative claims. Thus, respondent asserts that a
trustee's recovery under $ 506(c) simply goes into the estate to be distributed according to the Code's priority provisions. Since this case does
not involve a trustee's recovery under $ 506(c), we do not address this
question, or the related question whether the trustee may use the provision prior to paying the expenses for which reimbursement is sought,
see In re K & L Lakeland, Inc., 128 F. 3d 203, 207, 212 (CA4 1997).

Opinion of the Court
tion. Each such claim would require inquiry into the necessity of the services at issue and the degree of benefit
to the secured creditor. Allowing recovery to be sought at
the behest of parties other than the trustee could therefore
impair the ability of the bankruptcy court to coordinate proceedings, as well as the ability of the trustee to manage the
estate. Indeed, if administrative claimants were free to
seek recovery on their own, they could proceed even where
the trustee himself planned to do so. See, e. g., In re Bluffton Castings Corp., 224 B. R. 902, 904 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ind.
1998).5 Further, where unencumbered assets were scarce,
creditors might attempt to use $ 506(c) even though their
claim to have benefited the secured creditor was quite weak.
The possibility of being targeted for such claims by various
administrative claimants could make secured creditors less
willing to provide postpetition financing.

In any event, we do not sit to assess the relative merits
of different approaches to various bankruptcy problems. It
suffices that the natural reading of the text produces the
result we announce. Achieving a better policy outcome--if
what petitioner urges is that--is a task for Congress, not

5 We do not address whether a bankruptcy court can allow other interested parties to act in the trustee's stead in pursuing recovery under

$ 506(c). Amici American Insurance Association and National Union Fire
Insurance Co. draw our attention to the practice of some courts of allowing
creditors or creditors' committees a derivative right to bring avoidance
actions when the trustee refuses to do so, even though the applicable
Code provisions, see 11 U. S. C. $$ 544, 545, 547(b), 548(a), 549(a), mention
only the trustee. See, e. g., In re Gibson Group, Inc., 66 F. 3d 1436, 1438
(CA6 1995). Whatever the validity of that practice, it has no analogous
application here, since petitioner did not ask the trustee to pursue payment under $ 506(c) and did not seek permission from the Bankruptcy
Court to take such action in the trustee's stead. Petitioner asserted an
independent right to use $ 506(c), which is what we reject today. Cf. In re
Xonics Photochemical, Inc., 841 F. 2d 198, 202-203 (CA7 1988) (holding
that creditor had no right to bring avoidance action independently, but
noting that it might have been able to seek to bring derivative suit).

RALEIGH, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE FOR THE ESTATE OFSTOECKER

v. ILLINOIS DEPARTMENTOF REVENUE

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 99-387. Argued April 17, 2000--Decided May 30, 2000
While debtor Stoecker was its president, a now-defunct Illinois company

purchased a plane out of State and moved it to Illinois. Respondent
claims that this purchase was subject to the State's use tax. When
such tax is unpaid, respondent issues a Notice of Tax Liability to the
taxpayer and may issue a Notice of Penalty Liability against any corporate officer responsible for paying the tax who willfully fails to file
the return or make the payment. By the time respondent discovered
that the tax was unpaid in this case, the company was defunct and
Stoecker was in bankruptcy, with petitioner as his trustee. Respondent filed, inter alia, a Notice of Penalty Liability against Stoecker. The
fact that there was no affirmative proof that he was responsible for or
willfully evaded the payment was not dispositive, for Illinois law shifts
the burden of proof, both on production and persuasion, to the responsible officer once a Notice of Penalty Liability is issued. The Seventh
Circuit ruled for respondent, holding that the burden of proof remained
with petitioner, just as it would have been on Stoecker had the proceedings taken place outside of bankruptcy, and finding that petitioner had
not satisfied the burden of persuasion.

Held: When the substantive law creating a tax obligation puts the burden

of proof on a taxpayer, the burden of proof on the tax claim in bankruptcy court remains where the substantive law put it (in this case, on
the trustee in bankruptcy). Pp. 20-26.

(a) Creditors' entitlements in bankruptcy arise from the underlying
substantive law creating the debtor's obligation, subject to any qualifying or contrary Bankruptcy Code provisions. See Butner v. United
States, 440 U. S. 48, 55. The basic federal rule in bankruptcy is that
state law governs the substance of claims. Id., at 57. In this case,
Illinois tax law establishes the estate's obligation to respondent, placing
the burden of proof on the responsible officer. That burden of proof is
a substantive aspect of such a claim, given its importance to the outcome of cases. See, e. g., Director, Office of Workers' Compensation
Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 271. Tax law is no
candidate for exception from the general rule, for the very fact that the

16 RALEIGH v. ILLINOIS DEPT. OF REVENUE

Syllabus
burden has often been shifted to the taxpayer indicates how critical it is.
Several compelling rationales for this shift--the government's vital interest in acquiring its revenue, the taxpayer's readier access to the relevant information, and the importance of encouraging voluntary compliance--are powerful justifications not to be disregarded lightly. The
Bankruptcy Code makes no provision for altering the burden of proof
on a tax claim, and its silence indicates that no change was intended.
Pp. 20-22.

(b) The trustee's appeals to Code silence are rejected. The state of
pre-Code law does not indicate that the Code is silent because it was
predicated on an alteration of the substantive law of obligations once
a taxpayer enters bankruptcy. And although Vanston Bondholders
Protective Comm. v. Green, 329 U. S. 156, suggested that "allowance"
of claims is a federal matter, that case concerned distribution of assets,
not the validity of claims in the first instance, which, Vanston specifically states, is to be determined by reference to state law, id., at 161.
Nor is the trustee helped by the reference, in City of New York v. Saper,
336 U. S. 328, 332, to "prov[ing]" government claims in the same manner
as other debts, for that reference was to the procedure by which proof
of claim was submitted, not to the validity of the claim. Finally, the
trustee's argument that the Code-mandated priority enjoyed by taxing
authorities over other creditors requires a compensating equality of
treatment when it comes to demonstrating validity of claims distorts a
bankruptcy court's legitimate powers and begs the question about the
relevant principle of equality. Pp. 22-26.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question raised here is who bears the burden of proofon a tax claim in bankruptcy court when the substantive

law creating the tax obligation puts the burden on the tax-payer (in this case, the trustee in bankruptcy). We hold
that bankruptcy does not alter the burden imposed by thesubstantive law.

The issue of state tax liability in question had its genesisin the purchase of an airplane by Chandler Enterprises, Inc.,

a now-defunct Illinois company. William J. Stoecker, forwhom petitioner Raleigh is the trustee in bankruptcy, was
president of Chandler in 1988, when Chandler entered into alease-purchase agreement for the plane, moved it to Illinois,

Opinion of the Court
and ultimately took title under the agreement. See In re
Stoecker, 179 F. 3d 546, 548 (CA7 1999).

According to respondent State Department of Revenue,
the transaction was subject to the Illinois use tax, a sales-tax
substitute imposed on Illinois residents such as Chandler
who buy out of State. If the seller does not remit the tax,
the buyer must, and, when buying a plane, must file a return
and pay the tax within 30 days after the aircraft enters the
State. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 35, $ 105/10 (1999). Chandler
failed to do this.

When the State discovers a failure to file and pay taxes,
its Department of Revenue (the respondent here) determines
the amount of tax due and issues a Notice of Tax Liability
to the taxpayer. $$ 105/12, 120/4. Unless the taxpayer protests within the time provided, the assessment becomes final,
though still subject to judicial review in the Illinois circuit
court. $$ 120/4, 12.

Illinois law also provides that any corporate officer "who
has the control, supervision or responsibility of filing returns
and making payment of the amount of any . . . tax . . . who
wilfully fails to file the return or make the payment . . .
shall be personally liable for a penalty equal to the total
amount of tax unpaid by the [corporation]." $ 735/3-7. The
department determines the amount, and its determination
is "prima facie evidence of a penalty due," ibid., though a
Notice of Penalty Liability issued under this provision is
open to challenge much like the antecedent Notice of Tax
Liability.

By the time the department discovered the unpaid tax
in this case, Chandler was defunct and Stoecker was in
bankruptcy. The department issued both a Notice of Tax
Liability against Chandler and a Notice of Penalty Liability
against Stoecker. See 179 F. 3d, at 549.

The record evidence about Chandler's operations is minimal. A person named Pluhar acted as its financial officer.

19Cite as: 530 U. S. 15 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
There is no evidence directly addressing Stoecker's role in
the filing of Chandler's tax returns or the payment of any
taxes, and so no affirmative proof that he either was responsible for or willfully evaded the payment of the use tax,
see id., at 550. This evidentiary dearth is not necessarily
dispositive, however, due to the provision of Illinois law
shifting the burden of proof, on both production and persuasion, to the responsible officer once a Notice of Penalty
Liability is issued, see Branson v. Department of Revenue,
168 Ill. 2d 247, 256-261, 659 N. E. 2d 961, 966-968 (1995).
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit accordingly
ruled for the Department of Revenue. 179 F. 3d, at 550.

The Court of Appeals thought the trustee may have satisfied his burden of production by identifying Pluhar as the
financial officer but, in any event, had not satisfied his burden
of persuasion. Because Stoecker was the president and, as
far as the record showed, he and Pluhar were the only officers, each would have been involved in Chandler's tax affairs.
Ibid. While it is true that failure to pay must be willful
(at least grossly negligent) to justify the penalty under Illinois law, see Branson, supra, at 254-255, 659 N. E. 2d, at
965, and true that Chandler had an opinion letter from a
reputable lawyer that no tax was due because of certain details of the lease-purchase agreement, there was no evidence
that Stoecker ever saw the letter or relied on it, and nothing
else bearing on the issue of willfulness. See 179 F. 3d, at
550-551.

Obviously, the burden of proof was critical to the resolution of the case, which the Department of Revenue won
because the Court of Appeals held that the burden remained
on the trustee, just as it would have been on the taxpayer
had the proceedings taken place outside of bankruptcy. The
Courts of Appeals are divided on this point: the Seventh
Circuit joined the Third and Fourth Circuits in leaving the
burden on the taxpayer. See Resyn Corp. v. United States,

for the Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have comeout the other way. See In re Placid Oil Co., 988 F. 2d 554,

II
Creditors' entitlements in bankruptcy arise in the firstinstance from the underlying substantive law creating the

debtor's obligation, subject to any qualifying or contraryprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code. See Butner v. United
States, 440 U. S. 48, 55 (1979); Vanston Bondholders Pro-tective Comm. v. Green, 329 U. S. 156, 161-162 (1946). The
"basic federal rule" in bankruptcy is that state law governsthe substance of claims, Butner, supra, at 57, Congress having "generally left the determination of property rights inthe assets of a bankrupt's estate to state law," 440 U. S., at 54
(footnote omitted). "Unless some federal interest requires adifferent result, there is no reason why [the state] interests
should be analyzed differently simply because an interestedparty is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding."

Id., at 55.In this case, the bankruptcy estate's obligation to the Illinois Department of Revenue is established by that State'stax code, which puts the burden of proof on the responsible
officer of the taxpayer, see Branson, supra, at 260-262, 659N. E. 2d, at 968.

The scope of the obligation is the issue here. Do theState's right and the taxpayer's obligation include the burden of proof? Our cases point to an affirmative answer.Given its importance to the outcome of cases, we have long
held the burden of proof to be a "substantive" aspect of a

claim. See, e. g., Director, Office of Workers' CompensationPrograms v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 271 (1994);

Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., 359 U. S. 437, 446 (1959);Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., 317 U. S. 239, 249 (1942).
That is, the burden of proof is an essential element of theclaim itself; one who asserts a claim is entitled to the burden
of proof that normally comes with it.Tax law is no candidate for exception from this general
rule, for the very fact that the burden of proof has oftenbeen placed on the taxpayer indicates how critical the burden rule is, and reflects several compelling rationales: thevital interest of the government in acquiring its lifeblood,
revenue, see Arkansas v. Farm Credit Servs. of Central
Ark., 520 U. S. 821, 826 (1997); the taxpayer's readier accessto the relevant information, see United States v. Rexach,

482 F. 2d 10, 16 (CA1), cert. denied, 414 U. S. 1039 (1973);and the importance of encouraging voluntary compliance
by giving taxpayers incentives to self-report and to keepadequate records in case of dispute, see

United States v.Bisceglia, 420 U. S. 141, 145 (1975). These are powerful

justifications not to be disregarded lightly.1Congress of course may do what it likes with entitlements
in bankruptcy, but there is no sign that Congress meant toalter the burdens of production and persuasion on tax claims.
The Code in several places, to be sure, establishes particularburdens of proof. See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $ 362(g) (relief from
automatic stay), $ 363(o) (adequate protection for creditors),

1 It is true that a trustee may have less access to the facts than a taxpayer with personal knowledge, but the trustee takes custody of the taxpayer's records, see 11 U. S. C. $ 521(4), and may have greater access to
the taxpayer than a creditor. Even if the trustee's advantage is somewhat less than the original taxpayer's, the difference hardly overcomes
the compelling justifications for shifting the burden of proof. The government, of course, is in no better position than it ever was, and remains
without access to sources of proof when the taxpayer has not kept sufficient documentation.

Opinion of the Court

$ 364(d)(2) (same), $ 547(g) (avoidability of preferential trans-fer), $ 1129(d) (confirmation of plan for purpose of avoiding

taxes). But the Code makes no provision for altering theburden on a tax claim, and its silence says that no change
was intended.2 III

The trustee looks for an advantage in the very silence ofthe Code, however, first by arguing that actual, historical
practice favored trustees under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898and various pre-Code revisions up to the current Code's enactment in 1978. He says that courts operating in the daysof the Bankruptcy Act, which was silent on the burden to
prove the validity of claims, almost uniformly placed the
burden on those seeking a share of the bankruptcy estate.Because the Code generally incorporates pre-Code practice

in the absence of explicit revision, the argument goes, andbecause the Code is silent here, we should follow the preCode practice even when this would reverse the burdenimposed outside bankruptcy. This tradition makes sense,
petitioner urges, because in bankruptcy tax authorities areno longer opposed to the original taxpayer, and the choice
is no longer merely whether the tax claim is paid but
whether other innocent creditors must share the bankruptcy
estate with the taxing government.

We, however, find history less availing to the trustee than
he says. While some pre-Code cases put the burden of proof

2 The legislative history indicates that the burden of proof on the issue
of establishing claims was left to the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.

The Bankruptcy Rules are silent on the burden of proof for claims; while
Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3001(f) provides that a proof of
claim (the name for the proper form for filing a claim against a debtor) is
"prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim," this rule
does not address the burden of proof when a trustee disputes a claim.
The Rules thus provide no additional guidance.

5 This state of things is the end

of the argument, for without the weight of solid authority onthe trustee's side, we cannot treat the Code as predicated

on an alteration of the substantive law of obligations once ataxpayer enters bankruptcy. Cf. United Sav. Assn. of Tex.
v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365,381-382 (1988) ("The at best divided [pre-Code] authority . . .
removes all cause for wonder that the alleged departurefrom it should not have been commented upon in the legislative history").The trustee makes a different appeal to Code silence in
pointing to language in Vanston Bondholders Protective
Comm. v. Green, 329 U. S. 156 (1946), suggesting that "allow-ance" of claims is a federal matter. But "allowance" referred to the ordering of valid claims when that case wasdecided, see id., at 162-163, and Vanston, in fact, concerned

authority).

Paschal and Lang Body Co., appear to confuse the burden of production
(which ceases to be relevant upon presentation of a trustee's case) with
the burden of persuasion, under tax statutes that shift the entire burden
of proof to the taxpayer. Whatever we make of their reasoning, these
cases do not follow the rule whose pedigree petitioner wishes to establish.

distribution of assets, not the validity of claims in the firstinstance, see

In re Highland Superstores, Inc., 154 F. 3d 573,
578 (CA6 1998); Fahs v. Martin, 224 F. 2d 387, 394-395 (CA51955). The burden of proof rule in question here bears only

on validity, and as to that the Vanston opinion specificallystates that "[w]hat claims of creditors are valid and subsisting obligations . . . is to be determined by reference to
state law." 329 U. S., at 161 (footnote omitted). Nor is thetrustee helped by

City of New York v. Saper, 336 U. S. 328,
332 (1949), which mentions "prov[ing]" government claimsin the same manner as other debts; the reference was to

the procedure by which proof of claim was submitted and
not to the validity of the claim. While it is true that federal
law has generally evolved to impose the same procedural requirements for claim submission on tax authorities as on
other creditors, ibid., nothing in that evolution has touched
the underlying laws on the elements sufficient to prove a
valid state claim.

Finally, the trustee argues that the Code-mandated priority enjoyed by taxing authorities over other creditors, see
11 U. S. C. $$ 507(a), 503(b)(1)(B), requires a compensating
equality of treatment when it comes to demonstrating validity of claims. But we think his argument distorts the
legitimate powers of a bankruptcy court and begs the question about the relevant principle of equality.

Bankruptcy courts do indeed have some equitable powers
to adjust rights between creditors. See, e. g., $ 510(c) (equitable subordination). That is, within the limits of the Code,
courts may reorder distributions from the bankruptcy estate, in whole or in part, for the sake of treating legitimate
claimants to the estate equitably. But the scope of a bankruptcy court's equitable power must be understood in the
light of the principle of bankruptcy law discussed already,
that the validity of a claim is generally a function of underlying substantive law. Bankruptcy courts are not authorized in the name of equity to make wholesale substitution

of underlying law controlling the validity of creditors' enti-tlements, but are limited to what the Bankruptcy Code itself

provides. See United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S. 213, 228-229 (1996); United
States v. Noland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996).Moreover, even on the assumption that a bankruptcy court

were to have a free hand, the case for a rule placing the
burden of proof uniformly on all bankruptcy creditors is notself-evidently justified by the trustee's invocation of equality.

Certainly the trustee has not shown that equal treatmentof all bankruptcy creditors in proving debts is more compelling than equal treatment of comparable creditors in and
out of bankruptcy. The latter sort of equality can be provided by a bankruptcy court as a matter of course, whereas
the trustee's notion of equality could not be uniformly observed consistently with other bankruptcy principles. Consider the case when tax litigation is pending at the time
the taxpayer files for bankruptcy. The tax litigation will
be subject to an automatic stay, but the stay can be lifted by
the bankruptcy court for cause, see 11 U. S. C. $ 362(d)(1),
which could well include, among other things, a lack of good
faith in attempting to avoid tax proceedings, or in attempting to favor private creditors who might escape the disadvantage of a priority tax claim under the trustee's proposed
rule. See generally 3 Collier on Bankruptcy || 362.07[6][a],
pp. 362-101 to 362-102 (rev. 15th ed. 2000) (noting that bad
faith commencement of case justifies lifting stay); Internal
Revenue Service v. Bacha, 166 B. R. 611, 612 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
Md. 1993) (lifting automatic stay when bankruptcy filing was
attempt to avoid tax proceedings). If the bankruptcy court
exercises its discretion to lift the stay, the burden of proof
will be on the taxpayer in the pre-existing tax litigation, and
a tax liability determination will be final. See 11 U. S. C.

$ 505(a)(2)(A). We see no reason that Congress would have
intended the burden of proof (and consequent vindication
of this trustee's vision of equality) to depend on whether

Opinion of the Court
tax authorities have initiated proceedings against a debtorbefore a bankruptcy filing. Thus, the uncertainty and increased complexity that would be generated by the trustee'sposition is another reason to stick with the simpler rule, that
in the absence of modification expressed in the BankruptcyCode the burden of proof on a tax claim in bankruptcy remains where the substantive tax law puts it.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES v. HUBBELL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 99-166. Argued February 22, 2000--Decided June 5, 2000
As part of a plea agreement, respondent promised to provide the Independent Counsel investigating matters relating to the Whitewater Development Corporation with information relevant to his investigation.
Subsequently, the Independent Counsel served respondent with a subpoena calling for the production of 11 categories of documents before a
grand jury in Little Rock, Arkansas. Respondent appeared before that
jury, invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,
and refused to state whether he had the documents. The prosecutor
then produced an order obtained pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 6003(a) directing respondent to respond to the subpoena and granting him immunity to the extent allowed by law. Respondent produced 13,120
pages of documents and testified that those were all of the responsive
documents in his control. The Independent Counsel used the documents' contents in an investigation that led to this indictment of respondent on tax and fraud charges. The District Court dismissed the
indictment on the ground that the Independent Counsel's use of the
subpoenaed documents violated 18 U. S. C. $ 6002--which provides for
use and derivative-use immunity--because all of the evidence he would
offer against respondent at trial derived either directly or indirectly
from the testimonial aspects of respondent's immunized act of producing the documents. In vacating and remanding, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court to determine the extent and detail
of the Government's knowledge of respondent's financial affairs on the
day the subpoena issued. If the Government could not demonstrate
with reasonable particularity a prior awareness that the documents
sought existed and were in respondent's possession, the indictment was
tainted. Acknowledging that he could not satisfy the reasonable particularity standard, the Independent Counsel entered into a conditional
plea agreement providing for dismissal of the indictment unless this
Court's disposition of the case makes it reasonably likely that respondent's immunity would not pose a significant bar to his prosecution. Because the agreement also provides for the entry of a guilty plea and a
sentence should this Court reverse, the case is not moot.

Syllabus
Held: The indictment against respondent must be dismissed. Pp. 34-46.

(a) The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being "compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." The word "witness" limits the relevant category of compelled incriminating communications to those that are "testimonial." In addition, a person such as
respondent may be required to produce specific documents containing
incriminating assertions of fact or belief because the creation of those
documents was not "compelled" within the meaning of the privilege.
See Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S. 391. However, the act of producing subpoenaed documents may have a compelled testimonial aspect.
That act, as well as a custodian's compelled testimony about whether he
has produced everything demanded, may certainly communicate information about the documents' existence, custody, and authenticity. It is
also well settled that compelled testimony communicating information
that may lead to incriminating evidence is privileged even if the information itself is not inculpatory. Pp. 34-38.

(b) Section 6002 is constitutional because the scope of the "use
and derivative-use" immunity it provides is coextensive with the scope
of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. Kastigar v.
United States, 406 U. S. 441. When a person is prosecuted for matters related to immunized testimony, the prosecution has an affirmative
duty to prove that the evidence it proposes to use is derived from a
legitimate source wholly independent of that testimony. Id., at 460.
This ensures that the grant of immunity leaves the witness and the
Government in substantially the same position as if the witness had
claimed his privilege in the grant's absence. The compelled testimony
relevant here is not to be found in the contents of the documents
produced, but is the testimony inherent in the act of producing those
documents. Pp. 38-40.

(c) The fact that the Government does not intend to use the act
of production in respondent's criminal trial leaves open the separate
question whether it has already made "derivative use" of the testimonial aspect of that act in obtaining the indictment and preparing
for trial. It clearly has. It is apparent from the subpoena's text that
the prosecutor needed respondent's assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce those sources. It is undeniable that providing a catalog of existing documents fitting within any
of the 11 broadly worded subpoena categories could provide a prosecutor with a lead to incriminating evidence or a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute. Indeed, that is what happened here: The
documents sought by one grand jury to see if respondent had violated
a plea agreement led to the return of an indictment by another grand
jury for offenses apparently unrelated to that agreement. The testimonial aspect of respondent's act of production was the first step in a chain

Opinion of the Court
of evidence leading to this prosecution. Thus, the Court cannot accept
the Government's submission that respondent's immunity did not preclude its derivative use of the produced documents because its possession of the documents was the fruit only of the simple physical act
of production. In addition, the Government misreads Fisher v. United
States, 425 U. S., at 411, and ignores United States v. Doe, 465 U. S.
605, in arguing that the communicative aspect of respondent's act of
production is insufficiently testimonial to support a privilege claim
because the existence and possession of ordinary business records is
a "foregone conclusion." Unlike the circumstances in Fisher, the Government has shown no prior knowledge of either the existence or the
whereabouts of the documents ultimately produced here. In Doe,
the Court found that the act of producing several broad categories of
general business records would involve testimonial self-incrimination.

I
This proceeding arises out of the second prosecution ofrespondent, Webster Hubbell, commenced by the Independent Counsel appointed in August 1994 to investigatepossible violations of federal law relating to the Whitewater
Development Corporation. The first prosecution was termi-nated pursuant to a plea bargain. In December 1994, respondent pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud and taxevasion arising out of his billing practices as a member of
an Arkansas law firm from 1989 to 1992, and was sentencedto 21 months in prison. In the plea agreement, respondent
promised to provide the Independent Counsel with "full,complete, accurate, and truthful information" about matters
relating to the Whitewater investigation.The second prosecution resulted from the Independent
Counsel's attempt to determine whether respondent had vio2 Section 6002 provides: "Whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of
his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in a proceeding before or ancillary to--

a committee or a subcommittee of either House,

"and the person presiding over the proceeding communicates to the witness an order issued under this title, the witness may not refuse to comply
with the order on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination; but
no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a
prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to
comply with the order."

lated that promise. In October 1996, while respondent wasincarcerated, the Independent Counsel served him with a

subpoena duces tecum calling for the production of 11 catego-ries of documents before a grand jury sitting in Little Rock,
Arkansas. See Appendix, infra. On November 19, he ap-peared before the grand jury and invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In response toquestioning by the prosecutor, respondent initially refused
"to state whether there are documents within my possession,custody, or control responsive to the Subpoena." App. 62.
Thereafter, the prosecutor produced an order, which hadpreviously been obtained from the District Court pursuant
to 18 U. S. C. $ 6003(a),3 directing him to respond to the sub-poena and granting him immunity "to the extent allowed by
law." 4 Respondent then produced 13,120 pages of docu-ments and records and responded to a series of questions
that established that those were all of the documents in hiscustody or control that were responsive to the commands in
the subpoena, with the exception of a few documents heclaimed were shielded by the attorney-client and attorney
work-product privileges.The contents of the documents produced by respondent
provided the Independent Counsel with the information thatled to this second prosecution. On April 30, 1998, a grand
jury in the District of Columbia returned a 10-count indict-ment charging respondent with various tax-related crimes
and mail and wire fraud.5 The District Court dismissed the

indictment relying, in part, on the ground that the Independ-ent Counsel's use of the subpoenaed documents violated

the testimonial aspects of respondent's immunized act of pro-ducing those documents.

6 11 F. Supp. 2d 25, 33-37 (DC

1998). Noting that the Independent Counsel had admittedthat he was not investigating tax-related issues when he issued the subpoena, and that he had " `learned about the unre-ported income and other crimes from studying the records'
contents,' " the District Court characterized the subpoena as"the quintessential fishing expedition."

Id., at 37.The Court of Appeals vacated the judgment and remanded

for further proceedings. 167 F. 3d 552 (CADC 1999). Themajority concluded that the District Court had incorrectly
relied on the fact that the Independent Counsel did not haveprior knowledge of the contents of the subpoenaed documents. The question the District Court should have ad-dressed was the extent of the Government's independent
knowledge of the documents' existence and authenticity, andof respondent's possession or control of them. It explained:

"On remand, the district court should hold a hearing inwhich it seeks to establish the extent and detail of the
[G]overnment's knowledge of Hubbell's financial affairs(or of the paperwork documenting it) on the day the subpoena issued. It is only then that the court will be ina position to assess the testimonial value of Hubbell's
response to the subpoena. Should the IndependentCounsel prove capable of demonstrating with reasonable

by respondent would not, in any event, affect the charges against those
other defendants.

6 As an independent basis for dismissal, the District Court also concluded that the Independent Counsel had exceeded his jurisdiction under
the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended by the Independent
Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994, 28 U. S. C. $$ 591-599. That holding
was reversed by the Court of Appeals and is not at issue here.

particularity a prior awareness that the exhaustive litany of documents sought in the subpoena existed and
were in Hubbell's possession, then the wide distance evidently traveled from the subpoena to the substantive
allegations contained in the indictment would be based
upon legitimate intermediate steps. To the extent that
the information conveyed through Hubbell's compelled
act of production provides the necessary linkage, however, the indictment deriving therefrom is tainted."
Id., at 581.

In the opinion of the dissenting judge, the majority failed
to give full effect to the distinction between the contents of
the documents and the limited testimonial significance of the
act of producing them. In his view, as long as the prosecutor could make use of information contained in the documents or derived therefrom without any reference to the fact
that respondent had produced them in response to a subpoena, there would be no improper use of the testimonial
aspect of the immunized act of production. In other words,
the constitutional privilege and the statute conferring use
immunity would only shield the witness from the use of any
information resulting from his subpoena response "beyond
what the prosecutor would receive if the documents appeared in the grand jury room or in his office unsolicited and
unmarked, like manna from heaven." 7 Id., at 602.

On remand, the Independent Counsel acknowledged that
he could not satisfy the "reasonable particularity" standard
prescribed by the Court of Appeals and entered into a conditional plea agreement with respondent. In essence, the
agreement provides for the dismissal of the charges unless
this Court's disposition of the case makes it reasonably likely
that respondent's "act [of] production immunity" would not

The case is not moot, however, because the agreement also
provides for the entry of a guilty plea and a sentence that
will not include incarceration if we should reverse and issue
an opinion that is sufficiently favorable to the Government
to satisfy that condition. Ibid. Despite that agreement, we

of immunity with respect to the production of documents

It is useful to preface our analysis of the constitutional
issue with a restatement of certain propositions that are not
in dispute. The term "privilege against self-incrimination"
is not an entirely accurate description of a person's constitutional protection against being "compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself."

The word "witness" in the constitutional text limits the
relevant category of compelled incriminating communications to those that are "testimonial" in character.8 As Justice Holmes observed, there is a significant difference between the use of compulsion to extort communications from
a defendant and compelling a person to engage in conduct

8 "It is consistent with the history of and the policies underlying the
Self-Incrimination Clause to hold that the privilege may be asserted only
to resist compelled explicit or implicit disclosures of incriminating information. Historically, the privilege was intended to prevent the use of
legal compulsion to extract from the accused a sworn communication of
facts which would incriminate him. Such was the process of the ecclesiastical courts and the Star Chamber--the inquisitorial method of putting the
accused upon his oath and compelling him to answer questions designed to
uncover uncharged offenses, without evidence from another source. See
Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U. S. 463, 470-471 (1976); 8 Wigmore $ 2250;
E. Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today 2-3 (1955)." Doe v. United
States, 487 U. S. 201, 212 (1988).

that may be incriminating.9 Thus, even though the act mayprovide incriminating evidence, a criminal suspect may be

compelled to put on a shirt,10 to provide a blood sample 11 orhandwriting exemplar,

12 or to make a recording of his voice.13

The act of exhibiting such physical characteristics is not thesame as a sworn communication by a witness that relates

either express or implied assertions of fact or belief. Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 594-598 (1990). Similarly,the fact that incriminating evidence may be the byproduct

of obedience to a regulatory requirement, such as filing anincome tax return,

14 maintaining required records,15 or reporting an accident,16 does not clothe such required conductwith the testimonial privilege.

17

More relevant to this case is the settled proposition that aperson may be required to produce specific documents even

though they contain incriminating assertions of fact or beliefbecause the creation of those documents was not "compelled"

9 "A question arose as to whether a blouse belonged to the prisoner. A
witness testified that the prisoner put it on and it fitted him. It is objected that he did this under the same duress that made his statements
inadmissible, and that it should be excluded for the same reasons. But
the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness
against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion
to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material. The objection in principle would forbid
a jury to look at a prisoner and compare his features with a photograph
in proof." Holt v. United States, 218 U. S. 245, 252-253 (1910).

within the meaning of the privilege. Our decision in Fisherv. United States, 425 U. S. 391 (1976), dealt with summonses

issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeking work-ing papers used in the preparation of tax returns. Because
the papers had been voluntarily prepared prior to the issu-ance of the summonses, they could not be "said to contain
compelled testimonial evidence, either of the taxpayers or
of anyone else." Accordingly, the taxpayer could not "avoidcompliance with the subpoena merely by asserting that the

item of evidence which he is required to produce containsincriminating writing, whether his own or that of someone
else." Id., at 409-410; see also United States v. Doe, 465U. S. 605 (1984).

18 It is clear, therefore, that respondent

Hubbell could not avoid compliance with the subpoenaserved on him merely because the demanded documents contained incriminating evidence, whether written by others orvoluntarily prepared by himself.

On the other hand, we have also made it clear that the actof producing documents in response to a subpoena may have
a compelled testimonial aspect. We have held that "the act
of production" itself may implicitly communicate "statementsof fact." By "producing documents in compliance with a

subpoena, the witness would admit that the papers existed,were in his possession or control, and were authentic."

19

18 "Respondent does not contend that he prepared the documents involuntarily or that the subpoena would force him to restate, repeat, or affirm
the truth of their contents. The fact that the records are in respondent's
possession is irrelevant to the determination of whether the creation of
the records was compelled. We therefore hold that the contents of those
records are not privileged." United States v. Doe, 465 U. S., at 611-612
(footnote omitted).

19 "The issue presented in those cases was whether the act of producing

subpoenaed documents, not itself the making of a statement, might nonetheless have some protected testimonial aspects. The Court concluded
that the act of production could constitute protected testimonial communication because it might entail implicit statements of fact: by producing

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, as was true in this case, when the custodian ofdocuments responds to a subpoena, he may be compelled to

take the witness stand and answer questions designed to de-termine whether he has produced everything demanded by
the subpoena.20 The answers to those questions, as well asthe act of production itself, may certainly communicate information about the existence, custody, and authenticity of thedocuments. Whether the constitutional privilege protects
the answers to such questions, or protects the act of produc-tion itself, is a question that is distinct from the question
whether the unprotected contents of the documents them-selves are incriminating.

Finally, the phrase "in any criminal case" in the text ofthe Fifth Amendment might have been read to limit its coverage to compelled testimony that is used against the defend-ant in the trial itself. It has, however, long been settled that
its protection encompasses compelled statements that leadto the discovery of incriminating evidence even though the
statements themselves are not incriminating and are not in-troduced into evidence. Thus, a half century ago we held

documents in compliance with a subpoena, the witness would admit that
the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and were authentic.
United States v. Doe, 465 U. S., at 613, and n. 11; Fisher, 425 U. S., at
409-410; id., at 428, 432 (concurring opinions). See Braswell v. United
States, [487 U. S.,] at 104; [id.,] at 122 (dissenting opinion). Thus, the
Court made clear that the Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination applies to acts that imply assertions of fact.

". . . An examination of the Court's application of these principles in
other cases indicates the Court's recognition that, in order to be testimonial, an accused's communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate
a factual assertion or disclose information. Only then is a person compelled to be a `witness' against himself." Doe v. United States, 487 U. S.,
at 209-210 (footnote omitted).

20 See App. 62-70. Thus, for example, after respondent had been duly

sworn by the grand jury foreman, the prosecutor called his attention to
paragraph A of the Subpoena Rider (reproduced in the Appendix, infra, at
46) and asked whether he had produced "all those documents." App. 65.

38 UNITED STATES v. HUBBELL

Opinion of the Court
that a trial judge had erroneously rejected a defendant'sclaim of privilege on the ground that his answer to the pending question would not itself constitute evidence of thecharged offense. As we explained:

"The privilege afforded not only extends to answers thatwould in themselves support a conviction under a federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those whichwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to
prosecute the claimant for a federal crime." Hoffmanv. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951).

Compelled testimony that communicates information thatmay "lead to incriminating evidence" is privileged even if
the information itself is not inculpatory. Doe v. UnitedStates, 487 U. S. 201, 208, n. 6 (1988). It is the Fifth Amendment's protection against the prosecutor's use of incrimi-nating information derived directly or indirectly from the
compelled testimony of the respondent that is of primaryrelevance in this case.

III
Acting pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 6002, the District Courtentered an order compelling respondent to produce "any and

all documents" described in the grand jury subpoena andgranting him "immunity to the extent allowed by law."
App. 60-61. In Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441(1972), we upheld the constitutionality of $ 6002 because
the scope of the "use and derivative-use" immunity that itprovides is coextensive with the scope of the constitutional
privilege against self-incrimination.The protection against the derivative use of compelled
testimony distinguishes $ 6002 from the 1868 statute that hadbeen held invalid in Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547
(1892), because it merely provided "use" immunity, as well asfrom the more recent federal statutes that broadly provide
"transactional" immunity. In Kastigar the petitioners ar-gued that, under our reasoning in

Counselman, nothing less

39Cite as: 530 U. S. 27 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
than full transactional immunity from prosecution for anyoffense to which compelled testimony relates could suffice

to supplant the privilege. In rejecting that argument, westressed the importance of $ 6002's "explicit proscription" of
the use in any criminal case of " `testimony or other informa-tion compelled under the order (or any information directly
or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information).' " 406 U. S., at 453. We particularly emphasized thecritical importance of protection against a future prosecution

" `based on knowledge and sources of information obtainedfrom the compelled testimony.' "

Id., at 454 (quoting Ullmann v. United States, 350 U. S. 422, 437 (1956)).21We also re jected the petitioners' argument that

derivative-use immunity under $ 6002 would not obviate the
risk that the prosecutor or other law enforcement officials
may use compelled testimony to obtain leads, names of
witnesses, or other information not otherwise available to
support a prosecution. That argument was predicated on
the incorrect assumption that the derivative-use prohibition
would prove impossible to enforce. But given that the statute contains a "comprehensive safeguard" in the form of a
"sweeping proscription of any use, direct or indirect, of the

21 "Our holding is consistent with the conceptual basis of Counselman.
The Counselman statute, as construed by the Court, was plainly deficient
in its failure to prohibit the use against the immunized witness of evidence
derived from his compelled testimony. The Court repeatedly emphasized
this deficiency, noting that the statute:

" `could not, and would not, prevent the use of his testimony to search out
other testimony to be used in evidence against him or his property, in a
criminal proceeding . . .' 142 U. S., at 564;. . . . .

"and that it:
" `affords no protection against that use of compelled testimony which consists in gaining therefrom a knowledge of the details of a crime, and of
sources of information which may supply other means of convicting the
witness or party.' 142 U. S., at 586." Kastigar v. United States, 406
U. S., at 453-454.

Opinion of the Court
compelled testimony and any information derived there-from," we concluded that a person who is prosecuted for

matters related to testimony he gave under a grant of immu-nity does not have the burden of proving that his testimony
was improperly used. Instead, we held that the statute im-poses an affirmative duty on the prosecution, not merely to
show that its evidence is not tainted by the prior testimony,but "to prove that the evidence it proposes to use is derived
from a legitimate source wholly independent of the com-pelled testimony."

Id., at 460.22 Requiring the prosecutionto shoulder this burden ensures that the grant of immunity

has "le[ft] the witness and the Federal Government in sub-stantially the same position as if the witness had claimed
his privilege in the absence of a grant of immunity." Id., at458-459 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).

The "compelled testimony" that is relevant in this case isnot to be found in the contents of the documents produced
in response to the subpoena. It is, rather, the testimonyinherent in the act of producing those documents. The disagreement between the parties focuses entirely on the sig-nificance of that testimonial aspect.

IV
The Government correctly emphasizes that the testimonialaspect of a response to a subpoena

duces tecum does nothing

22 "A person accorded this immunity under 18 U. S. C. $ 6002, and subsequently prosecuted, is not dependent for the preservation of his rights
upon the integrity and good faith of the prosecuting authorities. As
stated in Murphy [v. Waterfront Comm'n of N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S. 52
(1964)]:

" `Once a defendant demonstrates that he has testified, under a state grant
of immunity, to matters related to the federal prosecution, the federal
authorities have the burden of showing that their evidence is not tainted
by establishing that they had an independent, legitimate source for the
disputed evidence.' [Id.,] at 79 n. 18.

"This burden of proof, which we reaffirm as appropriate, is not limited
to a negation of taint; rather, it imposes on the prosecution the affirmative
duty to prove that the evidence it proposes to use is derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled testimony." Id., at 460.

Opinion of the Court
more than establish the existence, authenticity, and custodyof items that are produced. We assume that the Government is also entirely correct in its submission that it wouldnot have to advert to respondent's act of production in order
to prove the existence, authenticity, or custody of any docu-ments that it might offer in evidence at a criminal trial; indeed, the Government disclaims any need to introduce any
of the documents produced by respondent into evidence inorder to prove the charges against him. It follows, according to the Government, that it has no intention of makingimproper "use" of respondent's compelled testimony.

The question, however, is not whether the response to thesubpoena may be introduced into evidence at his criminal
trial. That would surely be a prohibited "use" of the immu-nized act of production. See

In re Sealed Case, 791 F. 2d
179, 182 (CADC 1986) (Scalia, J.). But the fact that the Gov-ernment intends no such use of the act of production leaves

open the separate question whether it has already made "de-rivative use" of the testimonial aspect of that act in obtaining
the indictment against respondent and in preparing its case
for trial. It clearly has.It is apparent from the text of the subpoena itself that

the prosecutor needed respondent's assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce those
sources. See Appendix, infra. Given the breadth of the
description of the 11 categories of documents called for by
the subpoena, the collection and production of the materials
demanded was tantamount to answering a series of interrogatories asking a witness to disclose the existence and location
of particular documents fitting certain broad descriptions.
The assembly of literally hundreds of pages of material in
response to a request for "any and all documents reflecting,
referring, or relating to any direct or indirect sources of
money or other things of value received by or provided to"
an individual or members of his family during a 3-year period, Appendix, infra, at 46-49, is the functional equivalent
of the preparation of an answer to either a detailed written

42 UNITED STATES v. HUBBELL

Opinion of the Court
interrogatory or a series of oral questions at a discoverydeposition. Entirely apart from the contents of the 13,120

pages of materials that respondent produced in this case, itis undeniable that providing a catalog of existing documents
fitting within any of the 11 broadly worded subpoena cate-gories could provide a prosecutor with a "lead to incriminating evidence," or "a link in the chain of evidence neededto prosecute."

Indeed, the record makes it clear that that is what hap-pened in this case. The documents were produced before a
grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Arkansas in aidof the Independent Counsel's attempt to determine whether
respondent had violated a commitment in his first plea agree-ment. The use of those sources of information eventually
led to the return of an indictment by a grand jury sittingin the District of Columbia for offenses that apparently are
unrelated to that plea agreement. What the District Courtcharacterized as a "fishing expedition" did produce a fish, but
not the one that the Independent Counsel expected to hook.It is abundantly clear that the testimonial aspect of respondent's act of producing subpoenaed documents was the firststep in a chain of evidence that led to this prosecution. The
documents did not magically appear in the prosecutor's officelike "manna from heaven." They arrived there only after
respondent asserted his constitutional privilege, received agrant of immunity, and--under the compulsion of the District Court's order--took the mental and physical steps nec-essary to provide the prosecutor with an accurate inventory
of the many sources of potentially incriminating evidencesought by the subpoena. It was only through respondent's
truthful reply to the subpoena 23 that the Government re23 See Stuntz, Self-incrimination and Excuse, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1227,

Opinion of the Court
ceived the incriminating documents of which it made "sub-stantial use . . . in the investigation that led to the indictment." Brief for United States 3.For these reasons, we cannot accept the Government's
submission that respondent's immunity did not preclude itsderivative use of the produced documents because its "possession of the documents [was] the fruit only of a simplephysical act--the act of producing the documents."

Id., at29. It was unquestionably necessary for respondent to

make extensive use of "the contents of his own mind" inidentifying the hundreds of documents responsive to the
requests in the subpoena. See Curcio v. United States, 354U. S. 118, 128 (1957); Doe v. United States, 487 U. S., at 210.
The assembly of those documents was like telling an in-quisitor the combination to a wall safe, not like being forced
to surrender the key to a strongbox. Id., at 210, n. 9. TheGovernment's anemic view of respondent's act of production
as a mere physical act that is principally nontestimonial incharacter and can be entirely divorced from its "implicit" testimonial aspect so as to constitute a "legitimate, wholly inde-pendent source" (as required by

Kastigar) for the documentsproduced simply fails to account for these realities.

In sum, we have no doubt that the constitutional privi-lege against self-incrimination protects the target of a grand
jury investigation from being compelled to answer ques-tions designed to elicit information about the existence of
sources of potentially incriminating evidence. That consti-tutional privilege has the same application to the testimonial aspect of a response to a subpoena seeking discovery ofthose sources. Before the District Court, the Government
arguably conceded that respondent's act of production inthis case had a testimonial aspect that entitled him to respond to the subpoena by asserting his privilege againstself-incrimination. See 167 F. 3d, at 580 (noting District

ton rev. 1961) (describing a subpoena duces tecum as "process relying on
[the witness'] moral responsibility for truthtelling").

Opinion of the Court
Court's finding that "Hubbell's compelled act of productionrequired him to make communications as to the existence,

possession, and authenticity of the subpoenaed documents").On appeal and again before this Court, however, the Government has argued that the communicative aspect of respond-ent's act of producing ordinary business records is insufficiently "testimonial" to support a claim of privilege because
the existence and possession of such records by any business-man is a "foregone conclusion" under our decision in

Fisher
v. United States, 425 U. S., at 411. This argument both mis-reads

Fisher and ignores our subsequent decision in United
States v. Doe, 465 U. S. 605 (1984).As noted in Part II,

supra, Fisher involved summonses
seeking production of working papers prepared by the tax-payers' accountants that the IRS knew were in the possession of the taxpayers' attorneys. 425 U. S., at 394. Inrejecting the taxpayers' claim that these documents were
protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege, we stated:

"It is doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence
and possession of the papers rises to the level of testi-mony within the protection of the Fifth Amendment.

The papers belong to the accountant, were prepared byhim, and are the kind usually prepared by an accountant
working on the tax returns of his client. Surely the
Government is in no way relying on the `truthtelling'of the

taxpayer to prove the existence of or his access
to the documents. . . . The existence and location of thepapers are a foregone conclusion and the taxpayer adds

little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's
information by conceding that he in fact has the papers."
Id., at 411 (emphases added).

Whatever the scope of this "foregone conclusion" rationale,
the facts of this case plainly fall outside of it. While in
Fisher the Government already knew that the documents
were in the attorneys' possession and could independently

Opinion of the Court
confirm their existence and authenticity through the account-ants who created them, here the Government has not shown

that it had any prior knowledge of either the existence orthe whereabouts of the 13,120 pages of documents ultimately
produced by respondent. The Government cannot cure thisdeficiency through the overbroad argument that a businessman such as respondent will always possess general business
and tax records that fall within the broad categories de-scribed in this subpoena. The

Doe subpoenas also sought
several broad categories of general business records, yet weupheld the District Court's finding that the act of producing

those records would involve testimonial self-incrimination.
465 U. S., at 612-614, and n. 13.

Given our conclusion that respondent's act of production
had a testimonial aspect, at least with respect to the existence and location of the documents sought by the Government's subpoena, respondent could not be compelled to
produce those documents without first receiving a grant of
immunity under $ 6003. As we construed $ 6002 in Kastigar,
such immunity is coextensive with the constitutional privilege. Kastigar requires that respondent's motion to dismiss
the indictment on immunity grounds be granted unless the
Government proves that the evidence it used in obtaining
the indictment and proposed to use at trial was derived from
legitimate sources "wholly independent" of the testimonial
aspect of respondent's immunized conduct in assembling and
producing the documents described in the subpoena. The
Government, however, does not claim that it could make
such a showing. Rather, it contends that its prosecution of
respondent must be considered proper unless someone--presumably respondent--shows that "there is some substantial
relation between the compelled testimonial communications
implicit in the act of production (as opposed to the act of
production standing alone) and some aspect of the information used in the investigation or the evidence presented
at trial." Brief for United States 9. We could not accept

this submission without repudiating the basis for our con-clusion in Kastigar that the statutory guarantee of use and

derivative-use immunity is as broad as the constitutionalprivilege itself. This we are not prepared to do.

Accordingly, the indictment against respondent must be dis-missed. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist dissents and would reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part, for the reasonsgiven by Judge Williams in his dissenting opinion in that

court, 167 F. 3d 552, 597 (CADC 1999).

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring.

Our decision today involves the application of the act-of-production doctrine, which provides that persons compelled to turn over incriminating papers or other physicalevidence pursuant to a subpoena

duces tecum or a summons may invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination as a bar to production only where theact of producing the evidence would contain "testimonial"

features. See ante, at 34-38. I join the opinion of theCourt because it properly applies this doctrine, but I write
separately to note that this doctrine may be inconsistentwith the original meaning of the Fifth Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause. A substantial body of evidence sug-gests that the Fifth Amendment privilege protects against
the compelled production not just of incriminating testimony,
but of any incriminating evidence. In a future case, I would
be willing to reconsider the scope and meaning of the SelfIncrimination Clause.

I

The Fifth Amendment provides that "[n]o person . . . shall
be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself." The key word at issue in this case is "witness."
The Court's opinion, relying on prior cases, essentially defines "witness" as a person who provides testimony, and
thus restricts the Fifth Amendment's ban to only those com530US1 Unit: $U65 [10-22-01 17:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., concurring
munications "that are `testimonial' in character." Ante, at34. None of this Court's cases, however, has undertaken an

analysis of the meaning of the term at the time of the found-ing. A review of that period reveals substantial support for
the view that the term "witness" meant a person who givesor furnishes evidence, a broader meaning than that which
our case law currently ascribes to the term. If this is so, a
person who responds to a subpoena duces tecum would bejust as much a "witness" as a person who responds to a subpoena ad testificandum.1Dictionaries published around the time of the founding
included definitions of the term "witness" as a person whogives or furnishes evidence. Legal dictionaries of that period defined "witness" as someone who "gives evidence in acause." 2 G. Jacob, A New Law-Dictionary (8th ed. 1762);
2 T. Cunningham, New and Complete Law-Dictionary (2d ed.1771); T. Potts, A Compendious Law Dictionary 612 (1803);
6 G. Jacob, The Law-Dictionary 450 (T. Tomlins 1st American ed. 1811). And a general dictionary published earlier
in the century similarly defined "witness" as "a giver of evidence." J. Kersey, A New English Dictionary (1702). The
term "witness" apparently continued to have this meaning
at least until the first edition of Noah Webster's dictionary,
which defined it as "[t]hat which furnishes evidence or
proof." An American Dictionary of the English Language
(1828). See also J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution
of the United States $ 931 (1833) (using phrases "to give evidence" and "to furnish evidence" in explanation of the SelfIncrimination Clause). See generally Nagareda, Compul1 Even if the term "witness" in the Fifth Amendment referred to someone who provides testimony, as this Court's recent cases suggest without historical analysis, it may well be that at the time of the founding

Such a meaning of "witness" is consistent with, and mayhelp explain, the history and framing of the Fifth Amendment. The 18th-century common-law privilege againstself-incrimination protected against the compelled production of incriminating physical evidence such as papers
and documents. See Morgan, The Privilege against Self-Incrimination, 34 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 34 (1949); Nagareda,

supra, at 1618-1623. Several 18th-century cases explicitlyrecognized such a self-incrimination privilege. See

Against this common-law backdrop, the privilege againstself-incrimination was enshrined in the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776. See Moglen, The Privilege in Brit-ish North America: The Colonial Period to the Fifth
Amendment, in The Privilege against Self-Incrimination:
Its Origins and Development 133-134 (R. Helmholz et al.eds. 1997). That document provided that no one may "be

compelled to give evidence against himself." Virginia Dec-laration of Rights $ 8 (1776), in 1 The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History 235 (B. Schwartz ed. 1971). Following
Virginia's lead, seven of the other original States included
specific provisions in their Constitutions granting a right
against compulsion "to give evidence" or "to furnish evidence." See Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights, Art. IX
(1776) ("give"), id., at 265; Delaware Declaration of Rights

$ 15 (1776) ("give"), id., at 278; Maryland Declaration of

XII (1780) ("furnish"), id., at 342; New Hampshire Bill of
Rights, Art. XV (1783) ("furnish"), id., at 377. And during
ratification of the Federal Constitution, the four States that
proposed bills of rights put forward draft proposals employing similar wording for a federal constitutional provision
guaranteeing the right against compelled self-incrimination.
Each of the proposals broadly sought to protect a citizen
from "be[ing] compelled to give evidence against himself."

(J. Elliot 2d ed. 1854) (Mr. Holmes, Mass., Jan. 30, 1788)(objecting that nothing prohibits compelling a person "to
furnish evidence against himself "). Similarly worded pro-posals to protect against compelling a person "to furnish
evidence" against himself came from prominent voices out-side the conventions. See The Federal Farmer No. 6 (1787),
in Cogan, supra, at 333; Letter of Brutus, No. 2 (1788), in 1Schwartz,

supra, at 508.In response to such calls, James Madison penned the Fifth

Amendment. In so doing, Madison substituted the phrase"to be a witness" for the proposed language "to give evidence" and "to furnish evidence." But it seems likely thatMadison's phrasing was synonymous with that of the proposals. The definitions of the word "witness" and the back-ground history of the privilege against self-incrimination,
both discussed above, support this view. And this mayexplain why Madison's unique phrasing--phrasing that none
of the proposals had suggested--apparently attracted noattention, much less opposition, in Congress, the state legislatures that ratified the Bill of Rights, or anywhere else.See 3 W. LaFave, J. Israel, & N. King, Criminal Procedure
290-291 (2d ed. 1999). In fact, the only Member of the FirstCongress to address self-incrimination during the debates
on the Bill of Rights treated the phrases as synonymous,restating Madison's formulation as a ban on forcing one "to
give evidence against himself." 1 Annals of Cong. 753-754(J. Gales ed. 1834) (statement of Rep. Laurance).

3 Representative Laurance was no stranger to the Self-Incrimination
Clause; he was responsible for the limiting phrase "in any criminal case,"
which was added to the Clause without any recorded opposition. See

In addition, a broad definition of the term "witness"--one who gives evidence--is consistent with the same term

(albeit in plural form) in the Sixth Amendment's Compul-sory Process Clause.

4 That Clause provides that "[i]n all

criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . .to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his

favor." Soon after the adoption of the Bill of Rights, ChiefJustice Marshall had occasion to interpret the Compulsory
Process Clause while presiding over the treason trial ofAaron Burr.

United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30 (No.14,692d) (CC Va. 1807). Burr moved for the issuance of

a subpoena duces tecum to obtain from President Jeffer-son a letter that was said to incriminate Burr. The Government objected, arguing that compulsory process under theSixth Amendment permits a defendant to secure a subnoted that, absent such a restriction, the Fifth Amendment was "a general
declaration, in some degree contrary to laws passed." 1 Annals of Cong.
753 (J. Gales ed. 1834). Two prominent commentators have suggested
that "laws passed" likely refers to $ 15 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (then
in the process of passage). See Levy, supra, at 425-426; Moglen, The
Privilege in British North America: The Colonial Period to the Fifth
Amendment, in The Privilege against Self-Incrimination: Its Origins and
Development 258, n. 109 (R. Helmholz et al. eds. 1997). Section 15 provided that federal courts "shall have power in the trial of actions at law . . .
to require the parties to produce books or writings in their possession or
power, which contain evidence pertinent to the issue, in cases and under
circumstances where they might be compelled to produce the same by the
ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery." Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat.
82. Section 15's grant of power to compel discovery in civil cases would
have been inconsistent with an unrestricted Self-Incrimination Clause, but
only if the term "witness" in that Clause included persons who provide
such physical evidence as "books" and "writings." Laurance's assertion
thus suggests that the Framers believed the Self-Incrimination Clause
offered protection against such compelled production.

4 A broad view of the term "witness" in the compulsory process context dates back at least to the beginning of the 18th century. See Act of
May 31, 1718, ch. 236, $ 4, 1 Laws of Pennsylvania 112 (J. Bioren ed. 1810)
(speaking of witnesses "be[ing] admitted to [be] depose[d], or give any
manner of evidence" (emphasis added)).

poena ad testificandum, but not a subpoena duces tecum.
Id., at 34. The Chief Justice dismissed the argument, holding that the right to compulsory process includes the right
to secure papers--in addition to testimony--material to the
defense. Id., at 34-35. This Court has subsequently expressed agreement with this view of the Sixth Amendment.
See United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 711 (1974). Although none of our opinions has focused upon the precise
language or history of the Compulsory Process Clause, a
narrow definition of the term "witness" as a person who
testifies seems incompatible with Burr's holding. And if
the term "witnesses" in the Compulsory Process Clause has
an encompassing meaning, this provides reason to believe
that the term "witness" in the Self-Incrimination Clause
has the same broad meaning. Yet this Court's recent Fifth
Amendment act-of-production cases implicitly rest upon an
assumption that this term has different meanings in adjoining provisions of the Bill of Rights.5

II
This Court has not always taken the approach to the Fifth
Amendment that we follow today. The first case interpreting the Self-Incrimination Clause--Boyd v. United States--
was decided, though not explicitly, in accordance with the
understanding that "witness" means one who gives evidence.
In Boyd, this Court unanimously held that the Fifth Amendment protects a defendant against compelled production
of books and papers. 116 U. S., at 634-635; id., at 638-639
(Miller, J., concurring in judgment). And the Court linked
its interpretation of the Fifth Amendment to the common5 Accepting the definition of "witness" as one who gives or furnishes
evidence would also be compatible with my previous call for a reconsideration of the phrase "witnesses against him" in the Confrontation Clause
of the Sixth Amendment. See White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 365 (1992)
(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

law understanding of the self-incrimination privilege. Id.,at 631-632.

But this Court's decision in Fisher v. United States, 425U. S. 391 (1976), rejected this understanding, permitting the
Government to force a person to furnish incriminatingphysical evidence and protecting only the "testimonial" aspects of that transfer. Id., at 408. In so doing, Fisher notonly failed to examine the historical backdrop to the Fifth
Amendment, it also required--as illustrated by extended dis-cussion in the opinions below in this case--a difficult parsing
of the act of responding to a subpoena duces tecum.None of the parties in this case has asked us to depart
from Fisher, but in light of the historical evidence that theSelf-Incrimination Clause may have a broader reach than
Fisher holds, I remain open to a reconsideration of that de-cision and its progeny in a proper case.

6 To hold that the Government may not compel a person to produce incriminating evidence (absent an appropriate grant of immunity) does not
necessarily answer the question whether (and, if so, when) the Government may secure that same evidence through a search or seizure. The
lawfulness of such actions, however, would be measured by the Fourth
Amendment rather than the Fifth.

TROXEL et vir v. GRANVILLE
certiorari to the supreme court of washington

No. 99-138. Argued January 12, 2000--Decided June 5, 2000
Washington Rev. Code $ 26.10.160(3) permits "[a]ny person" to petition for

visitation rights "at any time" and authorizes state superior courts to
grant such rights whenever visitation may serve a child's best interest.
Petitioners Troxel petitioned for the right to visit their deceased son's
daughters. Respondent Granville, the girls' mother, did not oppose all
visitation, but objected to the amount sought by the Troxels. The Superior Court ordered more visitation than Granville desired, and she
appealed. The State Court of Appeals reversed and dismissed the
Troxels' petition. In affirming, the State Supreme Court held, inter
alia, that $ 26.10.160(3) unconstitutionally infringes on parents' fundamental right to rear their children. Reasoning that the Federal Constitution permits a State to interfere with this right only to prevent harm
or potential harm to the child, it found that $ 26.10.160(3) does not require a threshold showing of harm and sweeps too broadly by permitting
any person to petition at any time with the only requirement being that
the visitation serve the best interest of the child.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
137 Wash. 2d 1, 969 P. 2d 21, affirmed.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Gins-
burg, and Justice Breyer, concluded that $ 26.10.160(3), as applied
to Granville and her family, violates her due process right to make
decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her daughters.
Pp. 63-75.

(a) The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause has a substantive component that "provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests," Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720, including parents'
fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and
control of their children, see, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645,
651. Pp. 63-66.

(b) Washington's breathtakingly broad statute effectively permits a
court to disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent
concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision
files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge's determination of
the child's best interest. A parent's estimation of the child's best interest is accorded no deference. The State Supreme Court had the oppor530US1 Unit: $U66 [10-22-01 17:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tunity, but declined, to give $ 26.10.160(3) a narrower reading. A combination of several factors compels the conclusion that $ 26.10.160(3), as
applied here, exceeded the bounds of the Due Process Clause. First,
the Troxels did not allege, and no court has found, that Granville was
an unfit parent. There is a presumption that fit parents act in their
children's best interests, Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602; there is
normally no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm
of the family to further question fit parents' ability to make the best
decisions regarding their children, see, e. g., Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S.
292, 304. The problem here is not that the Superior Court intervened,
but that when it did so, it gave no special weight to Granville's determination of her daughters' best interests. More importantly, that court
appears to have applied the opposite presumption, favoring grandparent
visitation. In effect, it placed on Granville the burden of disproving
that visitation would be in her daughters' best interest and thus failed
to provide any protection for her fundamental right. The court also
gave no weight to Granville's having assented to visitation even before
the filing of the petition or subsequent court intervention. These factors, when considered with the Superior Court's slender findings, show
that this case involves nothing more than a simple disagreement between the court and Granville concerning her children's best interests,
and that the visitation order was an unconstitutional infringement on
Granville's right to make decisions regarding the rearing of her children. Pp. 67-73.

(c) Because the instant decision rests on $ 26.10.160(3)'s sweeping
breadth and its application here, there is no need to consider the question whether the Due Process Clause requires all nonparental visitation
statutes to include a showing of harm or potential harm to the child as
a condition precedent to granting visitation or to decide the precise
scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context. There
is also no reason to remand this case for further proceedings. The visitation order clearly violated the Constitution, and the parties should not
be forced into additional litigation that would further burden Granville's
parental right. Pp. 73-75.

Justice Souter concluded that the Washington Supreme Court's
second reason for invalidating its own state statute--that it sweeps too
broadly in authorizing any person at any time to request (and a judge
to award) visitation rights, subject only to the State's particular bestinterests standard--is consistent with this Court's prior cases. This
ends the case, and there is no need to decide whether harm is required
or to consider the precise scope of a parent's right or its necessary protections. Pp. 75-79.

Justice Thomas agreed that this Court's recognition of a fundamental right of parents to direct their children's upbringing resolves this
case, but concluded that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of
review to apply to infringements of fundamental rights. Here, the
State lacks a compelling interest in second-guessing a fit parent's decision regarding visitation with third parties. P. 80.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Justice O'Connor announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

The Chief Justice, Jus-
tice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join.

Section 26.10.160(3) of the Revised Code of Washingtonpermits "[a]ny person" to petition a superior court for visitation rights "at any time," and authorizes that court togrant such visitation rights whenever "visitation may serve
the best interest of the child." Petitioners Jenifer andGary Troxel petitioned a Washington Superior Court for

the right to visit their grandchildren, Isabelle and NatalieTroxel. Respondent Tommie Granville, the mother of Isabelle and Natalie, opposed the petition. The case ultimatelyreached the Washington Supreme Court, which held that

$ 26.10.160(3) unconstitutionally interferes with the funda-mental right of parents to rear their children.

I
Tommie Granville and Brad Troxel shared a relationshipthat ended in June 1991. The two never married, but they

had two daughters, Isabelle and Natalie. Jenifer and GaryTroxel are Brad's parents, and thus the paternal grandparents of Isabelle and Natalie. After Tommie and Brad sepa-rated in 1991, Brad lived with his parents and regularly
brought his daughters to his parents' home for weekend visi-tation. Brad committed suicide in May 1993. Although the

formed the Troxels in October 1993 that she wished to limittheir visitation with her daughters to one short visit per

month. In re Smith, 137 Wash. 2d 1, 6, 969 P. 2d 21, 23-24(1998); In re Troxel, 87 Wash. App. 131, 133, 940 P. 2d 698,
698-699 (1997).In December 1993, the Troxels commenced the present action by filing, in the Washington Superior Court for SkagitCounty, a petition to obtain visitation rights with Isabelle
and Natalie. The Troxels filed their petition under twoWashington statutes, Wash. Rev. Code $$ 26.09.240 and
26.10.160(3) (1994). Only the latter statute is at issue in thiscase. Section 26.10.160(3) provides: "Any person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time including, butnot limited to, custody proceedings. The court may order
visitation rights for any person when visitation may servethe best interest of the child whether or not there has been
any change of circumstances." At trial, the Troxels re-quested two weekends of overnight visitation per month and
two weeks of visitation each summer. Granville did not op-pose visitation altogether, but instead asked the court to
order one day of visitation per month with no overnight stay.87 Wash. App., at 133-134, 940 P. 2d, at 699. In 1995, the
Superior Court issued an oral ruling and entered a visitationdecree ordering visitation one weekend per month, one week
during the summer, and four hours on both of the petitioninggrandparents' birthdays. 137 Wash. 2d, at 6, 969 P. 2d, at

Superior Court for entry of written findings of fact and con-clusions of law. 137 Wash. 2d, at 6, 969 P. 2d, at 23. On
remand, the Superior Court found that visitation was inIsabelle's and Natalie's best interests:

tioners can provide opportunities for the children in the
areas of cousins and music.

". . . The court took into consideration all factors regarding the best interest of the children and considered all
the testimony before it. The children would be benefitted from spending quality time with the Petitioners,
provided that that time is balanced with time with the
childrens' [sic] nuclear family. The court finds that the
childrens' [sic] best interests are served by spending
time with their mother and stepfather's other six children." App. 70a.

Approximately nine months after the Superior Court entered its order on remand, Granville's husband formally
adopted Isabelle and Natalie. Id., at 60a-67a.

The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the lower
court's visitation order and dismissed the Troxels' petition
for visitation, holding that nonparents lack standing to seek
visitation under $ 26.10.160(3) unless a custody action is
pending. In the Court of Appeals' view, that limitation on
nonparental visitation actions was "consistent with the constitutional restrictions on state interference with parents'
fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children." 87 Wash. App., at 135, 940 P. 2d,
at 700 (internal quotation marks omitted). Having resolved
the case on the statutory ground, however, the Court of Appeals did not expressly pass on Granville's constitutional
challenge to the visitation statute. Id., at 138, 940 P. 2d,
at 701.

The Washington Supreme Court granted the Troxels' petition for review and, after consolidating their case with two
other visitation cases, affirmed. The court disagreed with
the Court of Appeals' decision on the statutory issue and
found that the plain language of $ 26.10.160(3) gave the Troxels standing to seek visitation, irrespective of whether a
custody action was pending. 137 Wash. 2d, at 12, 969 P.

2d, at 26-27. The Washington Supreme Court neverthelessagreed with the Court of Appeals' ultimate conclusion that

the Troxels could not obtain visitation of Isabelle and Nata-lie pursuant to $ 26.10.160(3). The court rested its decision
on the Federal Constitution, holding that $ 26.10.160(3) un-constitutionally infringes on the fundamental right of parents to rear their children. In the court's view, there wereat least two problems with the nonparental visitation statute. First, according to the Washington Supreme Court, theConstitution permits a State to interfere with the right of
parents to rear their children only to prevent harm or poten-tial harm to a child. Section 26.10.160(3) fails that standard
because it requires no threshold showing of harm. Id., at15-20, 969 P. 2d, at 28-30. Second, by allowing " `any person' to petition for forced visitation of a child at `any time'with the only requirement being that the visitation serve the
best interest of the child," the Washington visitation statutesweeps too broadly.

Id., at 20, 969 P. 2d, at 30. "It is notwithin the province of the state to make significant decisions

concerning the custody of children merely because it couldmake a `better' decision."

Ibid., 969 P. 2d, at 31. TheWashington Supreme Court held that "[p]arents have a right

to limit visitation of their children with third persons," andthat between parents and judges, "the parents should be the
ones to choose whether to expose their children to certainpeople or ideas." Id., at 21, 969 P. 2d, at 31. Four justices
dissented from the Washington Supreme Court's holding onthe constitutionality of the statute. Id., at 23-43, 969 P. 2d,

The demographic changes of the past century make it dif-ficult to speak of an average American family. The composition of families varies greatly from household to household.While many children may have two married parents and

grandparents who visit regularly, many other children areraised in single-parent households. In 1996, children living

with only one parent accounted for 28 percent of all childrenunder age 18 in the United States. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Current Population Reports, 1997Population Profile of the United States 27 (1998). Understandably, in these single-parent households, persons outside
the nuclear family are called upon with increasing frequencyto assist in the everyday tasks of child rearing. In many

cases, grandparents play an important role. For example,in 1998, approximately 4 million children--or 5.6 percent of
all children under age 18--lived in the household of their
grandparents. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census,
Current Population Reports, Marital Status and Living Arrangements: March 1998 (Update), p. i (1998).

The nationwide enactment of nonparental visitation statutes is assuredly due, in some part, to the States' recognition
of these changing realities of the American family. Because
grandparents and other relatives undertake duties of a parental nature in many households, States have sought to ensure the welfare of the children therein by protecting the
relationships those children form with such third parties.
The States' nonparental visitation statutes are further supported by a recognition, which varies from State to State,
that children should have the opportunity to benefit from
relationships with statutorily specified persons--for example, their grandparents. The extension of statutory rights
in this area to persons other than a child's parents, however,
comes with an obvious cost. For example, the State's recognition of an independent third-party interest in a child can
place a substantial burden on the traditional parent-child relationship. Contrary to Justice Stevens' accusation, our
description of state nonparental visitation statutes in these
terms, of course, is not meant to suggest that "children are
so much chattel." Post, at 89 (dissenting opinion). Rather,
our terminology is intended to highlight the fact that these

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
statutes can present questions of constitutional import. Inthis case, we are presented with just such a question. Specifically, we are asked to decide whether $ 26.10.160(3), asapplied to Tommie Granville and her family, violates the Federal Constitution.The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall
"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law." We have long recognized that the Amend-ment's Due Process Clause, like its Fifth Amendment counterpart, "guarantees more than fair process." Washingtonv.

Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 719 (1997). The Clause also includes a substantive component that "provides heightened
protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests." Id., at 720; see also
Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301-302 (1993).

The liberty interest at issue in this case--the interest of
parents in the care, custody, and control of their children--
is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests
recognized by this Court. More than 75 years ago, in Meyer
v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399, 401 (1923), we held that the
"liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause includes the
right of parents to "establish a home and bring up children"
and "to control the education of their own." Two years
later, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534-535
(1925), we again held that the "liberty of parents and guardians" includes the right "to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control." We explained in
Pierce that "[t]he child is not the mere creature of the State;
those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right,
coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him
for additional obligations." Id., at 535. We returned to the
subject in Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158 (1944), and
again confirmed that there is a constitutional dimension to
the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. "It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary

function and freedom include preparation for obligations the
state can neither supply nor hinder." Id., at 166.

In subsequent cases also, we have recognized the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the
care, custody, and control of their children. See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651 (1972) ("It is plain that the
interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and
management of his or her children `come[s] to this Court with
a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements' " (citation omitted)); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205,
232 (1972) ("The history and culture of Western civilization
reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture
and upbringing of their children. This primary role of the
parents in the upbringing of their children is now established
beyond debate as an enduring American tradition"); Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 255 (1978) ("We have recognized on numerous occasions that the relationship between
parent and child is constitutionally protected"); Parham v.
J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979) ("Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family
as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.
Our cases have consistently followed that course"); Santosky
v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 753 (1982) (discussing "[t]he fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child"); Glucksberg, supra, at
720 ("In a long line of cases, we have held that, in addition
to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the
`liberty' specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the righ[t] . . . to direct the education and upbringing
of one's children" (citing Meyer and Pierce)). In light of this
extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the
fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning
the care, custody, and control of their children.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Section 26.10.160(3), as applied to Granville and her family
in this case, unconstitutionally infringes on that fundamental parental right. The Washington nonparental visitation
statute is breathtakingly broad. According to the statute's
text, "[a]ny person may petition the court for visitation
rights at any time," and the court may grant such visitation
rights whenever "visitation may serve the best interest of
the child." $ 26.10.160(3) (emphases added). That language
effectively permits any third party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the
parent's children to state-court review. Once the visitation
petition has been filed in court and the matter is placed before a judge, a parent's decision that visitation would not be
in the child's best interest is accorded no deference. Section
26.10.160(3) contains no requirement that a court accord the
parent's decision any presumption of validity or any weight
whatsoever. Instead, the Washington statute places the
best-interest determination solely in the hands of the judge.
Should the judge disagree with the parent's estimation of the
child's best interests, the judge's view necessarily prevails.
Thus, in practical effect, in the State of Washington a court
can disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial
parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected
by the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the
judge's determination of the child's best interests. The
Washington Supreme Court had the opportunity to give

$ 26.10.160(3) a narrower reading, but it declined to do so.
See, e. g., 137 Wash. 2d, at 5, 969 P. 2d, at 23 ("[The statute]
allow[s] any person, at any time, to petition for visitation
without regard to relationship to the child, without regard
to changed circumstances, and without regard to harm"); id.,
at 20, 969 P. 2d, at 30 ("[The statute] allow[s] `any person' to
petition for forced visitation of a child at `any time' with the
only requirement being that the visitation serve the best interest of the child").

68 TROXEL v. GRANVILLE

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Turning to the facts of this case, the record reveals that
the Superior Court's order was based on precisely the type
of mere disagreement we have just described and nothing
more. The Superior Court's order was not founded on any
special factors that might justify the State's interference
with Granville's fundamental right to make decisions concerning the rearing of her two daughters. To be sure, this
case involves a visitation petition filed by grandparents soon
after the death of their son--the father of Isabelle and Natalie--but the combination of several factors here compels our
conclusion that $ 26.10.160(3), as applied, exceeded the
bounds of the Due Process Clause.

First, the Troxels did not allege, and no court has found,
that Granville was an unfit parent. That aspect of the case
is important, for there is a presumption that fit parents act
in the best interests of their children. As this Court explained in Parham:

"[O]ur constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is the mere creature of the State and,
on the contrary, asserted that parents generally have
the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and
prepare [their children] for additional obligations. . . .
The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption
that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making
life's difficult decisions. More important, historically it
has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children." 442
U. S., at 602 (alteration in original) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted).

Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for his or
her children (i. e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for
the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family
to further question the ability of that parent to make the

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent's chil-dren. See,

e. g., Flores, 507 U. S., at 304.
The problem here is not that the Washington SuperiorCourt intervened, but that when it did so, it gave no special

weight at all to Granville's determination of her daughters'best interests. More importantly, it appears that the Superior Court applied exactly the opposite presumption. In
reciting its oral ruling after the conclusion of closingarguments, the Superior Court judge explained:

"The burden is to show that it is in the best interest of
the children to have some visitation and some qualitytime with their grandparents. I think in most situations a commonsensical approach [is that] it is normally
in the best interest of the children to spend quality timewith the grandparent, unless the grandparent,

[sic]
there are some issues or problems involved wherein thegrandparents, their lifestyles are going to impact adversely upon the children. That certainly isn't thecase here from what I can tell." Verbatim Report of
Proceedings in In re Troxel, No. 93-3-00650-7 (Wash.Super. Ct., Dec. 14, 19, 1994), p. 213 (hereinafter Verbatim Report).
The judge's comments suggest that he presumed the grandparents' request should be granted unless the children wouldbe "impact[ed] adversely." In effect, the judge placed on

Granville, the fit custodial parent, the burden of disprovingthat visitation would be in the best interest of her daughters.
The judge reiterated moments later: "I think [visitation withthe Troxels] would be in the best interest of the children and
I haven't been shown it is not in [the] best interest of the
children." Id., at 214.

The decisional framework employed by the Superior Court
directly contravened the traditional presumption that a fit
parent will act in the best interest of his or her child. See
Parham, supra, at 602. In that respect, the court's pre530US1 Unit: $U66 [10-22-01 17:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sumption failed to provide any protection for Granville's fun-damental constitutional right to make decisions concerning

the rearing of her own daughters. Cf., e. g., Cal. Fam. CodeAnn. $ 3104(e) (West 1994) (rebuttable presumption that
grandparent visitation is not in child's best interest if par-ents agree that visitation rights should not be granted); Me.
Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 19A, $ 1803(3) (1998) (court may award
grandparent visitation if in best interest of child and "wouldnot significantly interfere with any parent-child relationship

or with the parent's rightful authority over the child"); Minn.Stat. $ 257.022(2)(a)(2) (1998) (court may award grandparent
visitation if in best interest of child and "such visitation
would not interfere with the parent-child relationship"); Neb.
Rev. Stat. $ 43-1802(2) (1998) (court must find "by clear and
convincing evidence" that grandparent visitation "will not
adversely interfere with the parent-child relationship"); R. I.
Gen. Laws $ 15-5-24.3(a)(2)(v) (Supp. 1999) (grandparent
must rebut, by clear and convincing evidence, presumption
that parent's decision to refuse grandparent visitation was
reasonable); Utah Code Ann. $ 30-5-2(2)(e) (1998) (same);
Hoff v. Berg, 595 N. W. 2d 285, 291-292 (N. D. 1999) (holding
North Dakota grandparent visitation statute unconstitutional because State has no "compelling interest in presuming visitation rights of grandparents to an unmarried minor
are in the child's best interests and forcing parents to accede
to court-ordered grandparental visitation unless the parents
are first able to prove such visitation is not in the best interests of their minor child"). In an ideal world, parents might
always seek to cultivate the bonds between grandparents
and their grandchildren. Needless to say, however, our
world is far from perfect, and in it the decision whether such
an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in any
specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance.
And, if a fit parent's decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at
least some special weight to the parent's own determination.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Finally, we note that there is no allegation that Granvilleever sought to cut off visitation entirely. Rather, the present dispute originated when Granville informed the Troxelsthat she would prefer to restrict their visitation with Isabelle and Natalie to one short visit per month and specialholidays. See 87 Wash. App., at 133, 940 P. 2d, at 699; Verbatim Report 12. In the Superior Court proceedings Granville did not oppose visitation but instead asked that the du-ration of any visitation order be shorter than that requested

by the Troxels. While the Troxels requested two weekendsper month and two full weeks in the summer, Granville asked
the Superior Court to order only one day of visitation per
month (with no overnight stay) and participation in the Granville family's holiday celebrations. See 87 Wash. App., at
133, 940 P. 2d, at 699; Verbatim Report 9 ("Right off the bat
we'd like to say that our position is that grandparent visitation is in the best interest of the children. It is a matter of
how much and how it is going to be structured") (opening
statement by Granville's attorney). The Superior Court
gave no weight to Granville's having assented to visitation
even before the filing of any visitation petition or subsequent
court intervention. The court instead rejected Granville's
proposal and settled on a middle ground, ordering one weekend of visitation per month, one week in the summer, and
time on both of the petitioning grandparents' birthdays.
See 87 Wash. App., at 133-134, 940 P. 2d, at 699; Verbatim
Report 216-221. Significantly, many other States expressly
provide by statute that courts may not award visitation unless a parent has denied (or unreasonably denied) visitation
to the concerned third party. See, e. g., Miss. Code Ann.

$ 93-16-3(2)(a) (1994) (court must find that "the parent or
custodian of the child unreasonably denied the grandparent visitation rights with the child"); Ore. Rev. Stat.

$ 109.121(1)(a)(B) (1997) (court may award visitation if the
"custodian of the child has denied the grandparent reasonable opportunity to visit the child"); R. I. Gen. Laws $$ 15-5-

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
24.3(a)(2)(iii)-(iv) (Supp. 1999) (court must find that parentsprevented grandparent from visiting grandchild and that

"there is no other way the petitioner is able to visit his orher grandchild without court intervention").

Considered together with the Superior Court's reasons forawarding visitation to the Troxels, the combination of these
factors demonstrates that the visitation order in this case
was an unconstitutional infringement on Granville's funda-mental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody,

and control of her two daughters. The Washington SuperiorCourt failed to accord the determination of Granville, a fit
custodial parent, any material weight. In fact, the Superior
Court made only two formal findings in support of its visitation order. First, the Troxels "are part of a large, central,
loving family, all located in this area, and the [Troxels] can
provide opportunities for the children in the areas of cousins
and music." App. 70a. Second, "[t]he children would be
benefitted from spending quality time with the [Troxels],
provided that that time is balanced with time with the childrens' [sic] nuclear family." Ibid. These slender findings,
in combination with the court's announced presumption in
favor of grandparent visitation and its failure to accord significant weight to Granville's already having offered meaningful visitation to the Troxels, show that this case involves
nothing more than a simple disagreement between the Washington Superior Court and Granville concerning her children's best interests. The Superior Court's announced reason for ordering one week of visitation in the summer
demonstrates our conclusion well: "I look back on some personal experiences . . . . We always spen[t] as kids a week
with one set of grandparents and another set of grandparents, [and] it happened to work out in our family that [it]
turned out to be an enjoyable experience. Maybe that can,
in this family, if that is how it works out." Verbatim Report
220-221. As we have explained, the Due Process Clause
does not permit a State to infringe on the fundamental right

73Cite as: 530 U. S. 57 (2000)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because astate judge believes a "better" decision could be made. Neither the Washington nonparental visitation statute gener-ally--which places no limits on either the persons who may
petition for visitation or the circumstances in which such apetition may be granted--nor the Superior Court in this
specific case required anything more. Accordingly, we holdthat $ 26.10.160(3), as applied in this case, is unconstitutional.

Because we rest our decision on the sweeping breadth of$ 26.10.160(3) and the application of that broad, unlimited
power in this case, we do not consider the primary consti-tutional question passed on by the Washington Supreme
Court--whether the Due Process Clause requires all nonpa-rental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or
potential harm to the child as a condition precedent to grant-ing visitation. We do not, and need not, define today the
precise scope of the parental due process right in the visita-tion context. In this respect, we agree with

Justice Ken-
nedy that the constitutionality of any standard for awardingvisitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in thisarea are best "elaborated with care." Post, at 101 (dissenting opinion). Because much state-court adjudication in thiscontext occurs on a case-by-case basis, we would be hesitant
to hold that specific nonparental visitation statutes violatethe Due Process Clause as a per se matter.* See, e. g., Fair*All 50 States have statutes that provide for grandparent visitation in

entry of the order was appropriate in this case. Faced withthe Superior Court's application of $ 26.10.160(3) to Granville

and her family, the Washington Supreme Court chose not togive the statute a narrower construction. Rather, that
court gave $ 26.10.160(3) a literal and expansive interpreta-tion. As we have explained, that broad construction plainly
encompassed the Superior Court's application of the statute.
See supra, at 67.There is thus no reason to remand the case for further

proceedings in the Washington Supreme Court. As Jus-
tice Kennedy recognizes, the burden of litigating a domestic relations proceeding can itself be "so disruptive of theparent-child relationship that the constitutional right of a

custodial parent to make certain basic determinations for the
child's welfare becomes implicated." Post, at 101. In this
case, the litigation costs incurred by Granville on her trip
through the Washington court system and to this Court are
without a doubt already substantial. As we have explained,
it is apparent that the entry of the visitation order in this
case violated the Constitution. We should say so now, without forcing the parties into additional litigation that would
further burden Granville's parental right. We therefore
hold that the application of $ 26.10.160(3) to Granville and
her family violated her due process right to make decisions
concerning the care, custody, and control of her daughters.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Washington Supreme
Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the judgment affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Washington, whose facial invalidation of its
own state statute is consistent with this Court's prior cases
addressing the substantive interests at stake. I would say
no more. The issues that might well be presented by reviewing a decision addressing the specific application of the

"treacherous field" of substantive due process. Moore v.
East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502 (1977) (opinion of Powell,
J.).

The Supreme Court of Washington invalidated its state
statute based on the text of the statute alone, not its application to any particular case.1 Its ruling rested on two independently sufficient grounds: the failure of the statute to require harm to the child to justify a disputed visitation order,
In re Smith, 137 Wash. 2d 1, 17, 969 P. 2d 21, 29 (1998), and
the statute's authorization of "any person" at "any time"
to petition for and to receive visitation rights subject only
to a free-ranging best-interests-of-the-child standard, id., at
20-21, 969 P. 2d, at 30-31. Ante, at 63. I see no error in
the second reason, that because the state statute authorizes
any person at any time to request (and a judge to award)
visitation rights, subject only to the State's particular best1 The Supreme Court of Washington made its ruling in an action where
three separate cases, including the Troxels', had been consolidated. In re
Smith, 137 Wash. 2d 1, 6-7, 969 P. 2d 21, 23-24 (1998). The court also
addressed two statutes, Wash. Rev. Code $ 26.10.160(3) (Supp. 1996) and
former Wash. Rev. Code $ 26.09.240 (1994), 137 Wash. 2d, at 7, 969 P. 2d,
at 24, the latter of which is not even at issue in this case. See Brief for
Petitioners 6, n. 9; see also ante, at 61. Its constitutional analysis discussed only the statutory language and neither mentioned the facts of any
of the three cases nor reviewed the records of their trial court proceedings
below. 137 Wash. 2d, at 13-21, 969 P. 2d, at 27-31. The decision invalidated both statutes without addressing their application to particular
facts: "We conclude petitioners have standing but, as written, the statutes
violate the parents' constitutionally protected interests. These statutes
allow any person, at any time, to petition for visitation without regard to
relationship to the child, without regard to changed circumstances, and
without regard to harm." Id., at 5, 969 P. 2d, at 23 (emphasis added); see
also id., at 21, 969 P. 2d, at 31 ("RCW 26.10.160(3) and former RCW
26.09.240 impermissibly interfere with a parent's fundamental interest in
the care, custody and companionship of the child" (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted)).

interests standard, the state statute sweeps too broadlyand is unconstitutional on its face. Consequently, there is

no need to decide whether harm is required or to considerthe precise scope of the parent's right or its necessary

protections.We have long recognized that a parent's interests in the
nurture, upbringing, companionship, care, and custody of
children are generally protected by the Due Process Clauseof the Fourteenth Amendment. See,

e. g., Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399, 401 (1923); Pierce v. Society of
Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 535 (1925); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S.
645, 651 (1972); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 232 (1972);
Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 255 (1978); Parham v.
J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S.
745, 753 (1982); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720
(1997). As we first acknowledged in Meyer, the right of parents to "bring up children," 262 U. S., at 399, and "to control
the education of their own" is protected by the Constitution,
id., at 401. See also Glucksberg, supra, at 761 (Souter, J.,
concurring in judgment).

On the basis of this settled principle, the Supreme Court
of Washington invalidated its statute because it authorized a
contested visitation order at the intrusive behest of any person at any time subject only to a best-interests-of-the-child
standard. In construing the statute, the state court explained that the "any person" at "any time" language was to
be read literally, 137 Wash. 2d, at 10-11, 969 P. 2d, at 25-27,
and that "[m]ost notably the statut[e] do[es] not require the
petitioner to establish that he or she has a substantial relationship with the child," id., at 20-21, 969 P. 2d, at 31. Although the statute speaks of granting visitation rights whenever "visitation may serve the best interest of the child,"
Wash. Rev. Code $ 26.10.160(3) (1994), the state court authoritatively read this provision as placing hardly any limit on a
court's discretion to award visitation rights. As the court
understood it, the specific best-interests provision in the

statute would allow a court to award visitation whenever itthought it could make a better decision than a child's parent

had done. See 137 Wash. 2d, at 20, 969 P. 2d, at 31 ("It is notwithin the province of the state to make significant decisions
concerning the custody of children merely because it couldmake a `better' decision").

2 On that basis in part, the Supreme Court of Washington invalidated the State's own stat-ute: "Parents have a right to limit visitation of their children

with third persons." Id., at 21, 969 P. 2d, at 31.Our cases, it is true, have not set out exact metes and
bounds to the protected interest of a parent in the relation-ship with his child, but

Meyer's repeatedly recognized rightof upbringing would be a sham if it failed to encompass the

right to be free of judicially compelled visitation by "anyparty" at "any time" a judge believed he "could make a `better' decision" 3 than the objecting parent had done. Thestrength of a parent's interest in controlling a child's associates is as obvious as the influence of personal associations on
the development of the child's social and moral character.Whether for good or for ill, adults not only influence but may

indoctrinate children, and a choice about a child's social com-panions is not essentially different from the designation of
the adults who will influence the child in school. Even aState's considered judgment about the preferable political and religious character of schoolteachers is not entitled

2 As Justice O'Connor points out, the best-interests provision "contains no requirement that a court accord the parent's decision any presumption of validity or any weight whatsoever. Instead, the Washington
statute places the best-interest determination solely in the hands of the
judge." Ante, at 67.

in part and concurring in judgment) ("The ordinance is unconstitutional,
not because a policeman applied this discretion wisely or poorly in a particular case, but rather because the policeman enjoys too much discretion
in every case. And if every application of the ordinance represents an
exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinance is invalid in all its
applications").

to prevail over a parent's choice of private school. Pierce,
supra, at 535 ("The fundamental theory of liberty upon
which all governments in this Union repose excludes any
general power of the State to standardize its children by
forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only.
The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who
nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled
with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations"). It would be anomalous, then, to subject
a parent to any individual judge's choice of a child's associates from out of the general population merely because the
judge might think himself more enlightened than the child's
parent.4 To say the least (and as the Court implied in
Pierce), parental choice in such matters is not merely a default rule in the absence of either governmental choice or
the government's designation of an official with the power to
choose for whatever reason and in whatever circumstances.

Since I do not question the power of a State's highest court
to construe its domestic statute and to apply a demanding
standard when ruling on its facial constitutionality,5 see Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 55, n. 22 (1999) (opinion of Ste-
vens, J.), this for me is the end of the case. I would simply
affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of Washington that
its statute, authorizing courts to grant visitation rights to
any person at any time, is unconstitutional. I therefore
respectfully concur in the judgment.

4 The Supreme Court of Washington invalidated the broadly sweeping
statute at issue on similarly limited reasoning: "Some parents and judges
will not care if their child is physically disciplined by a third person; some
parents and judges will not care if a third person teaches the child a religion inconsistent with the parents' religion; and some judges and parents
will not care if the child is exposed to or taught racist or sexist beliefs.
But many parents and judges will care, and, between the two, the parents
should be the ones to choose whether to expose their children to certain
people or ideas." 137 Wash. 2d, at 21, 969 P. 2d, at 31 (citation omitted).

80 TROXEL v. GRANVILLE

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
I write separately to note that neither party has arguedthat our substantive due process cases were wrongly decided

and that the original understanding of the Due ProcessClause precludes judicial enforcement of unenumerated
rights under that constitutional provision. As a result, I ex-press no view on the merits of this matter, and I understand
the plurality as well to leave the resolution of that issue foranother day.*

Consequently, I agree with the plurality that this Court'srecognition of a fundamental right of parents to direct the
upbringing of their children resolves this case. Our decisionin Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), holds that
parents have a fundamental constitutional right to rear theirchildren, including the right to determine who shall educate
and socialize them. The opinions of the plurality, Justice
Kennedy, and Justice Souter recognize such a right, butcuriously none of them articulates the appropriate standard

of review. I would apply strict scrutiny to infringements offundamental rights. Here, the State of Washington lacks
even a legitimate governmental interest--to say nothing ofa compelling one--in second-guessing a fit parent's decision
regarding visitation with third parties. On this basis,I would affirm the judgment below.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The Court today wisely declines to endorse either theholding or the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Washington. In my opinion, the Court would have been even wiserto deny certiorari. Given the problematic character of the
trial court's decision and the uniqueness of the Washingtonstatute, there was no pressing need to review a State Su*This case also does not involve a challenge based upon the Privileges
and Immunities Clause and thus does not present an opportunity to reevaluate the meaning of that Clause. See Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 527-528

preme Court decision that merely requires the state legislature to draft a better statute.

Having decided to address the merits, however, the Court
should begin by recognizing that the State Supreme Court
rendered a federal constitutional judgment holding a state
law invalid on its face. In light of that judgment, I believe
that we should confront the federal questions presented directly. For the Washington statute is not made facially invalid either because it may be invoked by too many hypothetical plaintiffs, or because it leaves open the possibility
that someone may be permitted to sustain a relationship
with a child without having to prove that serious harm to
the child would otherwise result.

I
In response to Tommie Granville's federal constitutional
challenge, the State Supreme Court broadly held that Wash.
Rev. Code $ 26.10.160(3) (Supp. 1996) was invalid on its face
under the Federal Constitution.1 Despite the nature of this
judgment, Justice O'Connor would hold that the Washington visitation statute violated the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment only as applied. Ante, at 65, 67, 73
(plurality opinion). I agree with Justice Souter, ante, at
75-76, and n. 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), that this
approach is untenable.

The task of reviewing a trial court's application of a state
statute to the particular facts of a case is one that should be
performed in the first instance by the state appellate courts.
In this case, because of their views of the Federal Constitution, the Washington state appeals courts have yet to decide
whether the trial court's findings were adequate under the

statute.2 Any as-applied critique of the trial court's judg-ment that this Court might offer could only be based upon a

guess about the state courts' application of that State's stat-ute, and an independent assessment of the facts in this
case--both judgments that we are ill-suited and ill-advisedto make.

2 As the dissenting judge on the state appeals court noted, "[t]he trial
court here was not presented with any guidance as to the proper test to
be applied in a case such as this." In re Troxel, 87 Wash. App. 131, 143,
940 P. 2d 698, 703 (1997) (opinion of Ellington, J.). While disagreeing with
the appeals court majority's conclusion that the state statute was constitutionally infirm, Judge Ellington recognized that despite this disagreement,
the appropriate result would not be simply to affirm. Rather, because
there had been no definitive guidance as to the proper construction of the
statute, "[t]he findings necessary to order visitation over the objections
of a parent are thus not in the record, and I would remand for further
proceedings." Ibid.

3 Unlike Justice O'Connor, ante, at 69-70, I find no suggestion in the

trial court's decision in this case that the court was applying any presumptions at all in its analysis, much less one in favor of the grandparents.
The first excerpt Justice O'Connor quotes from the trial court's ruling,
ante, at 69, says nothing one way or another about who bears the burden
under the statute of demonstrating "best interests." There is certainly
no indication of a presumption against the parents' judgment, only a
" `commonsensical' " estimation that, usually but not always, visiting with
grandparents can be good for children. Ibid. The second quotation, " `I
think [visitation] would be in the best interest of the children and I haven't
been shown it is not in [the] best interest of the children,' " ibid., sounds
as though the judge has simply concluded, based on the evidence before
him, that visitation in this case would be in the best interests of both
girls. Verbatim Report of Proceedings in In re Troxel, No. 93-3-00650-7
(Wash. Super. Ct., Dec. 14, 1994), p. 214. These statements do not provide us with a definitive assessment of the law the court applied regarding
a "presumption" either way. Indeed, a different impression is conveyed
by the judge's very next comment: "That has to be balanced, of course,
with Mr. and Mrs. Wynn [a.k.a. Tommie Granville], who are trying to
put together a family that includes eight children, . . . trying to get all
those children together at the same time and put together some sort of
functional unit wherein the children can be raised as brothers and sisters
and spend lots of quality time together." Ibid. The judge then went on
to reject the Troxels' efforts to attain the same level of visitation that

Stevens, J., dissenting
While I thus agree with Justice Souter in this respect,I do not agree with his conclusion that the State Supreme

Court made a definitive construction of the visitation statutethat necessitates the constitutional conclusion he would
draw.4 As I read the State Supreme Court's opinion, In re
Smith, 137 Wash. 2d 1, 19-20, 969 P. 2d 21, 30-31 (1998), its
interpretation of the Federal Constitution made it unnecessary to adopt a definitive construction of the statutory text,or, critically, to decide whether the statute had been correctly applied in this case. In particular, the state courtgave no content to the phrase, "best interest of the child,"
Wash. Rev. Code $ 26.10.160(3) (Supp. 1996)--content thatmight well be gleaned from that State's own statutes or decisional law employing the same phrase in different contexts,
their son, the girls' biological father, would have had, had he been alive.
"[T]he fact that Mr. Troxel is deceased and he was the natural parent and
as much as the grandparents would maybe like to step into the shoes of
Brad, under our law that is not what we can do. The grandparents cannot
step into the shoes of a deceased parent, per say [sic], as far as whole
gamut of visitation rights are concerned." Id., at 215. Rather, as the
judge put it, "I understand your desire to do that as loving grandparents.
Unfortunately that would impact too dramatically on the children and
their ability to be integrated into the nuclear unit with the mother." Id.,
at 222-223.

However one understands the trial court's decision--and my point is
merely to demonstrate that it is surely open to interpretation--its validity
under the state statute as written is a judgment for the state appellate
courts to make in the first instance.

4 Justice Souter would conclude from the state court's statement that

the statute "do[es] not require the petitioner to establish that he or she
has a substantial relationship with the child," 137 Wash. 2d, at 21, 969
P. 2d, at 31, that the state court has "authoritatively read [the `best interests'] provision as placing hardly any limit on a court's discretion to award
visitation rights," ante, at 77 (opinion concurring in judgment). Apart
from the question whether one can deem this description of the statute an
"authoritative" construction, it seems to me exceedingly unlikely that the
state court held the statute unconstitutional because it believed that the
"best interests" standard imposes "hardly any limit" on courts' discretion.
See n. 5, infra.

530US1 Unit: $U66 [10-22-01 17:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
84 TROXEL v. GRANVILLE

Stevens, J., dissenting
and from the myriad other state statutes and court decisions
at least nominally applying the same standard.5 Thus,
I believe that Justice Souter's conclusion that the statute
unconstitutionally imbues state trial court judges with " `too
much discretion in every case,' " ante, at 78, n. 3 (opinion
concurring in judgment) (quoting Chicago v. Morales, 527
U. S. 41, 71 (1999) (Breyer, J., concurring)), is premature.

We are thus presented with the unconstrued terms of a
state statute and a State Supreme Court opinion that, in my
view, significantly misstates the effect of the Federal Constitution upon any construction of that statute. Given that
posture, I believe the Court should identify and correct the
two flaws in the reasoning of the state court's majority opin5 The phrase "best interests of the child" appears in no less than 10
current Washington state statutory provisions governing determinations
from guardianship to termination to custody to adoption. See, e. g., Wash.
Rev. Code $ 26.09.240(6) (Supp. 1996) (amended version of visitation statute enumerating eight factors courts may consider in evaluating a child's
best interests); $ 26.09.002 (in cases of parental separation or divorce "best
interests of the child are served by a parenting arrangement that best
maintains a child's emotional growth, health and stability, and physical
care"; "best interest of the child is ordinarily served when the existing
pattern of interaction between a parent and child is altered only to the
extent necessitated by the changed relationship of the parents or as required to protect the child from physical, mental, or emotional harm");

$ 26.10.100 ("The court shall determine custody in accordance with the
best interests of the child"). Indeed, the Washington state courts have
invoked the standard on numerous occasions in applying these statutory
provisions--just as if the phrase had quite specific and apparent meaning.
See, e. g., In re McDoyle, 122 Wash. 2d 604, 859 P. 2d 1239 (1993) (upholding trial court "best interest" assessment in custody dispute); McDaniels
v. Carlson, 108 Wash. 2d 299, 310, 738 P. 2d 254, 261 (1987) (elucidating
"best interests" standard in paternity suit context). More broadly, a
search of current state custody and visitation laws reveals fully 698 separate references to the "best interest of the child" standard, a number that,
at a minimum, should give the Court some pause before it upholds a decision implying that those words, on their face, may be too boundless to pass
muster under the Federal Constitution.

ion, and remand for further review of the trial court's dispo-sition of this specific case.

II
In my view, the State Supreme Court erred in its federalconstitutional analysis because neither the provision granting "any person" the right to petition the court for visitation,137 Wash. 2d, at 20, 969 P. 2d, at 30, nor the absence of a
provision requiring a "threshold . . . finding of harm to thechild,"

ibid., provides a sufficient basis for holding that thestatute is invalid in all its applications. I believe that a facial challenge should fail whenever a statute has "a `plainlylegitimate sweep,' "

Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702,739-740, and n. 7 (1997) (

Stevens, J., concurring in judg-ment).
6 Under the Washington statute, there are plainly

any number of cases--indeed, one suspects, the most com-mon to arise--in which the "person" among "any" seeking

visitation is a once-custodial caregiver, an intimate relation,or even a genetic parent. Even the Court would seem to
agree that in many circumstances, it would be constitution-ally permissible for a court to award some visitation of a
child to a parent or previous caregiver in cases of parentalseparation or divorce, cases of disputed custody, cases involving temporary foster care or guardianship, and so forth. Asthe statute plainly sweeps in a great deal of the permissible,
the State Supreme Court majority incorrectly concluded thata statute authorizing "any person" to file a petition seeking
visitation privileges would invariably run afoul of the Four-teenth Amendment.

The second key aspect of the Washington Supreme Court'sholding--that the Federal Constitution requires a showing
of actual or potential "harm" to the child before a court may

6 It necessarily follows that under the far more stringent demands suggested by the majority in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745
(1987) (plaintiff seeking facial invalidation "must establish that no set of
circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid"), respondent's
facial challenge must fail.

Stevens, J., dissenting
order visitation continued over a parent's objections--findsno support in this Court's case law. While, as the Court

recognizes, the Federal Constitution certainly protects theparent-child relationship from arbitrary impairment by the
State, see infra this page and 87-88, we have never held thatthe parent's liberty interest in this relationship is so inflexible as to establish a rigid constitutional shield, protectingevery arbitrary parental decision from any challenge absent
a threshold finding of harm.7 The presumption that paren-tal decisions generally serve the best interests of their children is sound, and clearly in the normal case the parent'sinterest is paramount. But even a fit parent is capable of
treating a child like a mere possession.Cases like this do not present a bipolar struggle between
the parents and the State over who has final authority todetermine what is in a child's best interests. There is at a
minimum a third individual, whose interests are implicatedin every case to which the statute applies--the child.

It has become standard practice in our substantive dueprocess jurisprudence to begin our analysis with an identification of the "fundamental" liberty interests implicated bythe challenged state action. See, e. g., ante, at 65-66 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.702 (1997); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). My colleagues are of course cor-rect to recognize that the right of a parent to maintain a
relationship with his or her child is among the interests in7 The suggestion by Justice Thomas that this case may be resolved
solely with reference to our decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268
U. S. 510, 535 (1925), is unpersuasive. Pierce involved a parent's choice
whether to send a child to public or private school. While that case is a
source of broad language about the scope of parents' due process rights
with respect to their children, the constitutional principles and interests
involved in the schooling context do not necessarily have parallel implications in this family law visitation context, in which multiple overlapping
and competing prerogatives of various plausibly interested parties are at
stake.

cluded most often in the constellation of liberties protectedthrough the Fourteenth Amendment.

Ante, at 65-66 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). Our cases leave no doubt that parentshave a fundamental liberty interest in caring for and guiding

their children, and a corresponding privacy interest--absentexceptional circumstances--in doing so without the undue
interference of strangers to them and to their child. Moreover, and critical in this case, our cases applying this princi-ple have explained that with this constitutional liberty comes

a presumption (albeit a rebuttable one) that "natural bondsof affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their
children." Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979); see

Despite this Court's repeated recognition of these significant parental liberty interests, these interests have never
been seen to be without limits. In Lehr v. Robertson, 463
U. S. 248 (1983), for example, this Court held that a putative
biological father who had never established an actual relationship with his child did not have a constitutional right to
notice of his child's adoption by the man who had married
the child's mother. As this Court had recognized in an earlier case, a parent's liberty interests " `do not spring fullblown from the biological connection between parent and
child. They require relationships more enduring.' " Id., at
260 (quoting Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U. S. 380, 397 (1979)).

Conversely, in Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110
(1989), this Court concluded that despite both biological parenthood and an established relationship with a young child,
a father's due process liberty interest in maintaining some
connection with that child was not sufficiently powerful to
overcome a state statutory presumption that the husband of
the child's mother was the child's parent. As a result of the

presumption, the biological father could be denied even visi-tation with the child because, as a matter of state law, he

was not a "parent." A plurality of this Court there recog-nized that the parental liberty interest was a function, not
simply of "isolated factors" such as biology and intimateconnection, but of the broader and apparently independent
interest in family. See, e. g., id., at 123; see also Lehr, 463U. S., at 261;

Smith v. Organization of Foster Families ForEquality & Reform, 431 U. S. 816, 842-847 (1977); Moore v.

East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 498-504 (1977).A parent's rights with respect to her child have thus never
been regarded as absolute, but rather are limited by the ex-istence of an actual, developed relationship with a child, and
are tied to the presence or absence of some embodiment offamily. These limitations have arisen, not simply out of the
definition of parenthood itself, but because of this Court'sassumption that a parent's interests in a child must be balanced against the State's long-recognized interests as parens
patriae, see, e. g., Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 303-304(1993); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S., at 766; Parham, 442

U. S., at 605; Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166(1944), and, critically, the child's own complementary interest
in preserving relationships that serve her welfare and pro-tection, Santosky, 455 U. S., at 760.

While this Court has not yet had occasion to elucidate thenature of a child's liberty interests in preserving established
familial or family-like bonds, 491 U. S., at 130 (reserving thequestion), it seems to me extremely likely that, to the extent
parents and families have fundamental liberty interests inpreserving such intimate relationships, so, too, do children
have these interests, and so, too, must their interests be bal-anced in the equation.

the statute as applied, to consider whether the trial court'sassessment of the "best interest of the child" incorporated
that presumption. Neither would I decide whether the trialcourt applied Washington's statute in a constitutional way in
this case, although, as I have explained, n. 3, supra, I thinkthe outcome of this determination is far from clear. For the
purpose of a facial challenge like this, I think it safe toassume that trial judges usually give great deference to
parents' wishes, and I am not persuaded otherwise here.But presumptions notwithstanding, we should recognize
that there may be circumstances in which a child has astronger interest at stake than mere protection from serious
harm caused by the termination of visitation by a "person"
other than a parent. The almost infinite variety of fam-ily relationships that pervade our ever-changing society

strongly counsel against the creation by this Court of a con-stitutional rule that treats a biological parent's liberty interest in the care and supervision of her child as an isolated
right that may be exercised arbitrarily. It is indisputablythe business of the States, rather than a federal court employing a national standard, to assess in the first instancethe relative importance of the conflicting interests that give
rise to disputes such as this.10 Far from guaranteeing that

an individual--with whom a child may have an establishedrelationship--the procedural right to ask the State to act
as arbiter, through the entirely well-known best-interestsstandard, between the parent's protected interests and the

of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves room for States to con-sider the impact on a child of possibly arbitrary parental

decisions that neither serve nor are motivated by the bestinterests of the child.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
Justice Scalia, dissenting.
In my view, a right of parents to direct the upbringing of
their children is among the "unalienable Rights" with whichthe Declaration of Independence proclaims "all men . . . are

endowed by their Creator." And in my view that right isalso among the "othe[r] [rights] retained by the people"
which the Ninth Amendment says the Constitution's enumeration of rights "shall not be construed to deny or disparage." The Declaration of Independence, however, is not a
legal prescription conferring powers upon the courts; and the
Constitution's refusal to "deny or disparage" other rights is
far removed from affirming any one of them, and even further removed from authorizing judges to identify what they
might be, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly
enacted by the people. Consequently, while I would think
it entirely compatible with the commitment to representative

allocating responsibility for resolving disputes of various kinds in our federal system. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689 (1992). But the
instinct against overregularizing decisions about personal relations is sustained on firmer ground than mere tradition. It flows in equal part from
the premise that people and their intimate associations are complex and
particular, and imposing a rigid template upon them all risks severing
bonds our society would do well to preserve.

which the Constitution confers upon me as a judge entitlesme to deny legal effect to laws that (in my view) infringe
upon what is (in my view) that unenumerated right.

Only three holdings of this Court rest in whole or in partupon a substantive constitutional right of parents to direct

the upbringing of their children 1--two of them from an erarich in substantive due process holdings that have since been
repudiated. See Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399, 401(1923);

Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534-535
(1925); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 232-233 (1972).Cf.

West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937)
(overruling Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S.525 (1923)). The sheer diversity of today's opinions persuades me that the theory of unenumerated parental rights
underlying these three cases has small claim to stare decisis
protection. A legal principle that can be thought to produce
such diverse outcomes in the relatively simple case before us
here is not a legal principle that has induced substantial reliance. While I would not now overrule those earlier cases
(that has not been urged), neither would I extend the theory
upon which they rested to this new context.

Judicial vindication of "parental rights" under a Constitution that does not even mention them requires (as Justice
Kennedy's opinion rightly points out) not only a judicially
crafted definition of parents, but also--unless, as no one be1 Whether parental rights constitute a "liberty" interest for purposes of

Justice Kennedy would do--that we will be ushering ina new regime of judicially prescribed, and federally prescribed, family law. I have no reason to believe that federaljudges will be better at this than state legislatures; and state
legislatures have the great advantages of doing harm in amore circumscribed area, of being able to correct their mistakes in a flash, and of being removable by the people.2For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment below.

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
The Supreme Court of Washington has determined thatpetitioners Jenifer and Gary Troxel have standing under

state law to seek court-ordered visitation with their grand-children, notwithstanding the objections of the children's
parent, respondent Tommie Granville. The statute reliedupon provides:

"Any person may petition the court for visitationrights at any time including, but not limited to, custody
proceedings. The court may order visitation rights forany person when visitation may serve the best interest
of the child whether or not there has been any change ofcircumstances." Wash. Rev. Code $ 26.10.160(3) (1994).

2 I note that respondent is asserting only, on her own behalf, a substantive due process right to direct the upbringing of her own children, and is
not asserting, on behalf of her children, their First Amendment rights of
association or free exercise. I therefore do not have occasion to consider
whether, and under what circumstances, the parent could assert the latter
enumerated rights.

94 TROXEL v. GRANVILLE

Kennedy, J., dissenting
After acknowledging this statutory right to sue for visita-tion, the State Supreme Court invalidated the statute as violative of the United States Constitution, because it inter-fered with a parent's right to raise his or her child free from
unwarranted interference. In re Smith, 137 Wash. 2d 1, 969P. 2d 21 (1998). Although parts of the court's decision may
be open to differing interpretations, it seems to be agreed
that the court invalidated the statute on its face, ruling ita nullity.

The first flaw the State Supreme Court found in the stat-ute is that it allows an award of visitation to a nonparent
without a finding that harm to the child would result if visitation were withheld; and the second is that the statute
allows any person to seek visitation at any time. In my
view the first theory is too broad to be correct, as it appears
to contemplate that the best interests of the child standard
may not be applied in any visitation case. I acknowledge
the distinct possibility that visitation cases may arise where,
considering the absence of other protection for the parent
under state laws and procedures, the best interests of the
child standard would give insufficient protection to the parent's constitutional right to raise the child without undue
intervention by the State; but it is quite a different matter
to say, as I understand the Supreme Court of Washington to
have said, that a harm to the child standard is required in
every instance.

Given the error I see in the State Supreme Court's central
conclusion that the best interests of the child standard is
never appropriate in third-party visitation cases, that court
should have the first opportunity to reconsider this case. I
would remand the case to the state court for further proceedings. If it then found the statute has been applied in an
unconstitutional manner because the best interests of the
child standard gives insufficient protection to a parent under
the circumstances of this case, or if it again declared the statute a nullity because the statute seems to allow any person

at all to seek visitation at any time, the decision would pre-sent other issues which may or may not warrant further review in this Court. These include not only the protectionthe Constitution gives parents against state-ordered visitation but also the extent to which federal rules for facial chal-lenges to statutes control in state courts. These matters,
however, should await some further case. The judgment
now under review should be vacated and remanded on thesole ground that the harm ruling that was so central to the

Supreme Court of Washington's decision was error, given itsbroad formulation.

Turning to the question whether harm to the child must
be the controlling standard in every visitation proceeding,
there is a beginning point that commands general, perhaps
unanimous, agreement in our separate opinions: As our case
law has developed, the custodial parent has a constitutional
right to determine, without undue interference by the State,
how best to raise, nurture, and educate the child. The parental right stems from the liberty protected by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g.,
Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399, 401 (1923); Pierce v.
Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534-535 (1925); Prince v.
Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944); Stanley v. Illinois,
405 U. S. 645, 651-652 (1972); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S.
205, 232-233 (1972); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 753-
754 (1982). Pierce and Meyer, had they been decided in recent times, may well have been grounded upon First Amendment principles protecting freedom of speech, belief, and
religion. Their formulation and subsequent interpretation
have been quite different, of course; and they long have been
interpreted to have found in Fourteenth Amendment concepts of liberty an independent right of the parent in the
"custody, care and nurture of the child," free from state intervention. Prince, supra, at 166. The principle exists,
then, in broad formulation; yet courts must use considerable
restraint, including careful adherence to the incremental in530US1 Unit: $U66 [10-22-01 17:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
struction given by the precise facts of particular cases, asthey seek to give further and more precise definition to the

right.The State Supreme Court sought to give content to the
parent's right by announcing a categorical rule that thirdparties who seek visitation must always prove the denial of
visitation would harm the child. After reviewing some of
the relevant precedents, the Supreme Court of Washingtonconcluded " `[t]he requirement of harm is the sole protection

that parents have against pervasive state interference in theparenting process.' " 137 Wash. 2d, at 19-20, 969 P. 2d, at
30 (quoting Hawk v. Hawk, 855 S. W. 2d 573, 580 (Tenn.
1993)). For that reason, "[s]hort of preventing harm to the
child," the court considered the best interests of the child to
be "insufficient to serve as a compelling state interest overruling a parent's fundamental rights." 137 Wash. 2d, at 20,
969 P. 2d, at 30.

While it might be argued as an abstract matter that in
some sense the child is always harmed if his or her best
interests are not considered, the law of domestic relations,
as it has evolved to this point, treats as distinct the two
standards, one harm to the child and the other the best interests of the child. The judgment of the Supreme Court of
Washington rests on that assumption, and I, too, shall assume that there are real and consequential differences between the two standards.

On the question whether one standard must always take
precedence over the other in order to protect the right of
the parent or parents, "[o]ur Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices" do not give us clear or definitive answers. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997).
The consensus among courts and commentators is that at
least through the 19th century there was no legal right of
visitation; court-ordered visitation appears to be a 20thcentury phenomenon. See, e. g., 1 D. Kramer, Legal Rights
of Children 124, 136 (2d ed. 1994); 2 J. Atkinson, Modern

Child Custody Practice $ 8.10 (1986). A case often cited asone of the earliest visitation decisions,

Succession of Reiss,
46 La. Ann. 347, 353, 15 So. 151, 152 (1894), explained that"the obligation ordinarily to visit grandparents is moral and

not legal"--a conclusion which appears consistent with thatof American common-law jurisdictions of the time. Early
20th-century exceptions did occur, often in cases where
a relative had acted in a parental capacity, or where oneof a child's parents had died. See

Douglass v. Merriman,
163 S. C. 210, 161 S. E. 452 (1931) (maternal grandparentawarded visitation with child when custody was awarded to

father; mother had died); Solomon v. Solomon, 319 Ill. App.
618, 49 N. E. 2d 807 (1943) (paternal grandparents could be
given visitation with child in custody of his mother when
their son was stationed abroad; case remanded for fitness
hearing); Consaul v. Consaul, 63 N. Y. S. 2d 688 (Sup. Ct.
Jefferson Cty. 1946) (paternal grandparents awarded visitation with child in custody of his mother; father had become
incompetent). As a general matter, however, contemporary
state-court decisions acknowledge that "[h]istorically, grandparents had no legal right of visitation," Campbell v. Campbell, 896 P. 2d 635, 642, n. 15 (Utah App. 1995), and it is safe
to assume other third parties would have fared no better
in court.

To say that third parties have had no historical right to
petition for visitation does not necessarily imply, as the Supreme Court of Washington concluded, that a parent has a
constitutional right to prevent visitation in all cases not
involving harm. True, this Court has acknowledged that
States have the authority to intervene to prevent harm to
children, see, e. g., Prince, supra, at 168-169; Yoder, supra,
at 233-234, but that is not the same as saying that a heightened harm to the child standard must be satisfied in every
case in which a third party seeks a visitation order. It is
also true that the law's traditional presumption has been
"that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the

best interests of their children," Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S.584, 602 (1979); and "[s]imply because the decision of a parent

is not agreeable to a child or because it involves risks doesnot automatically transfer the power to make that decision
from the parents to some agency or officer of the state," id.,at 603. The State Supreme Court's conclusion that the Constitution forbids the application of the best interests of the
child standard in any visitation proceeding, however, appearsto rest upon assumptions the Constitution does not require.

My principal concern is that the holding seems to proceedfrom the assumption that the parent or parents who resist
visitation have always been the child's primary caregivers
and that the third parties who seek visitation have no legitimate and established relationship with the child. That idea,
in turn, appears influenced by the concept that the conventional nuclear family ought to establish the visitation standard for every domestic relations case. As we all know, this
is simply not the structure or prevailing condition in many
households. See, e. g., Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S.
494 (1977). For many boys and girls a traditional family
with two or even one permanent and caring parent is simply
not the reality of their childhood. This may be so whether
their childhood has been marked by tragedy or filled with
considerable happiness and fulfillment.

Cases are sure to arise--perhaps a substantial number of
cases--in which a third party, by acting in a caregiving role
over a significant period of time, has developed a relationship
with a child which is not necessarily subject to absolute
parental veto. See Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110
(1989) (putative natural father not entitled to rebut state-law
presumption that child born in a marriage is a child of the
marriage); Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246 (1978) (best interests standard sufficient in adoption proceeding to protect
interests of natural father who had not legitimated the child);
see also Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 261 (1983) (" `[T]he

volved and to the society, stems from the emotional attach-ments that derive from the intimacy of daily association, and

from the role it plays in "promot[ing] a way of life" throughthe instruction of children . . . as well as from the fact of
blood relationship' " (quoting Smith v. Organization of Foster Families For Equality & Reform, 431 U. S. 816, 844
(1977), in turn quoting Yoder, 406 U. S., at 231-233)). Some
pre-existing relationships, then, serve to identify personswho have a strong attachment to the child with the concomitant motivation to act in a responsible way to ensure thechild's welfare. As the State Supreme Court was correct to
acknowledge, those relationships can be so enduring that "in
certain circumstances where a child has enjoyed a substantial relationship with a third person, arbitrarily depriving
the child of the relationship could cause severe psychological
harm to the child," 137 Wash. 2d, at 20, 969 P. 2d, at 30;
and harm to the adult may also ensue. In the design and
elaboration of their visitation laws, States may be entitled to
consider that certain relationships are such that to avoid the
risk of harm, a best interests standard can be employed by
their domestic relations courts in some circumstances.

Indeed, contemporary practice should give us some pause
before rejecting the best interests of the child standard in
all third-party visitation cases, as the Washington court has
done. The standard has been recognized for many years as
a basic tool of domestic relations law in visitation proceedings. Since 1965 all 50 States have enacted a third-party
visitation statute of some sort. See ante, at 73-74, n. (plurality opinion). Each of these statutes, save one, permits a
court order to issue in certain cases if visitation is found to
be in the best interests of the child. While it is unnecessary
for us to consider the constitutionality of any particular provision in the case now before us, it can be noted that the
statutes also include a variety of methods for limiting parents' exposure to third-party visitation petitions and for ensuring parental decisions are given respect. Many States

instance, some permit visitation petitions when there has
been a change in circumstances such as divorce or death of
a parent, see, e. g., N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 458:17-d (1992),

1994); R. I. Gen. Laws $ 15-5-24.3(a)(2)(v) (Supp. 1999).
Georgia's is the sole state legislature to have adopted a general harm to the child standard, see Ga. Code Ann. $ 19-7-
3(c) (1999), and it did so only after the Georgia Supreme
Court held the State's prior visitation statute invalid under
the Federal and Georgia Constitutions, see Brooks v. Parkerson, 265 Ga. 189, 454 S. E. 2d 769, cert. denied, 516 U. S.
942 (1995).

In light of the inconclusive historical record and case law,
as well as the almost universal adoption of the best interests
standard for visitation disputes, I would be hard pressed to
conclude the right to be free of such review in all cases is
itself " `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' " Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302
U. S. 319, 325 (1937)). In my view, it would be more appropriate to conclude that the constitutionality of the application of the best interests standard depends on more specific
factors. In short, a fit parent's right vis-a` -vis a complete

Kennedy, J., dissenting
stranger is one thing; her right vis-a` -vis another parent or a
de facto parent may be another. The protection the Constitution requires, then, must be elaborated with care, usingthe discipline and instruction of the case law system. We

must keep in mind that family courts in the 50 States con-front these factual variations each day, and are best situated
to consider the unpredictable, yet inevitable, issues that
arise. Cf. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689, 703-704(1992).

It must be recognized, of course, that a domestic relationsproceeding in and of itself can constitute state intervention
that is so disruptive of the parent-child relationship that the
constitutional right of a custodial parent to make certain
basic determinations for the child's welfare becomes implicated. The best interests of the child standard has at times
been criticized as indeterminate, leading to unpredictable results. See, e. g., American Law Institute, Principles of the
Law of Family Dissolution 2, and n. 2 (Tent. Draft No. 3,
Mar. 20, 1998). If a single parent who is struggling to raise
a child is faced with visitation demands from a third party,
the attorney's fees alone might destroy her hopes and plans
for the child's future. Our system must confront more often
the reality that litigation can itself be so disruptive that
constitutional protection may be required; and I do not discount the possibility that in some instances the best interests
of the child standard may provide insufficient protection
to the parent-child relationship. We owe it to the Nation's
domestic relations legal structure, however, to proceed with
caution.

It should suffice in this case to reverse the holding of the
State Supreme Court that the application of the best interests of the child standard is always unconstitutional in thirdparty visitation cases. Whether, under the circumstances of
this case, the order requiring visitation over the objection of
this fit parent violated the Constitution ought to be reserved
for further proceedings. Because of its sweeping ruling re530US1 Unit: $U66 [10-22-01 17:41:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
quiring the harm to the child standard, the Supreme Court ofWashington did not have the occasion to address the specific

visitation order the Troxels obtained. More specific guid-ance should await a case in which a State's highest court has
considered all of the facts in the course of elaborating theprotection afforded to parents by the laws of the State and
by the Constitution itself. Furthermore, in my view, weneed not address whether, under the correct constitutional
standards, the Washington statute can be invalidated on itsface. This question, too, ought to be addressed by the state
court in the first instance.In my view the judgment under review should be vacated
and the case remanded for further proceedings.

SIMS v. APFEL, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIALSECURITY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 98-9537. Argued March 28, 2000--Decided June 5, 2000
Petitioner applied for Social Security disability and Supplemental Security

Income benefits. After a state agency denied her claims, she obtained
a hearing before a Social Security Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),
who also denied her claims. Petitioner then requested review by the
Social Security Appeals Council, which denied review. She next filed
suit in the Federal District Court, contending that the ALJ erred in
three ways. The District Court rejected her contentions, and the Fifth
Circuit affirmed, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over two of the
contentions because they were not included in petitioner's request for
review by the Appeals Council.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
200 F. 3d 229, reversed and remanded.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I and II-A, concluding that Social Security claimants who exhaust
administrative remedies need not also exhaust issues in a request for
review by the Appeals Council in order to preserve judicial review of
those issues. Although administrative issue-exhaustion requirements
are largely creatures of statute, there is no contention that any statute
requires such exhaustion here. It is also common for an agency's regulations to require issue exhaustion in administrative appeals, but Social
Security Administration (SSA) regulations do not. This Court has required issue exhaustion even in the absence of a statute or regulation,
but the reason for doing so does not apply here. The desirability of a
judicially imposed issue-exhaustion requirement depends on the degree
to which the analogy to normal adversarial litigation applies in a particular administrative proceeding. See Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S.
552, 556. Where that proceeding is not adversarial, the reasons for a
court to require issue exhaustion are much weaker than where the parties are expected to develop the issues themselves. Pp. 106-110.

Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and
Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part II-B that the differences between courts and agencies are nowhere more pronounced than in Social
Security proceedings, which are inquisitorial rather than adversarial.
The ALJ's duty is to investigate the facts and develop the arguments

104 SIMS v. APFEL

Opinion of the Court
both for and against granting benefits, and the Council's review is similarly broad. The regulations expressly provide that the SSA conducts
the administrative review process in an informal, nonadversary manner.
As the Council, not the claimant, has primary responsibility for identifying and developing the issues, the general issue-exhaustion rule makes
little sense in this context. Pp. 110-112.

Justice O'Connor concluded that the SSA's failure to notify claimants of an issue exhaustion requirement is a sufficient basis for holding
that such exhaustion is not required in this context. Requiring issue
exhaustion is inappropriate here, where the SSA's regulations and procedures affirmatively suggest that specific issues need not be raised before the Appeals Council. Pp. 112-114.

Thomas, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the
opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II-A, in which Stevens,
O'Connor, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part II-B, in which Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.
O'Connor, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment, post, p. 112. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which
Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined, post, p. 114.

Opinion of the Court
before seeking judicial review of that denial, request thatthe Social Security Appeals Council review his claim. The

question is whether a claimant pursuing judicial review haswaived any issues that he did not include in that request.
We hold that he has not. I

In 1994, petitioner Juatassa Sims filed applications for dis-ability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 49
Stat. 622, 42 U. S. C. $ 401 et seq., and for supplemental secu-rity income benefits under Title XVI of that Act, 86 Stat.
1465, 42 U. S. C. $ 1381 et seq. She alleged disability from avariety of ailments, including degenerative joint diseases and
carpal tunnel syndrome. After a state agency denied herclaims, she obtained a hearing before a Social Security ALJ.
See generally Heckler v. Day, 467 U. S. 104, 106-107 (1984)(describing stages of review of claims for Social Security benefits). The ALJ, in 1996, also denied her claims, concludingthat, although she did have some medical impairments, she
had not been and was not under a "disability," as defined inthe Act. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 423(d) (1994 ed. and Supp. III)
and 1382c(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. III); Sullivan v. Zebley, 493U. S. 521, 524-526 (1990).

Petitioner then requested that the Social Security AppealsCouncil review her claims. A claimant may request such
review by completing a one-page form provided by the So-cial Security Administration (SSA)--Form HA-520--or "by
any other writing specifically requesting review." 20 CFR$ 422.205(a) (1999). Petitioner, through counsel, chose the
latter option, submitting to the Council a letter arguing thatthe ALJ had erred in several ways in analyzing the evidence.
The Council denied review.Next, petitioner filed suit in the District Court for the
Northern District of Mississippi. She contended that (1) theALJ had made selective use of the record; (2) the questions
the ALJ had posed to a vocational expert to determine peti-tioner's ability to work were defective because they omitted

Opinion of the Court
several of petitioner's ailments; and (3) in light of certainpeculiarities in the medical evidence, the ALJ should have

ordered a consultative examination. The District Court re-jected all of these contentions. App. 74-84.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 200F. 3d 229 (1998). That court affirmed on the merits with
regard to petitioner's first contention. With regard to thesecond and third contentions, it concluded that, under its decision in Paul v. Shalala, 29 F. 3d 208, 210 (1994), it lackedjurisdiction because petitioner had not raised those contentions in her request for review by the Appeals Council. Wegranted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1018 (1999), to resolve a conflict
among the Courts of Appeals over whether a Social Securityclaimant waives judicial review of an issue if he fails to exhaust that issue by presenting it to the Appeals Council inhis request for review. Compare

Paul, supra, at 210; Jamesv. Chater, 96 F. 3d 1341, 1343-1344 (CA10 1996), with Harwood v. Apfel, 186 F. 3d 1039, 1042-1043 (CA8 1999); Johnsonv.

A

The Social Security Act provides that "[a]ny individual,after any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing to which he was a party, . . . mayobtain a review of such decision by a civil action" in federal
district court. 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g). But the Act does notdefine "final decision," instead leaving it to the SSA to give
meaning to that term through regulations. See $ 405(a);Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 766 (1975). SSA regulations provide that, if the Appeals Council grants review of aclaim, then the decision that the Council issues is the Com1 We agree with the parties that, even were a court-imposed issueexhaustion requirement proper, the Fifth Circuit erred in treating it as
jurisdictional. Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 328 (1976).

Opinion of the Court
missioner's final decision. But if, as here, the Council deniesthe request for review, the ALJ's opinion becomes the final

decision. See 20 CFR $$ 404.900(a)(4)-(5), 404.955, 404.981,422.210(a) (1999).

2 If a claimant fails to request review

from the Council, there is no final decision and, as a result,no judicial review in most cases. See $ 404.900(b); Bowen

v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467, 482-483 (1986). Inadministrative-law parlance, such a claimant may not obtain

judicial review because he has failed to exhaust administra-tive remedies. See

Salfi, supra, at 765-766.The Commissioner rightly concedes that petitioner exhausted administrative remedies by requesting review bythe Council. Petitioner thus obtained a final decision, and
nothing in $ 405(g) or the regulations implementing it barsjudicial review of her claims.

Nevertheless, the Commissioner contends that we shouldrequire issue exhaustion in addition to exhaustion of remedies. That is, he contends that a Social Security claimant,to obtain judicial review of an issue, not only must obtain
a final decision on his claim for benefits, but also must spec-ify that issue in his request for review by the Council.
(Whether a claimant must exhaust issues before the ALJ isnot before us.) The Commissioner argues, in particular,
that an issue-exhaustion requirement is "an important corol-lary" of any requirement of exhaustion of remedies. Brief
for Respondent 13. We think that this is not necessarily soand that the corollary is particularly unwarranted in this
case.Initially, we note that requirements of administrative issue
exhaustion are largely creatures of statute. Marine Mammal Conservancy, Inc. v. Department of Agriculture, 134F. 3d 409, 412 (CADC 1998). Our cases addressing issue

2 Part 404 of 20 CFR (1999) applies to Title II of the Act. The regulations governing Title XVI, which can be found at 20 CFR pt. 416 (1999),
are, as relevant here, not materially different. We will therefore omit
references to the latter regulations.

108 SIMS v. APFEL

Opinion of the Court
exhaustion reflect this fact. For example, in Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U. S. 645 (1982), we held
that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review objections not raised before the National Labor Relations Board.
We so held because a statute provided that " `[n]o objection
that has not been urged before the Board . . . shall be considered by the court.' " Id., at 665 (quoting 29 U. S. C. $ 160(e)
(1982 ed.)). Our decision in FPC v. Colorado Interstate Gas
Co., 348 U. S. 492, 497-498 (1955), followed similar reasoning.
See also United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,
344 U. S. 33, 36, n. 6 (1952) (collecting statutes); Washington Assn. for Television and Children v. FCC, 712 F. 2d
677, 681-682, and n. 6 (CADC 1983) (interpreting issueexhaustion requirement in 47 U. S. C. $ 405 (1982 ed.) and
collecting statutes). Here, the Commissioner does not contend that any statute requires issue exhaustion in the request for review.

Similarly, it is common for an agency's regulations to require issue exhaustion in administrative appeals. See, e. g.,
20 CFR $ 802.211(a) (1999) (petition for review to Benefits
Review Board must "lis[t] the specific issues to be considered
on appeal"). And when regulations do so, courts reviewing
agency action regularly ensure against the bypassing of that
requirement by refusing to consider unexhausted issues.
See, e. g., South Carolina v. United States Dept. of Labor,
795 F. 2d 375, 378 (CA4 1986); Sears, Roebuck and Co. v.
FTC, 676 F. 2d 385, 398, n. 26 (CA9 1982). Yet, SSA regulations do not require issue exhaustion. (Although the question is not before us, we think it likely that the Commissioner
could adopt a regulation that did require issue exhaustion.)

It is true that we have imposed an issue-exhaustion requirement even in the absence of a statute or regulation.
But the reason we have done so does not apply here. The
basis for a judicially imposed issue-exhaustion requirement is
an analogy to the rule that appellate courts will not consider

530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

109Cite as: 530 U. S. 103 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
arguments not raised before trial courts. As the Courtexplained in

Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552 (1941):

"Ordinarily an appellate court does not give consider-ation to issues not raised below. For our procedural

scheme contemplates that parties shall come to issue inthe trial forum vested with authority to determine questions of fact. This is essential in order that parties mayhave the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues which the trial tribunal isalone competent to decide; it is equally essential in order
that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by finaldecision there of issues upon which they have had no
opportunity to introduce evidence. And the basic reasons which support this general principle applicable totrial courts make it equally desirable that parties should

have an opportunity to offer evidence on the general is-sues involved in the less formal proceedings before administrative agencies entrusted with the responsibilityof fact finding."

Id., at 556.

As we further explained in L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, courts
require administrative issue exhaustion "as a general rule"
because it is usually "appropriate under [an agency's] prac-tice" for "contestants in an adversary proceeding" before it

to develop fully all issues there. 344 U. S., at 36-37. (Wealso spoke favorably of issue exhaustion in

Unemployment
Compensation Comm'n of Alaska v. Aragon, 329 U. S. 143,154-155 (1946), without relying on any statute or regulation,

but in that case the waived issue had not been raised beforethe District Court, see

id., at 149, 155.)
But, as Hormel and L. A. Tucker Truck Lines suggest,
the desirability of a court imposing a requirement of issue
exhaustion depends on the degree to which the analogy to
normal adversarial litigation applies in a particular administrative proceeding. Cf. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S.
185, 193 (1969) (application of doctrine of exhaustion of ad530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
ministrative remedies "requires an understanding of its pur-poses and of the particular administrative scheme involved");

Salfi, 422 U. S., at 765 (same). Where the parties are ex-pected to develop the issues in an adversarial administrative
proceeding, it seems to us that the rationale for requiringissue exhaustion is at its greatest. Hormel, L. A. Tucker
Truck Lines, and Aragon each involved an adversarialproceeding. See

Hormel, supra, at 554, 556; L. A. TuckerTruck Lines, supra, at 36; Aragon v. Unemployment Compensation Comm'n of Alaska, 149 F. 2d 447, 449-452 (CA91945), aff 'd in part and rev'd in part, 329 U. S. 143 (1946).
(In Hormel, we allowed an exception to the issue-exhaustionrequirement. 312 U. S., at 560.) Where, by contrast, an administrative proceeding is not adversarial, we think the rea-sons for a court to require issue exhaustion are much weaker.
More generally, we have observed that "it is well settled thatthere are wide differences between administrative agencies
and courts," Shepard v. NLRB, 459 U. S. 344, 351 (1983), andwe have thus warned against reflexively "assimilat[ing] the
relation of . . . administrative bodies and the courts to therelationship between lower and upper courts,"

FCC v. Potts-ville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 144 (1940).

B
The differences between courts and agencies are nowheremore pronounced than in Social Security proceedings. Although "[m]any agency systems of adjudication are based toa significant extent on the judicial model of decisionmaking,"
2 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise $ 9.10,p. 103 (3d ed. 1994), the SSA is "[p]erhaps the best example
of an agency" that is not, B. Schwartz, Administrative Law469-470 (4th ed. 1994). See id., at 470 ("The most important
of [the SSA's modifications of the judicial model] is the re-placement of normal adversary procedure by . . . the `investigatory model' " (quoting Friendly, Some Kind of Hearing, 123U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1290 (1975))). Social Security proceed530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
ings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. It is theALJ's duty to investigate the facts and develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits, see Richardsonv.

Perales, 402 U. S. 389, 400-401 (1971), and the Council's
review is similarly broad. The Commissioner has no repre-sentative before the ALJ to oppose the claim for benefits,

and we have found no indication that he opposes claimants
before the Council. See generally Dubin, TorquemadaMeets Kafka: The Misapplication of the Issue Exhaustion

Doctrine to Inquisitorial Administrative Proceedings, 97Colum. L. Rev. 1289, 1301-1305, 1325-1329 (1997).

The regulations make this nature of SSA proceedings
quite clear. They expressly provide that the SSA "conduct[s] the administrative review process in an informal,
nonadversary manner." 20 CFR $ 404.900(b) (1999). They

permit--but do not require--the filing of a brief with the
Council (even when the Council grants review), $ 404.975, and
the Council's review is plenary unless it states otherwise,

$ 404.976(a). See also $ 404.900(b) ("[W]e will consider at
each step of the review process any information you present
as well as all the information in our records"). The Commissioner's involvement in the Appeals Council's decision
whether to grant review appears to be not as a litigant
opposing the claimant, but rather just as an adviser to
the Council regarding which cases are good candidates for
the Council to review pursuant to its authority to review a
case sua sponte. See $$ 404.969(b)-(c); Perales, supra, at
403. The regulations further make clear that the Council
will "evaluate the entire record," including "new and material evidence," in determining whether to grant review.

$ 404.970(b). Similarly, the notice of decision that ALJ's provide unsuccessful claimants informs them that if they request review, the Council will "consider all of [the ALJ's]
decision, even the parts with which you may agree," and that
the Council might review the decision "even if you do not
ask it to do so." App. 25-27. Finally, Form HA-520, which

530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
112 SIMS v. APFEL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the Commissioner considers adequate for the Council's pur-poses in determining whether to review a case, see

$ 422.205(a), provides only three lines for the request for re-view, and a notice accompanying the form estimates that it
will take only 10 minutes to "read the instructions, gatherthe necessary facts and fill out the form." The form therefore strongly suggests that the Council does not depend
much, if at all, on claimants to identify issues for review.Given that a large portion of Social Security claimants either

have no representation at all or are represented by non-attorneys, see Dubin,

supra, at 1294, n. 29, the lack of such
dependence is entirely understandable.Thus, the

Hormel analogy to judicial proceedings is at its
weakest in this area. The adversarial development of issues
by the parties--the "com[ing] to issue," 312 U. S., at 556--
on which that analogy depends simply does not exist. The
Council, not the claimant, has primary responsibility for
identifying and developing the issues. We therefore agree
with the Eighth Circuit that "the general rule [of issue
exhaustion] makes little sense in this particular context."
Harwood, 186 F. 3d, at 1042.

Accordingly, we hold that a judicially created issueexhaustion requirement is inappropriate. Claimants who
exhaust administrative remedies need not also exhaust issues in a request for review by the Appeals Council in order
to preserve judicial review of those issues. The judgment
of the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

In most cases, an issue not presented to an administrative
decisionmaker cannot be argued for the first time in federal
court. On this underlying principle of administrative law,
the Court is unanimous. See ante, at 108; post, at 114-115

113Cite as: 530 U. S. 103 (2000)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
(Breyer, J., dissenting). In the absence of a specific statuteor regulation requiring issue exhaustion, however, such a

rule is not always appropriate. The inquiry requires carefulexamination of "the characteristics of the particular administrative procedure provided." McCarthy v. Madigan, 503U. S. 140, 146 (1992). The Court's opinion provides such an
examination, and reaches the correct result. Accordingly,
I join Parts I and II-A of the Court's opinion, as well asits judgment. I write separately because, in my view, the

agency's failure to notify claimants of an issue exhaustionrequirement in this context is a sufficient basis for our decision. Requiring issue exhaustion is particularly inappropriate here, where the regulations and procedures of the Social
Security Administration (SSA) affirmatively suggest that
specific issues need not be raised before the Appeals Council.

Although the SSA's regulations warn claimants that completely failing to request Appeals Council review will forfeit
the right to seek judicial review, see 20 CFR $ 404.900(b)
(1999), the regulations provide no notice that claimants must
also raise specific issues before the Appeals Council to preserve them for review in federal court, see ante, at 108 (SSA
regulations do not require issue exhaustion). To the contrary, the relevant regulations and procedures indicate that
issue exhaustion before the Appeals Council is not required.
To request Appeals Council review, a claimant need not
file a brief. See $ 404.975. Rather, he can file either Form
HA-520, "Request for Review of Hearing Decision/Order,"
or "any other writing specifically requesting review."

$ 422.205(a). Form HA-520, the suggested means of requesting review, provides only three lines (roughly two
inches) for the statement of issues and grounds for appeal,
and the SSA estimates that it should take a total of 10 minutes to read the instructions, collect the relevant information, and complete the form, see 58 Fed. Reg. 28596 (1993);
ante, at 111-112. Moreover, Appeals Council review is plenary unless the Council informs the claimant otherwise in

writing, see $ 404.976(a); as the notice of decision of the Ad-ministrative Law Judge (ALJ) to petitioner stated, if she requested review before the Appeals Council, "the Council willconsider all of [the ALJ's] decision . . . . Requesting review
places the entire record of your case before the Council."See App. 26-27.

Justice Breyer concedes that these factors "might mislead the Social Security claimant" to believe that issue ex-haustion is not required.

Post, at 118 (dissenting opinion).
He nonetheless contends that this is not a problem becausethe SSA has assured the Court that it "has not invoked [issue

exhaustion] in suits brought by claimants who were unrep-resented during the Appeals Council proceedings." Brief
for Respondent 41-42. As a matter of past practice, the
agency's statement appears to be inaccurate. See Owens v.
Apfel, No. 1:98CV1442 (ND Ohio, Aug. 3, 1999), vacated on
other grounds, 205 F. 3d 1341 (CA6 2000). But even if this
stated policy were uniformly followed, I think it would be
unwise to adopt a rule that imposes different issue exhaustion obligations depending on whether claimants are represented by counsel.

In this case, the SSA told petitioner (1) that she could
request review by sending a letter or filling out a 1-page
form that should take 10 minutes to complete, (2) only that
failing to request Appeals Council review would preclude judicial review, and (3) that the Appeals Council would review
her entire case for issues. She did everything that the
agency asked of her. I would not impose any additional
requirements, and would reverse the judgment and remand
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Justice Breyer, with whom The Chief Justice, Jus-
tice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

Under ordinary principles of administrative law a reviewing court will not consider arguments that a party failed to
raise in timely fashion before an administrative agency. See

R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise $ 15.8, pp. 341-344(3d ed. 1994). As this Court explained long ago:

"[O]rderly procedure and good administration requirethat objections to the proceedings of an administrative
agency be made while it has opportunity for correctionin order to raise issues reviewable by the courts. . . .
[C]ourts should not topple over administrative decisionsunless the administrative body not only has erred but
has erred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice." L. A. Tucker Truck Lines,
supra, at 37.

Although the rule has exceptions, it applies with particular
force where resolution of the claim significantly dependsupon specialized agency knowledge or practice. In this case,

petitioner asked the reviewing court to consider argumentsof the kind that clearly fall within the general rule, namely,
whether an administrative law judge should have ordered a
further medical examination or asked different questions ofa vocational expert. No one claims that any established

exception to this ordinary "exhaustion" or "waiver" ruleapplies. See,

e. g., Bethesda Hospital Assn. v. Bowen, 485
U. S. 399, 406-407 (1988) (futility); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424U. S. 319, 329, n. 10 (1976) (constitutional claims).

The Court nonetheless concludes that the law requires anew exception. It points out that the ordinary waiver rule
as applied to administrative agencies "is an analogy to the
rule that appellate courts will not consider arguments not
raised before trial courts." Ante, at 108-109. And the
plurality argues that the agency proceedings here at issue,
unlike those before trial courts, are not adversarial proceedings. Ante, at 110-112. Although I agree with both

Breyer, J., dissenting
propositions, I do not see how they lead to the plurality'sconclusion.

There are, of course, important differences between acourt and an administrative agency, but those differences
argue in favor of, not against, applying the waiver principlehere. Cf.

SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 88-95 (1943).
As this Court has explained, the law ordinarily insists that
a party invoke administrative processes before coming tocourt in order to avoid premature interruption of the administrative process and to enable the expert agency to developthe necessary facts.

McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185,
193-194 (1969). In addition, exhaustion is required be-cause a

"complaining party may be successful in vindicating hisrights in the administrative process. If he is required
to pursue his administrative remedies, the courts maynever have to intervene. And notions of administrative
autonomy require that the agency be given a chance todiscover and correct its own errors. Finally, it is possible that frequent and deliberate flouting of adminis-trative processes could weaken the effectiveness of an
agency by encouraging people to ignore its procedures."
Id., at 195.

Certain of these reasons apply with equal force to courts andto administrative agencies. Others, such as the notion of

"administrative autonomy," apply with special force to agen-cies. None of them applies

only to courts. Practical considerations arising out of the agency's familiarity with thesubject matter as well as institutional considerations caution

strongly against courts' deciding ordinary, circumstancespecific matters that the parties have not raised before the
agency--at least where there is no good reason excusing that
failure. These considerations apply where a party fails to
give an agency an opportunity to correct its own mistake,
i. e., to a failure to raise a matter on an internal agency ap530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

peal, just as they apply to a failure ever to raise the matterat all. See

id., at 194 (exhaustion principles apply equally
where "administrative process is at an end and a party seeksjudicial review of a decision that was not appealed through

the administrative process").I would add that these ordinary "exhaustion of remedies"
rules are particularly important in Social Security cases,
where the Appeals Council is asked to process over 100,000claims each year, Social Security Administration Office of

Hearings and Appeals, Key Workload Indicators--FiscalYear 1999, p. 21 (115,151 requests for Appeals Council review), where many of those cases ultimately find their way
to federal court, Administrative Office of the United States
Courts, L. Mecham, Judicial Business of the United States
Courts: 1998 Report of the Director 144 (Table C-2) (over
14,000 cases in fiscal year 1998), and where the Social Security Act itself stresses their applicability, 42 U. S. C.

$$ 405(g), (h). See generally Shalala v. Illinois Council on
Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U. S. 1, 12-13 (2000); Weinberger
v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 765-766 (1975).

Nor, with one exception, do I see why the nonadversarial
nature of the Social Security Administration internal appellate process makes a difference. An initial ALJ proceeding
is, after all, itself nonadversarial. Ante, at 111 (although
claimant may be represented by counsel, the agency itself
has no representative present and relies upon the ALJ to
"investigate the facts and develop the arguments both for
and against granting benefits"). Yet I assume the plurality
would not forgive the requirement that a party ordinarily
must raise all relevant issues before the ALJ. Cf. Shalala,
supra, at 15 (noting statute's "nonwaivable and nonexcusable
requirement that an individual present a claim to the agency
before raising it in court").

Neither does the law in this area disfavor informal proceedings. See Hormel, 312 U. S., at 556 ("And the basic reasons which support th[e] general principle [of waiver] appli530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cable to trial courts make it equally desirable that partiesshould have an opportunity to offer evidence on the general

issues involved in the less formal proceedings before admin-istrative agencies entrusted with the responsibility of fact
finding" (emphasis added)). Considerations of time and ex-pense can favor such proceedings. And, since a Social Security claimant is permitted his own counsel or other representative if he wishes, the informality does not necessarilywork to his disadvantage. Indeed, the plurality's rule, by

interfering with the ordinary ALJ/Appeals Council/DistrictCourt order for presenting agency-specific arguments,
threatens to complicate judicial review, thereby producing
increased delay without any benefit to the agency or to the
claimants themselves.

There is, however, one exception, i. e., one way in which
the informality of the proceedings may matter. Administrative lawyers are normally aware of the basic "exhaustion of
remedies" rules, including the specific waiver principle here
at issue. But the internal appellate review proceeding's informality; the absence of a clear statement in the rules or
on the Appeals Council instructional form insisting upon the
raising of all, not just some, issues; the presence on the instructional form of just a few lines for the listing of issues;
and an attached estimate that on average an appellant can
"read the instructions, gather the necessary facts and fill out
the form" in 10 minutes, see Form HA-520--taken together--might mislead the Social Security claimant. That
is, it might make the claimant believe he need not raise every
issue before the Appeals Council. Ante, at 113-114 (O'Con-
nor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

But the Social Security Administration says that it does
not apply its waiver rule where the claimant is not represented. Brief for Respondent 41-42. And I cannot say it is
"arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion," 5 U. S. C.

by an attorney. Petitioner's lawyer should have known thebasic legal principle: namely, that, with important exceptions, a claimant must raise his objections in an internalagency appellate proceeding or forgo the opportunity later
to raise them in court. The Fifth Circuit, moreover, hadprecedent applying the general rule in this specific context.
Paul v. Shalala, 29 F. 3d 208, 210-211 (1994). And far frombeing misled by the agency's form, petitioner's lawyer followed an alternative procedure, see 20 CFR $$ 422.205(a),404.968(a) (1999), and filed 19 pages of detailed legal and factual arguments challenging the ALJ's decision. App. 51-69.In these circumstances, petitioner is accountable for her lawyer's decision--whether neglectful or by design--to reservesome of her objections for federal court.

For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals.

Syllabus

CASTILLO et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 99-658. Argued April 24, 2000--Decided June 5, 2000
Petitioners were indicted for, among other things, conspiring to murder

federal officers. At the time of their trial, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) read in
relevant part: "Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence . . . , uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment
provided for such crime . . . , be sentenced to imprisonment for five
years, . . . and if the firearm is[, e. g.,] a machinegun, . . . to imprisonment
for thirty years." The jury determined that petitioners had violated
this section, and at sentencing, the judge found that the firearms included machineguns and imposed the mandatory 30-year prison sentence. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding that statutory words such
as "machinegun" create sentencing factors, not elements of a separate
crime.

Held: Section 924(c)(1) uses the word "machinegun" (and similar words)

to state an element of a separate, aggravated crime. The statute's language, structure, context, history, and other factors helpful in determining its objectives lead to this conclusion. First, while the statute's
literal language, taken alone, appears neutral, its overall structure
strongly favors the "new crime" interpretation. The first part of

$ 924(c)(1)'s opening sentence clearly establishes the elements of the
basic federal offense of using or carrying a gun during a crime of violence, and Congress placed that element and the word machinegun in a
single sentence, not broken up with dashes or separated into subsections. That, along with the fact that the next three sentences refer
directly to sentencing, strongly suggests that the entire first sentence
defines crimes. Second, courts have not typically or traditionally used
firearm types (such as "machinegun") as sentencing factors where the
use or carrying of the firearm is itself the substantive crime. See Jones
v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 234. Third, to ask a jury, rather than a
judge, to decide whether a defendant used or carried a machinegun
would rarely complicate a trial or risk unfairness. Cf. AlmendarezTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 234-235. Fourth, the legislative
history favors interpreting $ 924(c) as setting forth elements rather than
sentencing factors. Finally, the length and severity of an added mandatory sentence that turns on the presence or absence of a "machinegun"
(or any of the other listed firearm types) weighs in favor of treating

such offense-related words as referring to an element in this context.
Such considerations make this a stronger "separate crime" case than

closely divided as to Congress' likely intent. Pp. 123-131.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.#
In this case we once again decide whether words in a federal criminal statute create offense elements (determined by
a jury) or sentencing factors (determined by a judge). See
Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999); AlmendarezTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). The statute
in question, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c) (1988 ed., Supp. V), prohibits
the use or carrying of a "firearm" in relation to a crime of
violence, and increases the penalty dramatically when the
weapon used or carried is, for example, a "machinegun."
We conclude that the statute uses the word "machinegun"
(and similar words) to state an element of a separate offense.

122 CASTILLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioners are members of the Branch-Davidian religioussect and are among those who were involved in a violent

confrontation with federal agents from the Bureau of Alco-hol, Tobacco, and Firearms near Waco, Texas, in 1993. The
case before us arises out of an indictment alleging that,among other things, petitioners conspired to murder federal
officers. At the time of petitioners' trial, the criminal stat-ute at issue (reprinted in its entirety in the Appendix,

infra)read in relevant part:

"(c)(1) Whoever, during and in relation to any crimeof violence . . . , uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of vio-lence . . . , be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,
and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle [or a] short-barreled shotgun to imprisonment for ten years, and if
the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device, oris equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, to
imprisonment for thirty years." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(1988 ed., Supp. V).

A jury determined that petitioners had violated this sectionby, in the words of the trial judge's instruction, "knowingly
us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm during and in relation to" thecommission of a crime of violence. App. 29. At sentencing,
the judge found that the "firearms" at issue included certainmachineguns (many equipped with silencers) and handgrenades that the defendants actually or constructively had pos-sessed.

United States v. Branch, Crim. No. W-93-CR-046(WD Tex., June 21, 1994), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert.

119a, 124a-125a. The judge then imposed the statute's man-datory 30-year prison sentence. Id., at 134a.

Petitioners appealed. Meanwhile, this Court decided thatthe word "use" in $ 924(c)(1) requires evidence of more than
"mere possession." Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,143 (1995). The Court of Appeals subsequently held that

123Cite as: 530 U. S. 120 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
our decision in Bailey necessitated a remand of the case todetermine whether, in Bailey's stronger sense of "use," petitioners had used "machineguns and other enhancing weap-ons." United States v. Branch, 91 F. 3d 699, 740-741 (CA5
1996). The court also concluded that statutory words suchas "machinegun" create sentencing factors, i. e., factors that
enhance a sentence, not elements of a separate crime. Id.,at 738-740. Hence, it specified that the jury "was not required" to determine whether petitioners used or carried"machineguns" or other enhanced weapons.

Id., at 740.Rather, it wrote that "[s]hould the district court find on

remand that members of the conspiracy actively employedmachineguns, it is free to reimpose the 30-year sentence."
Id., at 740-741 (emphasis added). On remand, the DistrictCourt resentenced petitioners to 30-year terms of imprisonment based on its weapons-related findings. See App. toPet. for Cert. 119a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 179
F. 3d 321 (CA5 1999).The Federal Courts of Appeals have different views as
to whether the statutory word "machinegun" (and similarwords appearing in the version of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) here
at issue) refers to a sentencing factor to be assessed bythe trial court or creates a new substantive crime to be
determined by the jury. Compare, e. g., United States v.
Alborola-Rodriguez, 153 F. 3d 1269, 1272 (CA11 1998) (sen-tencing factor), with United States v. Alerta, 96 F. 3d 1230,

1235 (CA9 1996) (element). We granted certiorari to resolvethe conflict.

II
The question before us is whether Congress intended thestatutory references to particular firearm types in $ 924(c)(1)

to define a separate crime or simply to authorize an enhancedpenalty. If the former, the indictment must identify the
firearm type and a jury must find that element proved be-yond a reasonable doubt. If the latter, the matter need not
be tried before a jury but may be left for the sentencing

124 CASTILLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
judge to decide. As petitioners note, our decision in Jonesconcluded, in a similar situation, that treating facts that lead

to an increase in the maximum sentence as a sentencing fac-tor would give rise to significant constitutional questions.
See 526 U. S., at 239-252. Here, even apart from the doc-trine of constitutional doubt, our consideration of $ 924(c)(1)'s
language, structure, context, history, and such other factors
as typically help courts determine a statute's objectives,leads us to conclude that the relevant words create a separate substantive crime.First, while the statute's literal language, taken alone,
appears neutral, its overall structure strongly favors the
"new crime" interpretation. The relevant statutory sentence says: "Whoever, during and in relation to any crime
of violence . . . , uses or carries a firearm, shall . . . be sentenced to imprisonment for five years, and if the firearm is
a . . . machinegun, . . . to imprisonment for thirty years."

$ 924(c)(1). On the one hand, one could read the words "during and in relation to a crime of violence" and "uses or carries a firearm" as setting forth two basic elements of the
offense, and the subsequent "machinegun" phrase as merely
increasing a defendant's sentence in relevant cases. But,
with equal ease, by emphasizing the phrase "if the firearm is
a . . . ," one can read the language as simply substituting the
word "machinegun" for the initial word "firearm"; thereby
both incorporating by reference the initial phrases that relate the basic elements of the crime and creating a different
crime containing one new element, i. e., the use or carrying
of a "machinegun" during and in relation to a crime of
violence.

The statute's structure clarifies any ambiguity inherent
in its literal language. The first part of the opening sentence clearly and indisputably establishes the elements of

the basic federal offense of using or carrying a gun during
and in relation to a crime of violence. See United States
v. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S. 275, 280 (1999). Congress

Opinion of the Court
placed the element "uses or carries a firearm" and the word"machinegun" in a single sentence, not broken up with

dashes or separated into subsections. Cf. Jones, supra, at232-233 (noting that the structure of the carjacking statute--a "principal paragraph" followed by "numbered subsec-tions"--makes it "look" as though the statute sets forth sentencing factors). The next three sentences of $ 924(c)(1)
(which appear after the sentence quoted above (see Appen-dix,

infra)) refer directly to sentencing: the first to recidivism, the second to concurrent sentences, the third to parole.These structural features strongly suggest that the basic job

of the entire first sentence is the definition of crimes and the
role of the remaining three is the description of factors (such
as recidivism) that ordinarily pertain only to sentencing.

We concede that there are two other structural circumstances that suggest a contrary interpretation. The title of
the entirety of $ 924 is "Penalties"; and in 1998 Congress reenacted $ 924(c)(1), separating different parts of the first sentence (and others) into different subsections, see Pub. L. 105-
386, $ 1(a)(1), 112 Stat. 3469. In this case, however, the
section's title cannot help, for Congress already has determined that at least some portion of $ 924, including $ 924(c)
itself, creates, not penalty enhancements, but entirely new
crimes. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, pp. 312-314 (1984) ("Section 924(c) sets out an offense distinct from the underlying
felony and is not simply a penalty provision"); see also Busic
v. United States, 446 U. S. 398, 404 (1980); Simpson v. United
States, 435 U. S. 6, 10 (1978). The title alone does not tell us
which are which. Nor can a new postenactment statutory
restructuring help us here to determine what Congress intended at the time it enacted the earlier statutory provision
that governs this case. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S.,
at 237 (amendments that, among other things, neither
"declare the meaning of earlier law" nor "seek to clarify an
earlier enacted general term" fail to provide interpretive
guidance).

126 CASTILLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Second, we cannot say that courts have typically or tradi-tionally used firearm types (such as "shotgun" or "machinegun") as sentencing factors, at least not in respect to an un-derlying "use or carry" crime. See

Jones, supra, at 234
("[S]tatutory drafting occurs against a backdrop . . . of tradi-tional treatment of certain categories of important facts");

see also Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 230 (recidivism "is as
typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine"). Tradi-tional sentencing factors often involve either characteristics

of the offender, such as recidivism, or special features of themanner in which a basic crime was carried out (

e. g., that the
defendant abused a position of trust or brandished a gun).
See 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a)(1) (providing that a sentencing court
"shall" consider "the history and characteristics of the defendant" and "the nature and circumstances of the offense");
see also, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 4A1.1 (Nov. 1998) (sentence based in part on
defendant's criminal history); $ 3B1.3 (upward adjustment for
abuse of position of trust); $ 5K2.6 (same for use of a dangerous instrumentality). Offender characteristics are not here
at issue. And, although one might consider the use of a machinegun, or for that matter a firearm, as a means (or a manner) in which the offender carried out the more basic underlying crime of violence, the underlying crime of violence is
not the basic crime here at issue. Rather, as we have already mentioned, the use or carrying of a firearm is itself a
separate substantive crime. See Busic, supra, at 404; Simpson, supra, at 10.

The Government argues that, conceptually speaking, one
can refer to the use of a machinegun as simply a "metho[d]"
of committing the underlying "firearms offense." Brief for
United States 23. But the difference between carrying, say,
a pistol and carrying a machinegun (or, to mention another
factor in the same statutory sentence, a "destructive device,"
i. e., a bomb) is great, both in degree and kind. And, more
importantly, that difference concerns the nature of the ele530US1 Unit: $U68 [10-22-01 18:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

127Cite as: 530 U. S. 120 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
ment lying closest to the heart of the crime at issue. It isnot surprising that numerous gun crimes make substantive

distinctions between weapons such as pistols and machine-guns. See,

e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 922(a)(4) (making it unlawful to
"transport in interstate or foreign commerce" any "destruc-tive device," "machine gun," or similar type of weapon unless

carrier is licensed or authorized, but making no such prohibition for pistols); $ 922(b)(4) (prohibiting the unauthorizedsale or delivery of "machine gun[s]" and similar weapons);

$ 922(o)(1) (making it "unlawful for any person to transferor possess a machine gun"); $ 922(v)(1) (making it illegal "to
manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault
weapon"). And we do not have any indication that legislatures or judges typically have viewed the difference between
using a pistol and using a machinegun as insubstantial. Indeed, the fact that (a) the statute at issue prescribes a mandatory penalty for using or carrying a machinegun that is
six times more severe than the punishment for using or carrying a mere "firearm," and (b) at least two Courts of Appeals have interpreted $ 924(c)(1) as setting forth a separate
"machinegun" element in relevant cases, see Alerta, 96 F. 3d,
at 1235; Judicial Committee on Model Jury Instructions for
the Eighth Circuit, Manual of Model Criminal Jury Instructions || 6.18.924C (1997 ed.), in L. Sand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin, & S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions: Criminal
Pattern Instructions, p. 8-153 (1999), points to the conclusion
that the difference between the act of using or carrying a
"firearm" and the act of using or carrying a "machinegun" is
both substantive and substantial--a conclusion that supports
a "separate crime" interpretation.

Third, to ask a jury, rather than a judge, to decide whether
a defendant used or carried a machinegun would rarely complicate a trial or risk unfairness. Cf. Almendarez-Torres,
supra, at 234-235 (pointing to potential unfairness of placing
fact of recidivism before jury). As a practical matter, in determining whether a defendant used or carried a "firearm,"

530US1 Unit: $U68 [10-22-01 18:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
128 CASTILLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
the jury ordinarily will be asked to assess the particularweapon at issue as well as the circumstances under which it

was allegedly used. Furthermore, inasmuch as the prosecu-tion's case under $ 924(c) usually will involve presenting a
certain weapon (or weapons) to the jury and arguing thatthe defendant used or carried that weapon during a crime of
violence within the meaning of the statute, the evidence is
unlikely to enable a defendant to respond both (1) "I did notuse or carry

any firearm," and (2) "even if I did, it was a
pistol, not a machinegun." Hence, a rule of law that makesit difficult to make both claims at the same time to the same

decisionmaker (the jury) will not often prejudice a defendant's case.

At the same time, a contrary rule--one that leaves the
machinegun matter to the sentencing judge--might unnecessarily produce a conflict between the judge and the jury.
That is because, under our case law interpreting the statute
here at issue, a jury may well have to decide which of several
weapons the defendant actively used, rather than passively
possessed. See Bailey, 516 U. S., at 143. And, in such a
case, the sentencing judge will not necessarily know which
"firearm" supports the jury's determination. Under these
circumstances, a judge's later, sentencing-related decision
that the defendant used the machinegun, rather than, say,
the pistol, might conflict with the jury's belief that he actively used the pistol, which factual belief underlay its firearm "use" conviction. Cf. Alerta, supra, at 1234-1235 (in
the absence of a specific jury finding regarding the type of
weapon that defendant used, it was possible that the jury did
not find "use" of a machinegun even though the judge imposed the 30-year mandatory statutory sentence). There is
no reason to think that Congress would have wanted a
judge's views to prevail in a case of so direct a factual conflict, particularly when the sentencing judge applies a lower
standard of proof and when 25 additional years in prison are
at stake.

Opinion of the Court
Fourth, the Government argues that the legislative history of the statute favors interpreting $ 924(c) as setting
forth sentencing factors, not elements. It points out that

$ 924(c), as originally enacted, provided a mandatory minimum prison term of at least one year (up to a maximum of
10 years) where a person (1) "use[d] a firearm to commit
any felony," or (2) "carr[ied] a firearm unlawfully during the
commission of any felony." Gun Control Act of 1968, $ 102,
82 Stat. 1223; see also Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970,

$ 13, 84 Stat. 1889. In 1984, Congress amended the law,
eliminating the range of permissible penalties, setting a mandatory prison term of five years, and specifying that that
term was to be added on top of the prison term related to the
underlying "crime of violence," including statutory sentences
that imposed certain other weapons-related enhancements.
See Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, $ 1005(a), 98
Stat. 2138. In 1986, Congress again amended the law by
providing for a 10-year mandatory prison term (20 years for
subsequent offenses) "if the firearm is a machinegun, or is
equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler." Firearms Owners' Protection Act, $ 104(a)(2), 100 Stat. 456. In
1988, Congress changed the provision to its here-relevant
form. Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, $ 6460, 102 Stat. 4373.

The Government finds three features of the history surrounding the enactment of the key 1986 version of the statute significant. First, the House Report spoke in terms of
a sentence, not an offense. The Report stated, for example,
that the relevant bill would create "a new mandatory prison
term of ten years for using or carrying a machine gun during
and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking
offense for a first offense, and twenty years for a subsequent
offense." H. R. Rep. No. 99-495, p. 28 (1986); see also id.,
at 2 (bill "[p]rovides a mandatory prison term of ten years
for using or carrying a machine gun during and in relation
to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense, and a

530US1 Unit: $U68 [10-22-01 18:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
130 CASTILLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
mandatory twenty years for any subsequent offense"). Sec-ond, statements of the bill's sponsors and supporters on the

floor of the House also spoke in terms of sentencing, noting,for example, that the proposed law "imposes mandatory
prison terms on those [who] would use a machinegun in thecommission of a violent offense." 132 Cong. Rec. 3809 (1986)
(statement of Rep. Hughes); see also, e. g., id., at 6843 (statement of Rep. Volkmer) (bill "includes stiff mandatory sen-tences for the use of firearms, including machineguns and

silencers, in relation to violent or drug trafficking crimes");
id., at 6850 (statement of Rep. Moore) (machinegun clause
"strengthen[s] criminal penalties"); id., at 6856 (statement of
Rep. Wirth) (proposed law "would have many benefits, including the expansion of mandatory sentencing to those persons who use a machinegun in the commission of a violent
crime"). Third, and similarly, "any discussion suggesting
the creation of a new offense" was "[n]oticeably absent" from
the legislative record. 91 F. 3d, at 739; Brief for United
States 36.

Insofar as this history may be relevant, however, it does
not significantly help the Government. That is because the
statute's basic "uses or carries a firearm" provision also dealt
primarily with sentencing, its pre-eminent feature consisting
of the creation of a new mandatory term of imprisonment
additional to that for the underlying crime of violence. Cf.
Bailey, supra, at 142 ("Section 924(c)(1) requires the imposition of specified penalties"); Smith v. United States, 508 U. S.
223, 227 (1993) (same). In this context, the absence of "separate offense" statements means little, and the "mandatory
sentencing" statements to which the Government points
show only that Congress believed that the "machinegun" and
"firearm" provisions would work similarly. Indeed, the legislative statements that discuss a new prison term for the
act of "us[ing] a machine gun," see, e. g., supra this page,
seemingly describe offense conduct, and, thus, argue against
(not for) the Government's position.

131Cite as: 530 U. S. 120 (2000)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
Fifth and finally, the length and severity of an added mandatory sentence that turns on the presence or absence of
a "machinegun" (or any of the other listed firearm types)
weighs in favor of treating such offense-related words as referring to an element. Thus, if after considering traditional
interpretive factors, we were left genuinely uncertain as to
Congress' intent in this regard, we would assume a preference for traditional jury determination of so important a factual matter. Cf. Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 619,
n. 17 (1994) (rule of lenity requires that "ambiguous criminal
statute[s] . . . be construed in favor of the accused"); United
States v. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 54 (1994) (similar); United
States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347 (1971) (same).

These considerations, in our view, make this a stronger
"separate crime" case than either Jones or AlmendarezTorres--cases in which we were closely divided as to Congress' likely intent. For the reasons stated, we believe that
Congress intended the firearm type-related words it used in

$ 924(c)(1) to refer to an element of a separate, aggravated
crime. Accordingly, we reverse the contrary determination
of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING

PRODUCTS, INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 99-536. Argued March 21, 2000--Decided June 12, 2000
Petitioner Reeves, 57, and Joe Oswalt, in his mid-thirties, were the supervisors in one of respondent's departments known as the "Hinge Room,"
which was managed by Russell Caldwell, 45. Reeves' responsibilities
included recording the attendance and hours worked by employees
under his supervision. In 1995, Caldwell informed Powe Chesnut, the
company's director of manufacturing, that Hinge Room production was
down because employees were often absent, coming in late, and leaving early. Because the monthly attendance reports did not indicate a
problem, Chesnut ordered an audit, which, according to his testimony,
revealed numerous timekeeping errors and misrepresentations by Caldwell, Reeves, and Oswalt. Chesnut and other company officials recommended to the company president, Sandra Sanderson, that Reeves and
Caldwell be fired, and she complied. Reeves filed this suit, contending
that he had been terminated because of his age in violation of the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA). At trial, respondent contended Reeves had been fired due to his failure to maintain accurate attendance records. Reeves attempted to demonstrate that this
explanation was pretext for age discrimination, introducing evidence
that he had accurately recorded the attendance and hours of the employees he supervised, and that Chesnut, whom Oswalt described as
wielding "absolute power" within the company, had demonstrated agebased animus in his dealings with him. The District Court denied respondent's motions for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 50, and the case went to the jury, which returned a
verdict for Reeves. The Fifth Circuit reversed. Although recognizing
that Reeves may well have offered sufficient evidence for the jury to
have found that respondent's explanation was pretextual, the court explained that this did not mean that Reeves had presented sufficient
evidence to show that he had been fired because of his age. In finding
the evidence insufficient, the court weighed the additional evidence of
discrimination introduced by Reeves against other circumstances surrounding his discharge, including that Chesnut's age-based comments
were not made in the direct context of Reeves' termination; there was
no allegation that the other individuals who recommended his firing

Syllabus
were motivated by age; two of those officials were over 50; all three
Hinge Room supervisors were accused of inaccurate recordkeeping; and
several of respondent's managers were over 50 when Reeves was fired.

Held:

1. A plaintiff's prima facie case of discrimination (as defined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802, and subsequent decisions), combined with sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to
reject the employer's nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision,
may be adequate to sustain a finding of liability for intentional discrimination under the ADEA. In this case, Reeves established a prima facie
case and made a substantial showing that respondent's legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation, i. e., his shoddy recordkeeping, was false.
He offered evidence showing that he had properly maintained the attendance records in question and that cast doubt on whether he was
responsible for any failure to discipline late and absent employees. In
holding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict, the Fifth Circuit ignored this evidence, as well as the evidence
supporting Reeves' prima facie case, and instead confined its review
of the evidence favoring Reeves to that showing that Chesnut had directed derogatory, age-based comments at Reeves, and that Chesnut
had singled him out for harsher treatment than younger employees.
It is therefore apparent that the court believed that only this additional
evidence of discrimination was relevant to whether the jury's verdict
should stand. In so reasoning, the court misconceived the evidentiary
burden borne by plaintiffs who attempt to prove intentional discrimination through indirect evidence. In St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,
509 U. S. 502, 511, the Court stated that, because the factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant, together with the
elements of the prima facie case, may suffice to show intentional discrimination, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will permit the
trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.
Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply
one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it can be quite persuasive. See id., at 517. In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the
falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up
a discriminatory purpose. See, e. g., Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 296.
Moreover, once the employer's justification has been eliminated, discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual
reason for its decision. Cf. Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S.
567, 577. Such a showing by the plaintiff will not always be adequate
to sustain a jury's liability finding. Certainly there will be instances
where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and

530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

135Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)
Syllabus
introduced sufficient evidence to reject the employer's explanation,
no rational factfinder could conclude that discrimination had occurred.
This Court need not--and could not--resolve all such circumstances
here. In this case, it suffices to say that a plaintiff's prima facie case,
combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted
justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the
employer unlawfully discriminated. Pp. 141-149.

2. Respondent was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law under
the particular circumstances presented here. Pp. 149-154.

(a) Rule 50 requires a court to render judgment as a matter of law
when a party has been fully heard on an issue, and there is no legally
sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party
on that issue. The standard for judgment as a matter of law under
Rule 50 mirrors the standard for summary judgment under Rule 56.
Thus, the court must review all of the evidence in the record, cf., e. g.,
Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574,
587, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,
but making no credibility determinations or weighing any evidence, e. g.,
Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U. S. 545, 554-555. The latter functions, along with the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts,
are for the jury, not the court. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477
U. S. 242, 255. Thus, although the court should review the record as a
whole, it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that
the jury is not required to believe. Pp. 149-151.

(b) In holding that the record contained insufficient evidence to
sustain the jury's verdict, the Fifth Circuit misapplied the standard of
review dictated by Rule 50. The court disregarded evidence favorable
to Reeves--the evidence supporting his prima facie case and undermining respondent's nondiscriminatory explanation--and failed to draw
all reasonable inferences in his favor. For instance, while acknowledging the potentially damning nature of Chesnut's age-related comments, the court discounted them on the ground that they were not
made in the direct context of Reeves' termination. And the court discredited Reeves' evidence that Chesnut was the actual decisionmaker
by giving weight to the fact that there was no evidence suggesting the
other decisionmakers were motivated by age. Moreover, the other
evidence on which the court relied--that Caldwell and Oswalt were
also cited for poor recordkeeping, and that respondent employed many
managers over age 50--although relevant, is certainly not dispositive.
See Furnco, supra, at 580. The ultimate question in every disparate
treatment case is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional
discrimination. Here, the District Court informed the jury that Reeves
was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his age
was a determining and motivating factor in the decision to terminate

Syllabus
him. It instructed the jury that, to show respondent's explanation was
pretextual, Reeves had to demonstrate that age discrimination, not respondent's explanation, was the real reason for his discharge. Given
that Reeves established a prima facie case, introduced enough evidence
for the jury to reject respondent's explanation, and produced additional
evidence that Chesnut was motivated by age-based animus and was
principally responsible for Reeves' firing, there was sufficient evidence
for the jury to conclude that respondent had intentionally discriminated. Pp. 151-154.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the kind and amount of evidence neces-sary to sustain a jury's verdict that an employer unlawfully

discriminated on the basis of age. Specifically, we mustresolve whether a defendant is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law when the plaintiff 's case consists exclusivelyof a prima facie case of discrimination and sufficient evidence
for the trier of fact to disbelieve the defendant's legitimate,nondiscriminatory explanation for its action. We must also
decide whether the employer was entitled to judgment as amatter of law under the particular circumstances presented
here. I

Opinion of the Court
the Hinge Room because employees were often absent andwere "coming in late and leaving early." 4

id., at 203-204.
Because the monthly attendance reports did not indicate aproblem, Chesnut ordered an audit of the Hinge Room's

timesheets for July, August, and September of that year.197 F. 3d, at 690. According to Chesnut's testimony, that
investigation revealed "numerous timekeeping errors and
misrepresentations on the part of Caldwell, Reeves, and Os-walt."

Ibid. Following the audit, Chesnut, along with
Dana Jester, vice president of human resources, and TomWhitaker, vice president of operations, recommended to

company president Sanderson that petitioner and Caldwell
be fired. Id., at 690-691. In October 1995, Sanderson followed the recommendation and discharged both petitioner
and Caldwell. Id., at 691.

In June 1996, petitioner filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, contending that he had been fired because of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
(ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq.
At trial, respondent contended that it had fired petitioner
due to his failure to maintain accurate attendance records,
while petitioner attempted to demonstrate that respondent's
explanation was pretext for age discrimination. 197 F. 3d,
at 692-693. Petitioner introduced evidence that he had accurately recorded the attendance and hours of the employees
under his supervision, and that Chesnut, whom Oswalt described as wielding "absolute power" within the company, 3
Record 80, had demonstrated age-based animus in his dealings with petitioner. 197 F. 3d, at 693.

During the trial, the District Court twice denied oral motions by respondent for judgment as a matter of law under
Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the case
went to the jury. 3 Record 183; 4 id., at 354. The court
instructed the jury that "[i]f the plaintiff fails to prove age

Opinion of the Court
terminate him, then your verdict shall be for the defendant."Tr. 7 (Jury Charge) (Sept. 12, 1997). So charged, the jury

returned a verdict in favor of petitioner, awarding him$35,000 in compensatory damages, and found that respondent's age discrimination had been "willfu[l]." 197 F. 3d, at691. The District Court accordingly entered judgment for
petitioner in the amount of $70,000, which included $35,000
in liquidated damages based on the jury's finding of will-fulness.

Ibid. Respondent then renewed its motion for
judgment as a matter of law and alternatively moved for anew trial, while petitioner moved for front pay. 2 Record,

Doc. Nos. 36, 38. The District Court denied respondent's
motions and granted petitioner's, awarding him $28,490.80 in
front pay for two years' lost income. 2 id., Doc. Nos. 40, 41.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that petitioner had not introduced sufficient evidence to
sustain the jury's finding of unlawful discrimination. 197 F.
3d, at 694. After noting respondent's proffered justification
for petitioner's discharge, the court acknowledged that petitioner "very well may" have offered sufficient evidence for
"a reasonable jury [to] have found that [respondent's] explanation for its employment decision was pretextual." Id., at
693. The court explained, however, that this was "not dispositive" of the ultimate issue--namely, "whether Reeves
presented sufficient evidence that his age motivated [respondent's] employment decision." Ibid. Addressing this
question, the court weighed petitioner's additional evidence
of discrimination against other circumstances surrounding
his discharge. See id., at 693-694. Specifically, the court
noted that Chesnut's age-based comments "were not made
in the direct context of Reeves's termination"; there was no
allegation that the two other individuals who had recommended that petitioner be fired (Jester and Whitaker) were
motivated by age; two of the decisionmakers involved in
petitioner's discharge (Jester and Sanderson) were over the
age of 50; all three of the Hinge Room supervisors were

accused of inaccurate recordkeeping; and several of respondent's management positions were filled by persons over
age 50 when petitioner was fired. Ibid. On this basis, the
court concluded that petitioner had not introduced sufficient
evidence for a rational jury to conclude that he had been
discharged because of his age. Id., at 694.

We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 985 (1999), to resolve a
conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether a plaintiff 's prima facie case of discrimination (as defined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802 (1973)), combined with sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to
reject the employer's nondiscriminatory explanation for its
decision, is adequate to sustain a finding of liability for intentional discrimination. Compare Kline v. TVA, 128 F. 3d 337

Under the ADEA, it is "unlawful for an employer . . . to failor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise

discriminate against any individual with respect to his com-pensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,
because of such individual's age." 29 U. S. C. $ 623(a)(1).When a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment, "liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age)actually motivated the employer's decision."

Hazen PaperCo. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993). That is, the plaintiff 's age must have "actually played a role in [the employer'sdecisionmaking] process and had a determinative influence
on the outcome." Ibid. Recognizing that "the questionfacing triers of fact in discrimination cases is both sensitive
and difficult," and that "[t]here will seldom be `eyewitness'testimony as to the employer's mental processes," Postal
Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983),the Courts of Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit in this
case, have employed some variant of the framework articu-lated in McDonnell Douglas to analyze ADEA claims that
are based principally on circumstantial evidence. See, e. g.,

Ackerman v. Diamond Shamrock Corp., 670 F. 2d 66, 69 (CA61982). This Court has not squarely addressed whether the

McDonnell Douglas framework, developed to assess claimsbrought under $ 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1), also applies
to ADEA actions. Because the parties do not dispute theissue, we shall assume,

arguendo, that the McDonnell Douglas framework is fully applicable here. Cf. O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U. S. 308, 311 (1996).

McDonnell Douglas and subsequent decisions have "established an allocation of the burden of production and an
order for the presentation of proof in . . . discriminatorytreatment cases." St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509
U. S. 502, 506 (1993). First, the plaintiff must establish a
prima facie case of discrimination. Ibid.; Texas Dept. of
Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 252-253
(1981). It is undisputed that petitioner satisfied this burden
here: (i) at the time he was fired, he was a member of the
class protected by the ADEA ("individuals who are at least
40 years of age," 29 U. S. C. $ 631(a)), (ii) he was otherwise
qualified for the position of Hinge Room supervisor, (iii) he
was discharged by respondent, and (iv) respondent successively hired three persons in their thirties to fill petitioner's
position. See 197 F. 3d, at 691-692. The burden therefore
shifted to respondent to "produc[e] evidence that the plaintiff
was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." Burdine, supra, at 254.
This burden is one of production, not persuasion; it "can involve no credibility assessment." St. Mary's Honor Center,
supra, at 509. Respondent met this burden by offering
admissible evidence sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that petitioner was fired because of his failure to maintain accurate attendance records. See 197 F. 3d, at 692.
Accordingly, "the McDonnell Douglas framework--with

Opinion of the Court
its presumptions and burdens"--disappeared, St. Mary's
Honor Center, supra, at 510, and the sole remaining issue
was "discrimination vel non," Aikens, supra, at 714.Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back

and forth under this framework, "[t]he ultimate burden ofpersuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally
discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with
the plaintiff." Burdine, 450 U. S., at 253. And in attempt-ing to satisfy this burden, the plaintiff--once the employer

produces sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatoryexplanation for its decision--must be afforded the "opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the
legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true
reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." Ibid.; see
also St. Mary's Honor Center, supra, at 507-508. That is,
the plaintiff may attempt to establish that he was the victim of intentional discrimination "by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence."
Burdine, supra, at 256. Moreover, although the presumption of discrimination "drops out of the picture" once the defendant meets its burden of production, St. Mary's Honor
Center, supra, at 511, the trier of fact may still consider the
evidence establishing the plaintiff 's prima facie case "and
inferences properly drawn therefrom . . . on the issue of
whether the defendant's explanation is pretextual," Burdine,
supra, at 255, n. 10.

In this case, the evidence supporting respondent's explanation for petitioner's discharge consisted primarily of
testimony by Chesnut and Sanderson and documentation
of petitioner's alleged "shoddy record keeping." 197 F. 3d,
at 692. Chesnut testified that a 1993 audit of Hinge Room
operations revealed "a very lax assembly line" where employees were not adhering to general work rules. 4 Record 197-199. As a result of that audit, petitioner was placed
on 90 days' probation for unsatisfactory performance. 197
F. 3d, at 690. In 1995, Chesnut ordered another investi530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
144 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
gation of the Hinge Room, which, according to his testi-mony, revealed that petitioner was not correctly recording

the absences and hours of employees. 4 Record 204-205.Respondent introduced summaries of that investigation
documenting several attendance violations by 12 employeesunder petitioner's supervision, and noting that each should
have been disciplined in some manner. See App. 21-24,
30-37; 4 Record 206-208. Chesnut testified that this failureto discipline absent and late employees is "extremely important when you are dealing with a union" because unevenenforcement across departments would keep the company
"in grievance and arbitration cases, which are costly, all
the time." 4 id., at 206. He and Sanderson also stated
that petitioner's errors, by failing to adjust for hours not
worked, cost the company overpaid wages. 3 id., at 100,
142, 154; 4 id., at 191-192, 213. Sanderson testified that she
accepted the recommendation to discharge petitioner because he had "intentionally falsif[ied] company pay records."
3 id., at 100.

Petitioner, however, made a substantial showing that respondent's explanation was false. First, petitioner offered
evidence that he had properly maintained the attendance
records. Most of the timekeeping errors cited by respondent involved employees who were not marked late but who
were recorded as having arrived at the plant at 7 a.m. for
the 7 a.m. shift. 3 id., at 118-123; 4 id., at 240-247, 283-285,
291, 293-294. Respondent contended that employees arriving at 7 a.m. could not have been at their workstations by
7 a.m., and therefore must have been late. 3 id., at 119-120;
4 id., at 241, 245. But both petitioner and Oswalt testified
that the company's automated timeclock often failed to
scan employees' timecards, so that the timesheets would not
record any time of arrival. 3 id., at 6, 85; 4 id., at 334-335.
On these occasions, petitioner and Oswalt would visually
check the workstations and record whether the employees
were present at the start of the shift. 3 id., at 6, 85-87;

530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

145Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
4 id., at 335. They stated that if an employee arrivedpromptly but the timesheet contained no time of arrival,

they would reconcile the two by marking "7 a.m." as theemployee's arrival time, even if the employee actually arrived at the plant earlier. Ibid. On cross-examination,Chesnut acknowledged that the timeclock sometimes malfunctioned, and that if "people were there at their work
station[s]" at the start of the shift, the supervisor "wouldwrite in seven o'clock." 4

id., at 244. Petitioner also testified that when employees arrived before or stayed after theirshifts, he would assign them additional work so they would

not be overpaid. See 197 F. 3d, at 693.

Petitioner similarly cast doubt on whether he was responsible for any failure to discipline late and absent employees.
Petitioner testified that his job only included reviewing the
daily and weekly attendance reports, and that disciplinary
writeups were based on the monthly reports, which were
reviewed by Caldwell. 3 Record 20-22; 4 id., at 335. Sanderson admitted that Caldwell, and not petitioner, was responsible for citing employees for violations of the company's attendance policy. 3 id., at 20-21, 137-138. Further, Chesnut
conceded that there had never been a union grievance or
employee complaint arising from petitioner's recordkeeping,
and that the company had never calculated the amount of
overpayments allegedly attributable to petitioner's errors.
4 id., at 267, 301. Petitioner also testified that, on the day
he was fired, Chesnut said that his discharge was due to his
failure to report as absent one employee, Gina Mae Coley, on
two days in September 1995. 3 id., at 23, 70; 4 id., at 335-
336. But petitioner explained that he had spent those days
in the hospital, and that Caldwell was therefore responsible
for any overpayment of Coley. 3 id., at 17, 22. Finally,
petitioner stated that on previous occasions that employees
were paid for hours they had not worked, the company had
simply adjusted those employees' next paychecks to correct
the errors. 3 id., at 72-73.

146 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Based on this evidence, the Court of Appeals concludedthat petitioner "very well may be correct" that "a reasonable

jury could have found that [respondent's] explanation for itsemployment decision was pretextual." 197 F. 3d, at 693.
Nonetheless, the court held that this showing, standingalone, was insufficient to sustain the jury's finding of liability:
"We must, as an essential final step, determine whether
Reeves presented sufficient evidence that his age motivated[respondent's] employment decision."

Ibid. And in making
this determination, the Court of Appeals ignored the evi-dence supporting petitioner's prima facie case and challenging respondent's explanation for its decision. See id., at
693-694. The court confined its review of evidence favoring
petitioner to that evidence showing that Chesnut had directed derogatory, age-based comments at petitioner, and
that Chesnut had singled out petitioner for harsher treatment than younger employees. See ibid. It is therefore
apparent that the court believed that only this additional evidence of discrimination was relevant to whether the jury's
verdict should stand. That is, the Court of Appeals proceeded from the assumption that a prima facie case of discrimination, combined with sufficient evidence for the trier
of fact to disbelieve the defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, is insufficient as a matter of
law to sustain a jury's finding of intentional discrimination.

In so reasoning, the Court of Appeals misconceived the
evidentiary burden borne by plaintiffs who attempt to prove
intentional discrimination through indirect evidence. This
much is evident from our decision in St. Mary's Honor Center. There we held that the factfinder's rejection of the
employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action does not compel judgment for the plaintiff. 509 U. S.,
at 511. The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated, and proof that "the employer's
proffered reason is unpersuasive, or even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish that the plaintiff 's prof530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

147Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
fered reason . . . is correct." Id., at 524. In other words,"[i]t is not enough . . . to

disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff 's explanation of intentionaldiscrimination."

Id., at 519.
In reaching this conclusion, however, we reasoned that itis
permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of
discrimination from the falsity of the employer's explanation.
Specifically, we stated:

"The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward bythe defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied

by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the ele-ments of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional
discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer theultimate fact of intentional discrimination."

Id., at 511.

Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that isprobative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite

persuasive. See id., at 517 ("[P]roving the employer's rea-son false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the
greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination"). In appropriate circumstances,the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the

explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up adiscriminatory purpose. Such an inference is consistent
with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinderis entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material
fact as "affirmative evidence of guilt." Wright v. West, 505U. S. 277, 296 (1992); see also

Wilson v. United States, 162
U. S. 613, 620-621 (1896); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 278(2),
p. 133 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1979). Moreover, once the employer's justification has been eliminated, discrimination may
well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially
since the employer is in the best position to put forth the
actual reason for its decision. Cf. Furnco Constr. Corp. v.

530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
148 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Waters, 438 U. S. 567, 577 (1978) ("[W]hen all legitimatereasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as

possible reasons for the employer's actions, it is more likelythan not the employer, who we generally assume acts with
some reason, based his decision on an impermissible con-sideration"). Thus, a plaintiff 's prima facie case, combined
with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted
justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to concludethat the employer unlawfully discriminated.

This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff will
always be adequate to sustain a jury's finding of liability.
Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient
evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational
factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.
For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment as
a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some
other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision,
or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to
whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was
abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that
no discrimination had occurred. See Aka v. Washington
Hospital Center, 156 F. 3d, at 1291-1292; see also Fisher v.
Vassar College, 114 F. 3d, at 1338 ("[I]f the circumstances
show that the defendant gave the false explanation to conceal something other than discrimination, the inference of
discrimination will be weak or nonexistent"). To hold
otherwise would be effectively to insulate an entire category of employment discrimination cases from review under
Rule 50, and we have reiterated that trial courts should not
" `treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact.' " St. Mary's Honor Center, supra, at 524
(quoting Aikens, 460 U. S., at 716).

Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in
any particular case will depend on a number of factors.
Those include the strength of the plaintiff 's prima facie

530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

149Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
case, the probative value of the proof that the employer'sexplanation is false, and any other evidence that supports

the employer's case and that properly may be considered ona motion for judgment as a matter of law. See infra, at
151-152. For purposes of this case, we need not--and couldnot--resolve all of the circumstances in which such factors would entitle an employer to judgment as a matter oflaw. It suffices to say that, because a prima facie case and
sufficient evidence to reject the employer's explanation maypermit a finding of liability, the Court of Appeals erred in
proceeding from the premise that a plaintiff must always in-troduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination.

III

A

The remaining question is whether, despite the Court ofAppeals' misconception of petitioner's evidentiary burden,

respondent was nonetheless entitled to judgment as a matterof law. Under Rule 50, a court should render judgment as
a matter of law when "a party has been fully heard on anissue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a
reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue." Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a); see also Weisgram v. Marley Co., 528
U. S. 440, 447-448 (2000). The Courts of Appeals have artic-ulated differing formulations as to what evidence a court
is to consider in ruling on a Rule 50 motion. See Venture
Technology, Inc. v. National Fuel Gas Distribution Corp.,decided with Schwimmer v. Sony Corp. of America, 459 U. S.

1007, 1009 (1982) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certio-rari). Some decisions have stated that review is limited to
that evidence favorable to the nonmoving party, see, e. g.,Aparicio v. Norfolk & Western R. Co., 84 F. 3d 803, 807 (CA6
1996); Simpson v. Skelly Oil Co., 371 F. 2d 563, 566 (CA81967), while most have held that review extends to the entire
record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant, see,

e. g., Tate v. Government Employees Ins. Co.,

530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
150 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
997 F. 2d 1433, 1436 (CA11 1993); Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411F. 2d 365, 374 (CA5 1969) (en banc).

On closer examination, this conflict seems more semanticthan real. Those decisions holding that review under Rule
50 should be limited to evidence favorable to the nonmovantappear to have their genesis in

Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336
U. S. 53 (1949). See 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2529, pp. 297-301 (2d ed. 1995) (here-inafter Wright & Miller). In

Wilkerson, we stated that "in
passing upon whether there is sufficient evidence to submitan issue to the jury we need look only to the evidence and

reasonable inferences which tend to support the case of " the
nonmoving party. 336 U. S., at 57. But subsequent decisions have clarified that this passage was referring to the
evidence to which the trial court should give credence, not
the evidence that the court should review. In the analogous
context of summary judgment under Rule 56, we have stated
that the court must review the record "taken as a whole."
Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475
U. S. 574, 587 (1986). And the standard for granting summary judgment "mirrors" the standard for judgment as a
matter of law, such that "the inquiry under each is the same."
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 250-251
(1986); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 323
(1986). It therefore follows that, in entertaining a motion
for judgment as a matter of law, the court should review all
of the evidence in the record.

In doing so, however, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may
not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.
Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U. S. 545, 554-555 (1990);
Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra, at 254; Continental Ore Co. v.
Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U. S. 690, 696, n. 6
(1962). "Credibility determinations, the weighing of the
evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the
facts are jury functions, not those of a judge." Liberty

Opinion of the Court
Lobby, supra, at 255. Thus, although the court should re-view the record as a whole, it must disregard all evidence

favorable to the moving party that the jury is not requiredto believe. See Wright & Miller 299. That is, the court
should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovantas well as that "evidence supporting the moving party that
is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extentthat that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses."
Id., at 300. B

Applying this standard here, it is apparent that respond-ent was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In
this case, in addition to establishing a prima facie case ofdiscrimination and creating a jury issue as to the falsity
of the employer's explanation, petitioner introduced addi-tional evidence that Chesnut was motivated by age-based
animus and was principally responsible for petitioner's firing.Petitioner testified that Chesnut had told him that he "was
so old [he] must have come over on the Mayflower" and,on one occasion when petitioner was having difficulty starting a machine, that he "was too damn old to do [his] job."3 Record 26. According to petitioner, Chesnut would regularly "cuss at me and shake his finger in my face." 3 id., at26-27. Oswalt, roughly 24 years younger than petitioner,
corroborated that there was an "obvious difference" inhow Chesnut treated them. 3 id., at 82. He stated that,
although he and Chesnut "had [their] differences," "it wasnothing compared to the way [Chesnut] treated Roger."
Ibid. Oswalt explained that Chesnut "tolerated quite a bit"from him even though he "defied" Chesnut "quite often," but
that Chesnut treated petitioner "[i]n a manner, as youwould . . . treat . . . a child when . . . you're angry with [him]."
3 id., at 82-83. Petitioner also demonstrated that, accordingto company records, he and Oswalt had nearly identical rates
of productivity in 1993. 3 id., at 163-167; 4 id., at 225-226.Yet respondent conducted an efficiency study of only the

Opinion of the Court
regular line, supervised by petitioner, and placed only peti-tioner on probation. 3

id., at 166-167; 4 id., at 229. Chesnut conducted that efficiency study and, after having testi-fied to the contrary on direct examination, acknowledged on

cross-examination that he had recommended that petitionerbe placed on probation following the study. 4

id., at 197-
199, 237.

Further, petitioner introduced evidence that Chesnutwas the actual decisionmaker behind his firing. Chesnut

was married to Sanderson, who made the formal decisionto discharge petitioner. 3

id., at 90, 152. Although Sanderson testified that she fired petitioner because he had "intentionally falsif[ied] company pay records," 3 id., at 100,
respondent only introduced evidence concerning the inaccuracy of the records, not their falsification. A 1994 letter
authored by Chesnut indicated that he berated other company directors, who were supposedly his coequals, about how
to do their jobs. Pl. Exh. 7, 3 Record 108-112. Moreover,
Oswalt testified that all of respondent's employees feared
Chesnut, and that Chesnut had exercised "absolute power"
within the company for "[a]s long as [he] can remember." 3
id., at 80.

In holding that the record contained insufficient evidence
to sustain the jury's verdict, the Court of Appeals misapplied
the standard of review dictated by Rule 50. Again, the
court disregarded critical evidence favorable to petitioner--
namely, the evidence supporting petitioner's prima facie
case and undermining respondent's nondiscriminatory explanation. See 197 F. 3d, at 693-694. The court also failed to
draw all reasonable inferences in favor of petitioner. For
instance, while acknowledging "the potentially damning
nature" of Chesnut's age-related comments, the court discounted them on the ground that they "were not made in the
direct context of Reeves's termination." Id., at 693. And
the court discredited petitioner's evidence that Chesnut was
the actual decisionmaker by giving weight to the fact that

530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

153Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
there was "no evidence to suggest that any of the other deci-sion makers were motivated by age."

Id., at 694. Moreover, the other evidence on which the court relied--thatCaldwell and Oswalt were also cited for poor recordkeeping,

and that respondent employed many managers over age 50--although relevant, is certainly not dispositive. See

Furnco,
438 U. S., at 580 (evidence that employer's work force was
racially balanced, while "not wholly irrelevant," was not"sufficient to

conclusively demonstrate that [the employer's]
actions were not discriminatorily motivated"). In conclud-ing that these circumstances so overwhelmed the evidence

favoring petitioner that no rational trier of fact could have
found that petitioner was fired because of his age, the Court
of Appeals impermissibly substituted its judgment concerning the weight of the evidence for the jury's.

The ultimate question in every employment discrimination
case involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether the
plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination. Given
the evidence in the record supporting petitioner, we see
no reason to subject the parties to an additional round of
litigation before the Court of Appeals rather than to resolve the matter here. The District Court plainly informed
the jury that petitioner was required to show "by a preponderance of the evidence that his age was a determining
and motivating factor in the decision of [respondent] to terminate him." Tr. 7 (Jury Charge) (Sept. 12, 1997). The
court instructed the jury that, to show that respondent's
explanation was a pretext for discrimination, petitioner
had to demonstrate "1, that the stated reasons were not the
real reasons for [petitioner's] discharge; and 2, that age discrimination was the real reason for [petitioner's] discharge."
Ibid. (emphasis added). Given that petitioner established a
prima facie case of discrimination, introduced enough evidence for the jury to reject respondent's explanation, and
produced additional evidence of age-based animus, there was
sufficient evidence for the jury to find that respondent had

intentionally discriminated. The District Court was there-fore correct to submit the case to the jury, and the Court

of Appeals erred in overturning its verdict.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
The Court today holds that an employment discrimination
plaintiff may survive judgment as a matter of law by submit-ting two categories of evidence: first, evidence establishing

a "prima facie case," as that term is used in McDonnell
Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802 (1973); and second,
evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude thatthe employer's proffered explanation for its actions was false.

Because the Court of Appeals in this case plainly, and erroneously, required the plaintiff to offer some evidence beyond
those two categories, no broader holding is necessary to support reversal.

I write separately to note that it may be incumbent on the
Court, in an appropriate case, to define more precisely the
circumstances in which plaintiffs will be required to submit
evidence beyond these two categories in order to survive a
motion for judgment as a matter of law. I anticipate that
such circumstances will be uncommon. As the Court notes,
it is a principle of evidence law that the jury is entitled to
treat a party's dishonesty about a material fact as evidence
of culpability. Ante, at 147. Under this commonsense principle, evidence suggesting that a defendant accused of illegal
discrimination has chosen to give a false explanation for its
actions gives rise to a rational inference that the defendant could be masking its actual, illegal motivation. Ibid.
Whether the defendant was in fact motivated by discrimination is of course for the finder of fact to decide; that is the
lesson of St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502
(1993). But the inference remains--unless it is conclusively

demonstrated, by evidence the district court is required tocredit on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, see

ante, at 151, that discrimination could not have been the de-fendant's true motivation. If such conclusive demonstrations are (as I suspect) atypical, it follows that the ultimatequestion of liability ordinarily should not be taken from
the jury once the plaintiff has introduced the two categoriesof evidence described above. Because the Court's opinion
leaves room for such further elaboration in an appropriatecase, I join it in full.

RAMDASS v. ANGELONE, DIRECTOR, VIRGINIADEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 99-7000. Argued April 18, 2000--Decided June 12, 2000
Petitioner Ramdass was sentenced to death in Virginia for the murder

of Mohammed Kayani. Under Virginia law, a conviction does not become final until the jury returns a verdict and, some time thereafter,
the judge enters a final judgment of conviction. At the time of the
Kayani sentencing trial, a final judgment had been entered against
Ramdass for an armed robbery at a Pizza Hut restaurant and a jury
had found him guilty of an armed robbery at a Domino's Pizza restaurant, but no final judgment had been entered. The prosecutor argued
future dangerousness at the Kayani sentencing trial, claiming that Ramdass would commit further violent crimes if released. The jury recommended death. After final judgment was entered on the Domino's
conviction, the Kayani judge held a hearing to consider whether to
impose the recommended sentence. Arguing for a life sentence, Ramdass claimed that his prior convictions made him ineligible for parole
under Virginia's three-strikes law, which denies parole to a person convicted of three separate felony offenses of murder, rape, or armed
robbery, which were not part of a common act, transaction, or scheme.
The court sentenced Ramdass to death, and the Virginia Supreme Court
affirmed. On remand from this Court, the Virginia Supreme Court
again affirmed the sentence, declining to apply the holding of Simmons
v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154, that a jury considering imposing death
should be told if the defendant is parole ineligible under state law.
The court concluded that Ramdass was not parole ineligible when the
jury was considering his sentence because the Domino's crime, in which
no final judgment had been entered, did not count as a conviction for
purposes of the three-strikes law. Ultimately, Ramdass sought federal
habeas relief. The District Court granted his petition, but the Court
of Appeals reversed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
187 F. 3d 396, affirmed.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Thomas, concluded that Ramdass was not entitled to a
jury instruction on parole ineligibility under Virginia's three-strikes
law. Pp. 165-178.

Syllabus
(a) Whether Ramdass may obtain relief under Simmons is governed
by the habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1), which forbids relief unless a state-court adjudication of a federal claim is contrary to,
or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as
determined by this Court. The Virginia Supreme Court's ruling here
was neither contrary to Simmons nor an unreasonable application of its
rationale. Pp. 165-166.

(b) Simmons created a workable rule. The parole-ineligibility instruction is required only when, assuming the jury fixes a life sentence,
the defendant is ineligible for parole under state law. The instruction
was required in Simmons because it was legally accurate. However,
that is not the case here, for the Virginia Supreme Court's authoritative determination is that Ramdass was not parole ineligible when the
jury considered his sentence. Material differences exist between this
case and Simmons: The Simmons defendant had conclusively established his parole ineligibility at the time of sentencing and Ramdass had
not; a sentence had been imposed for the Simmons defendant's prior
conviction and he pleaded guilty, while the Domino's case was tried to a
jury and no sentence had been imposed; and the grounds for challenging
a guilty plea in the Simmons defendant's State are limited. Ramdass'
additional attempts to equate his case with Simmons do not refute the
critical point that he was not parole ineligible as a matter of state law
at the time of his sentencing trial. Pp. 166-169.

(c) Extending Simmons to cover situations where it looks like a
defendant will turn out to be parole ineligible is neither necessary nor
workable, and the Virginia Supreme Court was not unreasonable in
refusing to do so. Doing so would require courts to evaluate the probability of future events in cases where a three-strikes law is the issue.
The States are entitled to some latitude in this field, for the admissibility of evidence at capital sentencing is an issue left to them, subject
to federal requirements. Extending Simmons would also give rise to
litigation on a peripheral point, since parole eligibility may be only indirectly related to the circumstances of the crime being considered
and is of uncertain materiality. The State is entitled to some deference
in determining the best reference point for making the ineligibility
determination. Virginia's rule using judgment in the Domino's case to
determine parole ineligibility is not arbitrary by virtue of Virginia's also
allowing the prosecutor to introduce evidence of Ramdass' unadjudicated prior bad acts to show future dangerousness. Public opinion
polls showing the likely effect of parole ineligibility on jury verdicts cast
no doubt upon the State's rule. Ramdass' claim is based on the contention that it is inevitable that a judgment of conviction would be entered
for his Domino's crime, but it is a well-established practice for Virginia

Syllabus
courts to consider and grant post-trial motions to set aside jury verdicts.
Ramdass' time to file such a motion in the Domino's case had not expired when the jury was deliberating the Kayani sentence. Ramdass
complains that using the entry of judgment rather than the jury verdict
to determine finality is arbitrary because the availability of postjudgment relief renders uncertain the judgment's finality and reliability.
However, States may take different approaches, and a judgment is the
usual measure of finality in the trial court. Ramdass' conduct in this
litigation confirms the conclusion reached here. He did not indicate at
trial that he thought he would never be paroled or mention the threestrikes law at trial, and it appears he did not argue that his parole
ineligibility should have been determined based on the date of the
Domino's verdict until the Virginia Supreme Court declared that another one of his convictions did not count as a strike. Pp. 169-177.

(d) State courts remain free to adopt rules that go beyond the Constitution's minimum requirements. In fact, Virginia allows a Simmons
instruction even where future dangerousness is not at issue; and since
it has also eliminated parole for capital defendants sentenced to life in
prison, all capital defendants now receive the instruction. Pp. 177-178.

Justice O'Connor agreed that Ramdass is not entitled to habeas
relief. The standard of review applicable in federal habeas cases is
narrower than that applicable on direct review. Whether a defendant is entitled to inform the jury that he is parole ineligible is ultimately
a federal law question, but this Court looks to state law to determine
the defendant's parole status. Under Virginia law, Ramdass was not
parole ineligible. Were the entry of judgment a purely ministerial act
under Virginia law, the facts in this case would have been materially
indistinguishable from those in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S.
154. Such was not the case here, however, for, under Virginia law, a
guilty verdict does not inevitably lead to the entry of a judgment order.
Consequently, the Virginia Supreme Court's decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Simmons. Pp. 178-181.

Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join.

Petitioner received a death sentence in the Commonwealthof Virginia for murder in the course of robbery. On review

of a decision denying relief in federal habeas corpus, heseeks to set aside the death sentence in reliance on Simmons
v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994). He argues thejury should have been instructed of his parole ineligibility
based on prior criminal convictions. We reject his claimsand conclude Simmons is inapplicable to petitioner since
he was not parole ineligible when the jury considered hiscase, nor would he have been parole ineligible by reason of
a conviction in the case then under consideration by the jury.He is not entitled to the relief he seeks.

Sometime after midnight on September 2, 1992, Mo-hammed Kayani was working as a convenience store clerk.

Petitioner Bobby Lee Ramdass and his accomplices enteredthe store and forced the customers to the floor at gunpoint.
While petitioner ordered Kayani to open the store's safe,accomplices took the customers' wallets, money from the
cash registers, cigarettes, Kool Aid, and lottery tickets.When Kayani fumbled in an initial attempt to open the
safe, petitioner squatted next to him and yelled at him toopen the safe. At close range he held the gun to Kayani's
head and pulled the trigger. The gun did not fire at first;but petitioner tried again and shot Kayani just above his
left ear, killing him. Petitioner stood over the body andlaughed. He later inquired of an accomplice why the customers were not killed as well.

160 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The murder of Kayani was no isolated incident. Just fourmonths earlier, after serving time for a 1988 robbery conviction, petitioner had been released on parole and almostat once engaged in a series of violent crimes. In July,
petitioner committed a murder in Alexandria, Virginia. OnAugust 25, petitioner and three accomplices committed an
armed robbery of a Pizza Hut restaurant, abducting one of
the victims. Four days later, petitioner and an accomplicepistol-whipped and robbed a hotel clerk. On the afternoon

of August 30, petitioner and two accomplices robbed a taxi-cab driver, Emanuel Selassie, shot him in the head, and left
him for dead. Through major surgery and after weeks of
unconsciousness, Selassie survived. The same day as the
Selassie shooting, petitioner committed an armed robbery
of a Domino's Pizza restaurant.

The crime spree ended with petitioner's arrest on September 11, 1992, nine days after the Kayani shooting. Petitioner faced a series of criminal prosecutions. For reasons
we discuss later, the sequence of events in the criminal proceedings is important to the claim petitioner makes in this
Court. Under Virginia law, a conviction does not become
final in the trial court until two steps have occurred. First,
the jury must return a guilty verdict; and, second, some time
thereafter, the judge must enter a final judgment of conviction and pronounce sentence, unless he or she determines to set the verdict aside. On December 15, 1992, a jury
returned a guilty verdict based on the Pizza Hut robbery.
On January 7, 1993, a jury rendered a guilty verdict for the
Domino's robbery; on January 22, the trial court entered a
judgment of conviction on the Pizza Hut verdict; on January
30, the sentencing phase of the Kayani murder trial was completed, with the jury recommending that petitioner be sentenced to death for that crime; and on February 18, the trial
court entered judgment on the Domino's verdict. After his
capital trial for the Kayani killing, petitioner pleaded guilty
to the July murder in Alexandria and to the shooting of

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Selassie. Thus, at the time of the capital sentencing trial, afinal judgment of conviction had been entered for the Pizza

Hut crime; a jury had found petitioner guilty of the Domino'scrime, but the trial court had not entered a final judgment
of conviction; and charges in the Alexandria murder had notyet been filed, and indeed petitioner had denied any role in
the crime until sometime after the sentencing phase in the
instant case.At the sentencing phase of the capital murder trial for

Kayani's murder, the Commonwealth submitted the case tothe jury using the future dangerousness aggravating circumstance, arguing that the death penalty should be imposed
because Ramdass "would commit criminal acts of violence
that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society."
Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-264.4(C) (1993). Petitioner countered
by arguing that he would never be released from jail, even
if the jury refused to sentence him to death. For this proposition, Ramdass relied on the sentences he would receive for
the crimes detailed above, including those which had yet to
go to trial and those (such as the Domino's crime) for which
no judgment had been entered and no sentence had been
pronounced. Counsel argued petitioner "is going to jail for
the rest of his life. . . . I ask you to give him life. Life, he
will never see the light of day . . . ." App. 85. At another
point, counsel argued: " `Ramdass will never be out of jail.
Your sentence today will insure that if he lives to be a hundred and twenty two, he will spend the rest of his life in
prison.' " 187 F. 3d 396, 400 (CA4 1999). These arguments
drew no objection from the Commonwealth.

The prosecution's case at sentencing consisted of an account of some of Ramdass' prior crimes, including crimes for
which Ramdass had not yet been charged or tried, such as
the shooting of Selassie and the assault of the hotel clerk.
Investigators of Ramdass' crimes, an accomplice, and two
victims provided narrative descriptions of the crime spree
preceding the murder, and their evidence of those crimes

was the basis for the prosecution's case in the sentencinghearing. Evidence of the crime spree did not depend on formal convictions for its admission. The prosecutor, more-over, did not mention the Domino's crime in his opening
statement and did not introduce evidence of the crime duringthe Commonwealth's case in chief. App. 8-47. Ramdass
himself first injected the Domino's crime into the sentencing
proceeding, testifying in response to his own lawyer's ques-tions about his involvement in the crime. In closing, the

prosecutor argued that Ramdass could not live by the rulesof society "either here or in prison."

Id., at 86.
During the juror deliberations, the jury sent a note to the
judge asking: " `[I]f the Defendant is given life, is there a
possibility of parole at some time before his natural death?' "
Id., at 88. Petitioner's counsel suggested the following response: " ` "You must not concern yourself with matters that
will occur after you impose your sentence, but you may impose [sic] that your sentence will be the legal sentence imposed in the case." ' " Id., at 89. The trial judge refused
the instruction, relying on the then-settled Virginia law
that parole is not an appropriate factor for the jury to consider, and informed the jury that they " `are not to concern
[them]selves with what may happen afterwards.' " Id., at
91. The next day the jury returned its verdict recommending the death sentence.

Virginia law permitted the judge to give a life sentence
despite the jury's recommendation; and two months later
the trial court conducted a hearing to decide whether the
jury's recommended sentence would be imposed. During
the interval between the jury trial and the court's sentencing
hearing, final judgment had been entered on the Domino's
conviction. At the court's sentencing hearing, Ramdass'
counsel argued for the first time that his prior convictions
rendered him ineligible for parole under Virginia's threestrikes law, which denies parole to a person convicted of
three separate felony offenses of murder, rape, or armed

robbery, which were not part of a common act, transaction,or scheme. Va. Code Ann. $ 53.1-151(B1) (1993). Petitioner's counsel also stated that three jurors contacted by peti-tioner's counsel after the verdict expressed the opinion that
a life sentence would have been imposed had they knownRamdass would not be eligible for parole. These jurors
were not identified by name, were not produced for testimony, and provided no formal or sworn statements support-ing defense counsel's representations. App. 95. Rejecting

petitioner's arguments for a life sentence, the trial courtsentenced petitioner to death.

Ramdass appealed, arguing that his parole ineligibility, as
he characterized it, should have been disclosed to the jury.
The Virginia Supreme Court rejected the claim, applying its
settled law "that a jury should not hear evidence of parole
eligibility or ineligibility because it is not a relevant consideration in fixing the appropriate sentence." Ramdass v.
Commonwealth, 246 Va. 413, 426, 437 S. E. 2d 566, 573 (1993).
The court did not address whether Ramdass had waived the
claim by failing to mention the three-strikes law at trial or
by not objecting to the instructions that were given. Other
Virginia capital defendants in Ramdass' position had been
raising the issue at trial, despite existing Virginia law to the
contrary. E. g., Mickens v. Commonwealth, 249 Va. 423,
424, 457 S. E. 2d 9, 10 (1995); O'Dell v. Thompson, 502 U. S.
995, 996-997, n. 3 (1991) (Blackmun, J., respecting denial of
certiorari); Mueller v. Commonwealth, 244 Va. 386, 408-409,
422 S. E. 2d 380, 394 (1992); Eaton v. Commonwealth, 240
Va. 236, 244, 397 S. E. 2d 385, 390 (1990).

From the State Supreme Court's denial of his claims on
direct review, Ramdass filed a petition for a writ of certiorari
in this Court. One of his arguments was that the judge
should have instructed the jury that he was ineligible for
parole. While the petition was pending, we decided Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), which held that
where a defendant was parole ineligible under state law at

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
the time of the jury's death penalty deliberations, the juryshould have been informed of that fact. We granted Ramdass' petition for certiorari and remanded the case for re-consideration in light of

Simmons. Ramdass v. Virginia,
512 U. S. 1217 (1994).On remand, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed Ramdass' death sentence, concluding that Simmons applied only
if Ramdass was ineligible for parole when the jury was con-sidering his sentence.

Ramdass v. Commonwealth, 248 Va.
518, 450 S. E. 2d 360 (1994). The court held that Ramdasswas not parole ineligible when the jury considered his sentence because the Kayani murder conviction was not his
third conviction for purposes of the three-strikes law. In a
conclusion not challenged here, the court did not count the
1988 robbery conviction as one which qualified under the
three-strikes provision. (It appears the crime did not involve use of a weapon.) The court also held the Domino's
robbery did not count as a conviction because no final judgment had been entered on the verdict. Thus, the only conviction prior to the Kayani murder verdict counting as a
strike at the time of the sentencing trial was for the Pizza
Hut robbery. Unless the three-strikes law was operative,
Ramdass was eligible for parole because, at the time of his
trial, murder convicts became eligible for parole in 25 years.
Va. Code Ann. $ 53.1-151(C) (1993). Under state law, then,
Ramdass was not parole ineligible at the time of sentencing;
and the Virginia Supreme Court declined to apply Simmons
to reverse Ramdass' sentence.

Ramdass filed a petition for a writ of certiorari contending
that the Virginia Supreme Court misapplied Simmons, and
we denied certiorari. Ramdass v. Virginia, 514 U. S. 1085
(1995). After an unsuccessful round of postconviction proceedings in Virginia courts, Ramdass sought habeas corpus
relief in federal court. He argued once more that the Virginia Supreme Court erred in not applying Simmons. The
District Court granted relief. 28 F. Supp. 2d 343 (ED Va.

1998). The Court of Appeals reversed. 187 F. 3d, at 407.When Ramdass filed a third petition for a writ of certiorari,

we stayed his execution, 528 U. S. 1015 (1999), and grantedcertiorari, 528 U. S. 1068 (2000). Ramdass contends he was
entitled to a jury instruction of parole ineligibility under theVirginia three-strikes law. Rejecting the contention, we
now affirm. II

Petitioner bases his request for habeas corpus relief onSimmons, supra. The premise of the Simmons case was
that, under South Carolina law, the capital defendant wouldbe ineligible for parole if the jury were to vote for a life
sentence. Future dangerousness being at issue, the plural-ity opinion concluded that due process entitled the defendant
to inform the jury of parole ineligibility, either by a juryinstruction or in arguments by counsel. In our later decision in O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 166 (1997), weheld that

Simmons created a new rule for purposes ofTeague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). O'Dell reaffirmed that

the States have some discretion in determining the extentto which a sentencing jury should be advised of probable
future custody and parole status in a future dangerousnesscase, subject to the rule of Simmons. We have not extended Simmons to cases where parole ineligibility has notbeen established as a matter of state law at the time of the
jury's future dangerousness deliberations in a capital case.Whether Ramdass may obtain relief under

Simmons isgoverned by the habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1)

(1994 ed., Supp. III), which forbids relief unless the state-court adjudication of a federal claim "resulted in a decision
that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-tion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by
the Supreme Court of the United States." As explained in
Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412-413 (2000), a state court acts con-trary to clearly established federal law if it applies a legal rule

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
that contradicts our prior holdings or if it reaches a different
result from one of our cases despite confronting indistinguishable facts. The statute also authorizes federal habeas
corpus relief if, under clearly established federal law, a state
court has been unreasonable in applying the governing legal
principle to the facts of the case. A state determination
may be set aside under this standard if, under clearly established federal law, the state court was unreasonable in refusing to extend the governing legal principle to a context in
which the principle should have controlled. The Virginia
Supreme Court's ruling in the case before us was neither
contrary to Simmons nor an unreasonable application of its
rationale.

Petitioner contends his case is indistinguishable from Simmons, making the Virginia Supreme Court's refusal to grant
relief contrary to that case. In his view the Pizza Hut conviction and the Domino's guilty verdict classified him, like
the Simmons petitioner, as ineligible for parole when the
jury deliberated his sentence. He makes this argument
even though the Virginia Supreme Court declared that he
was not parole ineligible at the time of the sentencing trial
because no judgment of conviction had been entered for the
Domino's crime.

Simmons created a workable rule. The parole-ineligibility
instruction is required only when, assuming the jury fixes the
sentence at life, the defendant is ineligible for parole under
state law. 512 U. S., at 156 (plurality opinion) (limiting holding to situations where "state law prohibits the defendant's
release on parole"); id., at 165, n. 5 (relying on fact that Simmons was "ineligible for parole under state law"); id., at 176
(O'Connor, J., concurring) (citing state statutes to demonstrate that for Simmons "the only available alternative sentence to death . . . was life imprisonment without [the] possibility of parole"). The instruction was required in Simmons
because it was agreed that "an instruction informing the jury

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
that petitioner is ineligible for parole is legally accurate."
Id., at 166.

In this case, a Simmons instruction would not have beenaccurate under the law; for the authoritative determination

of the Virginia Supreme Court is that petitioner was not inel-igible for parole when the jury considered his sentence. In
Simmons the defendant had "conclusively established" his
parole ineligibility at the time of sentencing. Id., at 158.Ramdass had not. In

Simmons, a sentence had been imposed for the defendant's prior conviction and he pleadedguilty. Ramdass' Domino's case was tried to a jury and no

sentence had been imposed. While a South Carolina defendant might challenge a guilty plea, the grounds for doing
so are limited, see Rivers v. Strickland, 264 S. C. 121, 124,
213 S. E. 2d 97, 98 (1975) ("The general rule is that a plea of
guilty, voluntarily and understandingly made, constitutes a
waiver of nonjurisdictional defects and defenses, including
claims of violation of constitutional rights prior to the plea");
see also Whetsell v. South Carolina, 276 S. C. 295, 296, 277
S. E. 2d 891, 892 (1981), and, in all events, such a motion
cannot seek to set aside a jury verdict or be considered a
post-trial motion, for there was no trial or jury verdict in
the case. 512 U. S., at 156. Simmons further does not indicate that South Carolina law considered a guilty plea and
sentence insufficient to render the defendant parole ineligible upon conviction of another crime. Material differences
exist between this case and Simmons, and the Virginia Supreme Court's decision is not contrary to the rule Simmons
announced.

Ramdass makes two arguments to equate his own case
with Simmons. Neither contention refutes the critical
point that he was not ineligible for parole as a matter of state
law at the time of his sentencing trial. First he contends
that the Simmons petitioner was not parole ineligible at the
time of his sentencing trial. According to Ramdass, a South
Carolina prisoner is not parole ineligible until the State

168 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Board of Probation makes a formal determination of parole
ineligibility and the state board had not done so when the
capital sentencing jury fixed Simmons' penalty. This argument is without merit. Virginia does not argue that Ramdass was parole eligible because a parole board had not
acted. It argues Ramdass was still parole eligible at the
time of the sentencing trial by reason of his then criminal
record as it stood under state law. We further note that
Ramdass bases his argument on briefs and the record filed
in Simmons. A failure by a state court to glean information
from the record of a controlling decision here and to refine
further holdings accordingly does not necessarily render the
state-court ruling "contrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by
the Supreme Court of the United States." $ 2254(d)(1). On
review of state decisions in habeas corpus, state courts are
responsible for a faithful application of the principles set out
in the controlling opinion of the Court.

Second, Ramdass argues Simmons allowed a prisoner to
obtain a parole-ineligibility instruction even though "hypothetical future events" (such as escape, pardon, or a change
in the law) might mean the prisoner would, at some point,
be released from prison. This argument is likewise of no
assistance to Ramdass. The Simmons petitioner was, as a
matter of state law, ineligible for parole at the time of the
sentencing trial. The State was left to argue that future
events might change this status or otherwise permit Simmons to reenter society. Id., at 166. Ramdass' situation is
just the opposite. He was eligible for parole at the time of
his sentencing trial and is forced to argue that a hypothetical
future event (the entry of judgment on the Domino's convictions) would render him parole ineligible under state law,
despite his current parole-eligible status. This case is not
parallel to Simmons on the critical point. The differences
between the cases foreclose the conclusion that the Virginia

169Cite as: 530 U. S. 156 (2000)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Supreme Court's decision denying Ramdass relief was con-trary to

Simmons.
Ramdass contends the Virginia Supreme Court neverthe-less was bound to extend

Simmons to cover his circumstances. He urges us to ignore the legal rules dictating hisparole eligibility under state law in favor of what he calls a

functional approach, under which, it seems, a court evaluates
whether it looks like the defendant will turn out to be paroleineligible. We do not agree that the extension of

Simmons
is either necessary or workable; and we are confident in say-ing that the Virginia Supreme Court was not unreasonable

in refusing the requested extension.

Simmons applies only to instances where, as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the
appropriate sentence is life in prison. Petitioner's proposed
rule would require courts to evaluate the probability of future events in cases where a three-strikes law is the issue.
Among other matters, a court will have to consider whether
a trial court in an unrelated proceeding will grant postverdict relief, whether a conviction will be reversed on appeal, or whether the defendant will be prosecuted for fully
investigated yet uncharged crimes. If the inquiry is to include whether a defendant will, at some point, be released
from prison, even the age or health of a prisoner facing a
long period of incarceration would seem relevant. The possibilities are many, the certainties few. If the Simmons rule
is extended beyond when a defendant is, as a matter of state
law, parole ineligible at the time of his trial, the State might
well conclude that the jury would be distracted from the
other vital issues in the case. The States are entitled to
some latitude in this field, for the admissibility of evidence
at capital sentencing was, and remains, an issue left to the
States, subject of course to federal requirements, especially,
as relevant here, those related to the admission of mitigating
evidence. Id., at 168; California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992
(1983).

170 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
By eliminating Simmons' well-understood rule, petitioner's approach would give rise to litigation on a peripheral
point. Parole eligibility may be unrelated to the circumstances of the crime the jury is considering or the character
of the defendant, except in an indirect way. Evidence of potential parole ineligibility is of uncertain materiality, as it
can be overcome if a jury concludes that even if the defendant might not be paroled, he may escape to murder again, see
Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244 (2000); he may be pardoned; he
may benefit from a change in parole laws; some other change
in the law might operate to invalidate a conviction once
thought beyond review, see Bousley v. United States, 523
U. S. 614 (1998); or he may be no less a risk to society in
prison, see United States v. Battle, 173 F. 3d 1343 (CA11
1999), cert. denied, 529 U. S. 1022 (2000). The Virginia Supreme Court had good reason not to extend Simmons beyond the circumstances of that case, which included conclusive proof of parole ineligibility under state law at the time
of sentencing.

A jury evaluating future dangerousness under Virginia
law considers all of the defendant's recent criminal history,
without being confined to convictions. As we have pointed
out, the Domino's Pizza conviction was not even a part of
the prosecution's main case in the sentencing proceedings.
Parole ineligibility, on the other hand, does relate to formal
criminal proceedings. The Commonwealth is entitled to
some deference, in the context of its own parole laws, in determining the best reference point for making the ineligibility determination. Given the damaging testimony of the
criminal acts in the spree Ramdass embarked upon in the
weeks before the Kayani murder, it is difficult to say just
what weight a jury would or should have given to the possibility of parole; and it was not error for the Commonwealth
to insist upon an accurate assessment of the parole rules by
using a trial court judgment as the measuring point.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
As we have explained, the dispositive fact in Simmons
was that the defendant conclusively established his parole
ineligibility under state law at the time of his trial. Ramdass did not because of the judicial determination Virginia
uses to establish a conviction's finality under its parole law.
We note that Virginia's rule using judgment in the Domino's
case to determine parole ineligibility is not arbitrary by virtue of Virginia's also allowing evidence of the defendant's
prior criminal history. To demonstrate Ramdass' evil character and his propensity to commit violent acts in the future,
the prosecutor used Ramdass' prior criminal conduct, supported in some cases (although not in the Domino's case) by
evidence in the form of the resulting jury verdicts. Virginia
law did not require a guilty verdict, a criminal judgment, or
the exhaustion of an appeal before prior criminal conduct
could be introduced at trial. Virginia law instead permitted
unadjudicated prior bad acts to be introduced as evidence at
trial. See Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 487, 331
S. E. 2d 422, 435 (1985). For example, the prosecutor was
permitted to use the shooting of Selassie in aggravation,
even though no verdict had been rendered in that case. The
prosecutor likewise asked Ramdass about the July murder
in Alexandria. App. 64. (Despite Ramdass' sworn denial,
he pleaded guilty to the crime after being sentenced to death
in this case.) The guilty verdict of the jury in the Domino's
case, therefore, was not a necessary prerequisite to the admissibility of the conduct underlying the Domino's crime.
Ramdass, furthermore, could not object to the Commonwealth's use of the Domino's crime at sentencing, for it was
he who introduced the evidence. The Commonwealth did
not mention the crime in its opening statement and did not
present evidence of the crime in its case in chief. Ramdass
used the Domino's crime to argue he would never be out of
jail; and he overused the crime even for that purpose.
Counsel advised the jury the Domino's crime would result in

172 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
"[a]t least another life sentence," when in fact the sentenceimposed was for 18 years.

Id., at 50.
The various public opinion polls to which we are pointedcast no doubt upon the rule adopted by the Commonwealth.

We are referred, for example, to a poll whose result is re-ported in Paduano & Smith, Deathly Errors: Juror Misperceptions Concerning Parole in the Imposition of the Death
Penalty, 18 Colum. Human Rights L. Rev. 211 (1987). Thepoll is said to permit the conclusion that 67% of potential

jurors would be more likely to give a life sentence instead ofdeath if they knew the defendant had to serve at least 25
years in prison before being parole eligible.

The poll is not a proper consideration in this Court. Mere
citation of a law review to a court does not suffice to introduce into evidence the truth of the hearsay or the so-called
scientific conclusions contained within it. Had the creators
of the poll taken the stand in support of the poll's application to Ramdass' case, the poll likely would have been demonstrated to be inadmissible. The poll's reporters concede
the poll was limited in scope, surveying 40 individuals eligible for jury service. Id., at 221. The poll was limited to
jurors in one Georgia county, jurors who would never serve
on a Fairfax County, Virginia, jury. The poll was supervised
by the Southern Prisoners' Defense Committee, a group
having an interest in obtaining life sentences for the inmates
it represents. The poll was conducted in the context of ongoing litigation of a particular defendant's death sentence.
The article makes no reference to any independent source
confirming the propriety of the sampling methodology. The
poll asked but four questions. It failed to ask those who
were surveyed why they held the views that they did or to
ascertain their reaction to evidence supplied by the prosecution designed to counter the parole information. No data
indicate the questions were framed using methodology employed by reliable pollsters. No indication exists regarding the amount of time participants were given to answer.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The reporters of the poll contend other similar, limited stud-ies support the results, yet those studies were conducted

over the telephone "by defense attorneys in connection withmotions for new trials."

Id., at 223, n. 35. These, and
other, deficiencies have been relied upon by courts with fact-finding powers to exclude or minimize survey evidence.

E. g., Amstar Corp. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 615 F. 2d 252,

(NJ 1987) (attorney contact and interference invalidates

Shop, Inc., 559 F. Supp. 1189 (EDNY 1983) (listing factors to
consider in determining whether a survey is reliable). The
poll reported in the Columbia Human Rights Law Review
should not be considered by this Court. See Stanford v.
Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 377 (1989) (plurality opinion). It is
the Virginia Supreme Court's decision rejecting Ramdass'
claims that is under review in this habeas proceeding. It
was not required to consult public opinion polls.

Ramdass' claim is based on the contention that it is inevitable that a judgment of conviction would be entered for

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
his Domino's crime. He calls the entry of judgment following a jury verdict a "ministerial act whose performance was
foreseeable, imminent, and inexorable." Brief for Petitioner
21, 36. Petitioner cites no authority for the proposition that
a judicial officer's determination that final judgment should
be entered (as opposed to the clerk's noting of the final judgment in the record) is a ministerial act. We are not surprised. We doubt most lawyers would consider a criminal
case concluded in the trial court before judgment is entered,
for it is judgment which signals that the case has become
final and is about to end or reach another stage of proceedings. See Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 1:1, 5A:6 (1999) (requiring notice of appeal to be filed "within 30 days after entry of final
judgment").

Post-trial motions are an essential part of Virginia criminal law practice, as discussed in leading treatises such as
J. Costello, Virginia Criminal Law and Procedure 829 (2d ed.
1995), and R. Bacigal, Virginia Criminal Procedure 337 (2d
ed. 1989). Under Virginia Supreme Court Rule 3A:15(b)
(1999), a verdict of guilty may be set aside "for error committed during the trial or if the evidence is insufficient as a
matter of law to sustain a conviction." A few examples
from the reports of Virginia decisions demonstrate it to be
well-established procedure in Virginia for trial courts to
consider and grant motions to set aside jury verdicts. E. g.,
Floyd v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 575, 576-577, 249 S. E.
2d 171, 172 (1978); Payne v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 601,
602-603, 260 S. E. 2d 247, 248 (1979); Johnson v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 547, 553, 458 S. E. 2d 599, 601 (1995);
Walker v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 286, 291, 356 S. E. 2d

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The motion to set aside may be filed and resolved beforejudgment is entered,

e. g., Walker, supra, at 291, 356 S. E.
2d, at 856, and trial courts may conduct hearings or allowevidence to be introduced on these motions. Postverdict

motions may be granted despite the denial of a motion tostrike the evidence made during trial,

e. g., Gorham, supra,
at 674, 426 S. E. 2d, at 494, or after denial of a pretrial motion
to dismiss, Cullen, supra, at 184, 409 S. E. 2d, at 488. Fed-eral judges familiar with Virginia practice have held that

postverdict motions give a defendant a full and fair oppor-tunity to raise claims of trial error,

DiPaola v. Riddle, 581
F. 2d 1111, 1113 (CA4 1978). In contexts beyond the threestrikes statute, Virginia courts have held that the possibility
of postverdict relief renders a jury verdict uncertain and unreliable until judgment is entered. E. g., Dowell v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1145, 408 S. E. 2d 263, 265 (1991);
see also Smith v. Commonwealth, 134 Va. 589, 113 S. E. 707
(1922); Blair v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. 850, 858, 861 (1874)
(availability of postverdict motions means it is at the defendant's option whether to "let judgment be entered in regular
order"). In one recent case, the Virginia Court of Appeals
relied on Rule 3A:15 to hold, contrary to petitioner's contention here, that it is an "incorrect statement of the law"
to say that the trial court has no concern with the proceedings after the jury's verdict. Davis v. Commonwealth,
No. 2960-98-2, 2000 WL 135148, *4, n. 1 (Va. App., Feb. 8,
2000) (unpublished).

The time for Ramdass to file a motion to set aside the
Domino's verdict had not expired when the jury was deliberating on the sentence for Kayani's murder; and he concedes
he could have filed postverdict motions. The Domino's case
was pending in a different county from the Kayani murder
trial and the record contains no indication that Ramdass'
counsel advised the judge in the Kayani case that he would
not pursue postverdict relief in the Domino's case. The
Virginia Supreme Court was reasonable to reject a parole530US1 Unit: $U70 [01-22-02 11:05:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
176 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
ineligibility instruction for a defendant who would becomeineligible only in the event a trial judge in a different county

entered final judgment in an unrelated criminal case.Ramdass complains that the Virginia Supreme Court's selection of the entry of judgment rather than the jury verdictis arbitrary. He points out that a trial court may set the
judgment aside within 21 days after its entry. Va. Sup. Ct.
Rule 1:1 (1999). Appeal is also permitted. We agree withRamdass that the availability of postjudgment relief in the

trial court or on appeal renders uncertain the finality andreliability of even a judgment in the trial court. Our own
jurisprudence under Teague v. Lane, for example, does not
consider a Virginia-state-court conviction final until the direct review process is completed. O'Dell v. Netherland, 521
U. S., at 157. States may take different approaches and we
see no support for a rule that would require a State to
declare a conviction final for purposes of a three-strikes
statute once a verdict has been rendered. Verdicts may be
overturned by the state trial court, by a state appellate
court, by the state supreme court, by a state court on collateral attack, by a federal court in habeas corpus, or by
this Court on review of any of these proceedings. Virginia's
approach, which would permit a Simmons instruction despite the availability of postjudgment relief that might, the
day after the jury is instructed that the defendant is parole ineligible, undo one of the strikes supporting the instruction, provided Ramdass sufficient protection. A judgment, not a verdict, is the usual measure for finality in the
trial court.

Our conclusion is confirmed by a review of petitioner's conduct in this litigation. The current claim that it was certain
at the time of trial that Ramdass would never be released
on parole in the event the jury sentenced him to life is belied
by the testimony his counsel elicited from him at sentencing.
Ramdass' counsel asked him, "Are you going to spend the
rest of your life in prison?" Despite the claim advanced

177Cite as: 530 U. S. 156 (2000)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
now that parole would be impossible, the answer counsel elic-ited from Ramdass at trial was, "I don't know." We think

Ramdass' answer at trial is an accurate assessment of theuncertainties that surrounded his parole and custody status
at the time of trial. In like manner, before the VirginiaSupreme Court's decision now challenged as unreasonable,
petitioner had not argued that his parole eligibility should
have been determined based on the date of the Domino'sverdict (January 7, 1993) rather than the date the judgment

was entered (February 18, 1993). He did not mention thethree-strikes law at trial, although the Domino's verdict had
already been returned. Petitioner's brief to the Virginia
Supreme Court on remand from this Court conceded that
the appropriate date to consider for the Domino's crime
was the date of judgment. His brief states Ramdass "was
convicted . . . on 18 February 1993 of armed robbery" and
that "[o]f course, the . . . 18 February convictio[n] occurred
after the jury findings in this case." App. 123-124. Thus
the Virginia Supreme Court treated the Domino's conviction
in the manner urged by petitioner. Petitioner's change of
heart on the controlling date appears based on a belated
realization that the 1988 robbery conviction did not qualify
as a strike, meaning that he needed the Domino's conviction
to count. To accomplish the task, petitioner began arguing
that the date of the jury verdict controlled. His original
position, however, is the one in accord with Virginia law.

State trial judges and appellate courts remain free, of
course, to experiment by adopting rules that go beyond the
minimum requirements of the Constitution. In this regard,
we note that the jury was not informed that Ramdass, at the
time of trial, was eligible for parole in 25 years, that the
trial judge had the power to override a recommended death
sentence, or that Ramdass' prior convictions were subject to
being set aside by the trial court or on appeal. Each statement would have been accurate as a matter of law, but each
statement might also have made it more probable that the

178 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
jury would have recommended a death sentence. We further note Virginia has expanded Simmons by allowing a
defendant to obtain a Simmons instruction even where the
defendant's future dangerousness is not at issue. Yarbrough
v. Commonwealth, 258 Va. 347, 519 S. E. 2d 602 (1999).
Likewise, Virginia has, after Ramdass' conviction, eliminated
parole for capital defendants sentenced to life in prison.
The combination of Yarbrough and the elimination of parole
means that all capital defendants in Virginia now receive a
Simmons instruction if they so desire. In circumstances
like those presented here, even if some instruction had
been given on the subject addressed by Simmons, the extent to which the trial court should have addressed the contingencies that could affect finality of the other convictions
is not altogether clear. A full elaboration of the various
ways to set a conviction aside or grant a new trial might
not have been favorable to the petitioner. In all events the
Constitution does not require the instruction that Ramdass
now requests. The sentencing proceeding was not invalid
by reason of its omission.

III

The Virginia Supreme Court's decision to deny petitioner
relief was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Simmons. The United States Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit was required to deny him relief under
28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), and we affirm
the judgment. It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
In Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), a
majority of the Court held that "[w]here the State puts the
defendant's future dangerousness in issue, and the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
to inform the capital sentencing jury . . . that he is paroleineligible."

Id., at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see also id., at 163-164 (plurality opinion). Due proc-ess requires that "a defendant not be sentenced to death `on

the basis of information which he had no opportunity to denyor explain.' "

Id., at 175 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 5,
n. 1 (1986)). Accordingly, where the State seeks to demon-strate that the defendant poses a future danger to society,

he "should be allowed to bring his parole ineligibility tothe jury's attention" as a means of rebutting the State's
case. 512 U. S., at 177. I have no doubt that Simmons was
rightly decided.

In this case, because petitioner seeks a writ of habeas corpus rather than the vacatur of his sentence on direct appeal,
the scope of our review is governed by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1)
(1994 ed., Supp. III). Accordingly, we may grant relief only
if the Virginia Supreme Court's decision "was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States," ibid.; see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.
362, 402-409 (2000), which in this case is our holding in
Simmons.

The Virginia Supreme Court concluded that Simmons was
inapplicable because petitioner "was not ineligible for parole
when the jury was considering his sentence." Ramdass v.
Commonwealth, 248 Va. 518, 521, 450 S. E. 2d 360, 361 (1994).
The court noted that, under Virginia law, any person who
has been convicted of three separate felony offenses of murder, rape, or robbery "by the presenting of firearms or other
deadly weapon" "shall not be eligible for parole." Va. Code
Ann. $ 53.1-151(B1) (1993). It explained that Ramdass was
not parole ineligible at the time of his capital sentencing proceeding because the Kayani murder conviction would not
constitute his third conviction for purposes of $ 53.1-151(B1).
Critically, the court held that, although Ramdass had been

530US1 Unit: $U70 [01-22-02 11:05:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
180 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
found guilty of the armed robbery of a Domino's Pizza res-taurant, that verdict did not count as a prior conviction

under $ 53.1-151(B1) because judgment had not yet beenentered on that verdict at the time of Ramdass' capital sentencing proceeding. 248 Va., at 520, 450 S. E. 2d, at 361.For the reasons explained in the plurality opinion, the Virginia Supreme Court's decision was neither contrary to, nor
an unreasonable application of, our holding in Simmons.Whether a defendant is entitled to inform the jury that he is

parole ineligible is ultimately a question of federal law, butwe look to state law to determine a defendant's parole status.
In Simmons, the defendant had "conclusively establish[ed]"
that he was parole ineligible at the time of sentencing, and
the "prosecution did not challenge or question [his] parole
ineligibility." 512 U. S., at 158. Ramdass, however, was
not ineligible for parole when the jury considered his sentence as the relevant court had not yet entered the judgment
of conviction for the Domino's Pizza robbery. Were the
entry of judgment a purely ministerial act under Virginia
law, in the sense that it was foreordained, I would agree with
petitioner that "the only available alternative sentence to
death [was] life imprisonment without possibility of parole."
Id., at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Such
circumstances would be "materially indistinguishable" from
the facts of Simmons. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S., at
405. It therefore would have been "contrary to" Simmons
for the Virginia Supreme Court to hold that petitioner was
not entitled to inform the jury that he would be parole ineligible. See ibid. Where all that stands between a defendant and parole ineligibility under state law is a purely ministerial act, Simmons entitles the defendant to inform the jury
of that ineligibility, either by argument or instruction, even
if he is not technically "parole ineligible" at the moment of
sentencing.

Such was not the case here, however. As the plurality
opinion explains, the entry of judgment following a criminal

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
conviction in Virginia state court is not a purely ministerial
act, i. e., one that is inevitable and foreordained under state
law. The Commonwealth allows criminal defendants to file
post-trial motions following a guilty verdict, and trial courts
may set aside jury verdicts in response to such motions.
See ante, at 173-175. Thus, as a matter of Virginia law, a
guilty verdict does not inevitably lead to the entry of a judgment order. Consequently, the jury verdict finding petitioner guilty of the Domino's Pizza robbery did not mean
that petitioner would necessarily be parole ineligible under
state law. Indeed, petitioner himself concedes that there
was a "possibility that the Domino's Pizza trial judge could
set aside the verdict under Virginia Supreme Court Rule
3A:15(b)." Brief for Petitioner 37.

Petitioner nevertheless contends that the possibility that
the trial court would set aside the guilty verdict for the
Domino's Pizza robbery was quite remote, and therefore
that the entry of judgment was extremely likely. But, as
the plurality opinion explains, Simmons does not require
courts to estimate the likelihood of future contingencies concerning the defendant's parole ineligibility. Rather, Simmons entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing
jury that he is parole ineligible where the only alternative
sentence to death is life without the possibility of parole.
And unlike the defendant in Simmons, Ramdass was eligible
for parole under state law at the time of his sentencing.

For these reasons, I agree that petitioner is not entitled
to the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. As our decision
in Williams v. Taylor makes clear, the standard of review
dictated by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III) is
narrower than that applicable on direct review. Applying
that standard here, I believe the Virginia Supreme Court's
decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, our holding in Simmons. Accordingly, I concur
in the judgment.

182 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

There is an acute unfairness in permitting a State to rely
on a recent conviction to establish a defendant's future dangerousness while simultaneously permitting the State to
deny that there was such a conviction when the defendant
attempts to argue that he is parole ineligible and therefore
not a future danger. Even the most miserly reading of the
opinions in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994),
supports the conclusion that this petitioner was denied
"one of the hallmarks of due process in our adversary system," namely, the defendant's right "to meet the State's
case against him." Id., at 175 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment).

I

In Simmons, we held that "[w]hen the State seeks to show
the defendant's future dangerousness . . . the defendant
should be allowed to bring his parole ineligibility to the
jury's attention--by way of argument by defense counsel or
an instruction from the court--as a means of responding to
the State's showing of future dangerousness." Id., at 177
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The present case
falls squarely within our holding.

There is no question that the Commonwealth argued
Ramdass' future dangerousness. Ante, at 161. In doing so,
it focused almost entirely on Ramdass' extensive criminal
history, emphasizing that his most recent crime spree was
committed after his mandatory release on parole.1 Indeed,

1 The prosecution's opening argument began by recounting Ramdass'
entire criminal history. App. 8-11. Eight of the nine witnesses the
Commonwealth called did little more than relate the details of Ramdass' criminal past. Id., at 12-64. The prosecution's closing argument
highlighted the connection between Ramdass' crimes and his prior releases from prison. Id., at 80-82. In fact, it did so on several occasions.
Id., at 9 (Ramdass "served time [for the 1988 strong arm robbery conviction] and was finally paroled in May of 1992"); id., at 46-47 (Ramdass "was

Stevens, J., dissenting
the prosecution relied upon the Domino's Pizza robbery--thevery crime Virginia has precluded Ramdass from relying

upon to establish his parole ineligibility.2There is also no question that Ramdass was denied the
opportunity to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility.During the sentencing deliberations, the jury asked the following question: "[I]f the Defendant is given life, is there a
possibility of parole at some time before his natural death?"
App. 88. Rather than giving any kind of straightforward
answer, and rather than permitting counsel to explain petitioner's parole ineligibility, the court instructed: "[Y]ou
should impose such punishment as you feel is just under the
evidence . . . . You are not to concern yourselves with what
may happen afterwards." Id., at 91.

Finally, it is undisputed that the absence of a clear instruction made a difference. The question itself demonstrates that parole ineligibility was important to the jury,
and that the jury was confused about whether a "life" sentence truly means life--or whether it means life subject to

released on mandatory parole" in 1992, shortly before his most recent
crime spree began); id., at 51b-52 (describing Ramdass' 1992 release on
mandatory parole).

2 Id., at 57-59 ("On that next night, August 30th, you did a robbery of

the Domino's Pizza over in Alexandria? . . . Well, if the cab driver was
shot in the head on August 30th and Domino's Pizza was August 30th, you
did them both the same day; didn't you?"); id., at 81 ("August 30th, 1992,
he robbed Domino's Pizza at the point of a gun in Alexandria and he
robbed Domino's Pizza not long after he shot that Arlington cab driver
through the head . . .").

Of course, Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), applies
when the prosecution argues future dangerousness; it does not require the
State to argue any particular past crime. My purpose in pointing out
Virginia's reliance on the Domino's Pizza verdict is to underscore the unfairness of permitting Virginia to use it, while denying Ramdass the same
use. The plurality's repeated statement that Virginia brought up the
crime in its cross-examination rather than its case in chief, ante, at 162,
170, 171, neither means Simmons is inapplicable nor mitigates the unfairness here. It only signals the formalism the plurality is prepared to
endorse.

the possibility of parole. See Simmons, 512 U. S., at 178(O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]hat the jury in
this case felt compelled to ask whether parole was availableshows that the jurors did not know whether or not a lifesentenced defendant will be released from prison"). Morecritically, three jurors said that "if the [ jury] knew that
[Ramdass] would have never gotten out of prison, they would
have given him life rather than death." App. 95. Two ofthem stated "that would have been the result among all

of [the jurors] beyond question, if they had had that infor-mation."

Ibid. But "because they weren't told or given
the answer . . . they all had a perception that he would beparoled."

Ibid.3
After we remanded for reconsideration in light of Simmons, the Virginia Supreme Court held that case did not
apply because Ramdass was not "ineligible for parole whenthe jury was considering his sentence."

Ramdass v. Commonwealth, 248 Va. 518, 520, 450 S. E. 2d 360, 361 (1994).The applicable Virginia statute requires three strikes for a

defendant to be parole ineligible. "At the time that the jury
was considering Ramdass's penalty on January 30, 1993," thecourt held, Ramdass "was not ineligible for parole" because

he had only two strikes against him--the Pizza Hut robberyand the instant capital murder.

Ibid. Ramdass' robbery of
the Domino's Pizza did not count as his third strike, eventhough the jury in that case had already found him guilty.

Technically, under state law, that did not count as a "con-viction," because Virginia's definition of "conviction" is not
just a guilty verdict. Rather, a "conviction" also requires a
piece of paper signed by the judge entering the verdict into

3 Once again, Simmons' applicability does not at all turn on whether this
kind of evidence exists. I point it out only to emphasize how real the
Simmons concerns are here. The plurality complains, in essence, that
the evidence came in the form of an uncontested proffer rather than as a
sworn affidavit. Ante, at 163. Again, neither Simmons' applicability nor
the reality of the case is undercut by this quibble. The only thing that it
proves is the plurality's penchant for formalism.

the record. Id., at 520-521, 450 S. E. 2d, at 361. The trial
judge signed the entry of the judgment in the Domino's Pizza
case 19 days after the end of the sentencing phase in Ramdass' capital murder proceeding. Ante, at 160. Therefore,
the Virginia Supreme Court held that at the time "when the
jury was considering [petitioner's] sentence" in the capital
murder case, Ramdass was "not ineligible for parole" under
state law, and thus Simmons was inapplicable.

II
The plurality begins by stating what it thinks is the rule
established in Simmons: "The parole-ineligibility instruction
is required only when, assuming the jury fixes the sentence
at life, the defendant is ineligible for parole under state law."
Ante, at 166. The plurality also adds a proviso: The defendant must be parole ineligible at the time of sentencing.4
Given that understanding, the plurality says "[m]aterial differences exist between this case and Simmons." Ante, at
167. But the differences to which the plurality points do not
distinguish this case from Simmons.

The first asserted distinction is that, as the Virginia Supreme Court stated, Ramdass was not parole ineligible
under state law at the time of sentencing. Ramdass might

4 Though the plurality does not include the proviso in its initial statement of the rule in Simmons, it repeats this requirement no less than
20 times in its 20-page opinion. See ante, at 159 ("when the jury considered his case"), 161 ("at the time of the capital sentencing trial"),
163-164 ("at the time of the jury's death penalty deliberations"), 164
("when the jury was considering his sentence"), ibid. ("at the time of the
sentencing trial"), ibid. ("at the time of his trial"), ibid. ("at the time of
sentencing"), 165 ("at the time of the jury's future dangerousness deliberations"), 166 ("when the jury deliberated his sentence"), ibid. ("at the time

have become parole ineligible at some later date, but at theexact moment the jury was deliberating that was not yet so.

The trouble is, that is not a fact that distinguishes Ramdass'case from Simmons'.

In Simmons, the relevant parole statute was S. C. CodeAnn. $ 24-21-640 (Supp. 1993). See Simmons, 512 U. S., at
176 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (citing SouthCarolina parole law); see also

id., at 156 (plurality opinion)(same).
5 Under that statute, it was the South Carolina

Board of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services that deter-mined a defendant's parole eligibility--and that determination would come after the sentencing phase. Then-currentSouth Carolina case law unambiguously stated that the eligibility determination would not be made at trial, but by theparole board.

6 Moreover, the statute required the parole

board to find that the defendant's prior convictions were notcommitted "pursuant to one continuous course of conduct,"

and it was by no means certain that the board would ulti-mately reach that conclusion. In fact, in

Simmons the Stateof South Carolina steadfastly maintained that Simmons was

not truly parole ineligible at the time of his sentencing

5 That statute read in part: "The board must not grant parole nor is
parole authorized, to any prisoner serving a sentence for a second or
subsequent conviction, following a separate sentencing for a prior conviction, for violent crimes as defined in Section 16-1-60. Provided that
where more than one included offense shall be committed within a one-day
period or pursuant to one continuous course of conduct, such multiple offenses must be treated for purposes of this section as one offense."

6 See, e. g., State v. McKay, 300 S. C. 113, 115, 386 S. E. 2d 623, 623-624

(1989).

It is true, as the plurality points out, ante, at 167, that in Simmons
the defendant did have an entry of judgment. But, under the plurality's
reasoning, the issue is whether the defendant is parole ineligible at the
time of sentencing, not why he is or is not ineligible. Thus, whether the
defendant is parole eligible at that time because he has no entry of judgment or because the parole board has not yet met is hardly relevant. It
is a distinction, but not a material one.

phase because the parole board's determination had notyet been made.

7 Therefore, the fact that parole ineligibility

under state law had not been determined at the time of sen-tencing is simply not a fact that distinguishes Simmons from

Ramdass' case.8

7 "First and foremost, at the time of the trial, no state agency had
ever determined that Simmons was going to be serving a sentence of
life without the possibility of parole, despite the fact that he had earlier
pled guilty and been sentenced to a violent crime prior to this trial. The
importance of that distinction is that the power to make that determination did not rest with the judiciary, but was solely vested in an executive branch agency, the South Carolina Board of Probation, Parole and
Pardon Services." Brief for Respondent in Simmons v. South Carolina,
O. T. 1993, No. 92-9059, p. 95 (emphasis added).

The plurality also complains that "a state court [need not] glean information from the record" in Simmons. Ante, at 168. That is true, but it
is equally true that a state court cannot pretend that a fact creates a
material distinction simply because it was not expressly raised and rejected by this Court. Moreover, it is evident in the opinion itself that
Simmons' parole-ineligibility status had not been definitively and legally
determined yet at the time of sentencing. See n. 8, infra.

8 The plurality contends that in Simmons "the defendant had `conclusively established' his parole ineligibility at the time of sentencing."
Ante, at 167 (quoting Simmons, 512 U. S., at 158 (plurality opinion)); see
also ante, at 171. What Simmons in fact said was that no one questioned
that the defendant had all the facts necessary to be found ineligible at
some future date. It does not indicate that a legal determination of the
defendant's parole ineligibility had already been definitively made by the
parole board. This is clear in the plurality's citation of the South Carolina
parole statute, under which a defendant's parole status is determined by
the parole board at a later date. See supra, at 186. This is also clear
from the fact that the plurality relied upon the testimony of the parole
board's attorneys, 512 U. S., at 158-159, demonstrating the plurality's recognition that it was the parole board that would ultimately determine
Simmons' parole eligibility. Furthermore, the plurality's statement that
Simmons was "in fact ineligible," id., at 158 (emphasis added), as opposed
to "legally" ineligible or ineligible "as a matter of law," clearly distinguished between the facts as known at that time (which indicated how
Simmons' status would, in all likelihood, ultimately be determined), and
the legal determination of status (which would be formally determined at

Stevens, J., dissenting
Perhaps recognizing that problem, the plurality shiftsground. It is not, the plurality says, "only" whether parole

ineligibility under state law has been determined "at thetime of sentencing," but whether there is "no possibility" of
parole eligibility at that time. Ante, at 169. In otherwords, the plurality says that Simmons applies when there
is "conclusive proof " at the time of sentencing that the de-fendant will (in the future) "inevitabl[y]" be found parole ineligible. Ante, at 170, 173-174. In Ramdass' case, the plurality continues, he would not inevitably be parole ineligible,because, under Virginia law, his Domino's Pizza robbery verdict could have been set aside under Virginia Supreme CourtRule 3A:15(b) (1999). That Rule permits a trial court to set
aside a guilty verdict up to 21 days after final judgment hasbeen entered.

Ante, at 174-175.9
But again, this is not a fact that distinguishes Ramdass'case from Simmons'. Like Virginia, South Carolina permitted (and still permits) the court to entertain post-trial motions to set aside a verdict and such a motion could have

a later date). Finally, if Simmons' parole ineligibility had been legally
and conclusively resolved by the time of his trial, there would have been
no need for the plurality to discuss (and reject) possibilities that might
have undermined Simmons' eventual finding of parole ineligibility. See
infra, at 201-203.

The Simmons plurality did say that "an instruction informing the jury
that petitioner is ineligible for parole is legally accurate." 512 U. S., at
166; ante, at 166-167. But in the very next sentence the plurality wrote:
"Certainly, such an instruction is more accurate than no instruction at
all." 512 U. S., at 166 (emphasis added). This made it clear that "accuracy," in the sense used there, is a relative term, not an absolute conclusive
determination of legal status.

9 At the time of Ramdass' trial, Rule 3A:15(b) read:

"(b) Motion to Set Aside Verdict.--If the jury returns a verdict of
guilty, the court may, on motion of the accused made not later than 21
days after entry of a final order, set aside the verdict for error committed
during the trial or if the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to
sustain a conviction."

been filed in Simmons' case.10 If the availability of sucha post-trial procedure makes Ramdass' parole ineligibility

less than inevitable, the same must also have been true forSimmons.

11 Accordingly, the mere availability of such a

procedure is not a fact that distinguishes the two cases.In the end, though, the plurality does not really rest upon

inevitability at all, nor upon the alleged lack of inevitabilityrepresented by the post-trial motion procedure. Instead,
the plurality relies upon the fact that at the time of Ramdass'
sentencing phase, although the jury had rendered a guiltyverdict in the Domino's Pizza robbery case, the trial judge

had not yet entered judgment on the verdict. Ante, at 160,167, 173-174, 176. That entry of judgment would come 19
days later. Ante, at 160. The distinction is important, theplurality says, because "[a] judgment, not a verdict, is the
usual measure for finality in the trial court," ante, at 176,whereas a verdict without a judgment is "uncertain,"

ibid.
The plurality is, of course, correct that the missing entry ofjudgment is a circumstance that was not present in

Simmons.

10 South Carolina Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(b) (1999) reads, in relevant part: "A motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence
must be made within a reasonable period of time after the discovery of
the evidence."

11 It is true, of course, that a motion for a new trial under South Carolina's rule must be predicated on the discovery of new evidence, but that
does not meaningfully distinguish its rule from Virginia's rule, under
which a verdict can be set aside only for trial error or insufficient evidence.

The plurality says that because Simmons pleaded guilty to his prior
crime, he was foreclosed from filing a motion under South Carolina's rule.
Ante, at 167. For this proposition, the plurality cites Whetsell v. State,
276 S. C. 295, 277 S. E. 2d 891 (1981). This is just flat wrong. See Johnson v. Catoe, 336 S. C. 354, 358-359, 520 S. E. 2d 617, 619 (1999) ("Whetsell
does not stand for the proposition that a defendant who admits his guilt
is barred from collaterally attacking his conviction. Whetsell stands only
for the narrow proposition that a [postconviction relief] applicant who has
pled guilty on advice of counsel cannot satisfy the prejudice prong on collateral attack if he states he would have pled guilty in any event").

190 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Stevens, J., dissenting
But the plurality's entirely unsupported assertion that anentry of judgment is more "certain" than a verdict is just

flat wrong.The sole basis for the plurality's conclusion that the Domino's Pizza verdict is uncertain is the possibility that it couldbe set aside under Rule 3A:15(b). But under that Rule, a
guilty verdict may be set aside even after judgment has beenentered. See n. 9,

supra. The plurality has cited not asingle case suggesting that the standard for setting aside a

verdict under Rule 3A:15(b) varies depending on whetheror not judgment has been entered. Accordingly, a verdict
that is susceptible to being set aside under Rule 3A:15(b) isno more or less certain simply because judgment has been
entered on that verdict; whatever the degree of uncertaintyis, it is identical in both cases. In short, whether judgment
has been entered on the verdict has absolutely no bearing onthe verdict's "uncertainty."

The plurality cites 11 Virginia cases to support its argu-ment that Rule 3A:15(b) puts a verdict on shaky ground.
Ante, at 174-175. The authorities are less than over-whelming. Only 2 of those 11 cases actually mention Rule
3A:15(b),12 and one of those does so in dicta in a footnotein the unpublished decision of an intermediate state court.

Another case also makes passing reference to the denial ofa post-trial motion, but it is clear from the fact that the

motion was predicated on "new evidence" (which is not abasis for a Rule 3A:15(b) motion, see n. 9, supra) and was
made four months after the verdict that the motion wasalmost certainly not based on Rule 3A:15(b).

15 Ultimately,

the plurality points to only three cases to demonstrate that"a jury verdict [is] uncertain and unreliable until judgment

is entered." Ante, at 175 (citing Dowell v. Commonwealth,12 Va. App. 1145, 1149, 408 S. E. 2d 263, 265 (1991) (mentioning Rule 3A:15(b)); Smith v. Commonwealth, 134 Va.589, 113 S. E. 707 (1922);

Blair v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. 850(1874)). What these cases hold, however, is (1) that a verdict without an entry of judgment may not be used for pur-poses of impeaching a witness' credibility; (2) the same may
not be used for purposes of a statute permitting the re-moval from public office of any person "convicted of an act . . .
involving moral turpitude"; but (3) the Governor can pardona prisoner after a verdict and before entry of judgment.
Not one of them actually involves a Rule 3A:15(b) motion,nor remotely says that a verdict itself is "unreliable."

("Carter . . . appeals from judgments of the Circuit Court of Loudoun

15 Payne v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 601, 602-603, 260 S. E. 2d 247, 248

(1979).

16 Dowell does say that a verdict without a judgment is not reliable "for

impeachment purposes," 12 Va. App., at 1149, 408 S. E. 2d, at 265, but this
is a far cry from saying the verdict is itself unreliable. What the three
cases actually address is the question whether a verdict is a "conviction"
under state law; they say that it depends on the context, answering in the
negative in two cases, and in the affirmative in a third.

The plurality also cites two intermediate state-court cases making passing reference to a trial court's granting of a post-trial motion, though neither case mentions Rule 3A:15(b). See Gorham v. Commonwealth, 15 Va.
App. 673, 426 S. E. 2d 493 (1993); Cullen v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App.
182, 409 S. E. 2d 487 (1991). But a mere two cases among all the criminal

Stevens, J., dissenting
plurality scrounges to find case law support, but the resultbarely registers on the radar screen.

Furthermore, the plurality thinks that there is "no author-ity" for the proposition that entry of judgment is generally
considered to be a "ministerial" matter. Ante, at 174. In arelated context, however, the Virginia Supreme Court has
observed:

"The rendition of a judgment is to be distinguished fromits entry in the records. The rendition of a judgment is

the judicial act of the court, whereas the entry of a judg-ment by the clerk on the records of the court is a ministerial, and not a judicial, act. . . . The entry or recor-dation of such an instrument in an order book is the
ministerial act of the clerk and does not constitute anintegral part of the judgment." Rollins v. Bazile, 205
Va. 613, 617, 139 S. E. 2d 114, 117 (1964) (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted).

In any event, there is a more critical point to be madeabout the plurality's entry-of-judgment distinction. In relying on that distinction, the plurality is necessarily abandon-ing the very understanding of Simmons that it purports to
be following. As explained above, to the extent that theavailability of Rule 3A:15(b) motions undermines the inevitability of a defendant's prior verdicts (and therefore hisparole ineligibility) under state law, it does so whether or
not judgment has been entered on the verdict. So why isit that Simmons does not apply when there is no entry of
judgment?The answer simply cannot be that, under state law, and at
the time of sentencing, the defendant will not inevitably be
cases in Virginia surely demonstrates that setting aside a verdict by posttrial motion is a rarity; if those two instances make the verdict uncertain,
then one might as well cite the solitary case in which the Governor granted
a pardon after the verdict but before the entry of judgment. See Blair
v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. 850 (1874).

found parole ineligible: the inevitability of the verdict isundermined equally with or without the judgment; and the

defendant is eligible for parole under state law if the ver-dict is set aside, regardless of whether it is set aside before
or after judgment is entered. In fact, though, the pluralityreally makes no attempt to explain the entry-of-judgment
distinction in terms of either the at-the-time-of-sentencing-under-state-law rule, or in terms of the inevitable-understate-law rule. Rather, the significance of the entry ofjudgment rests upon the assertion that a judgment is

morecertain than a jury verdict. The entry-of-judgment line,

then, is really about relative degrees of certainty regardingparole ineligibility.

17

If the question is not one in which state law controls (bylooking to the defendant's conclusively determined status

either at the time of sentencing or inevitably thereafter),the question of Simmons' applicability must be an issue of
federal due process law. That is a proposition with whichI agree entirely; indeed,

Simmons itself makes that perfectlyclear, as I discuss below. Before examining what Simmons'

17 Though the plurality insists that judgment "is the usual measure for
finality," ante, at 176, its own opinion reveals that it does not mean "finality" in any absolute sense. Rather, it concedes that while a "jury verdict
[is] uncertain," ante, at 175, "even a judgment" is "uncertain" too, because
of "the availability of postjudgment relief," ante, at 176. What it means,
then--though it is not particularly candid about it--is that a judgment is
more certain than a verdict. Put differently, the plurality thinks a judgment is more enduring, in that there is a greater probability that a verdict
will survive a motion to set it aside if there has already been an entry
of judgment.

It is clear that the significance of the entry of judgment for the plurality
must be based on that belief. The significance cannot be that without the
entry of judgment the defendant is not ineligible for parole at the exact
moment of sentencing; as explained above, that fact is not dispositive.
See supra, at 185-187. Nor can its significance be that without the entry
of judgment, his parole status is not inevitable. As also explained above,
the entry of judgment has no significance insofar as inevitability is concerned. See supra, at 188-192 and this page.

due process requirements entail, however, it is important tounderstand the rationale behind Simmons: the need for capital sentencing juries to have accurate information about thedefendant in the particular area of parole eligibility.

III
We stated in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976):

"If an experienced trial judge, who daily faces the diffi-cult task of imposing sentences, has a vital need for accurate information about a defendant and the crime hecommitted in order to be able to impose a rational sentence in the typical criminal case, then accurate sentenc-ing information is an indispensable prerequisite to a reasoned determination of whether a defendant shall liveor die by a jury of people who may never before have
made a sentencing decision." Id., at 190 ( joint opinionof Stewart, Powell, and S

tevens, JJ.).

This imperative is all the more critical when the jury mustmake a determination as to future dangerousness. "[A]ny

sentencing authority must predict a convicted person's prob-able future conduct when it engages in the process of determining what sentence to impose. . . . What is essential isthat the jury have before it all possible relevant information
about the individual defendant whose fate it must deter-mine." Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 274-276 (1976) ( joint
opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). When itcomes to issues such as future dangerousness and the possibility of parole, it is therefore vitally important that "thejury [have] accurate information of which both the defendant and his counsel are aware," including "an accurate state-ment of a potential sentencing alternative." California v.
Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1004, 1009 (1983).This is not to say, of course, that the Constitution compels
the States to tell the jury every single piece of informationthat may be relevant to its deliberations. See,

e. g., id., at

Stevens, J., dissenting
1010-1012. Indeed, in California v. Ramos, we held it ordi-narily proper to "defe[r] to the State's choice of substantive

factors relevant to the penalty determination." Id., at 1001.Notwithstanding the broad discretion recognized in

Ramos,
the latitude to which the States are entitled is not un-bounded; at times, it must give way to the demands of due

process.

One such due process requirement is that a defendantmust have an opportunity to rebut the State's case against

him. Simmons, 512 U. S., at 175 (O'Connor, J., concurringin judgment). And "[w]hen the State seeks to show the defendant's future dangerousness, . . . the fact that he will
never be released from prison will often be the only way that
a violent criminal can successfully rebut the State's case."
Id., at 177 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, "despite our general deference to state decisions regarding what the jury should be told about sentencing, . . .
due process requires that the defendant be allowed [to bring
his parole ineligibility to the jury's attention] in cases in
which the only available alternative sentence to death is life
imprisonment without possibility of parole and the prosecution argues that the defendant will pose a threat to society
in the future." Ibid.

The rationale for the Simmons exception to the general
rule of Ramos is quite apparent. In Ramos, the defendant
claimed that if the State were permitted to argue that the
Governor could commute a sentence of life without parole,
then due process entitled him to tell the jury that the Governor could commute a death sentence as well. We rejected
that argument, however, holding that the information the defendant sought to introduce "would not `balance' the impact"
of telling the jury that the Governor could commute a sentence of life without parole. 463 U. S., at 1011. Nor would
it make the jury "any less inclined to vote for the death penalty upon learning" that information. Ibid. Nor, finally,
were we persuaded that it would "impermissibly impe[l] the

196 RAMDASS v. ANGELONE

Stevens, J., dissenting
jury toward voting for the death sentence" if the jury were
told that a life without parole sentence could be commuted,
but were not told that a death penalty could be commuted
as well. Id., at 1012.

Each of these factors, however, points in precisely the
opposite direction when it comes to information about a defendant's parole ineligibility. If the State argues that the
defendant will be a future danger to society, it quite plainly
rebuts that argument to point out that the defendant--because of his parole ineligibility--will never be a part of
society again. Simmons, 512 U. S., at 177 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment) ("[T]he fact that he will never be
released from prison will often . . . rebut the State's case").
And unlike Ramos, if the jury is informed of a defendant's
parole ineligibility, it is "less inclined to vote for the death
penalty upon learning" that fact. Conversely, permitting
the State to argue the defendant's future dangerousness,
while simultaneously precluding the defendant from arguing
his parole ineligibility, does tend to "impe[l] the jury toward
voting for the death sentence." Despite the plurality's unsupported remark that "[e]vidence of potential parole ineligibility is of uncertain materiality," ante, at 170, all of the
available data demonstrate to the contrary.

How long a defendant will remain in jail is a critical factor
for juries. One study, for example, indicates that 79% of
Virginia residents consider the number of years that a defendant might actually serve before being paroled to be an
" `important consideration when choosing between life imprisonment and the death penalty.' " 18 A similar study reveals that 76.5% of potential jurors think it is "extremely
important" or "very important" to know that information
when deciding between life imprisonment and the death pen18 See Note, The Meaning of "Life" for Virginia Jurors and Its Effect on

jurors would actually disregard a judge's instructions not toconsider parole eligibility when determining the defendant's
sentence.22At the same time, the recent development of parole ineligibility statutes results in confusion and misperception, suchthat "common sense tells us that many jurors might not

of parole." Simmons, 512 U. S., at 177-178 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment). The statistical data bear this out.

One study of potential Virginia jurors asked: " `If a personis sentenced to life imprisonment for intentional murder
during an armed robbery, how many years on the averagedo you think that the person would actually serve before
being released on parole?' " The most frequent responsewas 10 years.

23 Another potential-juror survey put the

average response at just over eight years.24 And morethan 70% of potential jurors think that a person sentenced

to life in prison for murder can be released at some point inthe future.

25

Given this data, it is not surprising that one study con-cluded: "[J]urors assessing dangerousness attach great

weight to the defendant's expected sentence if a death sen-tence is not imposed. Most importantly, jurors who believe
the alternative to death is a relatively short time in prisontend to sentence to death. Jurors who believe the alternative treatment is longer tend to sentence to life." 26 Con-sequently, every reason why the Governor's commutation
power at issue in Ramos was not required to be put be-fore the jury leads to precisely the opposite conclusion when
it comes to the issue of parole ineligibility. That is exactlywhy Simmons is an exception to the normally operative rule
of deference established in Ramos.27The plurality--focusing exclusively on one of the many
sources cited--criticizes at length (ante, at 172-173) these"so-called scientific conclusions" that merely confirm what

every sentencing judge surely knows--that how soon the de-fendant may actually be released from prison is highly relevant to the sentencing decision. The plurality's criticism yetagain underscores the formalistic character of its analysis of
the life-or-death issue presented by this case. In exercisingthe judicial function, there are times when judgment is far
more important than technical symmetry.28

The Virginia Supreme Court held that whether Simmonsapplies is a question whose answer is entirely controlled by

the operation of state law. See supra, at 184-185. Thisunderstanding was adopted by the plurality as well, at least
as it originally stated the holding of Simmons. See supra,at 185. But as explained above, the Virginia court's view,
as well as the plurality's original stance, simply cannot bereconciled with Simmons itself. That might explain why
the plurality ultimately abandons that view, instead relying

28 As for the specific criticisms, the plurality first complains that such
surveys are inadmissible as evidence. The question, though, is not
whether the statistical studies are admissible evidence, but whether they
are relevant facts assisting in our determination of the proper scope of the
Simmons due process right. Surely they are. In any event, Ramdass
did raise such studies at his sentencing hearing. See App. 95-96. Virginia had its chance to object, but opted not to do so. It is far too late in
the day to complain about it now. (Simmons, incidentally, also introduced
similar evidence in his trial without objection. See 512 U. S., at 159
(plurality opinion).)

Next, the plurality says that one of the studies I cited focused only on
Georgia jurors, as if Georgians have some unique preference for life without parole. In any event, the studies focusing on Virginia jurors yield the
same results. See nn. 18, 21, supra. Finally, the plurality questions the
objectivity of one particular study. Even if the plurality were justified in
that criticism, it surely has no basis for questioning the many other sources
cited. See n. 19, supra (Univ. of South Carolina's Institute for Public Affairs), n. 21 (Gallup Poll and Virginia Tech's Center for Survey Research),
n. 26 (study by Associate Professor of Statistics, Dept. of Economic and
Social Statistics, Cornell Univ.).

on an assessment of how probable it is that the defendantwill be found parole ineligible--or, as the plurality might put

it, what is "more certain" under state law.The plurality is correct to reject the Virginia Supreme
Court's holding that state law entirely controls the appli-cability of Simmons. Simmons announced a rule of due
process, not state law. 512 U. S., at 156 (plurality opinion);
id., at 177 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). This isnot to say that the federal due process right in Simmons

does not make reference to state law, for surely it does; thevery reason why Simmons is an exception to Ramos is because of the consequences of parole ineligibility under statelaw. But that is not the same thing as saying that the precise, technical operation of state law entirely controls itsapplicability.

Simmons itself makes this perfectly clear. In that caseSouth Carolina argued that "because future exigencies such
as legislative reform, commutation, clemency, and escapemight allow [Simmons] to be released into society, [Simmons]
was not entitled to inform the jury that he is parole ineligi-ble." 512 U. S., at 166, and n. 6 (plurality opinion). Indeed,
as noted earlier, it argued that Simmons was not, technically,parole ineligible at the time of sentencing because the state
parole board had not yet made its determination. See
supra, at 186-187.Yet the plurality opinion rejected outright the argument

that "hypothetical future developments" control the issue,finding that South Carolina's argument about state law, while
"technically . . . true," and "legally accurate," had "littleforce." Simmons, 512 U. S., at 166, and n. 6.

29 In other

words, the due process standard of Simmons was not con29 While Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion did not make direct
reference to those hypothetical possibilities, South Carolina's brief and the
plurality's opinion put the issue squarely before the Court. If those hypotheticals had made a difference, the outcome of the case for the concurring
opinion would have been precisely the opposite of what it was.

Stevens, J., dissenting
trolled entirely by the technical minutiae of state law, even
though it looked at state law for determining when the right
to rebut the State's argument was triggered.

It makes perfect sense for Simmons' due process right to
make reference to, yet not be wholly controlled by, state law.
On the one hand, Simmons is a limited exception to Ramos,
and as such it is confined to where the defendant will be
parole ineligible--hence the reference to state law. On the
other hand, Simmons is a constitutional requirement imposed on the States. If its applicability turned entirely on
a defendant's technical status under state law at the time of
sentencing, the constitutional requirement would be easily
evaded by the artful crafting of a state statute. For example, if Virginia can define "conviction" to require an entry
of judgment, it could just as easily define "conviction" to
require that all final appeals be exhausted, or that all state
and federal habeas options be foreclosed. And by delaying
when the defendant's convictions count as strikes for parole
ineligibility purposes until some point in time well after the
capital murder sentencing phase, the State could convert the
Simmons requirement into an opt-in constitutional rule.30

Simmons' applicability is therefore a question of federal
law, and that case makes clear that the federal standard
essentially disregards future hypothetical possibilities even
if they might make the defendant parole eligible at some

30 This is true even if one accepts the premise that Simmons requires
us to presume that the most recent conviction will ultimately count as a
strike regardless of what could happen under state law after the sentencing hearing. (The Virginia Supreme Court apparently adopted that
view, which explains why that court counted the capital murder verdict
as a strike at the time of the sentencing hearing, even though judgment
had not yet been entered on the verdict. See supra, at 184.) Even accepting that premise, delaying the determination of parole ineligibility status until after the sentencing hearing would still mean that the defendant's
other prior convictions would not count as strikes until well after the capital murder sentencing phase.

point.31 The question in this case, then, boils down towhether the plurality's line between entry of judgment and

a verdict is a demarcation of Simmons' applicability that is(1) consistent with Simmons; (2) a realistic and accurate assessment of the probabilities; and (3) a workable, clear rule.I believe the plurality fails on each score.

It is important to emphasize the precise basis for the un-certainty the plurality perceives. The plurality limits the
relevant uncertainty to things known before the time of sen-tencing. Events developing the day

after sentencing, whichmight lend uncertainty to a defendant's eventual parole ineligibility do not make Simmons inapplicable, the pluralitysays. Ante, at 176. What I understand the plurality to be
concerned about is whether the facts, as known at or priorto sentencing, cast any doubt on whether, after sentencing,
the defendant will become parole ineligible. Even if nothingdefinitive has happened yet by the time of sentencing, the
facts as known at that time might well give rise to uncer-tainty as to the defendant's parole ineligibility.

The question, then, is what were the facts as known at
the time of Ramdass' sentencing that might cast doubt onwhether he would be found parole ineligible after sentencing.

The facts to which the plurality points are, first, that judg-ment had not yet been entered on the verdict, and second,
that the verdict could have been set aside if Ramdass had

31 The plurality's claim, ante, at 169, that Ramdass seeks an extension of
Simmons is therefore unfounded. And its criticism that "[p]etitioner's
proposed rule would require courts to evaluate the probability of future
events" ignores the fact that Simmons itself did the very same thing.
Ante, at 169. The irony of that comment, moreover, is that it criticizes
the rule for requiring an assessment of the future on the ground that such
an inquiry is inherently speculative. Yet speculation about the future is
precisely what is required when the jury is asked to assess a defendant's
future dangerousness. The speculation, however, becomes reasoned prediction rather than arbitrary guesswork only when the jury is permitted
to learn of the defendant's future parole status. See supra, at 194-199.
Unfortunately, that was not the case here.

filed a motion to set aside the verdict under Rule 3A:15(b)and the trial court had found that motion meritorious. But

no motion to set aside the verdict had been filed or was pend-ing; no legal basis for granting such a motion had (or has)
ever been identified; and there was not the slightest in-dication from the Domino's Pizza robbery trial court that
such a motion would have been found meritorious if it had
been filed. In short, the plurality finds constitutionally sig-nificant uncertainty in the hypothetical possibility that a

motion, if it had been filed, might have identified a trialerror and the court possibly could have found the claim meritorious. The mere availability of a procedure for setting
aside a verdict that is necessary for the defendant's parole
ineligibility is enough, the plurality says, to make Simmons
inapplicable.

Frankly, I do not see how Simmons can be found inapplicable on the basis of such a "hypothetical future developmen[t]." 512 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion). The plurality
offers no evidence whatsoever that this possibility--an "if
only" wrapped in a "might have" inside of a "possibly so"--
is at all more likely to occur than the "hypothetical future
developments" that Simmons itself refused to countenance.
Why is that possibility of setting aside the verdict any more
likely than the fanciful scenarios dismissed in Simmons?
Why is the certainty diminished merely because the trial
judge has not yet entered judgment, when that fact has no
bearing on whether a Rule 3A:15(b) motion will be granted?
The plurality never tells us, for it simply declares, without
support, elaboration, or explanation, that a verdict is more
uncertain than a judgment is. See supra, at 192-193, and
n. 17. The only reason it suggests for why the verdict here
was uncertain is rather remarkable--that Ramdass himself
said so. That is, the plurality relies upon the fact that a
convicted murderer with minimal education and a history of
drug experimentation including PCP and cocaine, App. 49,
said "I don't know" when asked if he could ever be released

from prison. Ante, at 177. This evidence is thinner thangossamer.

32

What's more, the plurality's assessment of certainties isinternally inconsistent. As explained earlier, the standard

for setting aside a verdict post-trial is the same regardlessof whether judgment has been entered. Accordingly, if the
verdict was uncertain in the Domino's Pizza case, that wasalso true for the Pizza Hut conviction. At the time of the
sentencing hearing in the capital murder case, the deadlinefor filing a motion under the Rule had not expired for either
the Domino's Pizza verdict or the Pizza Hut conviction.(The time for filing a motion for the Pizza Hut conviction
expired on February 12, 21 days after judgment had beenentered on that verdict. This was 13 days after the sentencing phase in the capital murder case ended.) Because therewas a possibility that the Pizza Hut conviction could have
been set aside before judgment was entered on the Domino'sPizza verdict (and therefore before Ramdass technically became parole ineligible), the certainty of the verdict was justas much in doubt for that conviction. The plurality, however, finds the Domino's Pizza verdict uncertain yet casts nodoubt on the Pizza Hut conviction. How can this possibly
be consistent? The plurality never says.Finally, the plurality's approach is entirely boundless. If
the kind of "hypothetical future developmen[t]" at issuehere is sufficient to make Simmons inapplicable, would it

32 The plurality also attempts to distinguish the hypotheticals in Simmons from those in Ramdass' case by pointing out that the former hypotheticals, if they happened, would do so after sentencing. Ante, at 168-
169. But the entire point of the hypotheticals is not whether they could
occur before sentencing, but whether they could occur before the defendant was technically declared parole ineligible. In Simmons, that was true
right up until the parole board made its determination. Simply because
the nuances of state law may create an opportunity for undermining parole
ineligibility earlier on does not make the possibility any less hypothetical
or undermine the ineligibility any less; the same principle is at work
either way.

be sufficient if, rather than having the possibility of a recentconviction being set aside by post-trial motion, an old prior

conviction could be set aside on appeal before judgment hadbeen entered on the Domino's Pizza verdict? Or under a
State's postconviction habeas procedure? More to the point,if the mere availability of a post-trial procedure to set aside
the verdict is enough, is the same true as well for the mere
availability of an appeal or state habeas review, so long asthe time had not expired for either? Old convictions necessary for a defendant's parole ineligibility can be set asideunder these procedures as well. And under each procedure
those prior convictions could potentially be set aside at thecrucial moment.

33

It is easy, in this case, to be distracted by the lack of anentry of judgment and the recentness of Ramdass' prior convictions. As the above examples demonstrate, however,these facts tend to detract from, rather than elucidate, the
relevant issue. If Simmons is inapplicable because at least
one of the defendant's prior convictions could be set asidebefore sentencing (or before the third strike becomes final,

or before whatever time the plurality might think is thecrucial moment), then it should not matter, under that reasoning, whether it is set aside by post-trial motion, on appeal,or through state (or federal) postconviction relief. What's
more, the plurality's reasoning would hold true so long asthese procedures are simply

available. Accordingly, it
would not matter whether a defendant's prior strikes werea day old, a year old, or 100 years old. Nor would it matter

that judgment had been entered on those prior convictions.So long as such procedures for setting aside old convictions

33 It is true that these old convictions--like the Pizza Hut conviction--
have had an entry of judgment and thus would count as strikes. But
under state law, a defendant must have three strikes at the same time to
be parole ineligible. If a strike were set aside before the defendant has
all three, he is just as much parole eligible as he would be if judgment
had never been entered on the verdict.

exist and remain technically available prior to a defendant'scapital murder sentencing phase, the defendant's eventual

parole ineligibility is just as uncertain at the crucial moment.The plurality, however, never addresses any of this, but
surely its holding today is an invitation to such possibilities.Indeed, if these possibilities make Simmons inapplicable,
does this not invite the very same circumvention of Simmons that would result if the rule turned entirely on statelaw (see supra, at 201), by allowing a State to render all

prior convictions uncertain simply by holding open sometheoretical possibility for postconviction relief at all times?
Given that appeals and various forms of postconviction re-lief undermine the certainty of a verdict or a "conviction"
every bit as much as does a procedure like Rule 3A:15(b)--indeed, probably more so--the plurality's reasoning either
draws an arbitrary line between these types of procedures,or it accepts that all of these possibilities make Simmons
inapplicable, in which case that due process right is eviscer-ated entirely.

34 It is abundantly clear that the proclaimed

"workable" rule the plurality claims to be following is anillusion.

Ante, at 166.No such arbitrary line-drawing is at all necessary to decide

this case. It is entirely sufficient simply to hold that Vir-ginia has offered not one reason for doubting that judgment
would be entered on the Domino's Pizza robbery verdict orfor doubting Ramdass' eventual parole ineligibility. Certainly it has offered no reason for thinking that the possibil34 The plurality says "[t]he Commonwealth is entitled to some deference,
in the context of its own parole laws, in determining the best reference
point for making the ineligibility determination." Ante, at 170; see also
ante, at 176 ("States may take different approaches and we see no support
for a rule that would require a State to declare a conviction final for purposes of a three-strikes statute once a verdict has been rendered"). But
the questions here are whether the federal due process standard must
abide by every state-law distinction, and if not, is abiding by the entry-ofjudgment distinction arbitrary, in light of the fact that that distinction has
absolutely no bearing on whether the verdict will be set aside?

Stevens, J., dissenting
ity of setting aside the Domino's Pizza robbery verdict isat all more likely than the hypothetical future developments

rejected in Simmons. This case thus falls squarely withinSimmons.

Though it is unnecessary to decide it here, a guilty verdictis the proper line. A guilty verdict against the defendant is
a natural breaking point in the uncertainties inherent in thetrial process. Before that time, the burden is on the State
to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Aguilty verdict, however, means that the defendant's presumption of innocence--with all of its attendant trial safe-guards--has been overcome. The verdict resolves the central question of the general issue of guilt. It marks the mostsignificant point of the adversary proceeding, and reflects a
fundamental shift in the probabilities regarding the defend-ant's fate. For that reason, it is the proper point at which a
line separating the hypothetical from the probable should bedrawn. Moreover, because the State itself can use the defendant's prior crimes to argue future dangerousness after ajury has rendered a verdict--as Virginia did here, see supra,
at 182-183, and n. 2--that is also the point at which the de-fendant's Simmons right should attach.

will certainly be contrary to our clearly established prece-dent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases." As I have explained, theVirginia Supreme Court applied

Simmons as if (a) its applica-bility was controlled entirely by state law and (b) the defendant's parole ineligibility is determined at the exact momentwhen the sentencing phase occurs. See supra, at 184-
185. But state law does not control Simmons' applicability,nor does the due process right turn on whether the defend530US1 Unit: $U70 [01-22-02 11:05:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
ant has already been found parole ineligible at the exact mo-ment of sentencing. Simmons itself makes this entirely

clear. Both aspects of the Virginia Supreme Court's hold-ing, then, applied a "rule that contradicts the governing law
set forth in" Simmons.We also held in Williams that "[a] state-court decision will
also be contrary to this Court's clearly established precedentif the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially
indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and never-theless arrives at a result different from our precedent."
529 U. S., at 406. The Virginia Supreme Court's decisionwas also contrary to

Simmons in this respect. Because the"hypothetical future developments" rejected in Simmons

are materially indistinguishable from the future possibilityhere, the Virginia court's decision is contrary to Simmons.

Even assuming the correct rule had been applied, theVirginia Supreme Court's decision would be an "unreasonable application" of Simmons. That court held that thePizza Hut conviction would count as a strike, but not the
Domino's Pizza robbery verdict. The only distinction is thelack of an entry of judgment, and the only reason that matters is because the verdict may be set aside by a post-trialmotion. But that possibility remains identical for both
crimes. To disregard one of those hypothetical possibilitiesbut not the other based on a state-law distinction that has
absolutely no relevance to the probability that the verdictwill be set aside is an unreasonable application of

Simmons.35

35 Three remaining points should be addressed. First, Teague v. Lane,
489 U. S. 288 (1989), does not bar relief. Teague's antiretroactivity doctrine is irrelevant here, as Simmons was decided before Ramdass' conviction became final. See 187 F. 3d 396, 404, n. 3 (CA4 1999) (case below).
Nor is Teague's bar of applying "new rules" on federal habeas review any
barrier; because Ramdass' case falls squarely within Simmons, that case
controls entirely, and no new rule is necessary.

The second point concerns the plurality's suggestion that Ramdass
might have waived his Simmons claim. See ante, at 162-163, 177. It is
not necessary to discuss the issue at length. It suffices to note that this

Stevens, J., dissenting

VI
Nothing in the above arguments should distract us fromthe fact that this is a simple case. The question turns on

whether the hypothetical possibility that the trial judgemight fail to sign a piece of paper entering judgment on a
guilty verdict should mean that the defendant is precludedfrom arguing his parole ineligibility to the jury. We should
also not be distracted by the plurality's red herring--the pos-sibility of setting aside the verdict by a post-trial motion.
Not only is that possibility indistinguishable from the non-exhaustive list of hypothetical future possibilities we dismissed in Simmons, but it also fails to distinguish this casefrom the many other possibilities that are part of the state
criminal justice system, and fails to distinguish Ramdass'convictions from each other.

The plurality's convoluted understanding of Simmons andits diverse implications necessitate a fair amount of disentangling of its argument. But, once again, this shouldnot divert us from the plain reality of this case. Juries want
to know about parole ineligibility. We know how important
is precisely the argument that Virginia raised on remand to the Virginia
Supreme Court. That court was not persuaded by the argument, nor was
any court during the entire state and federal habeas proceedings. See,
e. g., App. 219, 225-226, 281-284 (Magistrate's Report) (discussing its own
and other courts' rejection of waiver argument); 187 F. 3d, at 402 (case
below) (same). It is therefore not surprising that Virginia failed to argue
waiver in its brief in opposition and arguments not raised therein are
themselves normally deemed waived. See Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519
U. S. 61, 75, n. 13 (1996).

Finally, that Ramdass' counsel argued that he would go to jail "for the
rest of his life" does not at all satisfy Simmons' requirement. Ante,
at 161. The entire point of Simmons is that the jury will often misunderstand what it means to sentence a defendant to "life." Consequently, that
Ramdass was able to tell the jury he would get "life" simply does not help
unless he is also permitted to tell the jury that life means life without the
possibility of parole. Indeed, the very fact that the jury's question came
after counsel made this argument demonstrates that the jury was uncertain about what that statement meant.

it is to their life-and-death decisionmaking. We know howmisinformed they are likely to be if we do not give them

this information. We know Simmons has worked,36 and weknow the States have wholeheartedly embraced it.

37

Moreover, we know this jury thought the information wascritical; we know this jury misunderstood what a "life" sentence meant; we know this jury would have recommendedlife instead of death if it had known that Ramdass was parole
ineligible; and we know this jury did not get a clear answerto its question. We also know that Virginia entrusts to the
jury the solemn duty of recommending life or death for thedefendant. Why does the Court insist that the Constitution
permits the wool to be pulled over their eyes?I respectfully dissent.

36 See, e. g., Finn, Washington Post, at A1 (recounting how, after Virginia
adopted life without parole alternative in 1995, and after Simmons, "[t]he
number of people given the death sentence in Virginia has plummeted,"
and describing "[s]imilar declines . . . in Georgia and Indiana" as well as
in Maryland).

PEGRAM et al. v. HERDRICH
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 98-1949. Argued February 23, 2000--Decided June 12, 2000
Petitioners (collectively Carle) function as a health maintenance organization (HMO) owned by physicians providing prepaid medical services to
participants whose employers contract with Carle for coverage. Respondent Herdrich was covered by Carle through her husband's employer, State Farm Insurance Company. After petitioner Pegram, a
Carle physician, required Herdrich to wait eight days for an ultrasound
of her inflamed abdomen, her appendix ruptured, causing peritonitis.
She sued Carle in state court for, inter alia, fraud. Carle responded
that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
preempted the fraud counts and removed the case to federal court. The
District Court granted Carle summary judgment on one fraud count,
but granted Herdrich leave to amend the other. Her amended count
alleged that the provision of medical services under terms rewarding
physician owners for limiting medical care entailed an inherent or anticipatory breach of an ERISA fiduciary duty, since the terms created an
incentive to make decisions in the physicians' self-interest, rather than
the plan participants' exclusive interests. The District Court granted
Carle's motion to dismiss on the ground that Carle was not acting as an
ERISA fiduciary. The Seventh Circuit reversed the dismissal.

Held: Because mixed treatment and eligibility decisions by HMO physicians are not fiduciary decisions under ERISA, Herdrich does not state
an ERISA claim. Pp. 218-237.

(a) Whether Carle is a fiduciary when acting through its physician
owners depends on some background of fact and law about HMO organizations, medical benefit plans, fiduciary obligation, and the meaning of
Herdrich's allegations. The defining feature of an HMO is receipt of a
fixed fee for each patient enrolled under the terms of a contract to provide specified health care if needed. Like other risk bearing organizations, HMOs take steps to control costs. These measures are commonly
complemented by specific financial incentives to physicians, rewarding
them for decreasing utilization of health-care services, and penalizing
them for excessive treatment. Hence, an HMO physician's financial
interest lies in providing less care, not more. Herdrich argues that
Carle's incentive scheme of annually paying physician owners the profit
resulting from their own decisions rationing care distinguishes its plan

530US1 Unit: $U71 [11-21-01 13:53:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
212 PEGRAM v. HERDRICH

Syllabus
from HMOs generally, so that reviewing Carle's decision under a fiduciary standard would not open the door to claims against other HMOs.
However, inducement to ration care is the very point of any HMO
scheme, and rationing necessarily raises some risks while reducing others. Thus, any legal principle purporting to draw a line between good
and bad HMOs would embody a judgment about socially acceptable
medical risk that would turn on facts not readily accessible to courts
and on social judgments not wisely required of courts unless resort cannot be had to the legislature. Because courts are not in a position to
derive a sound legal principle to differentiate an HMO like Carle from
other HMOs, this Court assumes that the decisions listed in Herdrich's
count cannot be subject to a claim under fiduciary standards unless all
such decisions by all HMOs acting through their physicians are judged
by the same standards and subject to the same claims. Pp. 218-222.

(b) Under ERISA, a fiduciary is someone acting in the capacity of
manager, administrator, or financial adviser to a "plan," and Herdrich's
count accordingly charged Carle with a breach of fiduciary duty in discharging its obligations under State Farm's medical plan. The common
understanding of "plan" is a scheme decided upon in advance. Here
the scheme comprises a set of rules defining a beneficiary's rights and
providing for their enforcement. When employers contract with an
HMO to provide benefits to employees subject to ERISA, their agreement may, as here, provide elements of a plan by setting out the rules
under which beneficiaries will be entitled to care. ERISA's provision
that fiduciaries shall discharge their duties with respect to a plan "solely
in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries," 29 U. S. C.

$ 1104(a)(1), is rooted in the common law of trusts, but an ERISA fiduciary may also have financial interests adverse to beneficiaries. Thus,
in every case charging breach of ERISA fiduciary duty, the threshold
question is not whether the actions of some person providing services
under the plan adversely affected a beneficiary's interest, but whether
that person was performing a fiduciary function when taking the action
subject to complaint. Pp. 222-226.

(c) Herdrich claims that Carle became a fiduciary, acting through its
physicians, when it contracted with State Farm. It then breached its
duty to act solely in the beneficiaries' interest, making decisions affecting medical treatment while influenced by a scheme under which the
physician owners ultimately profited from their own choices to minimize
the medical services provided. Herdrich's count lists mixed eligibility
and treatment decisions: decisions relying on medical judgments in
order to make plan coverage determinations. Pp. 226-230.

(d) Congress did not intend an HMO to be treated as a fiduciary to
the extent that it makes mixed eligibility decisions acting through its

Syllabus
physicians. Congress is unlikely to have thought of such decisions as
fiduciary. The common law trustee's most defining concern is the payment of money in the beneficiary's interest, and mixed eligibility decisions have only a limited resemblance to that concern. Consideration
of the consequences of Herdrich's contrary view leave no doubt as to
Congress's intent. Recovery against for-profit HMOs for their mixed
decisions would be warranted simply upon a showing that the profit
incentive to ration care would generally affect such decisions, in derogation of the fiduciary standard to act in the patient's interest without
possibility of conflict. And since the provision for profits is what makes
a for-profit HMO a proprietary organization, Herdrich's remedy--return
of profit to the plan for the participants' benefit--would be nothing less
than elimination of the for-profit HMO. The Judiciary has no warrant
to precipitate the upheaval that would follow a refusal to dismiss Herdrich's claim. Congress, which has promoted the formation of HMOs
for 27 years, may choose to restrict its approval to certain preferred
forms, but the Judiciary would be acting contrary to congressional policy
if it were to entertain an ERISA fiduciary claim portending wholesale
attacks on existing HMOs solely because of their structure. The Seventh Circuit's attempt to confine the fiduciary breach to cases where the
sole purpose of delaying or withholding treatment is to increase the
physician's financial reward would also lead to fatal difficulties. The
HMO's defense would be that its physician acted for good medical reasons. For all practical purposes, every claim would boil down to a
malpractice claim, and the fiduciary standard would be nothing but the
traditional medical malpractice standard. The only value to plan participants of such an ERISA fiduciary action would be eligibility for
attorney's fees if they won. A physician would also be subject to suit
in federal court applying an ERISA standard of reasonable medical
skill. This would, in turn, seem to preempt a state malpractice claim,
even though ERISA does not preempt such claims absent a clear
manifestation of congressional purpose, New York State Conference of
Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645.

Petitioners, Carle Clinic Association, P. C., Health AllianceMedical Plans, Inc., and Carle Health Insurance Management

Co., Inc. (collectively Carle), function as a health mainte-nance organization (HMO) organized for profit. Its owners
are physicians providing prepaid medical services to partici-pants whose employers contract with Carle to provide such
coverage. Respondent, Cynthia Herdrich, was covered byCarle through her husband's employer, State Farm Insurance Company.The events in question began when a Carle physician, petitioner Lori Pegram,1 examined Herdrich, who was experi-encing pain in the midline area of her groin. Six days later,
Dr. Pegram discovered a six by eight centimeter inflamedmass in Herdrich's abdomen. Despite the noticeable inflammation, Dr. Pegram did not order an ultrasound diagnos-tic procedure at a local hospital, but decided that Herdrich
would have to wait eight more days for an ultrasound, to beperformed at a facility staffed by Carle more than 50 miles
away. Before the eight days were over, Herdrich's appendixruptured, causing peritonitis. See 154 F. 3d 362, 365, n. 1
(CA7 1998).Herdrich sued Pegram and Carle in state court for medical
malpractice, and she later added two counts charging state-law fraud. Carle and Pegram responded that ERISA preempted the new counts, and removed the case to federalcourt,

take no position on whether or not the case was properly removed. As
we will explain, Herdrich's amended complaint alleged ERISA violations,
over which the federal courts have jurisdiction, and we therefore have
jurisdiction regardless of the correctness of the removal. See Grubbs v.

state-law fraud counts. The District Court granted theirmotion as to the second fraud count but granted Herdrich

leave to amend the one remaining. This she did by allegingthat provision of medical services under the terms of the
Carle HMO organization, rewarding its physician owners forlimiting medical care, entailed an inherent or anticipatory
breach of an ERISA fiduciary duty, since these terms createdan incentive to make decisions in the physicians' self-interest,
rather than the exclusive interests of plan participants.3

3 The specific allegations were these:
"11. Defendants are fiduciaries with respect to the Plan and under 29
[U. S. C. $ ]1109(a) are obligated to discharge their duties with respect to
the Plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and

"i. providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and
"ii. defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan;
"b. with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances
then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar
with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like
character and like aims.

"12. In breach of that duty:

"a. CARLE owner/physicians are the officers and directors of HAMP
and CHIMCO and receive a year-end distribution, based in large part
upon, supplemental medical expense payments made to CARLE by
HAMP and CHIMCO;

"b. Both HAMP and CHIMCO are directed and controlled by CARLE
owner/physicians and seek to fund their supplemental medical expense
payments to CARLE:

"i. by contracting with CARLE owner/physicians to provide the medical services contemplated in the Plan and then having those contracted
owner/physicians:

"(1) minimize the use of diagnostic tests;
"(2) minimize the use of facilities not owned by CARLE; and
"(3) minimize the use of emergency and non-emergency consultation
and/or referrals to non-contracted physicians.

and determining:

Opinion of the Court
Herdrich sought relief under 29 U. S. C. $ 1109(a), whichprovides that

"[a]ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a planwho breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or
duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shallbe personally liable to make good to such plan any losses

have been made through use of assets of the plan by thefiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable
or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate,including removal of such fiduciary."

When Carle moved to dismiss the ERISA count for failureto state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the District Court granted the motion, accepting the MagistrateJudge's determination that Carle was not "involved [in these
events] as" an ERISA fiduciary. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a.The original malpractice counts were then tried to a jury,
and Herdrich prevailed on both, receiving $35,000 in compen-sation for her injury. 154 F. 3d, at 367. She then appealed
the dismissal of the ERISA claim to the Court of Appealsfor the Seventh Circuit, which reversed. The court held
that Carle was acting as a fiduciary when its physicians madethe challenged decisions and that Herdrich's allegations were
sufficient to state a claim:

"Our decision does not stand for the proposition that theexistence of incentives automatically gives rise to a

II
Whether Carle is a fiduciary when it acts through its phy-sician owners as pleaded in the ERISA count depends on

some background of fact and law about HMOs, medical bene-fit plans, fiduciary obligation, and the meaning of Herdrich's
allegations. A

Traditionally, medical care in the United States has beenprovided on a "fee-for-service" basis. A physician charges
so much for a general physical exam, a vaccination, a tonsil-lectomy, and so on. The physician bills the patient for services provided or, if there is insurance and the doctor is will-ing, submits the bill for the patient's care to the insurer, for
payment subject to the terms of the insurance agreement.Cf. R. Rosenblatt, S. Law, & S. Rosenbaum, Law and the
American Health Care System 543-544 (1997) (hereinafterRosenblatt) (citing Weiner & de Lissovoy, Razing a Tower of
Babel: A Taxonomy for Managed Care and Health InsurancePlans, 18 J. Health Politics, Policy & Law 75, 76-78 (Summer
1993)). In a fee-for-service system, a physician's financialincentive is to provide more care, not less, so long as payment is forthcoming. The check on this incentive is a phy-sician's obligation to exercise reasonable medical skill and
judgment in the patient's interest.Beginning in the late 1960's, insurers and others developed
new models for health-care delivery, including HMOs. Cf.Rosenblatt 546. The defining feature of an HMO is receipt
of a fixed fee for each patient enrolled under the terms of acontract to provide specified health care if needed. The
HMO thus assumes the financial risk of providing the bene530US1 Unit: $U71 [11-21-01 13:53:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

219Cite as: 530 U. S. 211 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
fits promised: if a participant never gets sick, the HMO keeps
the money regardless, and if a participant becomes expensively ill, the HMO is responsible for the treatment agreed
upon even if its cost exceeds the participant's premiums.

Like other risk-bearing organizations, HMOs take steps to
control costs. At the least, HMOs, like traditional insurers,
will in some fashion make coverage determinations, scrutinizing requested services against the contractual provisions
to make sure that a request for care falls within the scope of
covered circumstances (pregnancy, for example), or that a
given treatment falls within the scope of the care promised
(surgery, for instance). They customarily issue general
guidelines for their physicians about appropriate levels of
care. See id., at 568-570. And they commonly require utilization review (in which specific treatment decisions are reviewed by a decisionmaker other than the treating physician)
and approval in advance (precertification) for many types of
care, keyed to standards of medical necessity or the reasonableness of the proposed treatment. See Andresen, Is Utilization Review the Practice of Medicine?, Implications for
Managed Care Administrators, 19 J. Legal Med. 431, 432
(Sept. 1998). These cost-controlling measures are commonly
complemented by specific financial incentives to physicians,
rewarding them for decreasing utilization of health-care
services, and penalizing them for what may be found to
be excessive treatment, see Rosenblatt 563-565; Iglehart,
Health Policy Report: The American Health Care System--
Managed Care, 327 New England J. Med. 742, 742-747 (1992).
Hence, in an HMO system, a physician's financial interest
lies in providing less care, not more. The check on this influence (like that on the converse, fee-for-service incentive) is
the professional obligation to provide covered services with
a reasonable degree of skill and judgment in the patient's
interest. See Brief for American Medical Association as
Amicus Curiae 17-21.

220 PEGRAM v. HERDRICH

Opinion of the Court
The adequacy of professional obligation to counter finan-cial self-interest has been challenged no matter what the

form of medical organization. HMOs became popular be-cause fee-for-service physicians were thought to be providing unnecessary or useless services; today, many doctors andother observers argue that HMOs often ignore the individual
needs of a patient in order to improve the HMOs' bottomlines. See,

e. g., 154 F. 3d, at 375-378 (citing various criticsof HMOs).
4 In this case, for instance, one could argue that

Pegram's decision to wait before getting an ultrasound forHerdrich, and her insistence that the ultrasound be done at

a distant facility owned by Carle, reflected an interest inlimiting the HMO's expenses, which blinded her to the need
for immediate diagnosis and treatment.

B
Herdrich focuses on the Carle scheme's provision for a"year-end distribution," n. 3,

supra, to the HMO's physicianowners. She argues that this particular incentive device of

annually paying physician owners the profit resulting fromtheir own decisions rationing care can distinguish Carle's organization from HMOs generally, so that reviewing Carle'sdecisions under a fiduciary standard as pleaded in Herdrich's
complaint would not open the door to like claims about otherHMO structures. While the Court of Appeals agreed, we
think otherwise, under the law as now written.Although it is true that the relationship between sparing
medical treatment and physician reward is not a subtle oneunder the Carle scheme, no HMO organization could survive
without some incentive connecting physician reward withtreatment rationing. The essence of an HMO is that salaries and profits are limited by the HMO's fixed membershipfees. See Orentlicher, Paying Physicians More To Do Less:
Financial Incentives to Limit Care, 30 U. Rich. L. Rev. 155,

4 There are, of course, contrary perspectives, and we endorse neither
side of the debate today.

Opinion of the Court
174 (1996). This is not to suggest that the Carle provisionsare as socially desirable as some other HMO organizational

schemes; they may not be. See, e. g., Grumbach, Osmond,Vranigan, Jaffe, & Bindman, Primary Care Physicians' Experience of Financial Incentives in Managed-Care Systems, 339New England J. Med. 1516 (1998) (arguing that HMOs that
reward quality of care and patient satisfaction would be preferable to HMOs that reward only physician productivity).But whatever the HMO, there must be rationing and inducement to ration.Since inducement to ration care goes to the very point of
any HMO scheme, and rationing necessarily raises some
risks while reducing others (ruptured appendixes are more
likely; unnecessary appendectomies are less so), any legal
principle purporting to draw a line between good and bad
HMOs would embody, in effect, a judgment about socially
acceptable medical risk. A valid conclusion of this sort
would, however, necessarily turn on facts to which courts
would probably not have ready access: correlations between
malpractice rates and various HMO models, similar correlations involving fee-for-service models, and so on. And, of
course, assuming such material could be obtained by courts
in litigation like this, any standard defining the unacceptably
risky HMO structure (and consequent vulnerability to claims
like Herdrich's) would depend on a judgment about the appropriate level of expenditure for health care in light of the
associated malpractice risk. But such complicated factfinding and such a debatable social judgment are not wisely required of courts unless for some reason resort cannot be had
to the legislative process, with its preferable forum for comprehensive investigations and judgments of social value, such
as optimum treatment levels and health-care expenditure.

665-666 (1994) (plurality opinion) ("Congress is far better equipped than the judiciary to `amass and evaluate the

and dynamic as that presented here" (quoting Walters v. Na-tional Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 331, n. 12

(1985))); Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 513(1982) ("[T]he relevant policy considerations do not invariably point in one direction, and there is vehement disagree-ment over the validity of the assumptions underlying many
of them. The very difficulty of these policy considerations,and Congress' superior institutional competence to pursue
this debate, suggest that legislative not judicial solutions arepreferable" (footnote omitted)).

We think, then, that courts are not in a position to derivea sound legal principle to differentiate an HMO like Carle
from other HMOs.5 For that reason, we proceed on the as-sumption that the decisions listed in Herdrich's complaint
cannot be subject to a claim that they violate fiduciary stand-ards unless all such decisions by all HMOs acting through
their owner or employee physicians are to be judged by thesame standards and subject to the same claims.

C
We turn now from the structure of HMOs to the require-ments of ERISA. A fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA

must be someone acting in the capacity of manager, admin-istrator, or financial adviser to a "plan," see 29 U. S. C.

$$ 1002(21)(A)(i)-(iii), and Herdrich's ERISA count accord-ingly charged Carle with a breach of fiduciary duty in discharging its obligations under State Farm's medical plan.App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a-86a. ERISA's definition of an employee welfare benefit plan is ultimately circular: "any plan,fund, or program . . . to the extent that such plan, fund, or
program was established . . . for the purpose of providing . . .through the purchase of insurance or otherwise . . . medical,

5 They are certainly not capable of making that distinction on a motion
to dismiss; if we accepted the Court of Appeals's reasoning, complaints
against any flavor of HMO would have to proceed at least to the summary
judgment stage.

surgical, or hospital care or benefits." $ 1002(1)(A). One isthus left to the common understanding of the word "plan" as

referring to a scheme decided upon in advance, see Webster'sNew International Dictionary 1879 (2d ed. 1957); Jacobson &
Pomfret, Form, Function, and Managed Care Torts: Achiev-ing Fairness and Equity in ERISA Jurisprudence, 35 Houston L. Rev. 985, 1050 (1998). Here the scheme comprises aset of rules that define the rights of a beneficiary and provide
for their enforcement. Rules governing collection of premi-ums, definition of benefits, submission of claims, and resolution of disagreements over entitlement to services are thesorts of provisions that constitute a plan. See

Hansen v.Continental Ins. Co., 940 F. 2d 971, 977 (CA5 1991). Thus,

when employers contract with an HMO to provide benefitsto employees subject to ERISA, the provisions of documents
that set up the HMO are not, as such, an ERISA plan; butthe agreement between an HMO and an employer who pays
the premiums may, as here, provide elements of a plan bysetting out rules under which beneficiaries will be entitled
to care. D

As just noted, fiduciary obligations can apply to managing,advising, and administering an ERISA plan, the fiduciary
function addressed by Herdrich's ERISA count being the ex-ercise of "discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of [an ERISA] plan," 29 U. S. C.$ 1002(21)(A)(iii). And as we have already suggested, although Carle is not an ERISA fiduciary merely because itadministers or exercises discretionary authority over its own
HMO business, it may still be a fiduciary if it administersthe plan.

In general terms, fiduciary responsibility under ERISA issimply stated. The statute provides that fiduciaries shall
discharge their duties with respect to a plan "solely in theinterest of the participants and beneficiaries," $ 1104(a)(1),
that is, "for the exclusive purpose of (i) providing benefits to

Opinion of the Court
participants and their beneficiaries; and (ii) defraying reason-able expenses of administering the plan," $ 1104(a)(1)(A).

These responsibilities imposed by ERISA have the familiarring of their source in the common law of trusts. See Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund v.Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570 (1985) ("[R]ather
than explicitly enumerating all of the powers and duties oftrustees and other fiduciaries, Congress invoked the common
law of trusts to define the general scope of their authorityand responsibility"). Thus, the common law (understood
as including what were once the distinct rules of equity)charges fiduciaries with a duty of loyalty to guarantee beneficiaries' interests: "The most fundamental duty owed by thetrustee to the beneficiaries of the trust is the duty of
loyalty. . . . It is the duty of a trustee to administer the trust
solely in the interest of the beneficiaries." 2A A. Scott &W. Fratcher, Trusts $ 170, p. 311 (4th ed. 1987) (hereinafter

Scott); see also G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and
Trustees $ 543 (rev. 2d ed. 1980) ("Perhaps the most funda-mental duty of a trustee is that he must display throughout

the administration of the trust complete loyalty to the inter-ests of the beneficiary and must exclude all selfish interest
and all consideration of the interests of third persons"); Central States, supra, at 570-571; Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N. Y.

Opinion of the Court
forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for thoseacting at arm's length, are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary ties. A trustee is held to something stricter than themorals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the
punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standardof behavior").

Beyond the threshold statement of responsibility, however,
the analogy between ERISA fiduciary and common lawtrustee becomes problematic. This is so because the trustee

at common law characteristically wears only his fiduciary hatwhen he takes action to affect a beneficiary, whereas the
trustee under ERISA may wear different hats.

Speaking of the traditional trustee, Professor Scott's treatise admonishes that the trustee "is not permitted to place
himself in a position where it would be for his own benefit
to violate his duty to the beneficiaries." 2A Scott $ 170, at
311. Under ERISA, however, a fiduciary may have financial
interests adverse to beneficiaries. Employers, for example,
can be ERISA fiduciaries and still take actions to the disadvantage of employee beneficiaries, when they act as employers (e. g., firing a beneficiary for reasons unrelated to the
ERISA plan), or even as plan sponsors (e. g., modifying the
terms of a plan as allowed by ERISA to provide less generous benefits). Nor is there any apparent reason in the
ERISA provisions to conclude, as Herdrich argues, that this
tension is permissible only for the employer or plan sponsor, to the exclusion of persons who provide services to an
ERISA plan.

ERISA does require, however, that the fiduciary with two
hats wear only one at a time, and wear the fiduciary hat
when making fiduciary decisions. See Hughes Aircraft Co.
v. Jacobson, 525 U. S. 432, 443-444 (1999); Varity Corp. v.
Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996). Thus, the statute does not
describe fiduciaries simply as administrators of the plan, or
managers or advisers. Instead it defines an administrator, for example, as a fiduciary only "to the extent" that he

226 PEGRAM v. HERDRICH

Opinion of the Court
acts in such a capacity in relation to a plan. 29 U. S. C.$ 1002(21)(A). In every case charging breach of ERISA fiduciary duty, then, the threshold question is not whether theactions of some person employed to provide services under
a plan adversely affected a plan beneficiary's interest, butwhether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was
performing a fiduciary function) when taking the action sub-ject to complaint.

E
The allegations of Herdrich's ERISA count that identifythe claimed fiduciary breach are difficult to understand. In

this count, Herdrich does not point to a particular act by anyCarle physician owner as a breach. She does not complain
about Pegram's actions, and at oral argument her counselconfirmed that the ERISA count could have been brought,
and would have been no different, if Herdrich had never hada sick day in her life. Tr. of Oral Arg. 53-54.

What she does claim is that Carle, acting through its phy-sician owners, breached its duty to act solely in the interest
of beneficiaries by making decisions affecting medical treat-ment while influenced by the terms of the Carle HMO
scheme, under which the physician owners ultimately profitfrom their own choices to minimize the medical services provided. She emphasizes the threat to fiduciary responsibilityin the Carle scheme's feature of a year-end distribution to
the physicians of profit derived from the spread between sub-scription income and expenses of care and administration.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a.The specific payout detail of the plan was, of course, a feature that the employer as plan sponsor was free to adoptwithout breach of any fiduciary duty under ERISA, since
an employer's decisions about the content of a plan are notthemselves fiduciary acts.

Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517U. S. 882, 887 (1996) ("Nothing in ERISA requires employers

to establish employee benefit plans. Nor does ERISA man-date what kind of benefits employers must provide if they

Opinion of the Court
choose to have such a plan").7 Likewise it is clear that therewas no violation of ERISA when the incorporators of the

Carle HMO provided for the year-end payout. The HMO isnot the ERISA plan, and the incorporation of the HMO preceded its contract with the State Farm plan. See 29 U. S. C.$ 1109(b) (no fiduciary liability for acts preceding fiduciary
status).The nub of the claim, then, is that when State Farm contracted with Carle, Carle became a fiduciary under the plan,acting through its physicians. At once, Carle as fiduciary
administrator was subject to such influence from the year-end payout provision that its fiduciary capacity was necessarily compromised, and its readiness to act amounted to antici-patory breach of fiduciary obligation.

F
The pleadings must also be parsed very carefully to under-stand what acts by physician owners acting on Carle's behalf

are alleged to be fiduciary in nature.8 It will help to keep

7 It does not follow that those who administer a particular plan design
may not have difficulty in following fiduciary standards if the design is
awkward enough. A plan might lawfully provide for a bonus for administrators who denied benefits to every 10th beneficiary, but it would be difficult for an administrator who received the bonus to defend against the
claim that he had not been solely attentive to the beneficiaries' interests
in carrying out his administrative duties. The important point is that
Herdrich is not suing the employer, State Farm, and her claim cannot be
analyzed as if she were.

8 Herdrich argues that Carle is judicially estopped from denying its fiduciary status as to the relevant decisions, because it sought and sucessfully defended removal of Herdrich's state action to the Federal District
Court on the ground that it was a fiduciary with respect to Herdrich's
fraud claims. Judicial estoppel generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase. See Rissetto v. Plumbers &
Steamfitters Local 343, 94 F. 3d 597, 605 (CA9 1996). The fraud claims in
Herdrich's initial complaint, however, could be read to allege breach of a
fiduciary obligation to disclose physician incentives to limit care, whereas

Opinion of the Court
two sorts of arguably administrative acts in mind. Cf.Dukes v. U. S. Healthcare, Inc., 57 F. 3d 350, 361 (CA3 1995)

(discussing dual medical/administrative roles of HMOs).What we will call pure "eligibility decisions" turn on the
plan's coverage of a particular condition or medical procedurefor its treatment. "Treatment decisions," by contrast, are
choices about how to go about diagnosing and treating a pa-tient's condition: given a patient's constellation of symptoms,
what is the appropriate medical response?These decisions are often practically inextricable from one
another, as amici on both sides agree. See Brief for Wash-ington Legal Foundation as

Amicus Curiae 12; Brief forHealth Law, Policy, and Ethics Scholars as Amici Curiae 10.

This is so not merely because, under a scheme like Carle's,treatment and eligibility decisions are made by the same person, the treating physician. It is so because a great manyand possibly most coverage questions are not simple yesor-no questions, like whether appendicitis is a covered condi-tion (when there is no dispute that a patient has appendicitis), or whether acupuncture is a covered procedure for painrelief (when the claim of pain is unchallenged). The more
common coverage question is a when-and-how question. Alher amended complaint alleges an obligation to avoid such incentives. Although we are not presented with the issue here, it could be argued that
Carle is a fiduciary insofar as it has discretionary authority to administer
the plan, and so it is obligated to disclose characteristics of the plan and
of those who provide services to the plan, if that information affects beneficiaries' material interests. See, e. g., Glaziers and Glassworkers Union
Local No. 252 Annuity Fund v. Newbridge Securities, Inc., 93 F. 3d 1171,
1179-1181 (CA3 1996) (discussing the disclosure obligations of an ERISA
fiduciary); cf. Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 505 (1996) (holding that
ERISA fiduciaries may have duties to disclose information about plan
prospects that they have no duty, or even power, to change).

But failure to disclose is no longer the allegation of the amended complaint. Because fiduciary duty to disclose is not necessarily coextensive
with fiduciary responsibility for the subject matter of the disclosure, Carle
is not estopped from contesting its fiduciary status with respect to the
allegations of the amended complaint.

Opinion of the Court
though coverage for many conditions will be clear and vari-ous treatment options will be indisputably compensable, physicians still must decide what to do in particular cases. Theissue may be, say, whether one treatment option is so superior to another under the circumstances, and needed sopromptly, that a decision to proceed with it would meet the
medical necessity requirement that conditions the HMO's ob-ligation to provide or pay for that particular procedure at
that time in that case. The Government in its brief alludesto a similar example when it discusses an HMO's refusal
to pay for emergency care on the ground that the situation
giving rise to the need for care was not an emergency, Brieffor United States as

Amicus Curiae 20-21.9 In practical
terms, these eligibility decisions cannot be untangled fromphysicians' judgments about reasonable medical treatment,

and in the case before us, Dr. Pegram's decision was one ofthat sort. She decided (wrongly, as it turned out) that Herdrich's condition did not warrant immediate action; the consequence of that medical determination was that Carle wouldnot cover immediate care, whereas it would have done so if

Dr. Pegram had made the proper diagnosis and judgmentto treat. The eligibility decision and the treatment decision
were inextricably mixed, as they are in countless medicaladministrative decisions every day.

The kinds of decisions mentioned in Herdrich's ERISAcount and claimed to be fiduciary in character are just such
mixed eligibility and treatment decisions: physicians' conclu-sions about when to use diagnostic tests; about seeking consultations and making referrals to physicians and facilitiesother than Carle's; about proper standards of care, the ex9 ERISA makes separate provision for suits to receive particular benefits. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(1)(B). We have no occasion to discuss the
standards governing such a claim by a patient who, as in the example in
text, was denied reimbursement for emergency care. Nor have we reason
to discuss the interaction of such a claim with state-law causes of action,
see infra, at 235-237.

Opinion of the Court
perimental character of a proposed course of treatment, the
reasonableness of a certain treatment, and the emergency
character of a medical condition.

We do not read the ERISA count, however, as alleging
fiduciary breach with reference to a different variety of administrative decisions, those we have called pure eligibility
determinations, such as whether a plan covers an undisputed
case of appendicitis. Nor do we read it as claiming breach
by reference to discrete administrative decisions separate
from medical judgments; say, rejecting a claim for no other
reason than the HMO's financial condition. The closest Herdrich's ERISA count comes to stating a claim for a pure,
unmixed eligibility decision is her general allegation that
Carle determines "which claims are covered under the Plan
and to what extent," App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a. But this
vague statement, difficult to interpret in isolation, is given
content by the other elements of the complaint, all of which
refer to decisions thoroughly mixed with medical judgment.
Cf. 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1357, pp. 320-321 (1990) (noting that, where specific
allegations clarify the meaning of broader allegations, they
may be used to interpret the complaint as a whole). Any
lingering uncertainty about what Herdrich has in mind is
dispelled by her brief, which explains that this allegation,
like the others, targets medical necessity determinations.

10 Though this case involves a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the complaint should therefore be construed
generously, we may use Herdrich's brief to clarify allegations in her complaint whose meaning is unclear. See C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal

Opinion of the Court

III

A

Based on our understanding of the matters just discussed,
we think Congress did not intend Carle or any other HMO
to be treated as a fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed
eligibility decisions acting through its physicians. We begin
with doubt that Congress would ever have thought of a
mixed eligibility decision as fiduciary in nature. At common
law, fiduciary duties characteristically attach to decisions
about managing assets and distributing property to beneficiaries. See Bogert & Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees

$$ 551, 741-747, 751-775, 781-799; 2A Scott $$ 176, 181; 3 id.,

$$ 188-193; 3A id., $ 232. Trustees buy, sell, and lease investment property, lend and borrow, and do other things to
conserve and nurture assets. They pay out income, choose
beneficiaries, and distribute remainders at termination.
Thus, the common law trustee's most defining concern historically has been the payment of money in the interest of the
beneficiary.

Mixed eligibility decisions by an HMO acting through its
physicians have, however, only a limited resemblance to the
usual business of traditional trustees. To be sure, the physicians (like regular trustees) draw on resources held for others and make decisions to distribute them in accordance with
entitlements expressed in a written instrument (embodying
the terms of an ERISA plan). It is also true that the objects of many traditional private and public trusts are ultimately the same as the ERISA plans that contract with
HMOs. Private trusts provide medical care to the poor;
thousands of independent hospitals are privately held and
publicly accountable trusts, and charitable foundations make
grants to stimulate the provision of health services. But
beyond this point the resemblance rapidly wanes. Traditional trustees administer a medical trust by paying out

530US1 Unit: $U71 [11-21-01 13:53:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
232 PEGRAM v. HERDRICH

Opinion of the Court
money to buy medical care, whereas physicians makingmixed eligibility decisions consume the money as well. Private trustees do not make treatment judgments, whereastreatment judgments are what physicians reaching mixed
decisions do make, by definition. Indeed, the physiciansthrough whom HMOs act make just the sorts of decisions
made by licensed medical practitioners millions of timesevery day, in every possible medical setting: HMOs, fee-forservice proprietorships, public and private hospitals, mili-tary field hospitals, and so on. The settings bear no more
resemblance to trust departments than a decision to operateturns on the factors controlling the amount of a quarterly
income distribution. Thus, it is at least questionablewhether Congress would have had mixed eligibility decisions
in mind when it provided that decisions administering a planwere fiduciary in nature. Indeed, when Congress took up
the subject of fiduciary responsibility under ERISA, it con-centrated on fiduciaries' financial decisions, focusing on pension plans, the difficulty many retirees faced in getting thepayments they expected, and the financial mismanagement
that had too often deprived employees of their benefits.See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 93-127, p. 5 (1973); S. Rep. No. 93-383,
p. 17 (1973); id., at 95. Its focus was far from the subject ofHerdrich's claim.

Our doubt that Congress intended the category of fidu-ciary administrative functions to encompass the mixed determinations at issue here hardens into conviction when we con-sider the consequences that would follow from Herdrich's
contrary view. B

First, we need to ask how this fiduciary standard wouldaffect HMOs if it applied as Herdrich claims it should be
applied, not directed against any particular mixed decisionthat injured a patient, but against HMOs that make mixed
decisions in the course of providing medical care for profit.Recovery would be warranted simply upon showing that the

530US1 Unit: $U71 [11-21-01 13:53:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

233Cite as: 530 U. S. 211 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
profit incentive to ration care would generally affect mixeddecisions, in derogation of the fiduciary standard to act solely

in the interest of the patient without possibility of conflict.Although Herdrich is vague about the mechanics of relief,
the one point that seems clear is that she seeks the returnof profit from the pockets of the Carle HMO's owners, with
the money to be given to the plan for the benefit of the par-ticipants. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1109(a) (return of all profits is an
appropriate ERISA remedy). Since the provision for profitis what makes the HMO a proprietary organization, her remedy in effect would be nothing less than elimination of thefor-profit HMO. Her remedy might entail even more than
that, although we are in no position to tell whether and towhat extent nonprofit HMO schemes would ultimately survive the recognition of Herdrich's theory.11 It is enough torecognize that the Judiciary has no warrant to precipitate
the upheaval that would follow a refusal to dismiss Her-drich's ERISA claim. The fact is that for over 27 years the
Congress of the United States has promoted the formationof HMO practices. The Health Maintenance Organization
Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 914, 42 U. S. C. $ 300e et seq., allowedthe formation of HMOs that assume financial risks for the
provision of health-care services, and Congress has amendedthe Act several times, most recently in 1996. See 110 Stat.
1976, 42 U. S. C. $ 300e (1994 ed., Supp. III). If Congresswishes to restrict its approval of HMO practice to certain

11 Herdrich's theory might well portend the end of nonprofit HMOs as
well, since those HMOs can set doctors' salaries. A claim against a nonprofit HMO could easily allege that salaries were excessively high because

Opinion of the Court
preferred forms, it may choose to do so. But the Federal
Judiciary would be acting contrary to the congressional policy of allowing HMO organizations if it were to entertain
an ERISA fiduciary claim portending wholesale attacks on
existing HMOs solely because of their structure, untethered
to claims of concrete harm.

C

The Court of Appeals did not purport to entertain quite
the broadside attack that Herdrich's ERISA claim thus entails, see 154 F. 3d, at 373, and the second possible consequence of applying the fiduciary standard that requires our
attention would flow from the difficulty of extending it to
particular mixed decisions that on Herdrich's theory are fiduciary in nature.

The fiduciary is, of course, obliged to act exclusively in the
interest of the beneficiary, but this translates into no rule
readily applicable to HMO decisions or those of any other
variety of medical practice. While the incentive of the HMO
physician is to give treatment sparingly, imposing a fiduciary
obligation upon him would not lead to a simple default rule,
say, that whenever it is reasonably possible to disagree about
treatment options, the physician should treat aggressively.
After all, HMOs came into being because some groups of
physicians consistently provided more aggressive treatment
than others in similar circumstances, with results not perceived as justified by the marginal expense and risk associated with intervention; excessive surgery is not in the patient's best interest, whether provided by fee-for-service
surgeons or HMO surgeons subject to a default rule urging
them to operate. Nor would it be possible to translate fiduciary duty into a standard that would allow recovery from
an HMO whenever a mixed decision influenced by the HMO's
financial incentive resulted in a bad outcome for the patient.
It would be so easy to allege, and to find, an economic influence when sparing care did not lead to a well patient, that

235Cite as: 530 U. S. 211 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
any such standard in practice would allow a factfinder toconvert an HMO into a guarantor of recovery.

These difficulties may have led the Court of Appeals totry to confine the fiduciary breach to cases where "the sole
purpose" of delaying or withholding treatment was to in-crease the physician's financial reward,

ibid. But this attempt to confine mixed decision claims to their most egregious examples entails erroneous corruption of fiduciaryobligation and would simply lead to further difficulties that

we think fatal. While a mixed decision made solely to bene-fit the HMO or its physician would violate a fiduciary duty,
the fiduciary standard condemns far more than that, in its
requirement of "an eye single" toward beneficiaries' interests, Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 F. 2d 263, 271 (CA2 1982).
But whether under the Court of Appeals's rule or a straight
standard of undivided loyalty, the defense of any HMO would
be that its physician did not act out of financial interest but
for good medical reasons, the plausibility of which would require reference to standards of reasonable and customary
medical practice in like circumstances. That, of course, is
the traditional standard of the common law. See W. Keeton,
D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owens, Prosser and Keeton on
Law of Torts $ 32, pp. 188-189 (5th ed. 1984). Thus, for all
practical purposes, every claim of fiduciary breach by an
HMO physician making a mixed decision would boil down
to a malpractice claim, and the fiduciary standard would be
nothing but the malpractice standard traditionally applied in
actions against physicians.

What would be the value to the plan participant of having
this kind of ERISA fiduciary action? It would simply apply
the law already available in state courts and federal diversity
actions today, and the formulaic addition of an allegation of
financial incentive would do nothing but bring the same
claim into a federal court under federal-question jurisdiction.
It is true that in States that do not allow malpractice actions
against HMOs the fiduciary claim would offer a plaintiff a

530US1 Unit: $U71 [11-21-01 13:53:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
236 PEGRAM v. HERDRICH

Opinion of the Court
further defendant to be sued for direct liability, and in somecases the HMO might have a deeper pocket than the physician. But we have seen enough to know that ERISA wasnot enacted out of concern that physicians were too poor to
be sued, or in order to federalize malpractice litigation in thename of fiduciary duty for any other reason. It is difficult,
in fact, to find any advantage to participants across the
board, except that allowing them to bring malpractice ac-tions in the guise of federal fiduciary breach claims against

HMOs would make them eligible for awards of attorney'sfees if they won. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(g)(1). But, again,
we can be fairly sure that Congress did not create fiduciary
obligations out of concern that state plaintiffs were not suing
often enough, or were paying too much in legal fees.

The mischief of Herdrich's position would, indeed, go further than mere replication of state malpractice actions with
HMO defendants. For not only would an HMO be liable as
a fiduciary in the first instance for its own breach of fiduciary
duty committed through the acts of its physician employee,
but the physician employee would also be subject to liability
as a fiduciary on the same basic analysis that would charge
the HMO. The physician who made the mixed administrative decision would be exercising authority in the
way described by ERISA and would therefore be deemed
to be a fiduciary. See 29 CFR $$ 2509.75-5, Question D-1;
2509.75-8, Question D-3 (1993) (stating that an individual
who exercises authority on behalf of an ERISA fiduciary in
interpreting and administering a plan will be deemed a fiduciary). Hence the physician, too, would be subject to suit
in federal court applying an ERISA standard of reasonable
medical skill. This result, in turn, would raise a puzzling
issue of preemption. On its face, federal fiduciary law applying a malpractice standard would seem to be a prescription
for preemption of state malpractice law, since the new
ERISA cause of action would cover the subject of a state-law
malpractice claim. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1144 (preempting state

laws that "relate to [an] employee benefit plan"). To be sure,New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield

Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 654-655 (1995),throws some cold water on the preemption theory; there, we
held that, in the field of health care, a subject of traditionalstate regulation, there is no ERISA preemption without
clear manifestation of congressional purpose. But in thatcase the convergence of state and federal law was not so
clear as in the situation we are positing; the state-law stand-ard had not been subsumed by the standard to be applied
under ERISA. We could struggle with this problem, butfirst it is well to ask, again, what would be gained by opening
the federal courthouse doors for a fiduciary malpracticeclaim, save for possibly random fortuities such as more favorable scheduling, or the ancillary opportunity to seek attor-ney's fees. And again, we know that Congress had no such
haphazard boons in prospect when it defined the ERISAfiduciary, nor such a risk to the efficiency of federal courts
as a new fiduciary malpractice jurisdiction would pose inwelcoming such unheard-of fiduciary litigation.

IV
We hold that mixed eligibility decisions by HMO physi-cians are not fiduciary decisions under ERISA. Herdrich's

ERISA count fails to state an ERISA claim, and the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

HARRIS TRUST AND SAVINGS BANK, as trustee

for the AMERITECH PENSION TRUST, et al. v.SALOMON SMITH BARNEY INC.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 99-579. Argued April 17, 2000--Decided June 12, 2000
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) bars a

fiduciary of an employee benefit plan from causing the plan to engage in
certain prohibited transactions with a "party in interest," $ 406(a), defined to encompass entities that a fiduciary might be inclined to favor at
the expense of the plan's beneficiaries, see $ 3(14). Section 406's prohibitions are subject to both statutory and regulatory exemptions. See

$$ 408(a), (b). The Ameritech Pension Trust (APT), an ERISA pension
plan, allegedly entered into a transaction prohibited by $ 406(a) and not
exempted by $ 408 with respondent Salomon Smith Barney Inc. (Salomon), a nonfiduciary party in interest. APT's fiduciaries--its trustee,
petitioner Harris Trust and Savings Bank, and its administrator, petitioner Ameritech Corporation--sued Salomon under $ 502(a)(3), which
authorizes a fiduciary, inter alios, to bring a civil action to obtain
"appropriate equitable relief" to redress violations of ERISA Title I.
Salomon moved for summary judgment, arguing that $ 502(a)(3), when
used to remedy a transaction prohibited by $ 406(a), authorizes a suit
only against the party expressly constrained by $ 406(a)--the fiduciary
who caused the plan to enter the transaction--and not against the counterparty to the transaction. The District Court denied the motion,
holding that ERISA provides a private cause of action against nonfiduciaries who participate in a prohibited transaction, but granted Salomon's motion for certification of the issue for interlocutory appeal. The
Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the authority to sue under

$ 502(a)(3) does not extend to a suit against a nonfiduciary "party in
interest" to a transaction barred by $ 406(a).

Held: Section 502(a)(3)'s authorization to a plan "participant, beneficiary,

or fiduciary" to bring a civil action for "appropriate equitable relief "
extends to a suit against a nonfiduciary "party in interest" to a prohibited transaction barred by $ 406(a). Pp. 245-254.

(a) In providing that "[a] fiduciary . . . shall not cause the plan to
engage in a [prohibited] transaction" (emphasis added), $ 406(a)(1) imposes a duty only on the fiduciary that causes the plan to engage in
the transaction. However, this Court rejects the Seventh Circuit's and

Syllabus
Salomon's conclusion that, absent a substantive ERISA provision expressly imposing a duty on a nonfiduciary party in interest, the nonfiduciary party may not be held liable under $ 502(a)(3), one of ERISA's
remedial provisions. Because $ 502(a)(3) itself imposes certain duties,
liability under that provision does not depend on whether ERISA's substantive provisions impose a specific duty on the party being sued.
While $ 502(a)(3) does not authorize "appropriate equitable relief" at
large, but only for the purpose of "redress[ing any] violations or . . .
enforc[ing] any provisions" of ERISA or an ERISA plan, e. g., Peacock
v. Thomas, 516 U. S. 349, 353, the section admits of no limit (aside from
the "appropriate equitable relief" caveat) on the universe of possible
defendants. Indeed, $ 502(a)(3) makes no mention at all of which parties may be proper defendants--the focus, instead, is on redressing the
"act or practice which violates any provision of [ERISA Title I]."
(Emphasis added.) Other provisions of ERISA, by contrast, expressly
address who may be a defendant. See, e. g., $ 409(a). And, in providing
that a "civil action may be brought by a participant, beneficiary, or
fiduciary" (emphasis added), $ 502(a) itself demonstrates Congress' care
in delineating the universe of plaintiffs who may bring certain civil
actions. The matter is conclusively resolved by $ 502(l), which provides
for assessment by the Secretary of Labor of a civil penalty against a
fiduciary or "other person" who knowingly participates in a fiduciary's
ERISA violation, defining the amount of such penalty by reference to
the amount "ordered by a court to be paid by such . . . other person . . . in
a judicial proceeding . . . by the Secretary under subsection . . . (a)(5)."
(Emphasis added.) The plain implication is that the Secretary may
bring a civil action under $ 502(a)(5) against an "other person" who
"knowing[ly] participat[es]" in a fiduciary's violation, notwithstanding
the absence of any ERISA provision explicitly imposing a duty upon an
"other person" not to engage in such knowing participation. It thus
follows that a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary may bring suit against
an "other person" under the similarly worded subsection (a)(3). See
Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 260. Id., at 261, distinguished. Section 502(l), therefore, refutes the notion that $ 502(a)(3) (or
(a)(5)) liability hinges on whether the particular defendant labors under
a duty expressly imposed by ERISA Title I's substantive provisions.
Pp. 245-249.

(b) The Court rejects Salomon's argument that it would contravene
common sense for Congress to impose civil liability on a party, such as
a nonfiduciary party in interest to a $ 406(a) transaction, that is not a
"wrongdoer" in the sense of violating a duty expressly imposed by
ERISA Title I's substantive provisions. This argument ignores the
limiting principle explicit in $ 502(a)(3): that the retrospective relief

sought be "appropriate equitable relief." The common law of trusts,
which offers a starting point for ERISA analysis, Hughes Aircraft Co.
v. Jacobson, 525 U. S. 432, 447, plainly countenances the sort of relief
sought by petitioners against Salomon here, see Moore v. Crawford, 130
U. S. 122, 128. It also sets limits on restitution actions against defendants other than the principal "wrongdoer." Translated to the instant
context, a transferee of ill-gotten plan assets may be held liable, if the
transferee (assuming he has purchased for value) knew or should have
known of the circumstances that rendered the transaction prohibited.
Those circumstances, in turn, involve a showing that the plan fiduciary,
with actual or constructive knowledge of the facts satisfying the elements of a $ 406(a) transaction, caused the plan to engage in the transaction. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 888-889. The common
law additionally prompts rejection of Salomon's complaint that the
Court's view of $ 502(a)(3) would incongruously allow not only the
harmed beneficiaries, but also the culpable fiduciary, to seek restitution
from the arguably less culpable counterparty-transferee. The common
law sees no incongruity in such a rule: Although the fiduciary bases his
cause of action upon his own wrongdoing, he may maintain the action
because its purpose is to recover money for the plan. And while Salomon correctly observes that the antecedent violation of $ 406(a)'s per se
prohibitions on transacting with a party in interest was unknown at
common law, the Court rejects as unsupported Salomon's suggestion
that common-law liability should not attach to an act that does not violate a common-law duty. Thus, an action for restitution against a transferee of tainted plan assets satisfies $ 502(a)(3)'s "appropriate[ness]" criterion. Such relief is also "equitable." See Mertens, supra, at 260.
Pp. 249-253.

(c) The Court declines to depart from $ 502(a)(3)'s text on the basis of
two nontextual matters: (1) that the congressional Conference Committee rejected language that would have expressly imposed a duty on
nonfiduciary parties to $ 406(a) transactions, and (2) that the policy
consequences of recognizing a $ 502(a)(3) action in this case could be
devastating because counterparties, faced with the prospect of liability
for dealing with a plan, may charge higher rates or, worse, refuse altogether to transact with plans. In ERISA cases, the Court's analysis
begins with the statutory language and, where that language is clear,
it ends there as well. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, supra, at
438. Section 502(a)(3), as informed by $ 502(l), satisfies this standard.

Section 406(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Secu-rity Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 879, bars a fiduciary of an

employee benefit plan from causing the plan to engage incertain transactions with a "party in interest." 29 U. S. C.

$ 1106(a). Section 502(a)(3) authorizes a "participant, bene-ficiary, or fiduciary" of a plan to bring a civil action to obtain "appropriate equitable relief " to redress violations ofERISA Title I. 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3). The question is
whether that authorization extends to a suit against a non-fiduciary "party in interest" to a transaction barred by

$ 406(a). We hold that it does.

loyalty to the plan's beneficiaries, $ 404(a), by categoricallybarring certain transactions deemed "likely to injure the

pension plan," Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus-tries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 160 (1993). Section 406(a)(1) provides, among other things, that "[a] fiduciary with respect toa plan shall not cause the plan to engage in a transaction, if
he knows or should know that such transaction constitutes adirect or indirect . . . sale or exchange . . . of any property
between the plan and a party in interest." 29 U. S. C.$ 1106(a)(1)(A). Congress defined "party in interest" to encompass those entities that a fiduciary might be inclined tofavor at the expense of the plan's beneficiaries. See $ 3(14),
29 U. S. C. $ 1002(14). Section 406's prohibitions are subjectto both statutory and regulatory exemptions. See $$ 408(a),
(b), 29 U. S. C. $$ 1108(a), (b).This case comes to us on the assumption that an ERISA
pension plan (the Ameritech Pension Trust (APT)) and aparty in interest (respondent Salomon Smith Barney (Salomon)) entered into a transaction prohibited by $ 406(a) andnot exempted by $ 408.

1 APT provides pension benefits to

employees and retirees of Ameritech Corporation and itssubsidiaries and affiliates. Salomon, during the late 1980's,

provided broker-dealer services to APT, executing nondis-cretionary equity trades at the direction of APT's fiduciaries,
thus qualifying itself (we assume) as a "party in interest."See $ 3(14)(B), 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(14)(B) (defining "party in interest" as "a person providing services to [an employee bene-fit] plan"). During the same period, Salomon sold interests
in several motel properties to APT for nearly $21 million.APT's purchase of the motel interests was directed by National Investment Services of America (NISA), an invest-ment manager to which Ameritech had delegated investment

discretion over a portion of the plan's assets, and hence afiduciary of APT, see $ 3(21)(A)(i), 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(21)(A)(i).

This litigation arose when APT's fiduciaries--its trustee,petitioner Harris Trust and Savings Bank, and its administrator, petitioner Ameritech Corporation--discovered thatthe motel interests were nearly worthless. Petitioners
maintain that the interests had been worthless all along;
Salomon asserts, to the contrary, that the interests declinedin value due to a downturn in the motel industry. Whatever

the true cause, petitioners sued Salomon in 1992 under$ 502(a)(3), which authorizes a "participant, beneficiary, or
fiduciary" to bring a civil action "to enjoin any act or practice
which violates any provision of [ERISA Title I] . . . or . . .
to obtain other appropriate equitable relief . . . to redress
such violations." 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3).

Petitioners claimed, among other things, that NISA, as
plan fiduciary, had caused the plan to engage in a per se prohibited transaction under $ 406(a) in purchasing the motel
interests from Salomon, and that Salomon was liable on
account of its participation in the transaction as a nonfiduciary party in interest. Specifically, petitioners pointed to

$ 406(a)(1)(A), 29 U. S. C. $ 1106(a)(1)(A), which prohibits a
"sale or exchange . . . of any property between the plan
and a party in interest," and $ 406(a)(1)(D), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1106(a)(1)(D), which prohibits a "transfer to . . . a party in
interest . . . of any assets of the plan." Petitioners sought
rescission of the transaction, restitution from Salomon of the
purchase price with interest, and disgorgement of Salomon's
profits made from use of the plan assets transferred to it.
App. 41.

Salomon moved for summary judgment, arguing that

$ 502(a)(3), when used to remedy a transaction prohibited by

$ 406(a), authorizes a suit only against the party expressly
constrained by $ 406(a)--the fiduciary who caused the plan to
enter the transaction--and not against the counterparty to
the transaction. See $ 406(a)(1), 29 U. S. C. $ 1106(a)(1) ("A

fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not cause the plan toengage in a transaction, if he knows or should know that

such transaction . . ." (emphasis added)). The District Courtdenied the motion, holding that ERISA does provide a private cause of action against nonfiduciaries who participate ina prohibited transaction, but granted Salomon's subsequent
motion for certification of the issue for interlocutory appeal
under 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b).The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.

184 F. 3d 646 (1999). It began with the observation that$ 406(a), by its terms and like several of its neighboring provisions, e. g., $ 404, governs only the conduct of fiduciaries,
not of counterparties or other nonfiduciaries. See id., at
650. The court next posited that "where ERISA does not
expressly impose a duty, there can be no cause of action,"
ibid., relying upon dictum in our decision in Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 254 (1993), that $ 502(a)(3) does
not provide a private cause of action against a nonfiduciary
for knowing participation in a fiduciary's breach of duty.
The Seventh Circuit saw no distinction between the Mertens
situation (involving $ 404) and the instant case (involving

$ 406), explaining that neither section expressly imposes a
duty on nonfiduciaries. Finally, in the Seventh Circuit's
view, Congress' decision to authorize the Secretary of Labor
to impose a civil penalty on a nonfiduciary "party in interest"
to a $ 406 transaction, see $ 502(i), simply confirms that Congress deliberately selected one enforcement tool (a civil penalty imposed by the Secretary) instead of another (a civil
action under $ 502(a)(3)). Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit
held that a nonfiduciary cannot be liable under $ 502(a)(3) for
participating in a $ 406 transaction and entered summary
judgment in favor of Salomon.

In doing so, the Seventh Circuit departed from the uniform
position of the Courts of Appeals that $ 502(a)(3)--and the
similarly worded $ 502(a)(5), which authorizes civil actions by
the Secretary--does authorize a civil action against a non530US1 Unit: $U72 [10-23-01 13:08:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

We agree with the Seventh Circuit's and Salomon's in-terpretation of $ 406(a). They rightly note that $ 406(a)

imposes a duty only on the fiduciary that causes the planto engage in the transaction. See $ 406(a)(1), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1106(a)(1) ("A fiduciary with respect to a plan shall notcause the plan to engage in a transaction, if he knows or
should know that such transaction . . ." (emphasis added)).We reject, however, the Seventh Circuit's and Salomon's conclusion that, absent a substantive provision of ERISA ex-pressly imposing a duty upon a nonfiduciary party in interest, the nonfiduciary party may not be held liable under$ 502(a)(3), one of ERISA's remedial provisions. Petitioners
contend, and we agree, that $ 502(a)(3) itself imposes certainduties, and therefore that liability under that provision does
not depend on whether ERISA's substantive provisions im-pose a specific duty on the party being sued.

2 Salomon asserts that petitioners waived this theory by neglecting to
present it to the courts below. According to Salomon, petitioners' claim
(until their merits brief in this Court) has been that Salomon may be sued
under $ 502(a)(3) only because Salomon "violated" $ 406(a). But, even assuming that petitioners did not pellucidly articulate this theory before the
Seventh Circuit, it appears to us that the Seventh Circuit understood the
tenor of the argument--namely, that the $ 406(a) transaction is the "act or
practice" which violates $ 406(a) and therefore may be redressed by a civil

Opinion of the Court

Section 502 provides:

"(a) . . .
"A civil action may be brought--. . . . .

"(3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) toenjoin any act or practice which violates any provision
of [ERISA Title I] or the terms of the plan, or (B) toobtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress
such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of thistitle or the terms of the plan." 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3).

This language, to be sure, "does not . . . authorize `appro-priate equitable relief ' at large, but only `appropriate equitable relief ' for the purpose of `redress[ing any] violationsor . . . enforc[ing] any provisions' of ERISA or an ERISA
plan." Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U. S. 349, 353 (1996) (quotingMertens, supra, at 253 (emphasis and alterations in original)). But $ 502(a)(3) admits of no limit (aside from the "ap-propriate equitable relief " caveat, which we address infra)
on the universe of possible defendants. Indeed, $ 502(a)(3)makes no mention at all of which parties may be proper defendants--the focus, instead, is on redressing the "act or
practice which violates any provision of [ERISA Title I]."29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). Other provisions

of ERISA, by contrast, do expressly address who may be adefendant. See, e. g., $ 409(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1109(a) (stating
that "[a]ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a planwho breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be per650 (CA7 1999). Moreover, petitioners' current focus on the "act or practice"--i. e., the $ 406 transaction--is merely an argument in support of
their $ 502(a)(3) claim for equitable relief against Salomon, not an independent claim. "Once a federal claim is properly presented, a party can
make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the
precise arguments they made below." Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519,
534 (1992).

sonally liable" (emphasis added)); $ 502(l), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(l)(authorizing imposition of civil penalties only against a "fiduciary" who violates part 4 of Title I or "any other person"who knowingly participates in such a violation). And

$ 502(a) itself demonstrates Congress' care in delineating theuniverse of plaintiffs who may bring certain civil actions.
See, e. g., $ 502(a)(3), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3) ("A civil actionmay be brought . . .

by a participant, beneficiary, orfiduciary . . ." (emphasis added)); $ 502(a)(5), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(a)(5) ("A civil action may be brought . . . by theSecretary . . ." (emphasis added)).

In light of Congress' precision in these respects, we wouldordinarily assume that Congress' failure to specify proper
defendants in $ 502(a)(3) was intentional. See Russello v.United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983). But ERISA's " `comprehensive and reticulated' " scheme warrants a cautious ap-proach to inferring remedies not expressly authorized by the
text, Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S.134, 146 (1985) (quoting

Nachman Corp. v. Pension BenefitGuaranty Corporation, 446 U. S. 359, 361 (1980)), especially

given the alternative and intuitively appealing interpreta-tion, urged by Salomon, that $ 502(a)(3) authorizes suits only
against defendants upon whom a duty is imposed by ERISA'ssubstantive provisions. In this case, however, $ 502(l) resolves the matter--it compels the conclusion that defendantstatus under $ 502(a)(3) may arise from duties imposed by

$ 502(a)(3) itself, and hence does not turn on whether the de-fendant is expressly subject to a duty under one of ERISA's
substantive provisions.Section 502(l) provides in relevant part:

"(1) In the case of--"(A) any breach of fiduciary responsibility under (or
other violation of) part 4 of this subtitle by a fiduciary,or

"(B) any knowing participation in such a breach orviolation by any other person,

SMITH BARNEY INC.

Opinion of the Court

"the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty against suchfiduciary or other person in an amount equal to 20 percent of the applicable recovery amount."(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term `applicable recovery amount' means any amount which is recov-ered from a fiduciary or other person with respect to a
breach or violation described in paragraph (1)--"(A) pursuant to any settlement agreement with the
Secretary, or"(B) ordered by a court to be paid by such fiduciary
or other person to a plan or its participants and benefi-ciaries in a judicial proceeding instituted by the Secretary under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(5) of this section." 29U. S. C. $$ 1132(

l)(1)-(2).

Section 502(l) contemplates civil penalty actions by the Sec-retary against two classes of defendants, fiduciaries and

"other person[s]." The latter class concerns us here. Para-phrasing, the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty against an
"other person" who "knowing[ly] participat[es] in" "any . . .violation of . . . part 4 . . . by a fiduciary." And the amount
of such penalty is defined by reference to the amount "or-dered by a court to be paid by such . . . other person to a
plan or its participants and beneficiaries in a judicial proceed-ing instituted by the Secretary under subsection (a)(2) or
(a)(5)." Ibid. (emphasis added).The plain implication is that the Secretary may bring a
civil action under $ 502(a)(5) against an "other person" who"knowing[ly] participat[es]" in a fiduciary's violation; otherwise, there could be no "applicable recovery amount" fromwhich to determine the amount of the civil penalty to be
imposed on the "other person." This $ 502(a)(5) action isavailable notwithstanding the absence of any ERISA provision explicitly imposing a duty upon an "other person" notto engage in such "knowing participation." And if the Secretary may bring suit against an "other person" under sub-section (a)(5), it follows that a participant, beneficiary, or fi530US1 Unit: $U72 [10-23-01 13:08:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

249Cite as: 530 U. S. 238 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
duciary may bring suit against an "other person" under thesimilarly worded subsection (a)(3). See Mertens, 508 U. S.,

at 260. Section 502(l), therefore, refutes the notion that$ 502(a)(3) (or (a)(5)) liability hinges on whether the particular defendant labors under a duty expressly imposed by thesubstantive provisions of ERISA Title I.

Salomon invokes Mertens as articulating an alternative,more restrictive reading of $ 502(

l) that does not support theinference we have drawn. In Mertens, we suggested, in dictum, that the "other person[s]" in $ 502(l) might be limitedto the "cofiduciaries" made expressly liable under $ 405(a) for
knowingly participating in another fiduciary's breach of fi-duciary responsibility. Id., at 261. So read, $ 502(l) would
be consistent with the view that liability under $ 502(a)(3)depends entirely on whether the particular defendant violated a duty expressly imposed by the substantive provisionsof ERISA Title I. But the Mertens dictum did not discuss--
understandably, since we were merely flagging the issue, see508 U. S., at 255, 260-261--that ERISA defines the term
"person" without regard to status as a cofiduciary (or, forthat matter, as a fiduciary or party in interest), see $ 3(9), 29
U. S. C. $ 1002(9). Moreover, $ 405(a) indicates that a cofi-duciary is

itself a fiduciary, see $ 405(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1105(a)("[A] fiduciary . . . shall be liable for a breach of fiduciary

responsibility of another fiduciary . . ."), and $ 502(l) clearlydistinguishes between a "fiduciary," $ 502(l)(1)(A), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(l)(1)(A), and an "other person," $ 502(l)(1)(B), 29U. S. C. $ 1132(l)(1)(B).

III
Notwithstanding the text of $ 502(a)(3) (as informed by$ 502(

l)), Salomon protests that it would contravene commonsense for Congress to have imposed civil liability on a party,

such as a nonfiduciary party in interest to a $ 406(a) transac-tion, that is not a "wrongdoer" in the sense of violating a
duty expressly imposed by the substantive provisions ofERISA Title I. Salomon raises the specter of $ 502(a)(3)

Opinion of the Court

suits being brought against innocent parties--even thosehaving no connection to the allegedly unlawful "act or practice"--rather than against the true wrongdoer, i. e., the fidu-ciary that caused the plan to engage in the transaction.

But this reductio ad absurdum ignores the limitingprinciple explicit in $ 502(a)(3): that the retrospective relief
sought be "appropriate equitable relief." The common lawof trusts, which offers a "starting point for analysis [of
ERISA] . . . [unless] it is inconsistent with the language ofthe statute, its structure, or its purposes,"

Hughes AircraftCo. v. Jacobson, 525 U. S. 432, 447 (1999) (internal quotation

marks omitted), plainly countenances the sort of relief soughtby petitioners against Salomon here. As petitioners and
amicus curiae the United States observe, it has long beensettled that when a trustee in breach of his fiduciary duty to
the beneficiaries transfers trust property to a third person,the third person takes the property subject to the trust, unless he has purchased the property for value and withoutnotice of the fiduciary's breach of duty. The trustee or beneficiaries may then maintain an action for restitution of theproperty (if not already disposed of) or disgorgement of proceeds (if already disposed of), and disgorgement of the thirdperson's profits derived therefrom. See,

e. g., Restatement(Second) of Trusts $$ 284, 291, 294, 295, 297 (1957); 4 A.

Scott & W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts $ 284, $ 291.1, pp. 77-78,$ 294.2, p. 101, $ 297 (4th ed. 1989) (hereinafter Law of
Trusts); 5 id., $ 470, at 363; 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies$ 4.7(1), pp. 660-661 (2d ed. 1993); G. Bogert, Law of Trusts
and Trustees $ 866, pp. 95-96 (rev. 2d ed. 1995). As we longago explained in the analogous situation of property obtained
by fraud:

"Whenever the legal title to property is obtainedthrough means or under circumstances `which render it

unconscientious for the holder of the legal title to retainand enjoy the beneficial interest, equity impresses a constructive trust on the property thus acquired in favor of

Opinion of the Court
the one who is truly and equitably entitled to the same,although he may never, perhaps, have had any legal estate therein; and a court of equity has jurisdiction toreach the property either in the hands of the original
wrongdoer, or in the hands of any subsequent holder,until a purchaser of it in good faith and without notice
acquires a higher right and takes the property relievedfrom the trust.' "

Moore v. Crawford, 130 U. S. 122, 128(1889) (quoting 2 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence

$ 1053, pp. 628-629 (1886)).
Importantly, that a transferee was not "the originalwrongdoer" does not insulate him from liability for restitution. See also, e. g., Restatement of Restitution ch. 7, Intro-ductory Note, p. 522 (1937); 1 Dobbs,

supra, $ 4.3(2), at 597("The constructive trust is based on property, not wrongs").

It also bears emphasis that the common law of trusts setslimits on restitution actions against defendants other than
the principal "wrongdoer." Only a transferee of ill-gottentrust assets may be held liable, and then only when the transferee (assuming he has purchased for value) knew or shouldhave known of the existence of the trust and the circumstances that rendered the transfer in breach of the trust.Translated to the instant context, the transferee must be
demonstrated to have had actual or constructive knowledgeof the circumstances that rendered the transaction unlawful.
Those circumstances, in turn, involve a showing that the
plan fiduciary, with actual or constructive knowledge of thefacts satisfying the elements of a $ 406(a) transaction, caused

the plan to engage in the transaction. Lockheed Corp. v.Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 888-889 (1996).

3 The issue of which party, as between the party seeking recovery and
the defendant-transferee, bears the burden of proof on whether the transferee is a purchaser for value and without notice, is not currently before
us, but may require resolution on remand. Cf. 4 Law of Trusts $ 284, at
40 (noting conflict of authority in non-ERISA cases on which party bears
the burden of proof).

252 HARRIS TRUST AND SAV. BANK v. SALOMON

SMITH BARNEY INC.

Opinion of the Court

The common law additionally leads us to reject Salomon'scomplaint that our view of $ 502(a)(3) would incongruously

allow not only the harmed beneficiaries, but also the culpablefiduciary, to seek restitution from the arguably less culpable
counterparty-transferee. The common law sees no incon-gruity in such a rule, see Restatement (Second) of Trusts,
supra, $ 294, at 69 ("[A]n action can be maintained against
the transferee either by the beneficiary or the trustee"); 4Law of Trusts $ 294.2, at 101, and for good reason: "Although

the trustee bases his cause of action upon his own voluntaryact, and even though the act was knowingly done in breach
of his duty to the beneficiary, he is permitted to maintain the
action, since the purpose of the action is to recover money
or other property for the trust estate, and whatever he
recovers he will hold subject to the trust." Restatement
(Second) of Trusts, supra, $ 294, Comment c.

But Salomon advances a more fundamental critique of the
common-law analogy, reasoning that the antecedent violation
here--a violation of $ 406(a)'s per se prohibitions on transacting with a party in interest--was unknown at common law,
and that common-law liability should not attach to an act
that does not violate a common-law duty. While Salomon
accurately characterizes $ 406(a) as expanding upon the common law's arm's-length standard of conduct, see Keystone
Consol. Industries, 508 U. S., at 160, we reject Salomon's
unsupported suggestion that remedial principles of the common law are tethered to the precise contours of commonlaw duty.

We note, however, that our interpretation of $ 502(a)(3) to
incorporate common-law remedial principles does not necessarily foreclose accommodation of Salomon's underlying concern that ERISA should not be construed to require counterparties to transactions with a plan to monitor the plan for
compliance with each of ERISA's intricate details. See,
e. g., Prohibited Transaction Exemption 75-1, $ II(e), 40 Fed.
Reg. 50847 (1975) (requiring that the plan maintain certain

530US1 Unit: $U72 [10-23-01 13:08:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
records for a 6-year period). While we have no occasion todecide the matter here, it may be that such concerns should

inform courts' determinations of what a transferee should (orshould not) be expected to know when engaging in a transaction with a fiduciary. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts$ 297(a), at 74 (defining "notice" to mean what a transferee
"knows or should know" (emphasis added)). Cf. ProhibitedTransaction Exemption 75-1, $ II(e)(1), 40 Fed. Reg. 50847
(1975) (providing that a broker-dealer shall not be subject tocivil penalties under $ 502(i) as a $ 406(a) "party in interest"
or taxes under 26 U. S. C. $ 4975 as a similarly defined "dis-qualified person" if such records are not maintained by the
plan).For these reasons, an action for restitution against a transferee of tainted plan assets satisfies the "appropriate[ness]"criterion in $ 502(a)(3). Such relief is also "equitable" in nature. See Mertens, 508 U. S., at 260 ("[T]he `equitable relief 'awardable under $ 502(a)(5) includes restitution of ill-gotten
plan assets or profits . . ."); ibid. (explaining that, in light ofthe similarity of language in $$ 502(a)(3) and (5), that language should be deemed to have the same meaning in bothsubsections).

IV
We turn, finally, to two nontextual clues cited by Salomonand

amici. First, Salomon urges us to consider, as the Sev-enth Circuit did, 184 F. 3d, at 652-653, the Conference Committee's rejection of language from the Senate bill thatwould have expressly imposed a duty on nonfiduciary parties
to $ 406(a) transactions. See Brief for Respondents 28-29(quoting H. R. Rep. No. 93-2, p. 533 (1974) (with amendments
as passed by the Senate), reprinted in 3 Legislative Historyof ERISA (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Subcommittee on Labor of the Committee on Labor and PublicWelfare by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93-406, p. 3780

comment on House and Senate differences on $ 409). Sec-ond, Salomon and amici submit that the policy consequences

of recognizing a $ 502(a)(3) action in this case could be devas-tating--counterparties, faced with the prospect of liability
for dealing with a plan, may charge higher rates or, worse,refuse altogether to transact with plans.

We decline these suggestions to depart from the text of$ 502(a)(3). In ERISA cases, "[a]s in any case of statutory
construction, our analysis begins with the language of thestatute. . . . And where the statutory language provides a
clear answer, it ends there as well." Hughes Aircraft, 525U. S., at 438 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Section 502(a)(3), as informed by $ 502(l), satisfies thisstandard.

Accordingly, we reverse the Seventh Circuit's judgmentand remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

255OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Syllabus

CARTER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 99-5716. Argued April 19, 2000--Decided June 12, 2000
Having donned a ski mask and entered a bank, petitioner Carter confronted an exiting customer and pushed her back inside. She screamed,
startling others in the bank. Undeterred, Carter ran inside and leaped
over a counter and through one of the teller windows. A teller rushed
into the manager's office. Meanwhile, Carter opened several teller
drawers and emptied the money into a bag. After removing almost
$16,000, he jumped back over the counter and fled. He was charged
with violating 18 U. S. C. $ 2113(a), which punishes "[w]hoever, by force
and violence, or by intimidation, takes . . . any . . . thing of value [from a]
bank." While not contesting the basic facts, Carter pleaded not guilty
on the theory that he had not taken the bank's money "by force and
violence, or by intimidation," as $ 2113(a) requires. Before trial, he
moved for a jury instruction on the offense described by $ 2113(b) as a
lesser included offense of the offense described by $ 2113(a). Section
2113(b) entails less severe penalties than $ 2113(a), punishing, inter alia,
"[w]hoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal or purloin,
any . . . thing of value exceeding $1,000 [from a] . . . bank." The District
Court denied the motion. The jury, instructed on $ 2113(a) alone, returned a guilty verdict, pursuant to which the District Court entered
judgment. The Third Circuit affirmed.

Held: Because $ 2113(b) requires three elements not required by $ 2113(a),

it is not a lesser included offense of $ 2113(a), and petitioner is prohibited
as a matter of law from obtaining a lesser included offense instruction
on the offense described by $ 2113(b). Pp. 260-274.

(a) In Schmuck v. United States, 489 U. S. 705, 716, this Court held
that a defendant who requests a jury instruction on a lesser offense
under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(c) must demonstrate that
the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the
charged offense. This elements test requires a textual comparison of
criminal statutes, which lends itself to certain and predictable outcomes. Id., at 720. Here, the Government contends that three elements required by $ 2113(b) are not required by $ 2113(a). A "textual
comparison" of the elements of the two offenses suggests that the Government is correct. Whereas $ 2113(b) requires (1) that the defendant
act "with intent to steal or purloin," (2) that the defendant "tak[e] and

530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
256 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
carr[y] away" the property, and (3) that the property have a "value exceeding $1,000," $ 2113(a) contains no such requirements. These extra
clauses in subsection (b) cannot be regarded as mere surplusage; they
mean something. Potter v. United States, 155 U. S. 438, 446. The
Court rejects Carter's assertion that the foregoing application of the
elements test is too rigid. Although he is correct that normal principles of statutory construction apply, the Court rejects his claim that
such principles counsel a departure here from what is indicated by a
straightforward reading of the text. Pp. 260-263.

(b) The Court rejects Carter's arguments pertinent to the general
relationship between $$ 2113(a) and (b). His first contention--that it
would be anomalous to impose criminal liability on a fence who receives
bank property from a $ 2113(b) violator, as the text of $ 2113(c) plainly
provides, but not on a fence who receives such property from a $ 2113(a)
violator, unless $ 2113(b) is a lesser included offense of $ 2113(a)--is unpersuasive because the anomaly, if it truly exists, is only an anomaly.
It is doubtful that it rises to the level of absurdity. Cf. Green v. Bock
Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 509-511, 527. In any event,
nothing in $ 2113(c) purports to redefine the elements required by the
text of $$ 2113(a) and (b). Although more substantial, Carter's second
argument--that, insofar as $$ 2113(a) and (b) are similar to common-law
robbery and larceny, the Court must assume that they require the same
elements as their common-law predecessors, absent Congress' affirmative indication of an intent to displace the common-law scheme--is also
unavailing because the canon on imputing common-law meaning applies only when Congress makes use of a statutory term with established meaning at common law. See, e. g., Morissette v. United States,
342 U. S. 246, 263. Although "robbery" and "larceny" are terms with
such meanings, neither term appears in the text of $ 2113(a) or $ 2113(b).
While "robbery" appears in $ 2113's title, the title of a statute is of use
only when it sheds light on some ambiguous word or phrase in the statute itself. E. g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S.
206, 212. Carter does not claim that this title illuminates any such ambiguous language. Pp. 263-267.

(c) The Court also rejects Carter's specific arguments concerning

$ 2113(b)'s three "extra" elements. Pp. 267-274.

(i) Carter is mistaken when he argues that an "intent to steal or
purloin" requirement must be deemed implicit in $ 2113(a) by virtue of
this Court's cases interpreting criminal statutes silent as to mens rea
to include broadly applicable scienter requirements, see, e. g., United
States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 70. The presumption
in favor of scienter generally requires a court to read into a statute
only that mens rea which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct

530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

257Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)
Syllabus
from "otherwise innocent conduct." Id., at 72. In this case, interpreting $ 2113(a) not to apply to a person who engages in innocent, if aberrant, activity is accomplished simply by requiring general intent--
i. e., proof of knowledge with respect to the crime's actus reus (here,
the taking of property of another by force or violence or intimidation).
See, e. g., Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 611-612. And once
this mental state and actus reus are shown, the concerns underlying
the presumption in favor of scienter are fully satisfied, for a forceful
taking--even by a defendant taking under a good-faith claim of right--
falls outside the realm of the "otherwise innocent." Thus, the presumption in favor of scienter does not justify reading a specific intent requirement--"intent to steal or purloin"--into $ 2113(a). Carter's
reliance on $ 2113(a)'s legislative history is unavailing in light of this
Court's approach to statutory interpretation, which begins by examining the text, see, e. g., Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505
U. S. 469, 475, not by psychoanalyzing those who enacted it, Bank
One Chicago, N. A. v. Midwest Bank & Trust Co., 516 U. S. 264, 279.
Pp. 267-271.

(ii) Similarly, Carter's claim that $ 2113(b)'s "takes and carries
away" requirement should be deemed implicit in $ 2113(a) also fails.
His argument that "takes" in $ 2113(a) is equivalent to "takes and carries away" in $ 2113(b) is at war with the statute's text. His suggestion
that the text is not dispositive because nothing in $ 2113(a)'s evolution
suggests that Congress sought to discard the common-law asportation
requirement ignores the fact that the Court's inquiry begins with the
textual product of Congress' efforts, not with speculation as to the internal thought processes of its Members. Congress is free to outlaw
bank theft that does not involve asportation, and it hardly would have
been absurd for Congress to do so, since the taking-without-asportation
scenario has actually occurred. While the common law's decision to
require asportation may have its virtues, Congress adopted a different
view in $ 2113(a), and it is not for this Court to question that choice.
P. 272.

(iii) Finally, the Court disagrees with Carter's claim that $ 2113(b)'s
requirement that the property taken have a "value exceeding $1,000"
is a sentencing factor, not an element of the crime. First, $ 2113(b)'s
structure strongly suggests that its two paragraphs--the first of which
uses the phrase in question, requiring that the property taken have
"value exceeding $1,000," the second of which refers to property of
"value not exceeding $1,000"--describe distinct offenses. Each begins with the word "[w]hoever," proceeds to describe identically (apart
from the differing valuation requirements) the elements of the offense,
and concludes by stating the prescribed punishment. That these pro530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
visions "stand on their own grammatical feet" strongly suggests that
Congress intended the valuation requirement to be an element of each
paragraph's offense, rather than a sentencing factor of some base

$ 2113(b) offense. Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 234. Furthermore, the steeply higher penalties--an enhancement from a 1-year to
a 10-year maximum penalty on proof of valuation exceeding $1,000--
leads to the conclusion that the valuation requirement is an element of

$ 2113(b)'s first paragraph. See, e. g., Castillo v. United States, ante,
at 127. Finally, the constitutional questions that would be raised by
interpreting the valuation requirement to be a sentencing factor persuade the Court to adopt the view that the requirement is an element.

person or presence of another . . . any . . . thing of valuebelonging to, or in the . . . possession of, any bank . . . ."
The latter, which entails less severe penalties, punishes,inter alia, "[w]hoever takes and carries away, with intent
to steal or purloin, any . . . thing of value exceeding $1,000belonging to, or in the . . . possession of, any bank . . . ."
We hold that $ 2113(b) requires an element not required by$ 2113(a)--three in fact--and therefore is not a lesser included offense of $ 2113(a). Petitioner is accordingly pro-hibited as a matter of law from obtaining a lesser included
offense instruction on the offense described by $ 2113(b).

I
On September 9, 1997, petitioner Floyd J. Carter donneda ski mask and entered the Collective Federal Savings Bank

in Hamilton Township, New Jersey. Carter confronted acustomer who was exiting the bank and pushed her back
inside. She screamed, startling others in the bank. Unde-terred, Carter ran into the bank and leaped over the customer service counter and through one of the teller windows.One of the tellers rushed into the manager's office. Meanwhile, Carter opened several teller drawers and emptied themoney into a bag. After having removed almost $16,000 in
currency, Carter jumped back over the counter and fled fromthe scene. Later that day, the police apprehended him.

A grand jury indicted Carter, charging him with violat-ing $ 2113(a). While not contesting the basic facts of the
episode, Carter pleaded not guilty on the theory that hehad not taken the bank's money "by force and violence,
or by intimidation," as $ 2113(a) requires. Before trial, Carter moved that the court instruct the jury on the offensedescribed by $ 2113(b) as a lesser included offense of the offense described by $ 2113(a). The District Court, relying

Opinion of the Court
on United States v. Mosley, 126 F. 3d 200 (CA3 1997),1 de-nied the motion in a preliminary ruling. At the close of the

Government's case, the District Court denied Carter's mo-tion for a judgment of acquittal and indicated that the preliminary ruling denying the lesser included offense instruc-tion would stand. The jury, instructed on $ 2113(a) alone,
returned a guilty verdict, and the District Court enteredjudgment pursuant to that verdict.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in anunpublished opinion, relying on its earlier decision in

Mosley.Judgment order reported at 185 F. 3d 863 (1999). While the

Ninth Circuit agrees with the Third that a lesser offenseinstruction is precluded in this context, see United States v.
Gregory, 891 F. 2d 732, 734 (CA9 1989), other Circuits haveheld to the contrary, see United States v. Walker, 75 F. 3d
178, 180 (CA4 1996); United States v. Brittain, 41 F. 3d 1409,1410 (CA10 1994). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 528 U. S. 1060 (1999), and now affirm.

II
In Schmuck, supra, we were called upon to interpretFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(c)'s provision that

"[t]he defendant may be found guilty of an offense neces-sarily included in the offense charged." We held that this
provision requires application of an elements test, underwhich "one offense is not `necessarily included' in another
unless the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of theelements of the charged offense." 489 U. S., at 716.

(per curiam).

2 By "lesser offense," Schmuck meant lesser in terms of magnitude of

punishment. When the elements of such a "lesser offense" are a subset
of the elements of the charged offense, the "lesser offense" attains the
status of a "lesser included offense."

elements test requires "a textual comparison of criminalstatutes," an approach that, we explained, lends itself to

"certain and predictable" outcomes. Id., at 720.3Applying the test, we held that the offense of tampering
with an odometer, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1984 and 1990c(a) (1982 ed.),is not a lesser included offense of mail fraud, 18 U. S. C.

$ 1341. We explained that mail fraud requires two ele-ments--(1) having devised or intending to devise a scheme
to defraud (or to perform specified fraudulent acts), and(2) use of the mail for the purpose of executing, or attempting
to execute, the scheme (or specified fraudulent acts). Thelesser offense of odometer tampering, however, requires the
element of knowingly and willfully causing an odometer tobe altered, an element that is absent from the offense of mail
fraud. Accordingly, the elements of odometer tamperingare not a subset of the elements of mail fraud, and a defendant charged with the latter is not entitled to an in-struction on the former under Rule 31(c).

Schmuck, supra,at 721-722.

Turning to the instant case, the Government contendsthat three elements required by $ 2113(b)'s first paragraph
are not required by $ 2113(a): (1) specific intent to steal; (2)asportation; and (3) valuation exceeding $1,000. The statute provides:

"$ 2113. Bank robbery and incidental crimes"(a) Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person orpresence of another, or obtains or attempts to obtain
by extortion any property or money or any other thingof value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control,

3 A defendant must also satisfy the "independent prerequisite . . . that
the evidence at trial . . . be such that a jury could rationally find the
defendant guilty of the lesser offense, yet acquit him of the greater."
Schmuck, 489 U. S., at 716, n. 8 (citing Keeble v. United States, 412 U. S.
205, 208 (1973)). In light of our holding that petitioner fails to satisfy the
elements test, we need not address the latter requirement in this case.

be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not morethan one year, or both."

A "textual comparison" of the elements of these offensessuggests that the Government is correct. First, whereas
subsection (b) requires that the defendant act "with in-tent to steal or purloin," subsection (a) contains no similar requirement. Second, whereas subsection (b) requiresthat the defendant "tak[e] and carr[y] away" the property,
subsection (a) only requires that the defendant "tak[e]"the property. Third, whereas the first paragraph of subsection (b) requires that the property have a "value ex-ceeding $1,000," subsection (a) contains no valuation requirement. These extra clauses in subsection (b) "cannot beregarded as mere surplusage; [they] mea[n] something."
Potter v. United States, 155 U. S. 438, 446 (1894).Carter urges that the foregoing application of

Schmuck'selements test is too rigid and submits that ordinary principles of statutory interpretation are relevant to the Schmuckinquiry. We do not dispute the latter proposition. The

263Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
Schmuck test, after all, requires an exercise in statutoryinterpretation before the comparison of elements may be

made, and it is only sensible that normal principles of statu-tory construction apply. We disagree, however, with petitioner's conclusion that such principles counsel a departurein this case from what is indicated by a straightforward reading of the text. III

We begin with the arguments pertinent to the general re-lationship between $$ 2113(a) and (b). Carter first contends
that the structure of $ 2113 supports the view that subsec-tion (b) is a lesser included offense of subsection (a). He
points to subsection (c) of $ 2113, which imposes criminalliability on a person who knowingly "receives, possesses,
conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of, any propertyor money or other thing of value which has been taken or
stolen from a bank . . . in violation of subsection (b)." (Em-phasis added.) It would be anomalous, posits Carter, for
subsection (c) to apply--as its text plainly provides--only tothe fence who receives property from a violator of subsection (b) but not to the fence who receives property froma violator of subsection (a). The anomaly disappears, he
concludes, only if subsection (b) is always violated whensubsection (a) is violated--

i. e., only if subsection (b) is alesser included offense of subsection (a).

But Carter's anomaly--even if it truly exists--is only ananomaly. Petitioner does not claim, and we tend to doubt,
that it rises to the level of absurdity. Cf. Green v. Bock
Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 509-511 (1989); id., at527 (S

calia, J., concurring in judgment). For example, itmay be that violators of subsection (a) generally act alone,

while violators of subsection (b) are commonly assisted byfences. In such a state of affairs, a sensible Congress may
have thought it necessary to punish only the fences of prop-erty taken in violation of subsection (b). Or Congress may
have thought that a defendant who violates subsection (a)

530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
264 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
usually--if not inevitably--also violates subsection (b), so
that the fence may be punished by reference to that latter
violation. In any event, nothing in subsection (c) purports
to redefine the elements required by the text of subsections
(a) and (b).

Carter's second argument is more substantial. He submits that, insofar as subsections (a) and (b) are similar to
the common-law crimes of robbery and larceny, we must assume that subsections (a) and (b) require the same elements
as their common-law predecessors, at least absent Congress'
affirmative indication (whether in text or legislative history)
of an intent to displace the common-law scheme. While we
(and the Government) agree that the statutory crimes at
issue here bear a close resemblance to the common-law
crimes of robbery and larceny, see Brief for United States 29
(citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *229, *232); accord,
post, at 278-279, that observation is beside the point. The
canon on imputing common-law meaning applies only when
Congress makes use of a statutory term with established
meaning at common law, and Carter does not point to any
such term in the text of the statute.

This limited scope of the canon on imputing common-law
meaning has long been understood. In Morissette v. United
States, 342 U. S. 246 (1952), for example, we articulated the
canon in this way:

"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are
accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the
cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed
word in the body of learning from which it was taken
and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind
unless otherwise instructed. In such case, absence of
contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with
widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from
them." Id., at 263 (emphasis added).

265Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
In other words, a "cluster of ideas" from the common lawshould be imported into statutory text only when Congress

employs a common-law term, and not when, as here, Con-gress simply describes an offense analogous to a commonlaw crime without using common-law terms.We made this clear in United States v. Wells, 519 U. S.
482 (1997). At issue was whether 18 U. S. C. $ 1014--whichpunishes a person who "knowingly makes any false statement or report . . . for the purpose of influencing in anyway the action" of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insured bank "upon any application, advance, . . . commit-ment, or loan"--requires proof of the materiality of the "false
statement." The defendants contended that since material-ity was a required element of "false statement"-type offenses
at common law, it must also be required by $ 1014. Although
Justice Stevens in dissent thought the argument to bemeritorious, we rejected it:

"[F]undamentally, we disagree with our colleague'sapparent view that any term that is an element of a
common-law crime carries with it every other aspect ofthat common-law crime when the term is used in a statute. Justice Stevens seems to assume that because`false statement' is an element of perjury, and perjury
criminalizes only material statements, a statute crimi-nalizing `false statements' covers only material statements. By a parity of reasoning, because common-lawperjury involved statements under oath, a statute criminalizing a false statement would reach only statementsunder oath. It is impossible to believe that Congress
intended to impose such restrictions sub silentio, how-ever, and so

our rule on imputing common-law mean-ing to statutory terms does not sweep so broadly." 519

U. S., at 492, n. 10 (emphasis added; citation omitted).4
4 The dissent claims that our decision in United States v. Wells, 519 U. S.
482 (1997), is not in point because we went on in Wells to discuss the
evolution of the statute (specifically, a recodification of numerous sections),

530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
266 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Similarly, in United States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407 (1957),
we declined to look to the analogous common-law crime because the statutory term at issue--"stolen"--had no meaning at common law. See id., at 411-412 ("[W]hile `stolen'
is constantly identified with larceny, the term was never at
common law equated or exclusively dedicated to larceny"
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

By contrast, we have not hesitated to turn to the common
law for guidance when the relevant statutory text does contain a term with an established meaning at common law. In
Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999), for example, we
addressed whether materiality is required by federal statutes punishing a "scheme or artifice to defraud." Id., at 20,
and 20-21, nn. 3-4 (citing 18 U. S. C. $$ 1341, 1343, 1344).
Unlike the statute in Wells, which contained no commonlaw term, these statutes did include a common-law term--
"defraud." 527 U. S., at 22. Because common-law fraud required proof of materiality, we applied the canon to hold that
these federal statutes implicitly contain a materiality requirement as well. Id., at 23. Similarly, in Evans v. United
States, 504 U. S. 255, 261-264 (1992), we observed that "extortion" in 18 U. S. C. $ 1951 was a common-law term, and
proceeded to interpret this term by reference to its meaning
at common law.

Here, it is undisputed that "robbery" and "larceny" are
terms with established meanings at common law. But neiwhich revealed Congress' apparent care in retaining a materiality requirement in certain sections while omitting it in others, such as the one before
us in Wells. According to the dissent, a similar statutory evolution is not
present here. See post, at 286. But, even assuming the dissent is correct
in this latter regard, the holding in Wells simply cannot be deemed to
rest on our discussion of the statute's evolution. Rather, we characterized
that discussion as supporting a result we had already reached on textual
grounds. See 519 U. S., at 492 ("Statutory history confirms the natural
reading").

Opinion of the Court
ther term appears in the text of $ 2113(a) or $ 2113(b).5While the term "robbery" does appear in $ 2113's title, the

title of a statute " `[is] of use only when [it] shed[s] light onsome ambiguous word or phrase' " in the statute itself.
Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206,212 (1998) (quoting Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,
331 U. S. 519, 528-529 (1947) (modifications in original)).And Carter does not claim that this title illuminates any
such ambiguous language. Accordingly, the canon on im-puting common-law meaning has no bearing on this case.

IV
We turn now to Carter's more specific arguments con-cerning the "extra" elements of $ 2113(b). While conceding

the absence of three of $ 2113(b)'s requirements from thetext of $ 2113(a)--(1) "intent to steal or purloin"; (2) "takes
and carries away," i. e., asportation; and (3) "value exceed-ing $1,000" (first paragraph)--Carter claims that the first
two should be deemed implicit in $ 2113(a), and that the thirdis not an element at all.

A
As to "intent to steal or purloin," it will be recalled thatthe text of subsection (b) requires a specific "intent to

steal or purloin," whereas subsection (a) contains no explicit
mens rea requirement of any kind. Carter nevertheless ar-gues that such a specific intent requirement must be deemed

implicitly present in $ 2113(a) by virtue of "our cases in-terpreting criminal statutes to include broadly applicable
scienter requirements, even where the statute by its terms

5 Congress could have simply punished "robbery" or "larceny" as some
States have done (and as Congress itself has done elsewhere, see, e. g.,
18 U. S. C. $$ 2112, 2114, 2115), thereby leaving the definition of these
terms to the common law, but Congress instead followed the more prevalent legislative practice of spelling out elements of these crimes. See 2
W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 8.11, p. 438, n. 6 (1986).

Opinion of the Court
does not contain them." United States v. X-Citement Video,Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 70 (1994).

6 Properly applied to $ 2113,

however, the presumption in favor of scienter demands onlythat we read subsection (a) as requiring proof of general

intent--that is, that the defendant possessed knowledgewith respect to the actus reus of the crime (here, the taking
of property of another by force and violence or intimidation).Before explaining why this is so under our cases, an example, United States v. Lewis, 628 F. 2d 1276, 1279 (CA10 1980),cert. denied, 450 U. S. 924 (1981), will help to make the distinction between "general" and "specific" intent less esoteric.
In Lewis, a person entered a bank and took money from ateller at gunpoint, but deliberately failed to make a quick

getaway from the bank in the hope of being arrested so thathe would be returned to prison and treated for alcoholism.
Though this defendant knowingly engaged in the acts ofusing force and taking money (satisfying "general intent"),
he did not intend permanently to deprive the bank of itspossession of the money (failing to satisfy "specific intent").

7

See generally 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal

6 This interpretive principle exists quite apart from the canon on imputing common-law meaning. See, e. g., X-Citement Video, 513 U. S., at
70 (applying presumption in favor of scienter to statute proscribing the
shipping or receiving of visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually
explicit conduct, without first inquiring as to the existence of a commonlaw antecedent to this offense); Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600
(1994) (similar).

7 The dissent claims that the Lewis court determined that the jury could

have found specific intent to steal on the facts presented, and thus disputes
our characterization of the case as illustrating a situation where a defendant acts only with general intent. Post, at 283-284 (citing Lewis, 628
F. 2d, at 1279). The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, that the Lewis
court made this determination only because some evidence suggested that,
if the defendant had not been arrested, he would have kept the stolen
money. Ibid. The Lewis court, implicitly acknowledging the possibility
that some defendant (if not Lewis) might unconditionally intend to turn
himself in after completing a bank theft, proceeded to hold, in the alternative, that $ 2113(a) covers a defendant who acts only with general intent.
See ibid.

Opinion of the Court
Law $ 3.5, p. 315 (1986) (distinguishing general from specific
intent).

The presumption in favor of scienter requires a court to
read into a statute only that mens rea which is necessary
to separate wrongful conduct from "otherwise innocent
conduct." X-Citement Video, supra, at 72. In Staples v.
United States, 511 U. S. 600 (1994), for example, to avoid
criminalizing the innocent activity of gun ownership, we
interpreted a federal firearms statute to require proof that
the defendant knew that the weapon he possessed had the
characteristics bringing it within the scope of the statute.
Id., at 611-612. See also, e. g., Liparota v. United States,
471 U. S. 419, 426 (1985); Morissette, 342 U. S., at 270-271.
By contrast, some situations may call for implying a specific
intent requirement into statutory text. Suppose, for example, a statute identical to $ 2113(b) but without the words
"intent to steal or purloin." Such a statute would run the
risk of punishing seemingly innocent conduct in the case of
a defendant who peaceably takes money believing it to be
his. Reading the statute to require that the defendant possess general intent with respect to the actus reus--i. e., that
he know that he is physically taking the money--would fail
to protect the innocent actor. The statute therefore would
need to be read to require not only general intent, but also
specific intent--i. e., that the defendant take the money with
"intent to steal or purloin."

In this case, as in Staples, a general intent requirement
suffices to separate wrongful from "otherwise innocent" conduct. Section 2113(a) certainly should not be interpreted
to apply to the hypothetical person who engages in forceful
taking of money while sleepwalking (innocent, if aberrant
activity), but this result is accomplished simply by requiring, as Staples did, general intent--i. e., proof of knowledge
with respect to the actus reus of the crime. And once this
mental state and actus reus are shown, the concerns underlying the presumption in favor of scienter are fully satis530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
270 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
fied, for a forceful taking--even by a defendant who takes
under a good-faith claim of right--falls outside the realm of
the "otherwise innocent." Thus, the presumption in favor
of scienter does not justify reading a specific intent requirement--"intent to steal or purloin"--into $ 2113(a).8

Independent of his reliance upon the presumption in favor
of scienter, Carter argues that the legislative history of $ 2113
supports the notion that an "intent to steal" requirement
should be read into $ 2113(a). Carter points out that, in
1934, Congress enacted what is now $ 2113(a), but with the
adverb "feloniously" (which all agree is equivalent to "intent
to steal") modifying the verb "takes." Act of May 18, 1934,
ch. 304, $ 2(a), 48 Stat. 783. In 1937, Congress added what
is now $ 2113(b). Act of Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 747, 50 Stat. 749.
Finally, in 1948, Congress made two changes to $ 2113, deleting "feloniously" from what is now $ 2113(a) and dividing
the "robbery" and "larceny" offenses into their own separate
subsections. 62 Stat. 796.

Carter concludes that the 1948 deletion of "feloniously"
was merely a stylistic change, and that Congress had no
intention, in deleting that word, to drop the requirement
that the defendant "feloniously" take the property--that is,
with intent to steal.9 Such reasoning, however, misunder8 Numerous Courts of Appeals agree. While holding that $ 2113(a)'s
version of bank robbery is not a specific intent crime, these courts have
construed the statute to contain a general intent requirement. See
United States v. Gonyea, 140 F. 3d 649, 653-654, and n. 10 (CA6 1998)
(collecting cases).

9 Relatedly, Carter argues that, even if a sensible Congress might have

deleted "feloniously," the 1948 Congress did not adequately explain an
intention to do so in the legislative history to the 1948 Act. He points
to the House Report, which states that Congress intended only to make
"changes in phraseology." H. R. Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A135
(1947). Carter further suggests that the phraseology concern with "feloniously" was that Congress in the 1948 codification generally desired to
delete references to felonies and misdemeanors in view of the statutory
definition of those terms in the former 18 U. S. C. $ 1. Carter fails, how530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
stands our approach to statutory interpretation. In ana-lyzing a statute, we begin by examining the text, see, e. g.,

Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475(1992), not by "psychoanalyzing those who enacted it," Bank
One Chicago, N. A. v. Midwest Bank & Trust Co., 516 U. S.264, 279 (1996) (S

calia, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment). While "feloniously" no doubt would be

sufficient to convey a specific intent requirement akin to theone spelled out in subsection (b), the word simply does not
appear in subsection (a).Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 283-284, this
reading is not a fanciful one. The absence of a specific intentrequirement from subsection (a), for example, permits the
statute to reach cases like Lewis, see supra, at 268, wherean ex-convict robs a bank because he wants to be apprehended and returned to prison. (The Government repre-sents that indictments on this same fact pattern (which invariably plead out and hence do not result in reporteddecisions) are brought "as often as every year," Brief for
United States 22, n. 13.) It can hardly be said, therefore,
that it would have been absurd to delete "feloniously" inorder to reach such defendants. And once we have made

that determination, our inquiry into legislative motivationis at an end. Cf.

Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S., at

ever, to acknowledge that the House Report does not give that reason for
the deletion of "feloniously" from $ 2113, even though it explicitly does so
in connection with the simultaneous elimination of similar language from
other sections. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 304, supra, at A67 ("References
to offenses as felonies or misdemeanors were omitted in view of definitive
section 1 of this title") (explaining revisions to 18 U. S. C. $ 751). As is
often the case, the legislative history, even if it is relevant, supports conflicting inferences and provides scant illumination.

10 Carter claims further support in Prince v. United States, 352 U. S. 322

(1957), for his view that $ 2113(a) implicitly requires a specific "intent to
steal." But Prince did not discuss the elements of that subsection, let
alone compare them to the elements of subsection (b).

272 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

B
Turning to the second element in dispute, it will be recalled that, whereas subsection (b) requires that the defendant "tak[e] and carr[y] away the property," subsection
(a) requires only that the defendant "tak[e]" the property.
Carter contends that the "takes" in subsection (a) is equivalent to "takes and carries away" in subsection (b). While
Carter seems to acknowledge that the argument is at war
with the text of the statute, he urges that text should not be
dispositive here because nothing in the evolution of $ 2113(a)
suggests that Congress sought to discard the asportation
requirement from that subsection.

But, again, our inquiry focuses on an analysis of the textual
product of Congress' efforts, not on speculation as to the
internal thought processes of its Members. Congress is certainly free to outlaw bank theft that does not involve asportation, and it hardly would have been absurd for Congress
to do so, since the taking-without-asportation scenario is no
imagined hypothetical. See, e. g., State v. Boyle, 970 S. W.
2d 835, 836, 838-839 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998) (construing state
statutory codification of common-law robbery to apply to defendant who, after taking money by threat of force, dropped
the money on the spot). Indeed, a leading treatise applauds
the deletion of the asportation requirement from the elements of robbery. See 2 LaFave & Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 8.11, at 439. No doubt the common law's decision
to require asportation also has its virtues. But Congress
adopted a different view in $ 2113(a), and it is not for us to
question that choice.

C

There remains the requirement in $ 2113(b)'s first paragraph that the property taken have a "value exceeding
$1,000"--a requirement notably absent from $ 2113(a). Carter, shifting gears from his previous arguments, concedes
the textual point but claims that the valuation require530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ment does not affect the Schmuck elements analysis becauseit is a

sentencing factor, not an element. We disagree. The
structure of subsection (b) strongly suggests that its twoparagraphs--the first of which requires that the property

taken have "value exceeding $1,000," the second of whichrefers to property of "value not exceeding $1,000"--describe
distinct offenses. Each begins with the word "[w]hoever,"
proceeds to describe identically (apart from the differingvaluation requirements) the elements of the offense, and

concludes by stating the prescribed punishment. That theseprovisions "stand on their own grammatical feet" strongly
suggests that Congress intended the valuation requirement
to be an element of each paragraph's offense, rather than a
sentencing factor of some base $ 2113(b) offense. Jones v.
United States, 526 U. S. 227, 234 (1999). Even aside from
the statute's structure, the "steeply higher penalties"--an
enhancement from a 1-year to a 10-year maximum penalty
on proof of valuation exceeding $1,000--leads us to conclude
that the valuation requirement is an element of the first
paragraph of subsection (b). See Castillo v. United States,
ante, at 127; Jones, 526 U. S., at 233. Finally, the constitutional questions that would be raised by interpreting the valuation requirement to be a sentencing factor persuade us to
adopt the view that the valuation requirement is an element.
See id., at 239-252.

The dissent agrees that the valuation requirement of
subsection (b)'s first paragraph is an element, but nonetheless would hold that subsection (b) is a lesser included offense of subsection (a). Post, at 287-289. The dissent reasons that the "value not exceeding $1,000" component of

$ 2113(b)'s second paragraph is not an element of the offense
described in that paragraph. Hence, the matter of value
does not prevent $ 2113(b)'s second paragraph from being
a lesser included offense of $ 2113(a). And if a defendant
wishes to receive an instruction on the first paragraph of

$ 2113(b)--which entails more severe penalties than the sec530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ond paragraph, but is a more realistic option from the jury'sstandpoint in a case such as this one where the value of the

property clearly exceeds $1,000--the dissent sees no reasonto bar him from making that election, even though the "value
exceeding $1,000" element of $ 2113(b)'s first paragraph isclearly absent from $ 2113(a).

This novel maneuver creates a problem, however. Sincesubsection (a) contains no valuation requirement, a defendant indicted for violating that subsection who requests aninstruction under subsection (b)'s first paragraph would effectively "waive . . . his [Fifth Amendment] right to noticeby indictment of the `value exceeding $1,000' element."
Post, at 289. But this same course would not be availableto the prosecutor who seeks the insurance policy of a lesser
included offense instruction under that same paragraph afterdetermining that his case may have fallen short of proving
the elements of subsection (a). For, whatever authority de-fense counsel may possess to waive a defendant's constitutional rights, see generally New York v. Hill, 528 U. S. 110(2000), a prosecutor has no such power. Thus, the prosecutor would be disabled from obtaining a lesser included of-fense instruction under Rule 31(c), a result plainly contrary
to Schmuck, in which we explicitly rejected an interpretiveapproach to the Rule that would have permitted "the defendant, by in effect waiving his right to notice, . . . [to] ob-tain a lesser [included] offense instruction in circumstances
where the constitutional restraint of notice to the defend-ant would prevent the prosecutor from seeking an identical
instruction," 489 U. S., at 718.

* * *
We hold that $ 2113(b) is not a lesser included offense of$ 2113(a), and therefore that petitioner is not entitled to a

jury instruction on $ 2113(b). The judgment of the ThirdCircuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Jus-
tice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

At common law, robbery meant larceny plus force, violence, or putting in fear. Because robbery was an aggravated form of larceny at common law, larceny was a lesser
included offense of robbery. Congress, I conclude, did not
depart from that traditional understanding when it rendered "Bank robbery and incidental crimes" federal offenses.
Accordingly, I would hold that petitioner Carter is not prohibited as a matter of law from obtaining an instruction
on bank larceny as a lesser included offense. The Court
holds that Congress, in 18 U. S. C. $ 2113, has dislodged bank
robbery and bank larceny from their common-law mooring.
I dissent from that determination.

I
The Court presents three reasons in support of its conclusion that a lesser included offense instruction was properly withheld in this case under the elements-based test
of Schmuck v. United States, 489 U. S. 705 (1989). First, the
Court holds that bank larceny contains an "intent to steal"
requirement that bank robbery lacks. Ante, at 267-271.
Second, the Court concludes that larceny contains a requirement of carrying away, or "asportation," while robbery does
not. Ante, at 272. And third, the Court states that the
"value exceeding $1,000" requirement in the first paragraph
of the larceny statute is an element for which no equivalent
exists in the robbery statute. Ante, at 272-274. The
Court's first and second points, I conclude, are mistaken. As
for the third, I agree with the Court that the "value exceeding $1,000" requirement is an element essential to sustain a
conviction for the higher degree of bank larceny. I would
hold, however, that Carter was not disqualified on that account from obtaining the lesser included offense instruction
he sought.

276 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
I note at the outset that the structure of $ 2113 pointsstrongly toward the conclusion that bank larceny is a lesser

included offense of bank robbery. Section 2113(c) imposescriminal liability on any person who knowingly "receives,
possesses, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of, anyproperty or money or other thing of value which has been
taken or stolen from a bank . . . in violation of subsection(b)." If bank larceny, covered in $ 2113(b), contains an intent
or asportation element not included in bank robbery, coveredin $ 2113(a), then $ 2113(c) creates an anomaly. As the Court
concedes, ante, at 263-264, under today's decision the fencewho gets his loot from a bank larcenist will necessarily receive property "stolen . . . in violation of subsection (b)," butthe one who gets his loot from a bank robber will not. Once
it is recognized that bank larceny is a lesser included offense
of bank robbery, however, the anomaly vanishes. Becauseanyone who violates $ 2113(a) necessarily commits the lesser

included offense described in $ 2113(b), a person who know-ingly receives stolen property from a bank robber is just as
guilty under $ 2113(c) as one who knowingly receives stolen
property from a bank larcenist.1I emphasize as well that the title of $ 2113 is "Bank robbery and incidental crimes." This Court has repeatedly rec-ognized that " `the title of a statute and the heading of a
section' are `tools available for the resolution of a doubt'

1 I further note, and the Court does not dispute, that under today's holding the Double Jeopardy Clause would not bar the Government from
bringing a bank larceny prosecution against a defendant who has already
been acquitted--or, indeed, convicted--by a jury of bank robbery on the
same facts. See Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932) (Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar consecutive prosecutions for a single act
if each charged offense requires proof of an element that the other does
not); Tr. of Oral Arg. 46-47 (in response to Court's inquiry, counsel for the
Government stated that, under the Government's construction of $ 2113, if
a jury acquitted a defendant on an indictment for bank robbery, it would
be open to the prosecution thereafter to seek the defendant's reindictment
for bank larceny).

Court has consistently instructed that courts should ordi-narily read federal criminal laws in accordance with their
common-law origins, if Congress has not directed otherwise.See

to "shed light on some ambiguous word or phrase," but not as a guide to a
statute's overall meaning. See ante, at 267. Our cases have never before
imposed such a wooden and arbitrary limitation, and for good reason: A
statute's meaning can be elusive, and its title illuminating, even where
a court cannot pinpoint a discrete word or phrase as the source of the
ambiguity.

direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely ac-cepted definitions, not as a departure from them." Id.,

at 263.
In interpreting $ 2113, then, I am guided by the common-law understanding of "robbery and incidental crimes." At

common law, as the Government concedes, robbery was anaggravated form of larceny. Specifically, the common law
defined larceny as "the felonious taking, and carryingaway, of the personal goods of another." 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 230 (1769) (Black-stone) (internal quotation marks omitted). Robbery, in
turn, was larceny effected by taking property from the per-son or presence of another by means of force or putting in
fear. Brief for United States 29-30 (citing 2 W. LaFave &A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 8.11, pp. 437-438 (1986)
(LaFave & Scott)). Larceny was therefore a lesser includedoffense of robbery at common law. See 4 Blackstone 241
(robbery is "[o]pen and violent larciny from the person" (em-phasis deleted)); 2 E. East, Pleas of the Crown $ 124, p. 707
(1803) (robbery is a species of "aggravated larceny"); 2W. Russell & C. Greaves, Crimes and Misdemeanors *101
("robbery is an aggravated species of larceny").Closer inspection of the common-law elements of both
crimes confirms the relationship. The elements of common-law larceny were also elements of robbery. First and most
essentially, robbery, like larceny, entailed an intentionaltaking. See 4 Blackstone 241 (robbery is "the felonious and
forcible taking, from the person of another, of goods ormoney to any value, by putting him in fear"); 2 East,

supra,at 707 (robbery is the "felonious taking of money or goods,

to any value, from the person of another, or in his presence,against his will, by violence or putting him in fear"). Second, as the above quotations indicate, the taking in a robberyhad to be "felonious," a common-law term of art signifying
an intent to steal. See 4 Blackstone 232 ("This taking, andcarrying away, must also be

felonious; that is, done animo

furandi [with intent to steal]: or, as the civil law expresses
it, lucri causa [for the sake of gain]."); Black's Law Dictionary 555 (5th ed. 1979) ("Felonious" is "[a] technical word
of law which means done with intent to commit crime").
And third, again like larceny, robbery contained an asportation requirement. See 2 LaFave & Scott $ 8.11, at 439
("Just as larceny requires that the thief both `take' (secure
dominion over) and `carry away' (move slightly) the property in question, so too robbery under the traditional view
requires both a taking and an asportation (in the sense
of at least a slight movement) of the property." (footnotes
omitted)). Unlike larceny, however, robbery included one
further essential component: an element of force, violence, or intimidation. See 4 Blackstone 242 ("[P]utting in
fear is the criterion that distinguishes robbery from other
larcinies.").3

Precedent thus instructs us to presume that Congress has
adhered to the altogether clear common-law understanding

3 English courts continue to recognize larceny as a lesser included offense of robbery. See, e. g., Regina v. Skivington, 51 Crim. App. 167, 170
(C. A. 1967) ("[L]arceny is an ingredient of robbery, and if the honest belief
that a man has a claim of right is a defence to larceny, then it negatives
one of the ingredients in the offense of robbery . . . ."). After the enactment of the Theft Act, 1968, which consolidated the crimes of larceny,
embezzlement, and fraudulent conversion into the single crime of theft,
see Director of Public Prosecutions v. Gomez, 96 Crim. App. 359, 377
(H. L. 1992) (Lord Lowry, dissenting), English courts reaffirmed that theft
remains a lesser included offense of robbery, see Regina v. Guy, 93 Crim.
App. 108, 111 (C. A. 1991) ("[Section 8(1) of the Theft Act, 1968] makes it
clear that robbery is theft with an additional ingredient, namely the use
of force, or putting or seeking to put any person in fear of being subjected to force. Therefore anyone guilty of robbery must, by statutory
definition, also be guilty of theft.").

Leading commentators agree that larceny is a lesser included offense
of robbery. See, e. g., 2 LaFave & Scott $ 8.11, at 437 ("Robbery . . . may
be thought of as aggravated larceny . . . ."); 3 C. Wright, Federal Practice
and Procedure $ 515, p. 22 (2d ed. 1982) ("Robbery necessarily includes
larceny . . . .").

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
that larceny is a lesser included offense of robbery, unless
Congress has affirmatively indicated its design, in codifying
the crimes of robbery and larceny, to displace their commonlaw meanings and relationship.

Far from signaling an intent to depart from the common
law, the codification of $ 2113's predecessor statute suggests
that Congress intended to adhere to the traditional ranking of larceny as a lesser included offense of robbery. There
is no indication at any point during the codification of the
two crimes that Congress meant to install new conceptions
of larceny and robbery severed from their common-law
foundations.

Prior to 1934, federal law did not criminalize bank robbery or larceny; these crimes were punishable only under
state law. Congress enacted the precursor to $ 2113(a) in
response to an outbreak of bank robberies committed by
John Dillinger and others who evaded capture by state
authorities by moving from State to State. See Jerome v.
United States, 318 U. S. 101, 102 (1943) (1934 Act aimed
at "interstate operations by gangsters against banks--activities with which local authorities were frequently unable
to cope"). In bringing federal law into this area, Congress
did not aim to reshape robbery by altering the commonlaw definition of that crime. On the contrary, Congress
chose language that practically jumped out of Blackstone's
Commentaries:

"Whoever, by force and violence, or by putting in
fear, feloniously takes, or feloniously attempts to take,
from the person or presence of another any property
or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or
in the care, custody, control, management, or possession
of, any bank shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both." Act of
May 18, 1934, ch. 304, $ 2(a), 48 Stat. 783.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
It soon became apparent, however, that this legislation
left a gap: It did not reach the thief who intentionally, though
not violently, stole money from a bank. Within a few years,
federal law enforcers endeavored to close the gap. In a
letter to the Speaker of the House, the Attorney General
conveyed the Executive Branch's official position: "The fact
that the statute is limited to robbery and does not include
larceny and burglary has led to some incongruous results."
See H. R. Rep. No. 732, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1937) (reprinting letter). In particular, the Attorney General cited
the example of a thief apprehended after taking $11,000 from
a bank while a teller was temporarily absent. Id., at 1-2.
He therefore asked Congress to amend the bank robbery
statute, specifically to add a larceny provision shorn of any
force, violence, or fear requirement. Id., at 2. Congress
responded by passing an Act "[t]o amend the bank robbery
statute to include burglary and larceny." Act of Aug. 24,
1937, ch. 747, 50 Stat. 749. The Act's new larceny provision, which Congress placed in the very same section as the
robbery provision, punished "whoever shall take and carry
away, with intent to steal or purloin," property, money, or
anything of value from a bank. Ibid. There is not the
slightest sign that, when this new larceny provision was
proposed in terms tracking the common-law formulation, the
Attorney General advocated any change in the definition of
robbery from larceny plus to something less. Nor is there
any sign that Congress meant to order such a change. The
Act left in place the 1934 Act's definition of bank robbery,
which continued to include the word "feloniously," requiring
(as the Court concedes, ante, at 270) proof by the Government of an intent to steal. 50 Stat. 749.

In its 1948 codification of federal crimes, Congress delineated the bank robbery and larceny provisions of $$ 2113(a)
and 2113(b) and placed these provisions under the title "Bank
robbery and incidental crimes." Act of June 25, 1948, $ 2113,

282 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
62 Stat. 796-797. In this codification, Congress deleted theword "feloniously" from the robbery provision, leaving the

statute in substantially its present form.

II
That 1948 deletion forms the basis of the Government'sprime argument against characterizing $ 2113(b) as a lesser

included offense of $ 2113(a), namely, that robbery, unlikelarceny, no longer requires a specific intent to steal. The
Government concedes that to gain a conviction for rob-bery at common law, the prosecutor had to prove the perpetrator's intent to steal. The Government therefore ac-knowledges that when Congress uses the terms "rob" or
"robbery" "without further elaboration," Congress intendsto retain the common-law meaning of robbery. Brief for
United States 16, n. 9. But the Government contends thatthe 1948 removal of "feloniously" from $ 2113(a) showed
Congress' purpose to dispense with any requirement of in-tent to steal.

It is true that the larceny provision contains the words"intent to steal" while the current robbery provision does
not.4 But the element-based comparison called for by
Schmuck is not so rigid as to require that the comparedstatutes contain identical words. Nor does Schmuck counsel deviation from our traditional practice of interpretingfederal criminal statutes consistently with their common-law
origins in the absence of affirmative congressional indicationto the contrary. Guided by the historical understanding of
the relationship between robbery and larceny both at com-mon law and as brought into the federal criminal code,
I conclude that the offense of bank robbery under $ 2113(a),like the offense of bank larceny under $ 2113(b), has always
included and continues to include a requirement of intentto steal.

4 Notably, the Court would read a requirement of intent to steal into

$ 2113(b) even if that provision did not contain such words. Ante, at 269.

This traditional reading of the robbery statute makes com-mon sense. The Government agrees that to be convicted

of robbery, the defendant must resort to force and violence,or intimidation, to accomplish his purpose. But what purpose could this be other than to steal? The Governmentdescribes two scenarios in which, it maintains, a person could
commit bank robbery while nonetheless lacking intent to
steal. One scenario involves a terrorist who temporarilytakes a bank's money or property aiming only to disrupt the

bank's business; the other involves an ex-convict, unable tocope with life in a free society, who robs a bank because he
wants to be apprehended and returned to prison. Brief for
United States 22, n. 13.

The Government does not point to any cases involving
its terrorist scenario, and I know of none. To illustrate its
ex-convict scenario, the Government cites United States v.
Lewis, 628 F. 2d 1276 (CA10 1980), which appears to be the
only reported federal case presenting this staged situation.
The facts of Lewis--a case on which the Court relies heavily,
see ante, at 268, 271--were strange, to say the least. Hoping to be sent back to prison where he could receive treatment for his alcoholism and have time to pursue his writing
hobby, Lewis called a local detective and informed him of his
intention to rob a bank. 628 F. 2d, at 1277. He also discussed his felonious little plans with the police chief, undercover police officers, and a psychologist. Ibid. He even
allowed his picture to be taken so that it could be posted
in local banks for identification. Ibid. Following his muchawaited heist, Lewis was arrested in the bank's outer foyer
by officers who had him under surveillance. Id., at 1278.

I am not sure whether a defendant exhibiting this kind
of "bizarre behavior," ibid., should in fact be deemed to
lack a specific intent to steal. (The Tenth Circuit, I note,
determined that specific intent was present in Lewis, for
"[t]he jury, charged with the duty to infer from conflicting
evidence the defendant's intent, could have concluded that

if Lewis was not arrested he would have kept the money andspent it."

Id., at 1279.) But whatever its proper disposition, this sort of case is extremely rare--the Governmentrepresents that, nationwide, such indictments are brought no

more than once per year. Brief for United States 22, n. 13.Moreover, unlike a John Dillinger who foils state enforcers
by robbing banks in Chicago and lying low in South Bend,
the thief who orchestrates his own capture at the handsof the local constable hardly poses the kind of problem that

one would normally expect to trigger a federal statutoryresponse. In sum, I resist the notion--apparently embraced
by the Court, see ante, at 271--that Congress' purpose in
deleting the word "feloniously" from $ 2113(a) was to grant
homesick ex-convicts like Lewis their wish to return to
prison. Nor can I credit the suggestion that Congress' concern was to cover the Government's fictional terrorist, or
the frustrated account holder who "withdraws" $100 by
force or violence, believing the money to be rightfully his,
or the thrill seeker who holds up a bank with the intent of
driving around the block in a getaway car and then returning
the loot, or any other defendant whose exploits are seldom
encountered outside the pages of law school exams.

Indeed, there is no cause to suspect that the 1948 deletion of "feloniously" was intended to effect any substantive
change at all. Nothing indicates that Congress removed
that word in response to any assertion or perception of
prosecutorial need. Nor is there any other reason to believe that it was Congress' design to alter the elements of
the offense of robbery. Rather, the legislative history
suggests that Congress intended only to make "changes in
phraseology." H. R. Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.,
A135 (1947). See Prince v. United States, 352 U. S. 322,
326, n. 5 (1957) ("The legislative history indicates that no
substantial change was made in this [1948] revision" of

$ 2113); Morissette, 342 U. S., at 269, n. 28 ("The 1948 Revision was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
those then in existence."). As the Third Circuit has recognized, "it seems that the deletion of `feloniously' was a result of Congress' effort to delete references to felonies and
misdemeanors from the code, inasmuch as both terms were
defined in 18 U. S. C. $ 1," a statute that has since been
repealed.5 United States v. Mosley, 126 F. 3d 200, 205 (CA3
1997). See also United States v. Richardson, 687 F. 2d 952,
957 (CA7 1982) (giving the same account of the 1948 revision). I would not attribute to Congress a design to create
a robbery offense stripped of the requirement of larcenous
intent in the absence of any affirmative indication of such
a design.6

Our decision in Prince supports this conclusion. The petitioner in that case had entered a bank, displayed a revolver,
and robbed the bank. He was convicted of robbery and of
entering the bank with the intent to commit a felony, both
crimes prohibited by $ 2113(a). The trial judge sentenced
him, consecutively, to 20 years for the robbery and 15 years
for the entering-with-intent crime. 352 U. S., at 324. This
Court reversed the sentencing decision. The entering-withintent crime, we held, merges with the robbery crime once
the latter crime is consummated. Thus, we explained, the
punishment could not exceed 20 years, the sentence authorized for a consummated robbery. Id., at 329. In reaching our decision in Prince, we noted that, when the federal
bank robbery proscription was enlarged in 1937 to add the
entering-with-intent and larceny provisions, "[i]t was manifestly the purpose of Congress to establish lesser offenses."

5 The various classes of federal felonies and misdemeanors are now
defined at 18 U. S. C. $ 3559.

6 Congress could have provided such an affirmative indication in any

number of ways. The simplest would have been to say so in the statute,
e. g.: "It shall not be a defense that the accused person lacked an intent
to steal." Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 645 (criminalizing embezzlement by judicial
officers, and providing that "[i]t shall not be a defense that the accused
person had any interest in [the embezzled] moneys or fund").

530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
286 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Id., at 327. We further stated that the "heart of the [enter-ing] crime is the intent to steal," and that "[t]his mental element merges into the completed crime if the robbery is con-summated."

Id., at 328. Prince thus conveys the Court's
comprehension that an intent to steal is central not only tothe entry and larceny crimes, but to robbery as well.

United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482 (1997), relied on by
the Court, ante, at 265, is not in point. In that case, weheld that the offense of making a false statement to a federally insured bank, 18 U. S. C. $ 1014, did not include a re-quirement of materiality. We reached that holding only
after concluding that the defendants in that case had not
"come close to showing that at common law the term `false
statement' acquired any implication of materiality that came
with it into $ 1014." 519 U. S., at 491. Indeed, the defendants made "no claims about the settled meaning of `false
statement' at common law." Ibid. Moreover, we held that
"Congress did not codify the crime of perjury or comparable common-law crimes in $ 1014; . . . it simply consolidated
13 statutory provisions relating to financial institutions" to
create a single regulatory offense. Ibid. Three of those
13 provisions, we observed, had contained express materiality requirements and lost them in the course of consolidation.
Id., at 492-493. From this fact, we inferred that "Congress
deliberately dropped the term `materiality' without intending materiality to be an element of $ 1014." Id., at 493.
Here, by contrast, it is clear that Congress' aim was to codify
the common-law offenses of bank robbery and bank larceny;
that intent to steal was an element of common-law robbery brought into $ 2113(a) via the word "feloniously"; and
that Congress' deletion of that word was not intended to
have any substantive effect, much less to dispense with the
requirement of intent to steal.

Having accepted the Government's argument concerning
intent to steal, the Court goes on to agree with the Government that robbery, unlike larceny, does not require that

530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
the defendant carry away the property. As with intent tosteal, the historical linkage of the two crimes reveals the

Court's error. It is true that $ 2113(b) includes the phrase"takes and carries away" while $ 2113(a) says only "takes."
Both crimes, however, included an asportation require-ment at common law. See

supra, at 279. Indeed, the text
of $$ 2113(a) and (b)--which the Court maintains must be the
primary focus of lesser included offense analysis--mirrorsthe language of the common law quite precisely. At common

law, larceny was typically described as a crime involvingboth a "taking" and a "

carrying away." See 4 Blackstone
231 (helpfully reminding us that "cepit et asportavit was the
old law-latin"). Robbery, on the other hand, was often defined in "somewhat undetailed language," LaFave & Scott

$ 8.11, at 438, n. 6, that made no mention of "carrying away,"
see 4 Blackstone 231, but was nevertheless consistently
interpreted to encompass an element of asportation. The
Court overlooks completely this feature of the commonlaw terminology. I note, moreover, that the asportation requirement, both at common law and under $ 2113, is an extremely modest one: even a slight movement will do. See
LaFave & Scott $ 8.11, at 439; 2 Russell & Greaves, Crimes
and Misdemeanors, at *152-*153. The text of $$ 2113(a)
and (b) thus tracks the common law. The Court's conclusory
statement notwithstanding, nothing in the evolution of the
statute suggests that "Congress adopted a different view
in $ 2113(a)," ante, at 272, deliberately doing away with the
minimal asportation requirement in prosecutions for bank
robbery. I would hold, therefore, that both crimes continue
to contain an asportation requirement.

Finally, the Court concludes that the "value exceeding
$1,000" requirement of the first paragraph of $ 2113(b) is an element of the offense described in that paragraph. I agree with
this conclusion and with the reasoning in support of it. See
ante, at 273. It bears emphasis, however, that the lesser
degree of bank larceny defined in $ 2113(b)'s second para530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
288 CARTER v. UNITED STATES

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
graph contains no dollar value element even arguably im-peding its classification as a lesser included offense of bank

robbery. The Government does not contend that the "valuenot exceeding $1,000" component of that paragraph is an
element of the misdemeanor offense, and such a contentionwould make scant sense. Surely Congress did not intend
that a defendant charged only with the lower grade of bank
larceny could successfully defend against that charge byshowing that he stole

more than $1,000. In other words,
if a defendant commits larceny without exhibiting the dis-tinguishing characteristics of robbery (force and violence, or

intimidation), he has necessarily committed at least the
lesser degree of larceny, whether he has taken $500 or $5,000.
Under Schmuck, then, a defendant charged with bank robbery in violation of $ 2113(a) is not barred as a matter of law
from obtaining a jury instruction on bank larceny as defined
in the second paragraph of $ 2113(b).

I see no reason why a defendant charged with bank
robbery, which securely encompasses as a lesser included
offense the statutory equivalent of petit larceny, should
automatically be denied an instruction on the statutory
equivalent of grand larceny if he wants one. It is clear that
petit and grand larceny were two grades of the same offense
at common law. See 4 Blackstone 229 (petit and grand
larceny are "considerably distinguished in their punishment,
but not otherwise"). And, as earlier explained, supra, at
278-279, robbery at common law was an aggravated form of
that single offense. One of the key purposes of Schmuck's
elements test is to allow easy comparison between two discrete crimes. See 489 U. S., at 720-721. That purpose
would be frustrated if an element that exists only to distinguish a more culpable from a less culpable grade of the same
crime were sufficient to prevent the defendant from getting
a lesser included offense instruction as to the more culpable
grade. I would therefore hold that a defendant charged
with the felony of bank robbery is not barred as a matter of

530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
law from requesting and receiving an instruction describingas a lesser included offense the felony grade of bank larceny.

7

To be sure, any request by the defendant for an instruc-tion covering the higher grade of bank larceny would be

tantamount to a waiver of his right to notice by indict-ment of the "value exceeding $1,000" element. See Stirone
v. United States, 361 U. S. 212, 215 (1960) (Fifth Amend-ment requires the Government to get a grand jury indictment before it may prosecute any felony). The con-stitutional requirement of notice would likely prevent the
prosecution from obtaining the same instruction withoutthe defendant's consent. I would limit any such asymmetry,
however, to the unusual circumstance presented here, wherean element serves only to distinguish a more culpable from
a less culpable grade of the very same common-law crimeand where the less culpable grade is, in turn, a lesser included offense of the crime charged.

* * *
In sum, I would hold that a defendant charged withbank robbery as defined in 18 U. S. C. $ 2113(a) is not barred

as a matter of law from obtaining a jury instruction onbank larceny as defined in 18 U. S. C. $ 2113(b). In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court gives short shrift tothe common-law origin and statutory evolution of $ 2113.
The Court's woodenly literal construction gives rise to prac-tical anomalies, see

supra, at 276, and n. 1, and effectivelyshrinks the jury's choices while enlarging the prosecutor's

options. I dissent.

7 The court could instruct the jury as to the common elements of both
grades of bank larceny, and then add that in order to return a conviction of the higher grade, the jury must also find that the value of the
stolen property exceeded $1,000. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35; 3 L. Sand,

SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT v.DOE,

individually and as next friend for

her minor children, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 99-62. Argued March 29, 2000--Decided June 19, 2000
Prior to 1995, a student elected as Santa Fe High School's student council

chaplain delivered a prayer over the public address system before each
home varsity football game. Respondents, Mormon and Catholic students or alumni and their mothers, filed a suit challenging this practice
and others under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
While the suit was pending, petitioner school district (District) adopted
a different policy, which authorizes two student elections, the first to
determine whether "invocations" should be delivered at games, and the
second to select the spokesperson to deliver them. After the students
held elections authorizing such prayers and selecting a spokesperson,
the District Court entered an order modifying the policy to permit only
nonsectarian, nonproselytizing prayer. The Fifth Circuit held that,
even as modified by the District Court, the football prayer policy was
invalid.

Held: The District's policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer

at football games violates the Establishment Clause. Pp. 301-317.

(a) The Court's analysis is guided by the principles endorsed in Lee
v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577. There, in concluding that a prayer delivered
by a rabbi at a graduation ceremony violated the Establishment Clause,
the Court held that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that
government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way that establishes a state
religion or religious faith, or tends to do so, id., at 587. The District
argues unpersuasively that these principles are inapplicable because
the policy's messages are private student speech, not public speech.
The delivery of a message such as the invocation here--on school property, at school-sponsored events, over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly
and implicitly encourages public prayer--is not properly characterized
as "private" speech. Although the District relies heavily on this
Court's cases addressing public forums, e. g., Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, it is clear that the District's

530US1 Unit: $U74 [10-23-01 13:25:52] PAGES PGT: OPLG

291Cite as: 530 U. S. 290 (2000)
Syllabus
pregame ceremony is not the type of forum discussed in such cases.
The District simply does not evince an intent to open its ceremony to
indiscriminate use by the student body generally, see, e. g., Hazelwood
School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S. 260, 270, but, rather, allows only
one student, the same student for the entire season, to give the invocation, which is subject to particular regulations that confine the content
and topic of the student's message. The majoritarian process implemented by the District guarantees, by definition, that minority candidates will never prevail and that their views will be effectively silenced.
See Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S.
217, 235. Moreover, the District has failed to divorce itself from the
invocations' religious content. The policy involves both perceived and
actual endorsement of religion, see Lee, 505 U. S., at 590, declaring that
the student elections take place because the District "has chosen to
permit" student-delivered invocations, that the invocation "shall" be
conducted "by the high school student council" "[u]pon advice and direction of the high school principal," and that it must be consistent with
the policy's goals, which include "solemniz[ing] the event." A religious
message is the most obvious method of solemnizing an event. Indeed,
the only type of message expressly endorsed in the policy is an "invocation," a term which primarily describes an appeal for divine assistance
and, as used in the past at Santa Fe High School, has always entailed a
focused religious message. A conclusion that the message is not "private speech" is also established by factors beyond the policy's text,
including the official setting in which the invocation is delivered, see,
e. g., Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 73, 76, by the policy's sham secular
purposes, see id., at 75, and by its history, which indicates that the District intended to preserve its long-sanctioned practice of prayer before
football games, see Lee, 505 U. S., at 596. Pp. 301-310.

(b) The Court rejects the District's argument that its policy is distinguishable from the graduation prayer in Lee because it does not
coerce students to participate in religious observances. The first part
of this argument--that there is no impermissible government coercion
because the pregame messages are the product of student choices--fails
for the reasons discussed above explaining why the mechanism of the
dual elections and student speaker do not turn public speech into private speech. The issue resolved in the first election was whether a
student would deliver prayer at varsity football games, and the controversy in this case demonstrates that the students' views are not unanimous on that issue. One of the Establishment Clause's purposes is to
remove debate over this kind of issue from governmental supervision
or control. See Lee, 505 U. S., at 589. Although the ultimate choice
of student speaker is attributable to the students, the District's de530US1 Unit: $U74 [10-23-01 13:25:52] PAGES PGT: OPLG
292 SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE

Syllabus
cision to hold the constitutionally problematic election is clearly a choice
attributable to the State, id., at 587. The second part of the District's
argument--that there is no coercion here because attendance at an extracurricular event, unlike a graduation ceremony, is voluntary--is unpersuasive. For some students, such as cheerleaders, members of the
band, and the team members themselves, attendance at football games
is mandated, sometimes for class credit. The District's argument also
minimizes the immense social pressure, or truly genuine desire, felt
by many students to be involved in the extracurricular event that is
American high school football. Id., at 593. The Constitution demands
that schools not force on students the difficult choice between attending
these games and avoiding personally offensive religious rituals. See
id., at 596. Pp. 310-313.

(c) The Court also rejects the District's argument that respondents'
facial challenge to the policy necessarily must fail because it is premature: No invocation has as yet been delivered under the policy. This
argument assumes that the Court is concerned only with the serious
constitutional injury that occurs when a student is forced to participate
in an act of religious worship because she chooses to attend a school
event. But the Constitution also requires that the Court keep in mind
the myriad, subtle ways in which Establishment Clause values can be
eroded, Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 694, and guard against other
different, yet equally important, constitutional injuries. One is the
mere passage by the District of a policy that has the purpose and perception of government establishment of religion. See, e. g., Bowen v.
Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602; Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612.
As discussed above, the policy's text and the circumstances surrounding
its enactment reveal that it has such a purpose. Another constitutional
violation warranting the Court's attention is the District's implementation of an electoral process that subjects the issue of prayer to a majoritarian vote. Through its election scheme, the District has established a governmental mechanism that turns the school into a forum
for religious debate and empowers the student body majority to subject students of minority views to constitutionally improper messages.
The award of that power alone is not acceptable. Cf. Board of Regents
of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217. For the foregoing
reasons, the policy is invalid on its face. Pp. 313-317.

294 SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Prior to 1995, the Santa Fe High School student who occu-pied the school's elective office of student council chaplain

delivered a prayer over the public address system beforeeach varsity football game for the entire season. This practice, along with others, was challenged in District Court asa violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. While these proceedings were pending in the Dis-trict Court, the school district adopted a different policy that
permits, but does not require, prayer initiated and led by astudent at all home games. The District Court entered an
order modifying that policy to permit only nonsectarian, non-proselytizing prayer. The Court of Appeals held that, even
as modified by the District Court, the football prayer policywas invalid. We granted the school district's petition for
certiorari to review that holding.

I
The Santa Fe Independent School District (District) is apolitical subdivision of the State of Texas, responsible for the

education of more than 4,000 students in a small communityin the southern part of the State. The District includes the
Santa Fe High School, two primary schools, an intermediateschool and the junior high school. Respondents are two sets
of current or former students and their respective mothers.One family is Mormon and the other is Catholic. The District Court permitted respondents (Does) to litigate anony-mously to protect them from intimidation or harassment.

was filed, the District Court entered an order that provided, in part:

"[A]ny further attempt on the part of District or school administration,

the identities of the Plaintiffs in this cause, by means of bogus petitions,

Opinion of the Court
Respondents commenced this action in April 1995 and
moved for a temporary restraining order to prevent the District from violating the Establishment Clause at the imminent graduation exercises. In their complaint the Does
alleged that the District had engaged in several proselytizing practices, such as promoting attendance at a Baptist revival meeting, encouraging membership in religious clubs,
chastising children who held minority religious beliefs, and
distributing Gideon Bibles on school premises. They also
alleged that the District allowed students to read Christian
invocations and benedictions from the stage at graduation
ceremonies,2 and to deliver overtly Christian prayers over
the public address system at home football games.

On May 10, 1995, the District Court entered an interim
order addressing a number of different issues.3 With recease immediately. ANYONE TAKING ANY ACTION ON SCHOOL
PROPERTY, DURING SCHOOL HOURS, OR WITH SCHOOL RESOURCES OR APPROVAL FOR PURPOSES OF ATTEMPTING TO
ELICIT THE NAMES OR IDENTITIES OF THE PLAINTIFFS IN
THIS CAUSE OF ACTION, BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS, WILL FACE THE HARSHEST POSSIBLE CONTEMPT SANCTIONS FROM THIS COURT, AND MAY ADDITIONALLY FACE CRIMINAL LIABILITY. The Court wants these proceedings addressed on their merits, and not on the basis of intimidation or
harassment of the participants on either side." App. 34-35.

2 At the 1994 graduation ceremony the senior class president delivered

this invocation:
"Please bow your heads.
"Dear heavenly Father, thank you for allowing us to gather here safely
tonight. We thank you for the wonderful year you have allowed us to
spend together as students of Santa Fe. We thank you for our teachers
who have devoted many hours to each of us. Thank you, Lord, for our
parents and may each one receive the special blessing. We pray also for
a blessing and guidance as each student moves forward in the future.
Lord, bless this ceremony and give us all a safe journey home. In Jesus'
name we pray." Id., at 19.

3 For example, it prohibited school officials from endorsing or participating in the baccalaureate ceremony sponsored by the Santa Fe Ministerial Alliance, and ordered the District to establish policies to deal with

Opinion of the Court
spect to the impending graduation, the order provided that
"non-denominational prayer" consisting of "an invocation
and/or benediction" could be presented by a senior student
or students selected by members of the graduating class.
The text of the prayer was to be determined by the students,
without scrutiny or preapproval by school officials. References to particular religious figures "such as Mohammed,
Jesus, Buddha, or the like" would be permitted "as long
as the general thrust of the prayer is non-proselytizing."
App. 32.

In response to that portion of the order, the District
adopted a series of policies over several months dealing with
prayer at school functions. The policies enacted in May and
July for graduation ceremonies provided the format for the
August and October policies for football games. The May

The parties stipulated that after this policy was adopted,"the senior class held an election to determine whether to
have an invocation and benediction at the commencement[and that the] class voted, by secret ballot, to include prayer
at the high school graduation." App. 52. In a second votethe class elected two seniors to deliver the invocation and
benediction.4In July, the District enacted another policy eliminating
the requirement that invocations and benedictions be "non-sectarian and nonproselytising," but also providing that if
the District were to be enjoined from enforcing that policy,the May policy would automatically become effective.

The August policy, which was titled "Prayer at FootballGames," was similar to the July policy for graduations. It
also authorized two student elections, the first to determinewhether "invocations" should be delivered, and the second to
select the spokesperson to deliver them. Like the July pol-icy, it contained two parts, an initial statement that omitted
any requirement that the content of the invocation be "non-sectarian and nonproselytising," and a fallback provision that
automatically added that limitation if the preferred policyshould be enjoined. On August 31, 1995, according to the
parties' stipulation: "[T]he district's high school studentsvoted to determine whether a student would deliver prayer

during this ceremony and to help us keep You in our hearts through the
rest of our lives. In God's name we pray. Amen." Id., at 53. The student benediction was similar in content and closed: "Lord, we ask for Your
protection as we depart to our next destination and watch over us as we
go our separate ways. Grant each of us a safe trip and keep us secure
throughout the night. In Your name we pray. Amen." Id., at 54.

student to say a prayer at football games." Id., at 65. A
week later, in a separate election, they selected a student
"to deliver the prayer at varsity football games." Id., at 66.

The final policy (October policy) is essentially the same as
the August policy, though it omits the word "prayer" from
its title, and refers to "messages" and "statements" as well
as "invocations." 5 It is the validity of that policy that is
before us.6

5 Despite these changes, the school did not conduct another election,
under the October policy, to supersede the results of the August policy
election.

"STUDENT ACTIVITIES:
"PRE-GAME CEREMONIES AT FOOTBALL GAMES

"The board has chosen to permit students to deliver a brief invocation
and/or message to be delivered during the pre-game ceremonies of home
varsity football games to solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship and student safety, and to establish the appropriate environment for
the competition.

"Upon advice and direction of the high school principal, each spring, the
high school student council shall conduct an election, by the high school
student body, by secret ballot, to determine whether such a statement or
invocation will be a part of the pre-game ceremonies and if so, shall elect
a student, from a list of student volunteers, to deliver the statement or
invocation. The student volunteer who is selected by his or her classmates may decide what message and/or invocation to deliver, consistent
with the goals and purposes of this policy.

Opinion of the Court
The District Court did enter an order precluding enforcement of the first, open-ended policy. Relying on our decision
in Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992), it held that the
school's "action must not `coerce anyone to support or participate in' a religious exercise." App. to Pet. for Cert. E7.
Applying that test, it concluded that the graduation prayers
appealed "to distinctively Christian beliefs," 7 and that delivering a prayer "over the school's public address system
prior to each football and baseball game coerces student
participation in religious events." 8 Both parties appealed,
the District contending that the enjoined portion of the October policy was permissible and the Does contending that
both alternatives violated the Establishment Clause. The
Court of Appeals majority agreed with the Does.

The decision of the Court of Appeals followed Fifth Circuit
precedent that had announced two rules. In Jones v. Clear
Creek Independent School Dist., 977 F. 2d 963 (1992), that
court held that student-led prayer that was approved by a
vote of the students and was nonsectarian and nonproselytizing was permissible at high school graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, in later cases the Fifth Circuit made it
clear that the Clear Creek rule applied only to high school

sage or invocation will be a part of the pre-game ceremonies and if so,
shall elect a student, from a list of student volunteers, to deliver the statement or invocation. The student volunteer who is selected by his or her
classmates may decide what statement or invocation to deliver, consistent
with the goals and purposes of this policy. Any message and/or invocation delivered by a student must be nonsectarian and nonproselytizing."
Id., at 104-105.

7 "The graduation prayers at issue in the instant case, in contrast, are

infused with explicit references to Jesus Christ and otherwise appeal to
distinctively Christian beliefs. The Court accordingly finds that use of
these prayers during graduation ceremonies, considered in light of the
overall manner in which they were delivered, violated the Establishment
Clause." App. to Pet. for Cert. E8.

Opinion of the Court
graduations and that school-encouraged prayer was constitutionally impermissible at school-related sporting events.
Thus, in Doe v. Duncanville Independent School Dist., 70
F. 3d 402 (1995), it had described a high school graduation
as "a significant, once in-a-lifetime event" to be contrasted
with athletic events in "a setting that is far less solemn and
extraordinary." Id., at 406-407.9

In its opinion in this case, the Court of Appeals explained:

"The controlling feature here is the same as in Duncanville: The prayers are to be delivered at football
games--hardly the sober type of annual event that can
be appropriately solemnized with prayer. The distinction to which [the District] points is simply one without difference. Regardless of whether the prayers are
selected by vote or spontaneously initiated at these
frequently-recurring, informal, school-sponsored events,
school officials are present and have the authority to
stop the prayers. Thus, as we indicated in Duncanville, our decision in Clear Creek II hinged on the singular context and singularly serious nature of a graduation ceremony. Outside that nurturing context, a Clear
Creek Prayer Policy cannot survive. We therefore reverse the district court's holding that [the District's]
alternative Clear Creek Prayer Policy can be extended
to football games, irrespective of the presence of the
nonsectarian, nonproselytizing restrictions." 168 F. 3d,
at 823.

The dissenting judge rejected the majority's distinction
between graduation ceremonies and football games. In his

"prayer-only policy" at football games was permissible in the Fifth Circuit.

opinion the District's October policy created a limited publicforum that had a secular purpose

10 and provided neutral

accommodation of noncoerced, private, religious speech.11We granted the District's petition for certiorari, limited to

the following question: "Whether petitioner's policy permit-ting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games
violates the Establishment Clause." 528 U. S. 1002 (1999).We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that it does.

II
The first Clause in the First Amendment to the FederalConstitution provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting thefree exercise thereof." The Fourteenth Amendment imposes those substantive limitations on the legislative powerof the States and their political subdivisions.

Wallace v.Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 49-50 (1985). In Lee v. Weisman, 505

U. S. 577 (1992), we held that a prayer delivered by a rabbiat a middle school graduation ceremony violated that Clause.
Although this case involves student prayer at a different

10 "There are in fact several secular reasons for allowing a brief, serious
message before football games--some of which [the District] has listed in
its policy. At sporting events, messages and/or invocations can promote,
among other things, honest and fair play, clean competition, individual
challenge to be one's best, importance of team work, and many more goals
that the majority could conceive would it only pause to do so.

"Having again relinquished all editorial control, [the District] has created a limited public forum for the students to give brief statements or
prayers concerning the value of those goals and the methods for achieving
them." 168 F. 3d, at 835.

11 "The majority fails to realize that what is at issue in this facial challenge to this school policy is the neutral accommodation of non-coerced,
private, religious speech, which allows students, selected by students, to
express their personal viewpoints. The state is not involved. The school
board has neither scripted, supervised, endorsed, suggested, nor edited
these personal viewpoints. Yet the majority imposes a judicial curse
upon sectarian religious speech." Id., at 836.

Opinion of the Court
type of school function, our analysis is properly guided by
the principles that we endorsed in Lee.

As we held in that case:

"The principle that government may accommodate
the free exercise of religion does not supersede the
fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment
Clause. It is beyond dispute that, at a minimum, the
Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its
exercise, or otherwise act in a way which `establishes a
[state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.' "
Id., at 587 (citations omitted) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 678 (1984)).

In this case the District first argues that this principle
is inapplicable to its October policy because the messages
are private student speech, not public speech. It reminds
us that "there is a crucial difference between government
speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause
forbids, and private speech endorsing religion, which the
Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect." Board
of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens,
496 U. S. 226, 250 (1990) (opinion of O'Connor, J.). We certainly agree with that distinction, but we are not persuaded
that the pregame invocations should be regarded as "private speech."

These invocations are authorized by a government policy
and take place on government property at governmentsponsored school-related events. Of course, not every message delivered under such circumstances is the government's
own. We have held, for example, that an individual's contribution to a government-created forum was not government
speech. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.
of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). Although the District relies
heavily on Rosenberger and similar cases involving such

Opinion of the Court
forums,12 it is clear that the pregame ceremony is not thetype of forum discussed in those cases.

13 The Santa Fe

school officials simply do not "evince either `by policy or bypractice,' any intent to open the [pregame ceremony] to

`indiscriminate use,' . . . by the student body generally."
Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S. 260, 270
(1988) (quoting Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators'
Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 47 (1983)). Rather, the school allowsonly one student, the same student for the entire season,

to give the invocation. The statement or invocation, more-over, is subject to particular regulations that confine the
content and topic of the student's message, see infra, at 306-307, 309. By comparison, in

Perry we rejected a claim that
the school had created a limited public forum in its schoolmail system despite the fact that it had allowed far more

speakers to address a much broader range of topics than thepolicy at issue here.

14 As we concluded in Perry, "selective

access does not transform government property into a public
forum." 460 U. S., at 47.

12 See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner 44-48, citing Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995) (limited public forum);
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981) (limited public forum); Capitol
Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753 (1995) (traditional public forum); Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993) (limited public forum). Although the
District relies on these public forum cases, it does not actually argue that
the pregame ceremony constitutes such a forum.

13 A conclusion that the District had created a public forum would

help shed light on whether the resulting speech is public or private,
but we also note that we have never held the mere creation of a public
forum shields the government entity from scrutiny under the Establishment Clause. See, e. g., Pinette, 515 U. S., at 772 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("I see no necessity to carve
out . . . an exception to the endorsement test for the public forum
context").

organizations such as "[l]ocal parochial schools, church groups, YMCA's,
and Cub Scout units." 460 U. S., at 39, n. 2.

304 SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
Granting only one student access to the stage at a timedoes not, of course, necessarily preclude a finding that a

school has created a limited public forum. Here, however,Santa Fe's student election system ensures that only those
messages deemed "appropriate" under the District's policymay be delivered. That is, the majoritarian process implemented by the District guarantees, by definition, that mi-nority candidates will never prevail and that their views will
be effectively silenced.Recently, in

Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v.Southworth, 529 U. S. 217 (2000), we explained why student

elections that determine, by majority vote, which expres-sive activities shall receive or not receive school benefits are
constitutionally problematic:

"To the extent the referendum substitutes majoritydeterminations for viewpoint neutrality it would undermine the constitutional protection the program re-quires. The whole theory of viewpoint neutrality is
that minority views are treated with the same respectas are majority views. Access to a public forum, for
instance, does not depend upon majoritarian consent.That principle is controlling here."

Id., at 235.

Like the student referendum for funding in Southworth, thisstudent election does nothing to protect minority views but

rather places the students who hold such views at the mercyof the majority.

15 Because "fundamental rights may not be

15 If instead of a choice between an invocation and no pregame message, the first election determined whether a political speech should be
made, and the second election determined whether the speaker should
be a Democrat or a Republican, it would be rather clear that the public
address system was being used to deliver a partisan message reflecting
the viewpoint of the majority rather than a random statement by a private individual.

The fact that the District's policy provides for the election of the
speaker only after the majority has voted on her message identifies an
obvious distinction between this case and the typical election of a "stu530US1 Unit: $U74 [10-23-01 13:25:52] PAGES PGT: OPLG

638 (1943), the District's elections are insufficient safeguardsof diverse student speech.

In Lee, the school district made the related argument thatits policy of endorsing only "civic or nonsectarian" prayer
was acceptable because it minimized the intrusion on theaudience as a whole. We rejected that claim by explaining
that such a majoritarian policy "does not lessen the offenseor isolation to the objectors. At best it narrows their number, at worst increases their sense of isolation and affront."505 U. S., at 594. Similarly, while Santa Fe's majoritarian
election might ensure that most of the students are repre-sented, it does nothing to protect the minority; indeed, it
likely serves to intensify their offense.Moreover, the District has failed to divorce itself from
the religious content in the invocations. It has not suc-ceeded in doing so, either by claiming that its policy is
" `one of neutrality rather than endorsement' " 16 or by char-acterizing the individual student as the "circuit-breaker"

17

in the process. Contrary to the District's repeated asser-tions that it has adopted a "hands-off " approach to the pregame invocation, the realities of the situation plainly revealthat its policy involves both perceived and actual endorsement of religion. In this case, as we found in Lee, the "de-gree of school involvement" makes it clear that the pregame prayers bear "the imprint of the State and thus putschool-age children who objected in an untenable position."

election process. The text of the October policy, however,
exposes the extent of the school's entanglement. The elections take place at all only because the school "board has
chosen to permit students to deliver a brief invocation and/or
message." App. 104 (emphasis added). The elections thus
"shall" be conducted "by the high school student council" and
"[u]pon advice and direction of the high school principal."
Id., at 104-105. The decision whether to deliver a message
is first made by majority vote of the entire student body,
followed by a choice of the speaker in a separate, similar
majority election. Even though the particular words used
by the speaker are not determined by those votes, the policy
mandates that the "statement or invocation" be "consistent
with the goals and purposes of this policy," which are "to
solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship and
student safety, and to establish the appropriate environment
for the competition." Ibid.

In addition to involving the school in the selection of the
speaker, the policy, by its terms, invites and encourages religious messages. The policy itself states that the purpose
of the message is "to solemnize the event." A religious
message is the most obvious method of solemnizing an event.
Moreover, the requirements that the message "promote good
sportsmanship" and "establish the appropriate environment
for competition" further narrow the types of message
deemed appropriate, suggesting that a solemn, yet nonreligious, message, such as commentary on United States foreign policy, would be prohibited.18 Indeed, the only type of
message that is expressly endorsed in the text is an "invocation"--a term that primarily describes an appeal for divine

18 The Chief Justice's hypothetical of the student body president
asked by the school to introduce a guest speaker with a biography of her
accomplishments, see post, at 325 (dissenting opinion), obviously would
pose no problems under the Establishment Clause.

Opinion of the Court
assistance.19 In fact, as used in the past at Santa Fe HighSchool, an "invocation" has always entailed a focused religious message. Thus, the expressed purposes of the policyencourage the selection of a religious message, and that is
precisely how the students understand the policy. The results of the elections described in the parties' stipulation 20
make it clear that the students understood that the central
question before them was whether prayer should be a part
of the pregame ceremony.21 We recognize the important
role that public worship plays in many communities, as well
as the sincere desire to include public prayer as a part of
various occasions so as to mark those occasions' significance.
But such religious activity in public schools, as elsewhere,
must comport with the First Amendment.

The actual or perceived endorsement of the message,
moreover, is established by factors beyond just the text of
the policy. Once the student speaker is selected and the
message composed, the invocation is then delivered to a
large audience assembled as part of a regularly scheduled,
school-sponsored function conducted on school property.
The message is broadcast over the school's public address
system, which remains subject to the control of school officials. It is fair to assume that the pregame ceremony is

19 See, e. g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1190 (1993)
(defining "invocation" as "a prayer of entreaty that is usu[ally] a call for
the divine presence and is offered at the beginning of a meeting or service
of worship").

20 See supra, at 297-298, and n. 4.

21 Even if the plain language of the October policy were facially neutral,

"the Establishment Clause forbids a State to hide behind the application
of formally neutral criteria and remain studiously oblivious to the effects
of its actions." Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515
U. S., at 777 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S.

context).

Opinion of the Court
clothed in the traditional indicia of school sporting events,which generally include not just the team, but also cheerleaders and band members dressed in uniforms sporting theschool name and mascot. The school's name is likely written
in large print across the field and on banners and flags. Thecrowd will certainly include many who display the school
colors and insignia on their school T-shirts, jackets, or hats
and who may also be waving signs displaying the schoolname. It is in a setting such as this that "[t]he board has

chosen to permit" the elected student to rise and give the"statement or invocation."

In this context the members of the listening audience
must perceive the pregame message as a public expression
of the views of the majority of the student body delivered
with the approval of the school administration. In cases involving state participation in a religious activity, one of the
relevant questions is "whether an objective observer, acquainted with the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute, would perceive it as a state endorsement
of prayer in public schools." Wallace, 472 U. S., at 73, 76
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Capitol
Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753,
777 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). Regardless of the listener's support for, or
objection to, the message, an objective Santa Fe High School
student will unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame
prayer as stamped with her school's seal of approval.

The text and history of this policy, moreover, reinforce
our objective student's perception that the prayer is, in actuality, encouraged by the school. When a governmental
entity professes a secular purpose for an arguably religious
policy, the government's characterization is, of course, entitled to some deference. But it is nonetheless the duty of
the courts to "distinguis[h] a sham secular purpose from a
sincere one." Wallace, 472 U. S., at 75 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

309Cite as: 530 U. S. 290 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
According to the District, the secular purposes of the pol-icy are to "foste[r] free expression of private persons . . .

as well [as to] solemniz[e] sporting events, promot[e] goodsportsmanship and student safety, and establis[h] an appropriate environment for competition." Brief for Petitioner14. We note, however, that the District's approval of only
one specific kind of message, an "invocation," is not necessary to further any of these purposes. Additionally, the factthat only one student is permitted to give a content-limited

message suggests that this policy does little to "foste[r] freeexpression." Furthermore, regardless of whether one considers a sporting event an appropriate occasion for solemnity,
the use of an invocation to foster such solemnity is impermissible when, in actuality, it constitutes prayer sponsored
by the school. And it is unclear what type of message would
be both appropriately "solemnizing" under the District's policy and yet nonreligious.

Most striking to us is the evolution of the current policy
from the long-sanctioned office of "Student Chaplain" to the
candidly titled "Prayer at Football Games" regulation. This
history indicates that the District intended to preserve the
practice of prayer before football games. The conclusion
that the District viewed the October policy simply as a continuation of the previous policies is dramatically illustrated
by the fact that the school did not conduct a new election,
pursuant to the current policy, to replace the results of the
previous election, which occurred under the former policy.
Given these observations, and in light of the school's history
of regular delivery of a student-led prayer at athletic events,
it is reasonable to infer that the specific purpose of the policy
was to preserve a popular "state-sponsored religious practice." Lee, 505 U. S., at 596.

School sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible because it sends the ancillary message to members of
the audience who are nonadherants "that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an ac530US1 Unit: $U74 [10-23-01 13:25:52] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
companying message to adherants that they are insiders,favored members of the political community." Lynch, 465

U. S., at 688 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The delivery ofsuch a message--over the school's public address system, by
a speaker representing the student body, under the supervi-sion of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that
explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer--is notproperly characterized as "private" speech.

III
The District next argues that its football policy is distin-guishable from the graduation prayer in

Lee because it doesnot coerce students to participate in religious observances.

Its argument has two parts: first, that there is no impermis-sible government coercion because the pregame messages
are the product of student choices; and second, that thereis really no coercion at all because attendance at an extracurricular event, unlike a graduation ceremony, is voluntary.The reasons just discussed explaining why the alleged
"circuit-breaker" mechanism of the dual elections and stu-dent speaker do not turn public speech into private speech
also demonstrate why these mechanisms do not insulate theschool from the coercive element of the final message. In
fact, this aspect of the District's argument exposes anew theconcerns that are created by the majoritarian election system. The parties' stipulation clearly states that the issueresolved in the first election was "whether a student would
deliver prayer at varsity football games," App. 65, and thecontroversy in this case demonstrates that the views of the
students are not unanimous on that issue.One of the purposes served by the Establishment Clause
is to remove debate over this kind of issue from govern-mental supervision or control. We explained in

Lee that the"preservation and transmission of religious beliefs and worship is a responsibility and a choice committed to the privatesphere." 505 U. S., at 589. The two student elections au530US1 Unit: $U74 [10-23-01 13:25:52] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
thorized by the policy, coupled with the debates that pre-sumably must precede each, impermissibly invade that private sphere. The election mechanism, when considered inlight of the history in which the policy in question evolved,
reflects a device the District put in place that determineswhether religious messages will be delivered at home football games. The mechanism encourages divisiveness along
religious lines in a public school setting, a result at odds withthe Establishment Clause. Although it is true that the ultimate choice of student speaker is "attributable to the stu-dents," Brief for Petitioner 40, the District's decision to hold
the constitutionally problematic election is clearly "a choice
attributable to the State," Lee, 505 U. S., at 587.

The District further argues that attendance at the commencement ceremonies at issue in Lee "differs dramatically"
from attendance at high school football games, which it contends "are of no more than passing interest to many students" and are "decidedly extracurricular," thus dissipating
any coercion. Brief for Petitioner 41. Attendance at a high
school football game, unlike showing up for class, is certainly
not required in order to receive a diploma. Moreover, we
may assume that the District is correct in arguing that the
informal pressure to attend an athletic event is not as strong
as a senior's desire to attend her own graduation ceremony.

There are some students, however, such as cheerleaders,
members of the band, and, of course, the team members
themselves, for whom seasonal commitments mandate their
attendance, sometimes for class credit. The District also
minimizes the importance to many students of attending and
participating in extracurricular activities as part of a complete educational experience. As we noted in Lee, "[l]aw
reaches past formalism." 505 U. S., at 595. To assert that
high school students do not feel immense social pressure,
or have a truly genuine desire, to be involved in the extracurricular event that is American high school football is
"formalistic in the extreme." Ibid. We stressed in Lee the

Opinion of the Court
obvious observation that "adolescents are often susceptibleto pressure from their peers towards conformity, and that

the influence is strongest in matters of social convention."Id., at 593. High school home football games are traditional
gatherings of a school community; they bring together stu-dents and faculty as well as friends and family from years
present and past to root for a common cause. Undoubtedly,the games are not important to some students, and they voluntarily choose not to attend. For many others, however,the choice between attending these games and avoiding personally offensive religious rituals is in no practical sense aneasy one. The Constitution, moreover, demands that the
school may not force this difficult choice upon these studentsfor "[i]t is a tenet of the First Amendment that the State
cannot require one of its citizens to forfeit his or her rightsand benefits as the price of resisting conformance to statesponsored religious practice." Id., at 596.Even if we regard every high school student's decision to
attend a home football game as purely voluntary, we arenevertheless persuaded that the delivery of a pregame
prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present toparticipate in an act of religious worship. For "the government may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxythan it may use more direct means." Id., at 594. As in Lee,
"[w]hat to most believers may seem nothing more than a rea-sonable request that the nonbeliever respect their religious
practices, in a school context may appear to the nonbelieveror dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the
State to enforce a religious orthodoxy." Id., at 592. Theconstitutional command will not permit the District "to exact
religious conformity from a student as the price" of joiningher classmates at a varsity football game.

students to choose between compliance or forfeiture demonstrates fundamental inconsistency in its argumentation. It fails to acknowledge that

Opinion of the Court
The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment preventthe government from making any law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.By no means do these commands impose a prohibition on all
religious activity in our public schools. See, e. g., Lamb'sChapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508
U. S. 384, 395 (1993); Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226 (1990); Wallace,472 U. S., at 59. Indeed, the common purpose of the Religion Clauses "is to secure religious liberty." Engel v. Vi-tale, 370 U. S. 421, 430 (1962). Thus, nothing in the Constitution as interpreted by this Court prohibits any publicschool student from voluntarily praying at any time before,
during, or after the schoolday. But the religious libertyprotected by the Constitution is abridged when the State
affirmatively sponsors the particular religious practice ofprayer.

IV
Finally, the District argues repeatedly that the Doeshave made a premature facial challenge to the October policy

that necessarily must fail. The District emphasizes, quitecorrectly, that until a student actually delivers a solemnizing message under the latest version of the policy, there canbe no certainty that any of the statements or invocations will
be religious. Thus, it concludes, the October policy neces-sarily survives a facial challenge.

This argument, however, assumes that we are concernedonly with the serious constitutional injury that occurs when
a student is forced to participate in an act of religious worimperative was for Daniel and Deborah Weisman religious conformance
compelled by the State. While in some societies the wishes of the majority might prevail, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is
addressed to this contingency and rejects the balance urged upon us. The
Constitution forbids the State to exact religious conformity from a student
as the price of attending her own high school graduation. This is the
calculus the Constitution commands." Lee, 505 U. S., at 595-596.

ship because she chooses to attend a school event. But theConstitution also requires that we keep in mind "the myriad,

subtle ways in which Establishment Clause values can beeroded,"

Lynch, 465 U. S., at 694 (O'Connor, J., concurring),
and that we guard against other different, yet equally im-portant, constitutional injuries. One is the mere passage by

the District of a policy that has the purpose and perception
of government establishment of religion. Another is theimplementation of a governmental electoral process that

subjects the issue of prayer to a majoritarian vote.The District argues that the facial challenge must fail
because "Santa Fe's Football Policy cannot be invalidated
on the basis of some `possibility or even likelihood' of an unconstitutional application." Brief for Petitioner 17 (quoting
Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 613 (1988)). Our Establishment Clause cases involving facial challenges, however,
have not focused solely on the possible applications of the
statute, but rather have considered whether the statute
has an unconstitutional purpose. Writing for the Court in
Bowen, The Chief Justice concluded that "[a]s in previous
cases involving facial challenges on Establishment Clause
grounds, e. g., Edwards v. Aguillard, [482 U. S. 578 (1987)];
Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), we assess the constitutionality of an enactment by reference to the three factors
first articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612
(1971) . . . , which guides `[t]he general nature of our inquiry
in this area,' Mueller v. Allen, supra, at 394." 487 U. S., at
602. Under the Lemon standard, a court must invalidate a
statute if it lacks "a secular legislative purpose." Lemon v.
Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612 (1971). It is therefore proper,
as part of this facial challenge, for us to examine the purpose
of the October policy.

As discussed, supra, at 306-307, 309, the text of the October
policy alone reveals that it has an unconstitutional purpose.
The plain language of the policy clearly spells out the extent
of school involvement in both the election of the speaker

Opinion of the Court
and the content of the message. Additionally, the text ofthe October policy specifies only one, clearly preferred message--that of Santa Fe's traditional religious "invocation."Finally, the extremely selective access of the policy and other
content restrictions confirm that it is not a content-neutralregulation that creates a limited public forum for the expression of student speech. Our examination, however, need not
stop at an analysis of the text of the policy.This case comes to us as the latest step in developing litigation brought as a challenge to institutional practices thatunquestionably violated the Establishment Clause. One of
those practices was the District's long-established tradition
of sanctioning student-led prayer at varsity football games.
The narrow question before us is whether implementation
of the October policy insulates the continuation of such prayers from constitutional scrutiny. It does not. Our inquiry
into this question not only can, but must, include an examination of the circumstances surrounding its enactment.
Whether a government activity violates the Establishment
Clause is "in large part a legal question to be answered on
the basis of judicial interpretation of social facts. . . . Every
government practice must be judged in its unique circumstances . . . ." Lynch, 465 U. S., at 693-694 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Our discussion in the previous sections, supra, at
307-310, demonstrates that in this case the District's direct
involvement with school prayer exceeds constitutional limits.

The District, nevertheless, asks us to pretend that we
do not recognize what every Santa Fe High School student
understands clearly--that this policy is about prayer. The
District further asks us to accept what is obviously untrue:
that these messages are necessary to "solemnize" a football
game and that this single-student, year-long position is essential to the protection of student speech. We refuse to
turn a blind eye to the context in which this policy arose,
and that context quells any doubt that this policy was implemented with the purpose of endorsing school prayer.

530US1 Unit: $U74 [10-23-01 13:25:52] PAGES PGT: OPLG
316 SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
Therefore, the simple enactment of this policy, with thepurpose and perception of school endorsement of student

prayer, was a constitutional violation. We need not wait forthe inevitable to confirm and magnify the constitutional injury. In Wallace, for example, we invalidated Alabama's as
yet unimplemented and voluntary "moment of silence" statute based on our conclusion that it was enacted "for the sole
purpose of expressing the State's endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each school day."
472 U. S., at 60; see also Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.
v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 532 (1993). Therefore, even if no
Santa Fe High School student were ever to offer a religious
message, the October policy fails a facial challenge because
the attempt by the District to encourage prayer is also at
issue. Government efforts to endorse religion cannot evade
constitutional reproach based solely on the remote possibility
that those attempts may fail.

This policy likewise does not survive a facial challenge
because it impermissibly imposes upon the student body a
majoritarian election on the issue of prayer. Through its
election scheme, the District has established a governmental
electoral mechanism that turns the school into a forum for
religious debate. It further empowers the student body
majority with the authority to subject students of minority
views to constitutionally improper messages. The award
of that power alone, regardless of the students' ultimate
use of it, is not acceptable.23 Like the referendum in Board
of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S.

23 The Chief Justice accuses us of "essentially invalidat[ing] all student elections," see post, at 321. This is obvious hyperbole. We have
concluded that the resulting religious message under this policy would be
attributable to the school, not just the student, see supra, at 301-310.
For this reason, we now hold only that the District's decision to allow the
student majority to control whether students of minority views are subjected to a school-sponsored prayer violates the Establishment Clause.

Opinion of the Court
217 (2000), the election mechanism established by the Dis-trict undermines the essential protection of minority viewpoints. Such a system encourages divisiveness along re-ligious lines and threatens the imposition of coercion
upon those students not desiring to participate in a reli-gious exercise. Simply by establishing this school-related
procedure, which entrusts the inherently nongovernmental
subject of religion to a majoritarian vote, a constitutionalviolation has occurred.

24 No further injury is required for

the policy to fail a facial challenge.To properly examine this policy on its face, we "must be

deemed aware of the history and context of the communityand forum,"

Pinette, 515 U. S., at 780 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Our examinationof those circumstances above leads to the conclusion that

this policy does not provide the District with the constitu-tional safe harbor it sought. The policy is invalid on its face
because it establishes an improper majoritarian election onreligion, and unquestionably has the purpose and creates the
perception of encouraging the delivery of prayer at a series
of important school events.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, accordingly,

affirmed.

It is so ordered.

24 The Chief Justice contends that we have "misconstrue[d] the nature . . . [of] the policy as being an election on `prayer' and `religion,' "
post, at 320. We therefore reiterate that the District has stipulated to
the facts that the most recent election was held "to determine whether a
student would deliver prayer at varsity football games," that the "students chose to allow a student to say a prayer at football games," and that
a second election was then held "to determine which student would deliver the prayer." App. 65-66 (emphases added). Furthermore, the policy was titled "Prayer at Football Games." Id., at 99 (emphasis added).
Although the District has since eliminated the word "prayer" from the
policy, it apparently viewed that change as sufficiently minor as to make
holding a new election unnecessary.

318 SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST. v. DOE

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia
and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court distorts existing precedent to conclude that the
school district's student-message program is invalid on its
face under the Establishment Clause. But even more disturbing than its holding is the tone of the Court's opinion; it
bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life.
Neither the holding nor the tone of the opinion is faithful to
the meaning of the Establishment Clause, when it is recalled
that George Washington himself, at the request of the very
Congress which passed the Bill of Rights, proclaimed a day
of "public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors
of Almighty God." Presidential Proclamation, 1 Messages
and Papers of the Presidents, 1789-1897, p. 64 (J. Richardson
ed. 1897).

We do not learn until late in the Court's opinion that respondents in this case challenged the district's studentmessage program at football games before it had been put
into practice. As the Court explained in United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987), the fact that a policy might
"operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of
circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid."
See also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 612 (1988).
While there is an exception to this principle in the First
Amendment overbreadth context because of our concern that
people may refrain from speech out of fear of prosecution,
Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing
Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 38-40 (1999), there is no similar justification for Establishment Clause cases. No speech will
be "chilled" by the existence of a government policy that
might unconstitutionally endorse religion over nonreligion.
Therefore, the question is not whether the district's policy
may be applied in violation of the Establishment Clause, but
whether it inevitably will be.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
The Court, venturing into the realm of prophecy, decidesthat it "need not wait for the inevitable" and invalidates the

district's policy on its face. See ante, at 316. To do so, itapplies the most rigid version of the oft-criticized test of
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971).1

Lemon has had a checkered career in the decisional law
of this Court. See, e. g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 398-399 (1993)(S

calia, J., concurring in judgment) (collecting opinions
criticizing Lemon); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 108-114(1985) (R

ehnquist, J., dissenting) (stating that Lemon's
"three-part test represents a determined effort to craft aworkable rule from a historically faulty doctrine; but the

rule can only be as sound as the doctrine it attempts to serv-ice" (internal quotation marks omitted));

1 The Court rightly points out that in facial challenges in the Establishment Clause context, we have looked to Lemon's three factors to "guid[e]
[t]he general nature of our inquiry." Ante, at 314 (internal quotation
marks omitted) (citing Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602 (1988)). In
Bowen, we looked to Lemon as such a guide and determined that a federal
grant program was not invalid on its face, noting that "[i]t has not been
the Court's practice, in considering facial challenges to statutes of this
kind, to strike them down in anticipation that particular applications may
result in unconstitutional use of funds." 487 U. S., at 612 (internal quotation marks omitted). But here the Court, rather than looking to Lemon
as a guide, applies Lemon's factors stringently and ignores Bowen's admonition that mere anticipation of unconstitutional applications does not warrant striking a policy on its face.

v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), and Larson v. Valente, 456
U. S. 228 (1982)]"). Indeed, in Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577
(1992), an opinion upon which the Court relies heavily today,
we mentioned, but did not feel compelled to apply, the Lemon
test. See also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 233 (1997)
(stating that Lemon's entanglement test is merely "an aspect
of the inquiry into a statute's effect"); Hunt v. McNair, 413
U. S. 734, 741 (1973) (stating that the Lemon factors are "no
more than helpful signposts").

Even if it were appropriate to apply the Lemon test here,
the district's student-message policy should not be invalidated on its face. The Court applies Lemon and holds that
the "policy is invalid on its face because it establishes an
improper majoritarian election on religion, and unquestionably has the purpose and creates the perception of encouraging the delivery of prayer at a series of important school
events." Ante, at 317. The Court's reliance on each of
these conclusions misses the mark.

First, the Court misconstrues the nature of the "majoritarian election" permitted by the policy as being an election
on "prayer" and "religion." 2 See ante, at 314, 317. To the
contrary, the election permitted by the policy is a two-fold
process whereby students vote first on whether to have a
student speaker before football games at all, and second, if
the students vote to have such a speaker, on who that
speaker will be. App. 104-105. It is conceivable that the
election could become one in which student candidates campaign on platforms that focus on whether or not they will

2 The Court attempts to support its misinterpretation of the nature of
the election process by noting that the district stipulated to facts about
the most recent election. See ante, at 317, n. 24. Of course, the most
recent election was conducted under the previous policy--a policy that
required an elected student speaker to give a pregame invocation. See
App. 65-66, 99-100. There has not been an election under the policy at
issue here, which expressly allows the student speaker to give a message
as opposed to an invocation.

pray if elected. It is also conceivable that the election couldlead to a Christian prayer before 90 percent of the football

games. If, upon implementation, the policy operated in thisfashion, we would have a record before us to review whether
the policy, as applied, violated the Establishment Clause orunduly suppressed minority viewpoints. But it is possible
that the students might vote not to have a pregame speaker,in which case there would be no threat of a constitutional
violation. It is also possible that the election would notfocus on prayer, but on public speaking ability or social popularity. And if student campaigning did begin to focus onprayer, the school might decide to implement reasonable
campaign restrictions.3But the Court ignores these possibilities by holding that
merely granting the student body the power to elect aspeaker that may choose to pray, "regardless of the students'
ultimate use of it, is not acceptable." Ante, at 316. TheCourt so holds despite that any speech that may occur as
a result of the election process here would be private, notgovernment, speech. The elected student, not the government, would choose what to say. Support for the Court'sholding cannot be found in any of our cases. And it essentially invalidates all student elections. A newly elected stu-dent body president, or even a newly elected prom king or
queen, could use opportunities for public speaking to sayprayers. Under the Court's view, the mere grant of power

3 The Court's reliance on language regarding the student referendum in
Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217
(2000), to support its conclusion with respect to the election process is
misplaced. That case primarily concerned free speech, and, more particularly, mandated financial support of a public forum. But as stated above,
if this case were in the "as applied" context and we were presented with
the appropriate record, our language in Southworth could become more
applicable. In fact, Southworth itself demonstrates the impropriety of
making a decision with respect to the election process without a record of
its operation. There we remanded in part for a determination of how the
referendum functions. See id., at 235-236.

to the students to vote for such offices, in light of the fear
that those elected might publicly pray, violates the Establishment Clause.

Second, with respect to the policy's purpose, the Court
holds that "the simple enactment of this policy, with the purpose and perception of school endorsement of student prayer,
was a constitutional violation." Ante, at 316. But the policy itself has plausible secular purposes: "[T]o solemnize the
event, to promote good sportsmanship and student safety,
and to establish the appropriate environment for the competition." App. 104-105. Where a governmental body "expresses a plausible secular purpose" for an enactment,
"courts should generally defer to that stated intent." Wallace, 472 U. S., at 74-75 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 394-395
(1983) (stressing this Court's "reluctance to attribute unconstitutional motives to the States, particularly when a plausible secular purpose for the State's program may be discerned
from the face of the statute"). The Court grants no deference to--and appears openly hostile toward--the policy's
stated purposes, and wastes no time in concluding that they
are a sham.

For example, the Court dismisses the secular purpose of
solemnization by claiming that it "invites and encourages religious messages." Ante, at 306; Cf. Lynch, 465 U. S., at 693
(O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing the "legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing public occasions"). The Court
so concludes based on its rather strange view that a "religious message is the most obvious means of solemnizing an
event." Ante, at 306. But it is easy to think of solemn messages that are not religious in nature, for example urging
that a game be fought fairly. And sporting events often
begin with a solemn rendition of our national anthem, with
its concluding verse "And this be our motto: `In God is our
trust.' " Under the Court's logic, a public school that spon530US1 Unit: $U74 [10-23-01 13:25:52] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
sors the singing of the national anthem before football gamesviolates the Establishment Clause. Although the Court apparently believes that solemnizing football games is an ille-gitimate purpose, the voters in the school district seem to
disagree. Nothing in the Establishment Clause prevents
them from making this choice.4

The Court bases its conclusion that the true purpose of the
policy is to endorse student prayer on its view of the school
district's history of Establishment Clause violations and the
context in which the policy was written, that is, as "the latest
step in developing litigation brought as a challenge to institutional practices that unquestionably violated the Establishment Clause." Ante, at 308-309, 315. But the context--
attempted compliance with a District Court order--actually
demonstrates that the school district was acting diligently to
come within the governing constitutional law. The District
Court ordered the school district to formulate a policy consistent with Fifth Circuit precedent, which permitted a
school district to have a prayer-only policy. See Jones v.
Clear Creek Independent School Dist., 977 F. 2d 963 (CA5
1992). But the school district went further than required by
the District Court order and eventually settled on a policy
that gave the student speaker a choice to deliver either an

4 The Court also determines that the use of the term "invocation" in the
policy is an express endorsement of that type of message over all others.
See ante, at 306-307. A less cynical view of the policy's text is that it
permits many types of messages, including invocations. That a policy tolerates religion does not mean that it improperly endorses it. Indeed, as
the majority reluctantly admits, the Free Exercise Clause mandates such
tolerance. See ante, at 313 ("[N]othing in the Constitution as interpreted
by this Court prohibits any public school student from voluntarily praying
at any time before, during, or after the schoolday"); see also Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 673 (1984) ("Nor does the Constitution require
complete separation of church and state; it affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any").

invocation or a message. In so doing, the school district ex-hibited a willingness to comply with, and exceed, Establishment Clause restrictions. Thus, the policy cannot be viewedas having a sectarian purpose.

The Court also relies on our decision in Lee v. Weisman,505 U. S. 577 (1992), to support its conclusion. In Lee, we

concluded that the content of the speech at issue, a gradua-tion prayer given by a rabbi, was "directed and controlled"
by a school official. Id., at 588. In other words, at issue in
Lee was government speech. Here, by contrast, the poten-tial speech at issue, if the policy had been allowed to proceed,

would be a message or invocation selected or created by astudent. That is, if there were speech at issue here, it would
be private speech. The "crucial difference between govern-ment speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment
Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing religion, whichthe Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect," applies
with particular force to the question of endorsement.
Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v.Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 250 (1990) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in original).Had the policy been put into practice, the students may
have chosen a speaker according to wholly secular criteria--like good public speaking skills or social popularity--and the
student speaker may have chosen, on her own accord, to de-liver a religious message. Such an application of the policy

5 Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985), is distinguishable on these
grounds. There we struck down an Alabama statute that added an express reference to prayer to an existing statute providing a moment of
silence for meditation. Id., at 59. Here the school district added a secular alternative to a policy that originally provided only for prayer. More
importantly, in Wallace, there was "unrebutted evidence" that pointed to
a wholly religious purpose, id., at 58, and Alabama "conceded in the courts
below that the purpose of the statute was to make prayer part of daily
classroom activity," id., at 77-78 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).
There is no such evidence or concession here.

would likely pass constitutional muster. See Lee, supra, at
630, n. 8 (Souter, J., concurring) ("If the State had chosen
its graduation day speakers according to wholly secular criteria, and if one of those speakers (not a state actor) had
individually chosen to deliver a religious message, it would
be harder to attribute an endorsement of religion to the
State").

Finally, the Court seems to demand that a government
policy be completely neutral as to content or be considered
one that endorses religion. See ante, at 305. This is undoubtedly a new requirement, as our Establishment Clause
jurisprudence simply does not mandate "content neutrality."
That concept is found in our First Amendment speech cases
and is used as a guide for determining when we apply strict
scrutiny. For example, we look to "content neutrality" in
reviewing loudness restrictions imposed on speech in public
forums, see Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781
(1989), and regulations against picketing, see Boos v. Barry,
485 U. S. 312 (1988). The Court seems to think that the fact
that the policy is not content neutral somehow controls the
Establishment Clause inquiry. See ante, at 305.

But even our speech jurisprudence would not require that
all public school actions with respect to student speech be
content neutral. See, e. g., Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v.
Fraser, 478 U. S. 675 (1986) (allowing the imposition of sanctions against a student speaker who, in nominating a fellow
student for elective office during an assembly, referred to his
candidate in terms of an elaborate sexually explicit metaphor). Schools do not violate the First Amendment every
time they restrict student speech to certain categories. But
under the Court's view, a school policy under which the student body president is to solemnize the graduation ceremony
by giving a favorable introduction to the guest speaker
would be facially unconstitutional. Solemnization "invites
and encourages" prayer and the policy's content limitations

prohibit the student body president from giving a solemn,yet nonreligious, message like "commentary on United

States foreign policy." See ante, at 306.The policy at issue here may be applied in an unconstitutional manner, but it will be time enough to invalidate it ifthat is found to be the case. I would reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals.

MILLER, SUPERINTENDENT, PENDLETON COR-RECTIONAL FACILITY,

et al. v. FRENCH et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 99-224. Argued April 18, 2000--Decided June 19, 2000*
In 1975, prison inmates at Indiana's Pendleton Correctional Facility

brought a class action, and the District Court issued an injunction,
which remains in effect, to remedy violations of the Eighth Amendment
regarding conditions of confinement. Congress subsequently enacted
the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), which, as relevant
here, sets a standard for the entry and termination of prospective relief
in civil actions challenging prison conditions. Specifically, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3626(b)(2) provides that a defendant or intervenor may move to terminate prospective relief under an existing injunction that does not meet
that standard; $ 3626(b)(3) provides that a court may not terminate such
relief if it makes certain findings; and $ 3626(e)(2) dictates that a motion to terminate such relief "shall operate as a stay" of that relief beginning 30 days after the motion is filed and ending when the court
rules on the motion. In 1997, petitioner prison officials (hereinafter
State) filed a motion to terminate the remedial order under $ 3626(b).
Respondent prisoners moved to enjoin the operation of the automatic
stay, arguing that $ 3626(e)(2) violates due process and separation of
powers principles. The District Court enjoined the stay, the State appealed, and the United States intervened to defend $ 3626(e)(2)'s constitutionality. In affirming, the Seventh Circuit concluded that $ 3626(e)(2)
precluded courts from exercising their equitable powers to enjoin the
stay, but that the statute, so construed, was unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds.

Held:

1. Congress clearly intended to make operation of the PLRA's automatic stay provision mandatory, precluding courts from exercising
their equitable power to enjoin the stay. The Government contends
that (1) the Court should not interpret a statute as displacing courts'
traditional equitable authority to preserve the status quo pending
resolution on the merits absent the clearest command to the contrary
and (2) reading $ 3626(e)(2) to remove that equitable power would

*Together with No. 99-582, United States v. French et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

raise serious separation of powers questions, and therefore should
be avoided under the canon of constitutional doubt. But where, as
here, Congress has made its intent clear, this Court must give effect
to that intent. Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195, 215.
Under $ 3626(e)(2), a stay is automatic once a state defendant has filed
a $ 3626(b) motion, and the command that it "shall operate as a stay
during" the specified time period indicates that it is mandatory throughout that period. The statute's plain meaning would be subverted were

$ 3626(e)(2) interpreted merely as a burden-shifting mechanism that
does not prevent courts from suspending the stay. Viewing the automatic stay provision in the context of $ 3626 as a whole confirms the
Court's conclusion. Section 3626(e)(4) provides for an appeal from an
order preventing the automatic stay's operation, not from the denial of
a motion to enjoin a stay. This provision's one-way nature only makes
sense if the stay is required to operate during a specific time period,
such that any attempt by a district court to circumvent the mandatory
stay is immediately reviewable. Mandamus is not a more appropriate
remedy because it is granted only in the exercise of sound discretion.
Given that curbing the courts' equitable discretion was a principal objective of the PLRA, it would have been odd for Congress to have left

$ 3626(e)(2)'s enforcement to that discretion. Section 3626(e)(3) also
does not support the Government's view, for it only permits the stay's
starting point to be delayed for up to 90 days; it does not affect the
stay's operation once it begins. While construing $ 3626(e)(2) to remove
courts' equitable discretion raises constitutional questions, the canon
of constitutional doubt permits the Court to avoid such questions only
where the saving construction is not plainly contrary to Congress' intent. Pp. 336-341.

2. Section 3626(e) does not violate separation of powers principles.
The Constitution prohibits one branch of the Government from encroaching on the central prerogatives of another. Article III gives the
Federal Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to decide
them, subject to review only by superior Article III courts. Plaut v.
Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 218-219. Respondents contend
that $ 3626(e)(2) violates the separation of powers principle by legislatively suspending a final judgment of an Article III court in violation
of Plaut and Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409. Unlike the situation in Hayburn's Case, $ 3626(e)(2) does not involve direct review of a judicial decision by the Legislative or Executive Branch. Nor does it involve the
reopening of a final judgment, as was addressed in Plaut. Plaut was
careful to distinguish legislation that attempted to reopen the dismissal
of a money damages suit from that altering the prospective effect of
injunctions entered by Article III courts. Prospective relief under

Syllabus
a continuing, executory decree remains subject to alteration due to
changes in the underlying law. Cf. Landgraf v. USI Film Products,
511 U. S. 244, 273. This conclusion follows from the Court's decision
in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 432
(Wheeling Bridge II), that prospective relief it issued in Pennsylvania
v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 13 How. 518 (Wheeling Bridge I),
became unenforceable after Congress altered the law underlying the
ongoing relief. Applied here, the Wheeling Bridge II principles demonstrate that $ 3626(e)(2)'s automatic stay does not unconstitutionally
suspend or reopen an Article III court's judgment. It does not tell
judges when, how, or what to do, but reflects the change implemented
by $ 3626(b), which establishes new standards for prospective relief.
As Plaut and Wheeling Bridge II instruct, when Congress changes the
law underlying the judgment awarding such relief, that relief is no
longer enforceable to the extent it is inconsistent with the new law.
Although the remedial injunction here is a final judgment for purposes
of appeal, it is not the last word of the judicial department, for it is
subject to the court's continuing supervisory jurisdiction, and therefore may be altered according to subsequent changes in the law. For
the same reasons, $ 3626(e)(2) does not violate the separation of powers
principle articulated in United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, where the
Court found unconstitutional a statute purporting to prescribe rules
of decision to the Federal Judiciary in cases pending before it. That

$ 3626(e)(2) does not itself amend the legal standard does not help respondents; when read in the context of $ 3626 as a whole, the provision
does not prescribe a rule of decision but imposes the consequences of
the court's application of the new legal standard. Finally, Congress'
imposition of the time limit in $ 3626(e)(2) does not offend the structural
concerns underlying the separation of powers. Whether that time is
so short that it deprives litigants of an opportunity to be heard is a
due process question not before this Court. Nor does the Court have
occasion to decide here whether there could be a time constraint on
judicial action that was so severe that it implicated structural separation
of powers concerns. Pp. 341-350.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) es-tablishes standards for the entry and termination of prospective relief in civil actions challenging prison conditions.$$ 801-810, 110 Stat. 1321-66 to 1321-77. If prospective
relief under an existing injunction does not satisfy thesestandards, a defendant or intervenor is entitled to "immediate termination" of that relief. 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(b)(2)(1994 ed., Supp. IV). And under the PLRA's "automatic
stay" provision, a motion to terminate prospective relief"shall operate as a stay" of that relief during the period
beginning 30 days after the filing of the motion (extendableto up to 90 days for "good cause") and ending when the court
rules on the motion. $$ 3626(e)(2), (3). The superintendentof Indiana's Pendleton Correctional Facility, which is currently operating under an ongoing injunction to remedy vio-lations of the Eighth Amendment regarding conditions of
confinement, filed a motion to terminate prospective reliefunder the PLRA. Respondent prisoners moved to enjoin
the operation of the automatic stay provision of $ 3626(e)(2),arguing that it is unconstitutional. The District Court enjoined the stay, and the Court of Appeals for the SeventhCircuit affirmed. We must decide whether a district court
may enjoin the operation of the PLRA's automatic stay pro-vision and, if not, whether that provision violates separation
of powers principles. I

action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, on behalf
of all persons who were, or would be, confined at the facility
against the predecessors in office of petitioners (hereinafter
State). 1 Record, Doc. No. 1, p. 2. After a trial, the District Court found that living conditions at the prison violated
both state and federal law, including the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,
and the court issued an injunction to correct those violations. French v. Owens, 538 F. Supp. 910 (SD Ind. 1982),
aff 'd in part, vacated and remanded in part, 777 F. 2d 1250
(CA7 1985). While the State's appeal was pending, this
Court decided Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89 (1984), which held that the Eleventh
Amendment deprives federal courts of jurisdiction over
claims for injunctive relief against state officials based on
state law. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit remanded the action to the District Court for
reconsideration. 777 F. 2d, at 1251. On remand, the District Court concluded that most of the state law violations
also ran afoul of the Eighth Amendment, and it issued an
amended remedial order to address those constitutional violations. The order also accounted for improvements in living conditions at the Pendleton facility that had occurred in
the interim. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the amended remedial
order as to those aspects governing overcrowding and double
celling, the use of mechanical restraints, staffing, and the
quality of food and medical services, but it vacated those
portions pertaining to exercise and recreation, protective
custody, and fire and occupational safety standards. Id., at
1258. This ongoing injunctive relief has remained in effect
ever since, with the last modification occurring in October
1988, when the parties resolved by joint stipulation the remaining issues related to fire and occupational safety standards. 1 Record, Doc. No. 14.

Opinion of the Court

B
In 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA. As relevant here,the PLRA establishes standards for the entry and termination of prospective relief in civil actions challenging con-ditions at prison facilities. Specifically, a court "shall not
grant or approve any prospective relief unless the courtfinds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further
than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right,and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right." 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(1)(A) (1994ed., Supp. IV). The same criteria apply to existing injunctions, and a defendant or intervenor may move to terminateprospective relief that does not meet this standard. See

$ 3626(b)(2). In particular, $ 3626(b)(2) provides:

"In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, adefendant or intervener shall be entitled to the immediate termination of any prospective relief if the re-lief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding
by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extendsno further than necessary to correct the violation of the
Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessaryto correct the violation of the Federal right."

A court may not terminate prospective relief, however, ifit "makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current andongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federalright, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and
the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation."$ 3626(b)(3). The PLRA also requires courts to rule
"promptly" on motions to terminate prospective relief, withmandamus available to remedy a court's failure to do so.

$ 3626(e)(1).Finally, the provision at issue here, $ 3626(e)(2), dictates
that, in certain circumstances, prospective relief shall be

stayed pending resolution of a motion to terminate. Spe-cifically, subsection (e)(2), entitled "Automatic Stay," states:

"Any motion to modify or terminate prospective reliefmade under subsection (b) shall operate as a stay during
the period--"(A)(i) beginning on the 30th day after such motion is
filed, in the case of a motion made under paragraph (1)or (2) of subsection (b); . . .

"(ii) . . . and"(B) ending on the date the court enters a final order
ruling on the motion."
As one of several 1997 amendments to the PLRA, Congresspermitted courts to postpone the entry of the automatic stay

for not more than 60 days for "good cause," which cannotinclude general congestion of the court's docket. $ 123, 111

On June 5, 1997, the State filed a motion under $ 3626(b)to terminate the prospective relief governing the conditions of confinement at the Pendleton Correctional Facil-ity. 1 Record, Doc. No. 16. In response, the prisoner class
moved for a temporary restraining order or preliminary in-junction to enjoin the operation of the automatic stay, arguing that $ 3626(e)(2) is unconstitutional as both a violationof the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and separation of powers principles. The District Court granted

*As originally enacted, $ 3626(e)(2) provided that "[a]ny prospective relief subject to a pending motion [for termination] shall be automatically

the motion." $ 802, 110 Stat. 1321-68 to 1321-69. The 1997 amendments
to the PLRA revised the automatic stay provision to its current form,
and Congress specified that the 1997 amendments "shall apply to pending
cases." 18 U. S. C. $ 3626 note (1994 ed., Supp. IV).

the prisoners' motion, enjoining the automatic stay. See id.,Doc. No. 23; see also

French v. Duckworth, 178 F. 3d 437,
440-441 (CA7 1999). The State appealed, and the UnitedStates intervened pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(a) to defend

the constitutionality of $ 3626(e)(2).The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the
District Court's order, concluding that although $ 3626(e)(2)
precluded courts from exercising their equitable powers toenjoin operation of the automatic stay, the statute, so construed, was unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds.See 178 F. 3d, at 447-448. The court reasoned that Congress drafted $ 3626(e)(2) in unequivocal terms, clearly providing that a motion to terminate under $ 3626(b)(2) "shall
operate" as a stay during a specified time period. Id., at
443. While acknowledging that courts should not lightly assume that Congress meant to restrict the equitable powers
of the federal courts, the Court of Appeals found "it impossible to read this language as doing anything less than
that." Ibid. Turning to the constitutional question, the
court characterized $ 3626(e)(2) as "a self-executing legislative determination that a specific decree of a federal court . . .
must be set aside at least for a period of time." Id., at 446.
As such, it concluded that $ 3626(e)(2) directly suspends a
court order in violation of the separation of powers doctrine
under Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211 (1995),
and mandates a particular rule of decision, at least during
the pendency of the $ 3626(b)(2) termination motion, contrary to United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872). See 178
F. 3d, at 446. Having concluded that $ 3626(e)(2) is unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds, the Court of
Appeals did not reach the prisoners' due process claims.
Over the dissent of three judges, the court denied rehearing
en banc. See id., at 448-453 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting
from denial of rehearing en banc).

We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1045 (1999), to resolve
a conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether

Opinion of the Court

$ 3626(e)(2) permits federal courts, in the exercise of their
traditional equitable authority, to enjoin operation of the
PLRA's automatic stay provision and, if not, to review the
Court of Appeals' judgment that $ 3626(e)(2), so construed,
is unconstitutional. Compare Ruiz v. Johnson, 178 F. 3d 385
(CA5 1999) (holding that district courts retain the equitable
discretion to suspend the automatic stay and that $ 3626(e)(2)
is therefore constitutional); Hadix v. Johnson, 144 F. 3d
925 (CA6 1998) (same), with 178 F. 3d 437 (CA7 1999) (case
below).

II

We address the statutory question first. Both the State
and the prisoner class agree, as did the majority and dissenting judges below, that $ 3626(e)(2) precludes a district
court from exercising its equitable powers to enjoin the
automatic stay. The Government argues, however, that

$ 3626(e)(2) should be construed to leave intact the federal
courts' traditional equitable discretion to "stay the stay,"
invoking two canons of statutory construction. First, the
Government contends that we should not interpret a statute
as displacing courts' traditional equitable authority to preserve the status quo pending resolution on the merits "[a]bsent the clearest command to the contrary." Califano v.
Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 705 (1979). Second, the Government asserts that reading $ 3626(e)(2) to remove that equitable power would raise serious separation of powers questions, and therefore should be avoided under the canon of
constitutional doubt. Like the Court of Appeals, we do not
lightly assume that Congress meant to restrict the equitable
powers of the federal courts, and we agree that constitutionally doubtful constructions should be avoided where "fairly
possible." Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735,
762 (1988). But where Congress has made its intent clear,
"we must give effect to that intent." Sinclair Refining Co.
v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195, 215 (1962).

337Cite as: 530 U. S. 327 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
The text of $ 3626(e)(2) provides that "[a]ny motion to . . .terminate prospective relief made under subsection (b)

shall
operate as a stay" during a fixed period of time, i. e., from30 (or 90) days after the motion is filed until the court enters

a final order ruling on the motion. 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(e)(2)(1994 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added). The stay is "automatic" once a state defendant has filed a $ 3626(b) motion,
and the statutory command that such a motion "shall operateas a stay during the [specified time] period" indicates that

the stay is mandatory throughout that period of time. See
Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523
U. S. 26, 35 (1998) ("[T]he mandatory `shall' . . . normally
creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion").

Nonetheless, the Government contends that reading the
statute to preserve courts' traditional equitable powers to
enter appropriate injunctive relief is consistent with this
text because, in its view, $ 3626(e)(2) is simply a burdenshifting mechanism. That is, the purpose of the automatic
stay provision is merely to relieve defendants of the burden
of establishing the prerequisites for a stay and to eliminate courts' discretion to deny a stay, even if those prerequisites are established, based on the public interest or
hardship to the plaintiffs. Thus, under this reading, nothing
in $ 3626(e)(2) prevents courts from subsequently suspending
the automatic stay by applying the traditional standards for
injunctive relief.

Such an interpretation, however, would subvert the plain
meaning of the statute, making its mandatory language
merely permissive. Section 3626(e)(2) states that a motion
to terminate prospective relief "shall operate as a stay during" the specified time period from 30 (or 90) days after the
filing of the $ 3626(b) motion until the court rules on that
motion. (Emphasis added.) Thus, not only does the statute
employ the mandatory term "shall," but it also specifies the
points at which the operation of the stay is to begin and end.
In other words, contrary to Justice Breyer's suggestion

338 MILLER v. FRENCH

Opinion of the Court
that the language of $ 3626(e)(2) "says nothing . . . about thedistrict court's power to modify or suspend the operation of

the `stay,' " post, at 358 (dissenting opinion), $ 3626(e)(2) un-equivocally mandates that the stay "shall operate

during"
this specific interval. To allow courts to exercise their equi-table discretion to prevent the stay from "operating" during

this statutorily prescribed period would be to contradict

$ 3626(e)(2)'s plain terms. It would mean that the motion toterminate merely

may operate as a stay, despite the statute's
command that it "shall" have such effect. If Congress hadintended to accomplish nothing more than to relieve state

defendants of the burden of establishing the prerequisites
for a stay, the language of $ 3626(e)(2) is, at best, an awkward
and indirect means to achieve that result.

Viewing the automatic stay provision in the context of

$ 3626 as a whole further confirms that Congress intended
to prohibit federal courts from exercising their equitable
authority to suspend operation of the automatic stay. The
specific appeal provision contained in $ 3626(e) states that
"[a]ny order staying, suspending, delaying, or barring the
operation of the automatic stay" of $ 3626(e)(2) "shall be appealable" pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(a)(1). $ 3626(e)(4).
At first blush, this provision might be read as supporting the
view that Congress expressly recognized the possibility that
a district court could exercise its equitable discretion to enjoin the stay. The two Courts of Appeals that have construed $ 3626(e)(2) as preserving the federal courts' equitable
powers have reached that conclusion based on this reading of

$ 3626(e)(4). See Ruiz v. Johnson, 178 F. 3d, at 394; Hadix v.
Johnson, 144 F. 3d, at 938. They reasoned that Congress
would not have provided for expedited review of such orders
had it not intended that district courts would retain the
power to enter the orders in the first place. See ibid. In
other words, "Congress understood that there would be some
cases in which a conscientious district court acting in good
faith would perceive that equity required that it suspend"

Opinion of the Court
the $ 3626(e)(2) stay, and "Congress therefore permitted thedistrict court to do so, subject to appellate review."

Ruiz v.
Johnson, supra, at 394.The critical flaw in this construction, however, is that

$ 3626(e)(4) only provides for an appeal from an order preventing the operation of the automatic stay. $ 3626(e)(4)
("Any order staying, suspending, delaying, or barring the
operation of the automatic stay" under $ 3626(e)(2) "shall beappealable"). If the rationale for the provision were that in

some situations equity demands that the automatic stay besuspended, then presumably the

denial of a motion to enjoin
the stay should also be appealable. The one-way nature of
the appeal provision only makes sense if the automatic stay
is required to operate during a specific time period, such that
any attempt by a district court to circumvent the mandatory
stay is immediately reviewable.

The Government contends that if Congress' goal were to
prevent courts from circumventing the PLRA's plain commands, mandamus would have been a more appropriate remedy than appellate review. But that proposition is doubtful,
as mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is "granted
only in the exercise of sound discretion." Whitehouse v.
Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 373 (1955). Given that
curbing the equitable discretion of district courts was one of
the PLRA's principal objectives, it would have been odd for
Congress to have left enforcement of $ 3626(e)(2) to that very
same discretion. Instead, Congress sensibly chose to make
available an immediate appeal to resolve situations in which
courts mistakenly believe--under the novel scheme created
by the PLRA--that they have the authority to enjoin the
automatic stay, rather than the extraordinary remedy of
mandamus, which requires a showing of a "clear and indisputable" right to the issuance of the writ. See Mallard v.
United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490
U. S. 296, 309 (1989). In any event, $ 3626(e) as originally
enacted did not provide for interlocutory review. It was

530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG
340 MILLER v. FRENCH

Opinion of the Court
only after some courts refused to enter the automatic stay,and after the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit would

not review such a refusal, that Congress amended $ 3626(e)to provide for interlocutory review. See

In re Scott, 163
F. 3d 282, 284 (CA5 1998); Ruiz v. Johnson, supra, at 388;see also 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(e)(4) (1994 ed., Supp. IV).

Finally, the Government finds support for its view in

$ 3626(e)(3). That provision authorizes an extension, for"good cause," of the starting point for the automatic stay,

from 30 days after the $ 3626(b) motion is filed until 90 daysafter that motion is filed. The Government explains that,
by allowing the court to prevent the entry of the stay for
up to 60 days under the relatively generous "good cause"
standard, Congress by negative implication has preserved
courts' discretion to suspend the stay after that time under
the more stringent standard for injunctive relief. To be
sure, allowing a delay in entry of the stay for 60 days based
on a good cause standard does not by itself necessarily imply
that any other reason for preventing the operation of the
stay--for example, on the basis of traditional equitable principles--is precluded. But $ 3626(e)(3) cannot be read in isolation. When $$ 3626(e)(2) and (3) are read together, it is
clear that the district court cannot enjoin the operation of
the automatic stay. The $ 3626(b) motion "shall operate as a
stay during" a specific time period. Section 3626(e)(3) only
adjusts the starting point for the stay, and it merely permits
that starting point to be delayed. Once the 90-day period
has passed, the $ 3626(b) motion "shall operate as a stay"
until the court rules on the $ 3626(b) motion. During that
time, any attempt to enjoin the stay is irreconcilable with
the plain language of the statute.

Thus, although we should not construe a statute to displace courts' traditional equitable authority absent the
"clearest command," Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S., at
705, or an "inescapable inference" to the contrary, Porter
v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946), we are con530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
vinced that Congress' intent to remove such discretion isunmistakable in $ 3626(e)(2). And while this construction

raises constitutional questions, the canon of constitutionaldoubt permits us to avoid such questions only where the
saving construction is not "plainly contrary to the intent ofCongress." Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf
Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575(1988). "We cannot press statutory construction `to the
point of disingenuous evasion' even to avoid a constitutionalquestion."

United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 96 (1985)(quoting George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U. S. 373,

379 (1933)); see also Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v.Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (constitutional doubt canon
does not apply where the statute is unambiguous); Commod-ity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 841
(1986) (constitutional doubt canon "does not give a court theprerogative to ignore the legislative will"). Like the Court
of Appeals, we find that $ 3626(e)(2) is unambiguous, and ac-cordingly, we cannot adopt

Justice Breyer's "more flexibleinterpretation" of the statute. Post, at 355. Any construction that preserved courts' equitable discretion to enjoin theautomatic stay would effectively convert the PLRA's mandatory stay into a discretionary one. Because this would beplainly contrary to Congress' intent in enacting the stay provision, we must confront the constitutional issue.

III
The Constitution enumerates and separates the powersof the three branches of Government in Articles I, II, and

III, and it is this "very structure" of the Constitution thatexemplifies the concept of separation of powers.

INS v.Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983). While the boundaries

between the three branches are not " `hermetically' sealed,"see id., at 951, the Constitution prohibits one branch from
encroaching on the central prerogatives of another, see Loving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 757 (1996); Buckley v.

530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG
342 MILLER v. FRENCH

Opinion of the Court
Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 121-122 (1976) (per curiam). The powersof the Judicial Branch are set forth in Article III, $ 1, which

states that the "judicial Power of the United States, shall bevested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as
the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,"and provides that these federal courts shall be staffed by
judges who hold office during good behavior, and whose compensation shall not be diminished during tenure in office.As we explained in

Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514
U. S., at 218-219, Article III "gives the Federal Judiciary thepower, not merely to rule on cases, but to

decide them, subject to review only by superior courts in the Article III
hierarchy."

Respondent prisoners contend that $ 3626(e)(2) encroaches
on the central prerogatives of the Judiciary and thereby violates the separation of powers doctrine. It does this, the
prisoners assert, by legislatively suspending a final judgment of an Article III court in violation of Plaut and Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792). According to the prisoners,
the remedial order governing living conditions at the Pendleton Correctional Facility is a final judgment of an Article III
court, and $ 3626(e)(2) constitutes an impermissible usurpation of judicial power because it commands the district court
to suspend prospective relief under that order, albeit temporarily. An analysis of the principles underlying Hayburn's
Case and Plaut, as well as an examination of $ 3626(e)(2)'s
interaction with the other provisions of $ 3626, makes clear
that $ 3626(e)(2) does not offend these separation of powers
principles.

Hayburn's Case arose out of a 1792 statute that authorized
pensions for veterans of the Revolutionary War. See Act of
Mar. 23, 1792, ch. 11, 1 Stat. 243. The statute provided that
the circuit courts were to review the applications and determine the appropriate amount of the pension, but that the
Secretary of War had the discretion either to adopt or reject
the courts' findings. Hayburn's Case, supra, at 408-410.

Opinion of the Court
Although this Court did not reach the constitutional issue in
Hayburn's Case, the statements of five Justices, acting as
circuit judges, were reported, and we have since recognizedthat the case "stands for the principle that Congress cannot

vest review of the decisions of Article III courts in officialsof the Executive Branch."

Plaut, supra, at 218; see also
Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 677, n. 15 (1988). As we
recognized in Plaut, such an effort by a coequal branch to"annul a final judgment" is " `an assumption of Judicial

power' and therefore forbidden." 514 U. S., at 224 (quoting
Bates v. Kimball, 2 Chipman 77 (Vt. 1824)).

Unlike the situation in Hayburn's Case, $ 3626(e)(2) does
not involve the direct review of a judicial decision by officials
of the Legislative or Executive Branches. Nonetheless, the
prisoners suggest that $ 3626(e)(2) falls within Hayburn's
prohibition against an indirect legislative "suspension" or reopening of a final judgment, such as that addressed in Plaut.
See Plaut, supra, at 226 (quoting Hayburn's Case, supra, at
413 (letter of Iredell, J., and Sitgreaves, D. J.) (" `[N]o decision of any court of the United States can, under any
circumstances, . . . be liable to a revision, or even suspension,
by the [l]egislature itself, in whom no judicial power of any
kind appears to be vested' ")). In Plaut, we held that a federal statute that required federal courts to reopen final judgments that had been entered before the statute's enactment
was unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds. 514
U. S., at 211. The plaintiffs had brought a civil securities
fraud action seeking money damages. Id., at 213. While
that action was pending, we ruled in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,
Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), that
such suits must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within
three years after such violation. In light of this intervening
decision, the Plaut plaintiffs' suit was untimely, and the District Court accordingly dismissed the action as time barred.
Plaut, supra, at 214. After the judgment dismissing the

530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG
344 MILLER v. FRENCH

Opinion of the Court
case had become final, Congress enacted a statute provid-ing for the reinstatement of those actions, including the

Plaut plaintiffs', that had been dismissed under Lampf butthat would have been timely under the previously applicable
statute of limitations. 514 U. S., at 215.We concluded that this retroactive command that federal
courts reopen final judgments exceeded Congress' authority.
Id., at 218-219. The decision of an inferior court within theArticle III hierarchy is not the final word of the department

(unless the time for appeal has expired), and "[i]t is the obli-gation of the last court in the hierarchy that rules on the
case to give effect to Congress's latest enactment, even
when that has the effect of overturning the judgment of an
inferior court, since each court, at every level, must `decide
according to existing laws.' " Id., at 227 (quoting United
States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 109 (1801)). But
once a judicial decision achieves finality, it "becomes the last
word of the judicial department." 514 U. S., at 227. And
because Article III "gives the Federal Judiciary the power,
not merely to rule on cases, but to decide them, subject to
review only by superior courts in the Article III hierarchy,"
id., at 218-219, the "judicial Power is one to render dispositive judgments," and Congress cannot retroactively command Article III courts to reopen final judgments, id., at 219
(quoting Easterbrook, Presidential Review, 40 Case W. Res.
L. Rev. 905, 926 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Plaut, however, was careful to distinguish the situation
before the Court in that case--legislation that attempted to
reopen the dismissal of a suit seeking money damages--from
legislation that "altered the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts." 514 U. S., at 232. We
emphasized that "nothing in our holding today calls . . . into
question" Congress' authority to alter the prospective effect
of previously entered injunctions. Ibid. Prospective relief under a continuing, executory decree remains subject to
alteration due to changes in the underlying law. Cf. Land530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
graf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 273 (1994) ("Whenthe intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety

of prospective relief, application of the new provision is notretroactive"). This conclusion follows from our decisions in
Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 13 How.518 (1852)

(Wheeling Bridge I), and Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421 (1856) (Wheeling
Bridge II).In

Wheeling Bridge I, we held that a bridge across the
Ohio River, because it was too low, unlawfully "obstruct[ed]the navigation of the Ohio," and ordered that the bridge be

raised or permanently removed. 13 How., at 578. Shortly
thereafter, Congress enacted legislation declaring the bridge
to be a "lawful structur[e]," establishing the bridge as a
" `post-roa[d] for the passage of the mails of the United
States,' " and declaring that the Wheeling and Belmont
Bridge Company was authorized to maintain the bridge at
its then-current site and elevation. Wheeling Bridge II,
supra, at 429. After the bridge was destroyed in a storm,
Pennsylvania sued to enjoin the bridge's reconstruction,
arguing that the statute legalizing the bridge was unconstitutional because it effectively annulled the Court's decision in Wheeling Bridge I. We rejected that argument, concluding that the decree in Wheeling Bridge I provided for
ongoing relief by "directing the abatement of the obstruction" which enjoined the defendants' from any continuance
or reconstruction of the obstruction. Because the intervening statute altered the underlying law such that the
bridge was no longer an unlawful obstruction, we held that it
was "quite plain the decree of the court cannot be enforced."
Wheeling Bridge II, supra, at 431-432. The Court explained that had Wheeling Bridge I awarded money damages
in an action at law, then that judgment would be final, and
Congress' later action could not have affected plaintiff 's right
to those damages. See 18 How., at 431. But because the
decree entered in Wheeling Bridge I provided for prospec530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG
346 MILLER v. FRENCH

Opinion of the Court
tive relief--a continuing injunction against the continuationor reconstruction of the bridge--the ongoing validity of the

injunctive relief depended on "whether or not [the bridge]interferes with the right of navigation." 18 How., at 431.
When Congress altered the underlying law such that thebridge was no longer an unlawful obstruction, the injunction
against the maintenance of the bridge was not enforceable.
See id., at 432.Applied here, the principles of

Wheeling Bridge II demonstrate that the automatic stay of $ 3626(e)(2) does not un-constitutionally "suspend" or reopen a judgment of an Article III court. Section 3626(e)(2) does not by itself "tell
judges when, how, or what to do." 178 F. 3d, at 449 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Instead, $ 3626(e)(2) merely reflects the change implemented
by $ 3626(b), which does the "heavy lifting" in the statutory
scheme by establishing new standards for prospective relief.
See Berwanger v. Cottey, 178 F. 3d 834, 839 (CA7 1999).
Section 3626 prohibits the continuation of prospective relief
that was "approved or granted in the absence of a finding by
the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal
right, and is the least intrusive means to correct the violation," $ 3626(b)(2), or in the absence of "findings based on the
record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct
a current and ongoing violation of a Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation
of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is
narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct
the violation," $ 3626(b)(3). Accordingly, if prospective relief under an existing decree had been granted or approved
absent such findings, then that prospective relief must cease,
see $ 3626(b)(2), unless and until the court makes findings on
the record that such relief remains necessary to correct an
ongoing violation and is narrowly tailored, see $ 3626(b)(3).
The PLRA's automatic stay provision assists in the enforce530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
ment of $$ 3626(b)(2) and (3) by requiring the court to stayany prospective relief that, due to the change in the underlying standard, is no longer enforceable, i. e., prospective reliefthat is not supported by the findings specified in $$ 3626(b)(2)
and (3).By establishing new standards for the enforcement of prospective relief in $ 3626(b), Congress has altered the relevant
underlying law. The PLRA has restricted courts' authorityto issue and enforce prospective relief concerning prison conditions, requiring that such relief be supported by findingsand precisely tailored to what is needed to remedy the violation of a federal right. See Benjamin v. Jacobson, 172 F. 3d
144, 163 (CA2 1999) (en banc); Imprisoned Citizens Union v.
Ridge, 169 F. 3d 178, 184-185 (CA3 1999); Tyler v. Murphy,
135 F. 3d 594, 597 (CA8 1998); Inmates of Suffolk County
Jail v. Rouse, 129 F. 3d 649, 657 (CA1 1997). We note that
the constitutionality of $ 3626(b) is not challenged here; we
assume, without deciding, that the new standards it pronounces are effective. As Plaut and Wheeling Bridge II
instruct, when Congress changes the law underlying a judgment awarding prospective relief, that relief is no longer enforceable to the extent it is inconsistent with the new law.
Although the remedial injunction here is a "final judgment"
for purposes of appeal, it is not the "last word of the judicial
department." Plaut, 514 U. S., at 227. The provision of
prospective relief is subject to the continuing supervisory
jurisdiction of the court, and therefore may be altered
according to subsequent changes in the law. See Rufo v.
Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 388 (1992).
Prospective relief must be "modified if, as it later turns out,
one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has
become impermissible under federal law." Ibid.; see also
Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 646-647 (1961)
(a court has the authority to alter the prospective effect of
an injunction to reflect a change in circumstances, whether
of law or fact, that has occurred since the injunction was

entered); Lauf v. E. G. Shinner & Co., 303 U. S. 323, 329
(1938) (applying the Norris-LaGuardia Act's prohibition on
a district court's entry of injunctive relief in the absence of
findings).

The entry of the automatic stay under $ 3626(e)(2) helps
to implement the change in the law caused by $$ 3626(b)(2)
and (3). If the prospective relief under the existing decree
is not supported by the findings required under $ 3626(b)(2),
and the court has not made the findings required by

$ 3626(b)(3), then prospective relief is no longer enforceable
and must be stayed. The entry of the stay does not reopen
or "suspend" the previous judgment, nor does it divest the
court of authority to decide the merits of the termination
motion. Rather, the stay merely reflects the changed legal
circumstances--that prospective relief under the existing
decree is no longer enforceable, and remains unenforceable
unless and until the court makes the findings required by

$ 3626(b)(3).

For the same reasons, $ 3626(e)(2) does not violate the
separation of powers principle articulated in United States
v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872). In that case, Klein, the executor of the estate of a Confederate sympathizer, sought to
recover the value of property seized by the United States
during the Civil War, which by statute was recoverable if
Klein could demonstrate that the decedent had not given
aid or comfort to the rebellion. See id., at 131. In United
States v. Padelford, 9 Wall. 531, 542-543 (1870), we held that
a Presidential pardon satisfied the burden of proving that no
such aid or comfort had been given. While Klein's case was
pending, Congress enacted a statute providing that a pardon
would instead be taken as proof that the pardoned individual
had in fact aided the enemy, and if the claimant offered proof
of a pardon the court must dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. Klein, 13 Wall., at 133-134. We concluded that the
statute was unconstitutional because it purported to "pre530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
scribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department of thegovernment in cases pending before it."

Id., at 146.
Here, the prisoners argue that Congress has similarly pre-scribed a rule of decision because, for the period of time

until the district court makes a final decision on the meritsof the motion to terminate prospective relief, $ 3626(e)(2)
mandates a particular outcome: the termination of prospective relief. As we noted in Plaut, however, "[w]hateverthe precise scope of

Klein, . . . later decisions have made
clear that its prohibition does not take hold when Con-gress `amend[s] applicable law.' " 514 U. S., at 218 (quoting

Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc., 503 U. S. 429, 441 (1992)).
The prisoners concede this point but contend that, because

$ 3626(e)(2) does not itself amend the legal standard, Klein is
still applicable. As we have explained, however, $ 3626(e)(2)
must be read not in isolation, but in the context of $ 3626 as
a whole. Section 3626(e)(2) operates in conjunction with the
new standards for the continuation of prospective relief; if
the new standards of $ 3626(b)(2) are not met, then the stay
"shall operate" unless and until the court makes the findings
required by $ 3626(b)(3). Rather than prescribing a rule of
decision, $ 3626(e)(2) simply imposes the consequences of the
court's application of the new legal standard.

Finally, the prisoners assert that, even if $ 3626(e)(2) does
not fall within the recognized prohibitions of Hayburn's
Case, Plaut, or Klein, it still offends the principles of separation of powers because it places a deadline on judicial decisionmaking, thereby interfering with core judicial functions.
Congress' imposition of a time limit in $ 3626(e)(2), however, does not in itself offend the structural concerns underlying the Constitution's separation of powers. For example,
if the PLRA granted courts 10 years to determine whether
they could make the required findings, then certainly the
PLRA would raise no apprehensions that Congress had
encroached on the core function of the Judiciary to decide
"cases and controversies properly before them." United

350 MILLER v. FRENCH

Opinion of Souter, J.
States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 20 (1960). Respondents' con-cern with the time limit, then, must be its relative brevity.

But whether the time is so short that it deprives litigantsof a meaningful opportunity to be heard is a due process
question, an issue that is not before us. We leave open,therefore, the question whether this time limit, particularly
in a complex case, may implicate due process concerns.

In contrast to due process, which principally serves to pro-tect the personal rights of litigants to a full and fair hearing,

separation of powers principles are primarily addressed tothe structural concerns of protecting the role of the independent Judiciary within the constitutional design. In thisaction, we have no occasion to decide whether there could be
a time constraint on judicial action that was so severe that
it implicated these structural separation of powers concerns.
The PLRA does not deprive courts of their adjudicatory
role, but merely provides a new legal standard for relief and
encourages courts to apply that standard promptly.

Through the PLRA, Congress clearly intended to make
operation of the automatic stay mandatory, precluding courts
from exercising their equitable powers to enjoin the stay.
And we conclude that this provision does not violate separation of powers principles. Accordingly, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and
the action is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

I agree that 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) is
unambiguous and join Parts I and II of the majority opinion.
I also agree that applying the automatic stay may raise the
due process issue, of whether a plaintiff has a fair chance to
preserve an existing judgment that was valid when entered.

also raise a serious separation-of-powers issue if the timeit allows turns out to be inadequate for a court to determine whether the new prerequisite to relief is satisfied in aparticular case.

1 I thus do not join Part III of the Court's

opinion and on remand would require proceedings consistentwith this one. I respectfully dissent from the terms of the

Court's disposition.

A prospective remedial order may rest on at least threedifferent legal premises: the underlying right meant to be

secured; the rules of procedure for obtaining relief, de-fining requisites of pleading, notice, and so on; and, in some
cases, rules lying between the other two, such as those de-fining a required level of certainty before some remedy may
be ordered, or the permissible scope of relief. At issue hereare rules of the last variety.

Congress has the authority to change rules of this sortby imposing new conditions precedent for the continuing

enforcement of existing, prospective remedial orders and
requiring courts to apply the new rules to those orders.
Cf. Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 232 (1995).
If its legislation gives courts adequate time to determine
the applicability of a new rule to an old order and to take
the action necessary to apply it or to vacate the order, there
seems little basis for claiming that Congress has crossed

1 The Court forecloses the possibility of a separation-of-powers challenge
based on insufficient time under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995
(PLRA): "In this action, we have no occasion to decide whether there
could be a time constraint on judicial action that was so severe that it
implicated these structural separation of powers concerns. The PLRA
does not deprive courts of their adjudicatory role, but merely provides a
new legal standard for relief and encourages courts to apply that standard
promptly." Ante, at 350.

2 Other provisions of the PLRA narrow the scope of the underlying entitlements that an order can protect, but some orders may have been
issued to secure constitutional rights unaffected by the PLRA. In any
event, my concern here is solely with the PLRA's changes to the requisites
for relief.

the constitutional line to interfere with the performance ofany judicial function. But if determining whether a new

rule applies requires time (say, for new factfinding) and ifthe statute provides insufficient time for a court to make
that determination before the statute invalidates an extantremedial order, the application of the statute raises a serious
question whether Congress has in practical terms assumedthe judicial function. In such a case, the prospective order
suddenly turns unenforceable not because a court has madea judgment to terminate it due to changed law or fact, but
because no one can tell in the time allowed whether the newrule requires modification of the old order. One way to view
this result is to see the Congress as mandating modificationof an order that may turn out to be perfectly enforceable
under the new rule, depending on judicial factfinding. If thefacts are taken this way, the new statute might well be
treated as usurping the judicial function of determiningthe applicability of a general rule in particular factual circumstances.3 Cf. United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 146(1872).

Whether this constitutional issue arises on the facts ofthis action, however, is something we cannot yet tell, for the

3 The constitutional question inherent in these possible circumstances
does not seem to be squarely addressed by any of our cases. Congress
did not engage in discretionary review of a particular judicial judgment,
cf. Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 218, 226 (1995) (characterizing Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792)), or try to modify a final, nonprospective judgment, cf. 514 U. S., at 218-219. Nor would a stay result
from the judicial application of a change in the underlying law, cf. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 431 (1856);
Plaut, supra, at 218 (characterizing United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128
(1872)). Instead, if the time is insufficient for a court to make a judicial
determination about the applicability of the new rules, the stay would
result from the inability of the Judicial Branch to exercise the judicial
power of determining whether the new rules applied at all. Cf. Marbury
v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and
duty of the judicial department to say what the law is").

District Court did not address the sufficiency of the timeprovided by the statute to make the findings required by

$ 3626(b)(3) in this particular action.4 Absent that determi-nation, I would not decide the separation-of-powers question,
but simply remand for further proceedings. If the DistrictCourt determined both that it lacked adequate time to make
the requisite findings in the period before the automatic staywould become effective, and that applying the stay would
violate the separation of powers, the question would then beproperly presented.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) saysthat "any party or intervener" may move to terminate any
"prospective relief " previously granted by the court, 18U. S. C. $ 3626(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV), and that the court
shall terminate (or modify) that relief unless it is "neces-sary to correct a current and ongoing violation of [a] Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct theviolation . . . [and is] the least intrusive means" to do so.
18 U. S. C. $ 3626(b)(3).We here consider a related procedural provision of the
PLRA. It says that "[a]ny motion to modify or terminateprospective relief . . . shall operate as a stay" of that prospective relief "during the period" beginning (no later than)the 90th day after the filing of the motion and ending when
the motion is decided. $ 3626(e)(2). This provision means

be . . . that in some cases the courts will not be able to carry out their
adjudicative function in a responsible way within the time limits imposed
by (e)(2)," French v. Duckworth, 178 F. 3d 437, 447 (CA7 1999), without
deciding whether this action presented such a situation. The court then
concluded that "under Klein [the Congress] cannot take away the power
of the court in a particular case to preserve the status quo while it ponders
these weighty questions." Ibid.

approximately the following: Suppose that a district court,
in 1980, had entered an injunction governing present and
future prison conditions. Suppose further that in 1996 a
party filed a motion under the PLRA asking the court to
terminate (or to modify) the 1980 injunction. That district
court would have no more than 90 days to decide whether to
grant the motion. After those 90 days, the 1980 injunction
would terminate automatically--regaining life only if, when,
and to the extent that the judge eventually decided to deny
the PLRA motion.

The majority interprets the words "shall operate as a
stay" to mean, in terms of my example, that the 1980 injunction must become ineffective after the 90th day, no matter
what. The Solicitor General, however, believes that the
view adopted by the majority interpretation is too rigid
and calls into doubt the constitutionality of the provision.
He argues that the statute is silent as to whether the district court can modify or suspend the operation of the automatic stay. He would find in that silence sufficient authority
for the court to create an exception to the 90-day time limit
where circumstances make it necessary to do so. As so
read, the statute would neither displace the courts' traditional equitable authority nor raise significant constitutional
difficulties. See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 705
(1979) (only "clearest" congressional "command" displaces
courts' traditional equity powers); Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades
Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) (the Court will construe a
statute to avoid constitutional problems "unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress").

I agree with the Solicitor General and believe we should
adopt that " `reasonable construction' " of the statute. Ibid.
(quoting Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895), stating " `every reasonable construction must be resorted to,
in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality' ").

At the outset, one must understand why a more flexibleinterpretation of the statute might be needed. To do so, one

must keep in mind the extreme circumstances that at leastsome prison litigation originally sought to correct, the complexity of the resulting judicial decrees, and the potentialdifficulties arising out of the subsequent need to review those
decrees in order to make certain they follow Congress'PLRA directives. A hypothetical example based on actual
circumstances may help.In January 1979, a Federal District Court made 81 factual findings describing extremely poor--indeed "barbaricand shocking"--prison conditions in the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico. Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo, 497F. Supp. 14, 32 (PR 1979). These conditions included prisons
typically operating with twice the number of prisoners theywere designed to hold; inmates living in 16 square feet of
space (i. e., only 4 feet by 4 feet); inmates without medicalcare, without psychiatric care, without beds, without mattresses, without hot water, without soap or towels or tooth-brushes or underwear; food prepared on a budget of $1.50
per day and "tons of food . . . destroyed because of . . . rats,vermin, worms, and spoilage"; "no working toilets or showers," "urinals [that] flush into the sinks," "plumbing sys-tems . . . in a state of collapse," and a "stench" that was
"omnipresent"; "exposed wiring . . . no fire extinguisher, . . .
[and] poor ventilation"; "calabozos," or dungeons, "like cageswith bars on the top" or with two slits in a steel door opening

onto a central corridor, the floors of which were "coveredwith raw sewage" and which contained prisoners with severe
mental illnesses, "caged like wild animals," sometimes formonths; areas of a prison where mentally ill inmates were
"kept in cells naked, without beds, without mattresses, with-out any private possessions, and most of them without toilets
that work and without drinking water." Id., at 20-23, 26-

530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG
356 MILLER v. FRENCH

Breyer, J., dissenting
27, 29, 32. These conditions had led to epidemics of com-municable diseases, untreated mental illness, suicides, and

murders. Id., at 32.The District Court held that these conditions amounted
to constitutionally forbidden "cruel and unusual punish-ment."

Id., at 33-36. It entered 30 specific orders designed to produce constitutionally mandated improvement
by requiring the prison system to, for example, screen foodhandlers for communicable diseases, close the "calabozos,"

move mentally ill patients to hospitals, fix broken plumbing,and provide at least 35 square feet (

i. e., 5 feet by 7 feet) of
living space to each prisoner. Id., at 39-41.

The very pervasiveness and seriousness of the conditions described in the court's opinion made those conditions
difficult to cure quickly. Over the next decade, the District
Court entered further orders embodied in 15 published
opinions, affecting 21 prison institutions. These orders concerned, inter alia, overcrowding, security, disciplinary proceedings, prisoner classification, rehabilitation, parole, and
drug addiction treatment. Not surprisingly, the related
proceedings involved extensive evidence and argument consuming thousands of pages of transcript. See Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo, 672 F. Supp. 591, 595 (PR 1986).
Their implementation involved the services of two monitors,
two assistants, and a Special Master. Along the way, the
court documented a degree of "administrative chaos" in the
prison system, Morales Feliciano v. Hernandez Colon, 697
F. Supp. 37, 44 (PR 1988), and entered findings of contempt
of court against the Commonwealth, followed by the assessment and collection of more than $74 million in fines. See
Morales Feliciano v. Hernandez Colon, 775 F. Supp. 487,
488, and n. 2 (PR 1991).

Prison conditions subsequently have improved in some respects. Morales Feliciano v. Rossello Gonzalez, 13 F. Supp.
2d 151, 179 (PR 1998). I express no opinion as to whether,
or which of, the earlier orders are still needed. But my

Breyer, J., dissenting
brief summary of the litigation should illustrate the potentialdifficulties involved in making the determination of continuing necessity required by the PLRA. Where prison liti-gation is as complex as the litigation I have just described,
it may prove difficult for a district court to reach a fairand accurate decision about which orders remain necessary,
and are the "least intrusive means" available, to prevent
or correct a continuing violation of federal law. The orders,which were needed to resolve serious constitutional problems and may still be needed where compliance has not yetbeen assured, are complex, interrelated, and applicable to
many different institutions. Ninety days might not provide
sufficient time to ascertain the views of several different
parties, including monitors, to allow them to present evidence, and to permit each to respond to the arguments and
evidence of the others.

It is at least possible, then, that the statute, as the majority reads it, would sometimes terminate a complex system of orders entered over a period of years by a court
familiar with the local problem--perhaps only to reinstate
those orders later, when the termination motion can be
decided. Such an automatic termination could leave constitutionally prohibited conditions unremedied, at least temporarily. Alternatively, the threat of termination could lead
a district court to abbreviate proceedings that fairness would
otherwise demand. At a minimum, the mandatory automatic stay would provide a recipe for uncertainty, as complex judicial orders that have long governed the administration of particular prison systems suddenly turn off, then
(perhaps selectively) back on. So read, the statute directly
interferes with a court's exercise of its traditional equitable authority, rendering temporarily ineffective pre-existing
remedies aimed at correcting past, and perhaps ongoing,
violations of the Constitution. That interpretation, as the
majority itself concedes, might give rise to serious constitutional problems. Ante, at 350.

II
The Solicitor General's more flexible reading of the statuteavoids all these problems. He notes that the relevant language says that the motion to modify or terminate pro-spective relief "shall operate as a stay" after a period of
30 days, extendable for "good cause" to 90 days. 18 U. S. C.$ 3626(e)(2); see also Brief for United States 12. The language says nothing, however, about the district court'spower to modify or suspend the operation of the "stay." In
the Solicitor General's view, the "stay" would determine thelegal status quo; but the district court would retain its traditional equitable power to change that status quo once theparty seeking the modification or suspension of the operation
of the stay demonstrates that the stay "would cause irrepa-rable injury, that the termination motion is likely to be defeated, and that the merits of the motion cannot be resolvedbefore the automatic stay takes effect." Ibid. Where this
is shown, the "court has discretion to suspend the automaticstay and require prison officials to comply with outstanding
court orders until the court resolves the termination motionon the merits," id., at 12-13, subject to immediate appellate
review, 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(e)(4).Is this interpretation a "reasonable construction" of the
statute? Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., 485 U. S., at 575.I note first that the statutory language is open to the Solicitor General's interpretation. A district court ordinarilycan stay the operation of a judicial order (such as a stay or
injunction), see Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316U. S. 4, 9-10, and n. 4 (1942), when a party demonstrates the
need to do so in accordance with traditional equitable criteria(irreparable injury, likelihood of success on the merits, and a
balancing of possible harms to the parties and the public, see
Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931 (1975); Yakus v.United States, 321 U. S. 414, 440 (1944)). There is no logical

inconsistency in saying both (1) a motion (to terminate)"shall operate as a stay," and (2) the court retains the power

359Cite as: 530 U. S. 327 (2000)
Breyer, J., dissenting
to modify or delay the operation of the stay in appropriate
circumstances. The statutory language says nothing about
this last-mentioned power. It is silent. It does not direct
the district court to leave the stay in place come what may.

Nor does this more flexible interpretation deprive the procedural provision of meaning. The filing of the motion to
terminate prospective relief will still, after a certain period,
operate as a stay without further action by the court. Thus,
the motion automatically changes the status quo and imposes
upon the party wishing to suspend the automatic stay the
burden of demonstrating strong, special reasons for doing so.
The word "automatic" in the various subsection titles does
not prove the contrary, for that word often means selfstarting, not unstoppable. See Websters Third New International Dictionary 148 (1993). Indeed, the Bankruptcy Act
uses the words "automatic stay" to describe a provision
stating that "a petition filed . . . operates as a stay" of certain
other judicial proceedings--despite the fact that a later portion of that same provision makes clear that under certain
circumstances the bankruptcy court may terminate, annul,
or modify the stay. 11 U. S. C. $ 362(d); see also 143 Cong.
Rec. S12269 (Nov. 9, 1997) (statement of Sen. Abraham)
(explaining that $ 3626(e)(2) was modeled after the Bankruptcy Act provision). And the Poultry Producers Financial Protection Act of 1987 specifies that a court of appeals
decree affirming an order of the Secretary of Agriculture
"shall operate as an injunction" restraining the "live poultry
dealer" from violating that order, 7 U. S. C. $ 228b-3(g); yet
it appears that no one has ever suggested that a court of
appeals lacks the power to modify that "injunction" where
appropriate. Moreover, the change in the legal status quo
that the automatic stay would bring about, and the need to
demonstrate a special need to lift the stay (according to traditional equitable criteria), mean that the stay would remain
in effect in all but highly unusual cases.

530US1 Unit: $U75 [10-23-01 13:29:47] PAGES PGT: OPLG
360 MILLER v. FRENCH

Breyer, J., dissenting
In addition, the surrounding procedural provisions aremost naturally read as favoring the flexible interpretation.

The immediately preceding provision requires the court torule "promptly" upon the motion to terminate and says that
"[m]andamus shall lie to remedy any failure to issue a promptruling." 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(e)(1). If a motion to terminate
takes effect automatically through the "stay" after 30 or
90 days, it is difficult to understand what purpose would beserved by providing for mandamus--a procedure that itself

(in so complicated a matter) could take several weeks. Butif the automatic stay might be modified or lifted in an
unusual case, providing for mandamus makes considerable
sense. It guarantees that an appellate court will make
certain that unusual circumstances do in fact justify any
such modification or lifting of the stay. A later provision
that provides for immediate appeal of any order "staying,
suspending, delaying, or barring the operation of the automatic stay" can be read as providing for similar appellate
review for similar reasons. $ 3626(e)(4).

Further, the legislative history is neutral, for it is silent on
this issue. Yet there is relevant judicial precedent. That
precedent does not read statutory silence as denying judges
authority to exercise their traditional equitable powers.
Rather, it reads statutory silence as authorizing the exercise
of those powers. This Court has said, for example, that
"[o]ne thing is clear. Where Congress wished to deprive the
courts of this historic power, it knew how to use apt words--
only once has it done so and in a statute born of the exigencies of war." Scripps-Howard, supra, at 17. Compare
Lockerty v. Phillips, 319 U. S. 182, 186-187 (1943) (finding
that courts were deprived of equity powers where the statute explicitly removed jurisdiction), with Scripps-Howard,
supra, at 8-10 (refusing to read silence as depriving courts
of their historic equity power), and Califano, 442 U. S., at
705-706 (same). These cases recognize the importance of
permitting courts in equity cases to tailor relief, and related

361Cite as: 530 U. S. 327 (2000)
Breyer, J., dissenting
relief procedure, to the exigencies of particular cases and individual circumstances. In doing so, they recognize the fact
that in certain circumstances justice requires the flexibility
necessary to treat different cases differently--the rationale
that underlies equity itself. Cf. Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321
U. S. 321, 329 (1944) ("The essence of equity jurisdiction has
been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould
each decree to the necessities of the particular case").

Finally, the more flexible interpretation is consistent with
Congress' purposes as revealed in the statute. Those purposes include the avoidance of new judicial relief that is
overly broad or no longer necessary and the reassessment
of pre-existing relief to bring it into conformity with these
standards. But Congress has simultaneously expressed its
intent to maintain relief that is narrowly drawn and necessary to end unconstitutional practices. See 18 U. S. C.

$$ 3626(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(3). The statute, as flexibly interpreted, risks interfering with the first set of objectives only
to the extent that the speedy appellate review provided in
the statute fails to control district court error. The same
interpretation avoids the improper provisional termination
of relief that is constitutionally necessary. The risk of an
occasional small additional delay seems a comparatively
small price to pay (in terms of the statute's entire set of
purposes) to avoid the serious constitutional problems that
accompany the majority's more rigid interpretation.

The upshot is a statute that, when read in light of its language, structure, purpose, and history, is open to an interpretation that would allow a court to modify or suspend
the automatic stay when a party, in accordance with traditional equitable criteria, has demonstrated a need for such
an exception. That interpretation reflects this Court's historic reluctance to read a statute as depriving courts of their
traditional equitable powers. It also avoids constitutional
difficulties that might arise in unusual cases.

I do not argue that this interpretation reflects the mostnatural reading of the statute's language. Nor do I assert

that each individual legislator would have endorsed thatreading at the time. But such an interpretation is a reasonable construction of the statute. That reading harmo-nizes the statute's language with other basic legal principles, including constitutional principles. And, in doing so,it better fits the full set of legislative objectives embodied
in the statute than does the more rigid reading that themajority adopts.

For these reasons, I believe that the Solicitor General'smore flexible reading is the proper reading of the statute
before us. I would consequently vacate the decision ofthe Court of Appeals and remand this action for further
proceedings.

363OCTOBER TERM, 1999
Syllabus

CROSBY, SECRETARY OF ADMINISTRATION ANDFINANCE OF MASSACHUSETTS,

et al. v.NATIONAL FOREIGN TRADE COUNCIL

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 99-474. Argued March 22, 2000--Decided June 19, 2000
In 1996, Massachusetts passed a law barring state entities from buying

goods or services from companies doing business with Burma. Subsequently, Congress imposed mandatory and conditional sanctions on
Burma. Respondent (hereinafter Council), which has several members
affected by the state Act, filed suit against petitioner state officials
(hereinafter State) in federal court, claiming that the state Act unconstitutionally infringes on the federal foreign affairs power, violates the
Foreign Commerce Clause, and is preempted by the federal Act. The
District Court permanently enjoined the state Act's enforcement, and
the First Circuit affirmed.

Held: The state Act is preempted, and its application unconstitutional,

under the Supremacy Clause. Pp. 372-388.

(a) Even without an express preemption provision, state law must
yield to a congressional Act if Congress intends to occupy the field,
California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U. S. 93, 100, or to the extent of
any conflict with a federal statute, Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,
66-67. This Court will find preemption where it is impossible for a
private party to comply with both state and federal law and where the
state law is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of Congress's full purposes and objectives. What is a sufficient obstacle is
determined by examining the federal statute and identifying its purpose
and intended effects. Here, the state Act is such an obstacle, for it
undermines the intended purpose and natural effect of at least three
federal Act provisions. Pp. 372-374.

(b) First, the state Act is an obstacle to the federal Act's delegation of
discretion to the President to control economic sanctions against Burma.
Although Congress put initial sanctions in place, it authorized the President to terminate the measures upon certifying that Burma has made
progress in human rights and democracy, to impose new sanctions upon
findings of repression, and, most importantly, to suspend sanctions in
the interest of national security. Within the sphere defined by Congress, the statute has given the President as much discretion to exercise
economic leverage against Burma, with an eye toward national security,

530US1 Unit: $U76 [10-24-01 13:01:59] PAGES PGT: OPLG
364 CROSBY v. NATIONAL FOREIGN TRADE COUNCIL

Syllabus
as law permits. The plenitude of Executive authority controls the preemption issue here. The President has the authority not merely to
make a political statement but to achieve a political result, and the fullness of his authority shows the importance in the congressional mind of
reaching that result. It is implausible to think that Congress would
have gone to such lengths to empower the President had it been willing
to compromise his effectiveness by allowing state or local ordinances to
blunt the consequences of his actions. Yet this is exactly what the state
Act does. Its sanctions are immediate and perpetual, there being no
termination provision. This unyielding application undermines the
President's authority by leaving him with less economic and diplomatic
leverage than the federal Act permits. Pp. 374-377.

(c) Second, the state Act interferes with Congress's intention to limit
economic pressure against the Burmese Government to a specific range.
The state Act stands in clear contrast to the federal Act. It prohibits
some contracts permitted by the federal Act, affects more investment
than the federal Act, and reaches foreign and domestic companies while
the federal Act confines its reach to United States persons. It thus
conflicts with the federal law by penalizing individuals and conduct that
Congress has explicitly exempted or excluded from sanctions. That the
two Acts have a common end hardly neutralizes the conflicting means,
and the fact that some companies may be able to comply with both sets
of sanctions does not mean the state Act is not at odds with achievement
of the congressional decision about the right calibration of force.
Pp. 377-380.

(d) Finally, the state Act is at odds with the President's authority to
speak for the United States among the world's nations to develop a
comprehensive, multilateral Burma strategy. Congress called for Presidential cooperation with other countries in developing such a strategy,
directed the President to encourage a dialogue between the Burmese
Government and the democratic opposition, and required him to report
to Congress on these efforts. This delegation of power, like that over
economic sanctions, invested the President with the maximum authority
of the National Government. The state Act undermines the President's

governments have filed formal protests with the National Government

the state Act has complicated its dealing with foreign sovereigns and
proven an impediment to accomplishing the objectives assigned it by
Congress. In this case, the positions of foreign governments and the

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue is whether the Burma law of the Commonwealthof Massachusetts, restricting the authority of its agencies to

purchase goods or services from companies doing businesswith Burma,

1 is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the

National Constitution owing to its threat of frustrating fed-eral statutory objectives. We hold that it is.

1/2 (1997). The statute

generally bars state entities from buying goods or servicesfrom any person (defined to include a business organization)

identified on a "restricted purchase list" of those doing busi-ness with Burma. $$ 7:22H(a), 7:22J. Although the statute
has no general provision for waiver or termination of its ban,it does exempt from boycott any entities present in Burma
solely to report the news, $ 7:22H(e), or to provide interna-tional telecommunication goods or services,

ibid., or medicalsupplies, $ 7:22I.

" `Doing business with Burma' " is defined broadly to coverany person

"(a) having a principal place of business, place of in-corporation or its corporate headquarters in Burma
(Myanmar) or having any operations, leases, franchises,majority-owned subsidiaries, distribution agreements,
or any other similar agreements in Burma (Myanmar),or being the majority-owned subsidiary, licensee or franchise of such a person;
"(b) providing financial services to the government ofBurma (Myanmar), including providing direct loans, underwriting government securities, providing any con-sulting advice or assistance, providing brokerage services, acting as a trustee or escrow agent, or otherwiseacting as an agent pursuant to a contractual agreement;
"(c) promoting the importation or sale of gems, timber,oil, gas or other related products, commerce in which
is largely controlled by the government of Burma(Myanmar), from Burma (Myanmar);
"(d) providing any goods or services to the governmentof Burma (Myanmar)." $ 7:22G.

There are three exceptions to the ban: (1) if the procure-ment is essential, and without the restricted bid, there would
be no bids or insufficient competition, $ 7:22H(b); (2) if the

person not doing business with Burma, $ 7:22H(d), meaningan offer that is no more than 10 percent greater than the
restricted bid, $ 7:22G. To enforce the ban, the Act requirespetitioner Secretary of Administration and Finance to maintain a "restricted purchase list" of all firms "doing businesswith Burma,"

In September 1996, three months after the Massachusettslaw was enacted, Congress passed a statute imposing a set

of mandatory and conditional sanctions on Burma. See For-eign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs
Appropriations Act, 1997, $ 570, 110 Stat. 3009-166 to 3009-167 (enacted by the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 1997, $ 101(c), 110 Stat. 3009-121 to 3009-172). The fed-eral Act has five basic parts, three substantive and two
procedural.First, it imposes three sanctions directly on Burma. It
bans all aid to the Burmese Government except for humani-tarian assistance, counternarcotics efforts, and promotion of
human rights and democracy. $ 570(a)(1). The statute in-structs United States representatives to international financial institutions to vote against loans or other assistanceto or for Burma, $ 570(a)(2), and it provides that no entry visa
shall be issued to any Burmese Government official unlessrequired by treaty or to staff the Burmese mission to the
United Nations, $ 570(a)(3). These restrictions are to re-main in effect "[u]ntil such time as the President determines
and certifies to Congress that Burma has made measurableand substantial progress in improving human rights practices and implementing democratic government." $ 570(a).

2 According to the District Court, companies may challenge their inclusion on the list by submitting an affidavit stating that they do no business
with Burma. National Foreign Trade Council v. Baker, 26 F. Supp. 2d

Services Division makes a final determination. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
Second, the federal Act authorizes the President to impose
further sanctions subject to certain conditions. He may prohibit "United States persons" from "new investment" in
Burma, and shall do so if he determines and certifies to Congress that the Burmese Government has physically harmed,
rearrested, or exiled Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (the opposition
leader selected to receive the Nobel Peace Prize), or has committed "large-scale repression of or violence against the
Democratic opposition." $ 570(b). "New investment" is defined as entry into a contract that would favor the "economical development of resources located in Burma," or would
provide ownership interests in or benefits from such development, $ 570(f )(2), but the term specifically excludes (and thus
excludes from any Presidential prohibition) "entry into, performance of, or financing of a contract to sell or purchase
goods, services, or technology," ibid.

Third, the statute directs the President to work to develop
"a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to bring democracy
to and improve human rights practices and the quality of
life in Burma." $ 570(c). He is instructed to cooperate with
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and with other countries having major trade and
investment interests in Burma to devise such an approach,
and to pursue the additional objective of fostering dialogue
between the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and democratic opposition groups. Ibid.

As for the procedural provisions of the federal statute, the
fourth section requires the President to report periodically
to certain congressional committee chairmen on the progress
toward democratization and better living conditions in
Burma as well as on the development of the required strategy. $ 570(d). And the fifth part of the federal Act authorizes the President "to waive, temporarily or permanently,
any sanction [under the federal Act] . . . if he determines and
certifies to Congress that the application of such sanction

would be contrary to the national security interests of theUnited States." $ 570(e).

On May 20, 1997, the President issued the Burma Execu-tive Order, Exec. Order No. 13047, 3 CFR 202 (1997 Comp.).
He certified for purposes of $ 570(b) that the Government ofBurma had "committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma" and found that the BurmeseGovernment's actions and policies constituted "an unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreignpolicy of the United States," a threat characterized as a national emergency. The President then prohibited new in-vestment in Burma "by United States persons," Exec. Order
No. 13047, $ 1, any approval or facilitation by a United Statesperson of such new investment by foreign persons, $ 2(a), and
any transaction meant to evade or avoid the ban, $ 2(b). Theorder generally incorporated the exceptions and exemptions
addressed in the statute. $$ 3, 4. Finally, the Presidentdelegated to the Secretary of State the tasks of working with
ASEAN and other countries to develop a strategy for democ-racy, human rights, and the quality of life in Burma, and of
making the required congressional reports.3 $ 5.

In April 1998, the Council filed suit in the United StatesDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the petitioner stateofficials charged with administering and enforcing the state
Act (whom we will refer to simply as the State).4 The Coun-cil argued that the state law unconstitutionally infringed on
the federal foreign affairs power, violated the Foreign Com-merce Clause, and was preempted by the federal Act. After
detailed stipulations, briefing, and argument, the DistrictCourt permanently enjoined enforcement of the state Act,
holding that it "unconstitutionally impinge[d] on the fed-eral government's exclusive authority to regulate foreign
affairs." National Foreign Trade Council v. Baker, 26 F.Supp. 2d 287, 291 (Mass. 1998).

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuitaffirmed on three independent grounds. 181 F. 3d, at 45.
It found the state Act unconstitutionally interfered with theforeign affairs power of the National Government under
Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U. S. 429 (1968), see 181 F. 3d, at52-55; violated the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause, U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, see 181 F. 3d, at 61-71; and waspreempted by the congressional Burma Act, see id., at 71-77.

The State's petition for certiorari challenged the decisionon all three grounds and asserted interests said to be shared
by other state and local governments with similar measures.5Though opposing certiorari, the Council acknowledged the

18-19. We granted certiorari to resolve these importantquestions, 528 U. S. 1018 (1999), and now affirm.

III
A fundamental principle of the Constitution is that Con-gress has the power to preempt state law. Art. VI, cl. 2;

Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 211 (1824); Savage v. Jones,225 U. S. 501, 533 (1912); California v. ARC America Corp.,
490 U. S. 93, 101 (1989). Even without an express provisionfor preemption, we have found that state law must yield to
a congressional Act in at least two circumstances. WhenCongress intends federal law to "occupy the field," state law
in that area is preempted. Id., at 100; cf. United States v.
Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 115 (2000) (citing Charleston & WesternCarolina R. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., 237 U. S. 597,

604 (1915)). And even if Congress has not occupied the field,state law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict
with a federal statute.6 Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,66-67 (1941); ARC America Corp., supra, at 100-101; Locke,
supra, at 109. We will find preemption where it is impossi-ble for a private party to comply with both state and federal
law, see, e. g., Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v.

6 We recognize, of course, that the categories of preemption are not "rigidly distinct." English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79, n. 5 (1990).
Because a variety of state laws and regulations may conflict with a federal
statute, whether because a private party cannot comply with both sets of
provisions or because the objectives of the federal statute are frustrated,
"field pre-emption may be understood as a species of conflict pre-emption,"
id., at 79-80, n. 5; see also Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management
Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 104, n. 2 (1992) (quoting English, supra); 505 U. S., at
115-116 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting similarity between "purposeconflict pre-emption" and preemption of a field, and citing L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 486 (2d ed. 1988)); 1 L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1177 (3d ed. 2000) (noting that "field" preemption may fall into
any of the categories of express, implied, or conflict preemption).

Opinion of the Court
Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963), and where "under thecircumstances of [a] particular case, [the challenged state

law] stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and ex-ecution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."
Hines, supra, at 67. What is a sufficient obstacle is a matterof judgment, to be informed by examining the federal statute
as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects:

"For when the question is whether a Federal act over-rides a state law, the entire scheme of the statute must

of course be considered and that which needs must beimplied is of no less force than that which is expressed.
If the purpose of the act cannot otherwise be accom-plished--if its operation within its chosen field else must
be frustrated and its provisions be refused their naturaleffect--the state law must yield to the regulation of Congress within the sphere of its delegated power." Sav-age, supra, at 533, quoted in Hines, supra, at 67, n. 20.

Applying this standard, we see the state Burma law as anobstacle to the accomplishment of Congress's full objectives
under the federal Act.7 We find that the state law under-mines the intended purpose and "natural effect" of at least
three provisions of the federal Act, that is, its delegation ofeffective discretion to the President to control economic

7 The State concedes, as it must, that in addressing the subject of the
federal Act, Congress has the power to preempt the state statute. See
Reply Brief for Petitioners 2; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6.

We add that we have already rejected the argument that a State's "statutory scheme . . . escapes pre-emption because it is an exercise of the
State's spending power rather than its regulatory power." Wisconsin
Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 287 (1986). In Gould, we
found that a Wisconsin statute debarring repeat violators of the National
Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 151 et seq., from contracting with the
State was preempted because the state statute's additional enforcement
mechanism conflicted with the federal Act. 475 U. S., at 288-289. The
fact that the State "ha[d] chosen to use its spending power rather than its
police power" did not reduce the potential for conflict with the federal
statute. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
sanctions against Burma, its limitation of sanctions solely toUnited States persons and new investment, and its directive

to the President to proceed diplomatically in developing acomprehensive, multilateral strategy toward Burma.

8

A
First, Congress clearly intended the federal Act to providethe President with flexible and effective authority over economic sanctions against Burma. Although Congress imme-diately put in place a set of initial sanctions (prohibiting
bilateral aid, $ 570(a)(1), support for international financialassistance, $ 570(a)(2), and entry by Burmese officials into the
United States, $ 570(a)(3)), it authorized the President to ter-minate any and all of those measures upon determining and
certifying that there had been progress in human rights anddemocracy in Burma. $ 570(a). It invested the President
with the further power to ban new investment by UnitedStates persons, dependent only on specific Presidential findings of repression in Burma. $ 570(b). And, most signifi-cantly, Congress empowered the President "to waive, temporarily or permanently, any sanction [under the federalAct] . . . if he determines and certifies to Congress that the
application of such sanction would be contrary to the nationalsecurity interests of the United States." $ 570(e).

8 We leave for another day a consideration in this context of a presumption against preemption. See United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 108
(2000). Assuming, arguendo, that some presumption against preemption
is appropriate, we conclude, based on our analysis below, that the state
Act presents a sufficient obstacle to the full accomplishment of Congress's
objectives under the federal Act to find it preempted. See Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).

Because our conclusion that the state Act conflicts with federal law is
sufficient to affirm the judgment below, we decline to speak to field preemption as a separate issue, see n. 6, supra, or to pass on the First Circuit's rulings addressing the foreign affairs power or the dormant Foreign
Commerce Clause. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-347 (1936)
(concurring opinion).

Opinion of the Court
This express investiture of the President with statutory
authority to act for the United States in imposing sanctions
with respect to the Government of Burma, augmented by
the flexibility 9 to respond to change by suspending sanctions
in the interest of national security, recalls Justice Jackson's
observation in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343
U. S. 579, 635 (1952): "When the President acts pursuant to
an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in
his own right plus all that Congress can delegate." See also
id., at 635-636, n. 2 (noting that the President's power in the
area of foreign relations is least restricted by Congress and
citing United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299
U. S. 304 (1936)). Within the sphere defined by Congress,
then, the statute has placed the President in a position with
as much discretion to exercise economic leverage against
Burma, with an eye toward national security, as our law will

9 Statements by the sponsors of the federal Act underscore the statute's
clarity in providing the President with flexibility in implementing its
Burma sanctions policy. See 142 Cong. Rec. 19212 (1996) (statement of
principal sponsor Sen. Cohen) (emphasizing importance of providing "the
administration flexibility in reacting to changes, both positive and negative, with respect to the behavior of the [Burmese regime]); id., at 19213;
id., at 19221 (statement of cosponsor Sen. McCain) (describing the federal
Act as "giv[ing] the President, who, whether Democrat or Republican, is
charged with conducting our Nation's foreign policy, some flexibility"); id.,
at 19220 (statement of cosponsor Sen. Feinstein) ("We need to be able to
have the flexibility to remove sanctions and provide support for Burma if
it reaches a transition stage that is moving toward the restoration of democracy, which all of us support"). These sponsors chose a pliant policy
with the explicit support of the Executive. See, e. g., id., at 19219 (letter
from Barbara Larkin, Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs, U. S. Department of State to Sen. Cohen) (admitted by unanimous consent) ("We
believe the current and conditional sanctions which your language proposes are consistent with Administration policy. As we have stated on
several occasions in the past, we need to maintain our flexibility to respond
to events in Burma and to consult with Congress on appropriate responses
to ongoing and future development there").

Opinion of the Court
admit. And it is just this plenitude of Executive authoritythat we think controls the issue of preemption here. The

President has been given this authority not merely to makea political statement but to achieve a political result, and the
fullness of his authority shows the importance in the con-gressional mind of reaching that result. It is simply implausible that Congress would have gone to such lengths to em-power the President if it had been willing to compromise his
effectiveness by deference to every provision of state statuteor local ordinance that might, if enforced, blunt the consequences of discretionary Presidential action.10And that is just what the Massachusetts Burma law would
do in imposing a different, state system of economic pressureagainst the Burmese political regime. As will be seen, the
state statute penalizes some private action that the federalAct (as administered by the President) may allow, and pulls
levers of influence that the federal Act does not reach. Butthe point here is that the state sanctions are immediate,

11

see 1996 Mass. Acts 239, ch. 130, $ 3 (restricting all contractsafter law's effective date); Mass. Gen. Laws $ 7:22K (1997)

10 The State makes arguments that could be read to suggest that Congress's objective of Presidential flexibility was limited to discretion solely
over the sanctions in the federal Act, and that Congress implicitly left
control over state sanctions to the State. Brief for Petitioners 19-24.
We reject this cramped view of Congress's intent as against the weight of
the evidence. Congress made no explicit statement of such limited objectives. More importantly, the federal Act itself strongly indicates the opposite. For example, under the federal Act, Congress explicitly identified
protecting "national security interests" as a ground on which the President could suspend federal sanctions. $ 570(e), 110 Stat. 3009-167. We
find it unlikely that Congress intended both to enable the President to
protect national security by giving him the flexibility to suspend or terminate federal sanctions and simultaneously to allow Massachusetts to act
at odds with the President's judgment of what national security requires.

11 These provisions strongly resemble the immediate sanctions on investment that appeared in the proposed section of H. R. 3540 that Congress
rejected in favor of the federal Act. See H. R. 3540, 104th Cong., 2d Sess.,

$ 569(1) (1996).

Opinion of the Court
(authorizing regulations for timely and effective implementation), and perpetual, there being no termination provision,
see, e. g., $ 7:22J (restricted companies list to be updated at
least every three months). This unyielding application undermines the President's intended statutory authority by
making it impossible for him to restrain fully the coercive
power of the national economy when he may choose to take
the discretionary action open to him, whether he believes
that the national interest requires sanctions to be lifted, or
believes that the promise of lifting sanctions would move the
Burmese regime in the democratic direction. Quite simply,
if the Massachusetts law is enforceable the President has less
to offer and less economic and diplomatic leverage as a consequence. In Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654 (1981),
we used the metaphor of the bargaining chip to describe the
President's control of funds valuable to a hostile country, id.,
at 673; here, the state Act reduces the value of the chips
created by the federal statute.12 It thus "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes

Congress manifestly intended to limit economic pressure
against the Burmese Government to a specific range. The
federal Act confines its reach to United States persons,

only a conditional ban on a carefully defined area of "new
investment," $ 570(f)(2), and pointedly exempts contracts to

dialog with the democratic opposition. That is why we also allow the
President to lift sanctions").

The State has set a different course, and its statute con-flicts with federal law at a number of points by penalizing

individuals and conduct that Congress has explicitly ex-empted or excluded from sanctions. While the state Act differs from the federal in relying entirely on indirect economic
leverage through third parties with Burmese connections,it otherwise stands in clear contrast to the congressional

scheme in the scope of subject matter addressed. It re-stricts all contracts between the State and companies doing
business in Burma, $ 7:22H(a), except when purchasing medi-cal supplies and other essentials (or when short of comparable bids), $ 7:22I. It is specific in targeting contracts to pro13 The fact that Congress repeatedly considered and rejected targeting
a broader range of conduct lends additional support to our view. Most
importantly, the federal Act, as passed, replaced the original proposed
section of H. R. 3540, which barred "any investment in Burma" by a
United States national without exception or limitation. See H. R. 3540,
supra, $ 569(1). Congress also rejected a competing amendment, S. 1511,
104th Cong., 1st Sess. (Dec. 29, 1995), which similarly provided that
"United States nationals shall not make any investment in Burma,"

$ 4(b)(1), and would have permitted the President to impose conditional
sanctions on the importation of "articles which are produced, manufactured, grown, or extracted in Burma," $ 4(c)(1), and would have barred all
travel by United States nationals to Burma, $ 4(c)(2). Congress had rejected an earlier amendment that would have prohibited all United States
investment in Burma, subject to the President's power to lift sanctions.
S. 1092, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (July 28, 1995).

Statements of the sponsors of the federal Act also lend weight to the
conclusions that the limits were deliberate. See, e. g., 142 Cong. Rec., at
19279 (statement of Sen. Breaux) (characterizing the federal Act as "strik[ing] a balance between unilateral sanctions against Burma and unfettered
United States investment in that country"). The scope of the exemptions
was discussed, see ibid. (statements of Sens. Nickles and Cohen), and
broader sanctions were rejected, see id., at 19212 (statement of Sen.
Cohen); id., at 19280 (statement of Sen. Murkowski) ("Instead of the current draconian sanctions proposed in the legislation before us, we should
adopt an approach that effectively secures our national interests").

vide financial services, $ 7:22G(b), and general goods andservices, $ 7:22G(d), to the Government of Burma, and thus

prohibits contracts between the State and United States per-sons for goods, services, or technology, even though those
transactions are explicitly exempted from the ambit of newinvestment prohibition when the President exercises his discretionary authority to impose sanctions under the federalAct. $ 570(f)(2).

As with the subject of business meant to be affected, sowith the class of companies doing it: the state Act's generality stands at odds with the federal discreteness. The Mas-sachusetts law directly and indirectly imposes costs on all
companies that do any business in Burma, $ 7:22G, save forthose reporting news or providing international telecommunications goods or services, or medical supplies, $$ 7:22H(e),7:22I. It sanctions companies promoting the importation of
natural resources controlled by the Government of Burma,or having any operations or affiliates in Burma. $ 7:22G.
The state Act thus penalizes companies with pre-existingaffiliates or investments, all of which lie beyond the reach
of the federal Act's restrictions on "new investment" inBurmese economic development. $$ 570(b), 570(f )(2). The
state Act, moreover, imposes restrictions on foreign compa-nies as well as domestic, whereas the federal Act limits its
reach to United States persons.The conflicts are not rendered irrelevant by the State's
argument that there is no real conflict between the statutesbecause they share the same goals and because some companies may comply with both sets of restrictions. See Brieffor Petitioners 21-22. The fact of a common end hardly
neutralizes conflicting means,14 see Gade v. National Solid

Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 286 (1986) (quoting Garner v.Teamsters, 346 U. S. 485, 498-499 (1953)). Sanctions are

drawn not only to bar what they prohibit but to allow whatthey permit, and the inconsistency of sanctions here undermines the congressional calibration of force.

Finally, the state Act is at odds with the President's in-tended authority to speak for the United States among the

world's nations in developing a "comprehensive, multilateralstrategy to bring democracy to and improve human rights
practices and the quality of life in Burma." $ 570(c). Con-gress called for Presidential cooperation with members of
ASEAN and other countries in developing such a strategy,ibid., directed the President to encourage a dialogue between the Government of Burma and the democratic opposi-tion, ibid.,

15 and required him to report to the Congress on

the progress of his diplomatic efforts, $ 570(d). As with Conprotection," 481 U. S., at 83, but we also examined whether the state law
conflicted with federal law "[i]n implementing its goal," ibid. Identity
of ends does not end our analysis of preemption. See Gould, 475 U. S.,
at 286.

15 The record supports the conclusion that Congress considered the development of a multilateral sanctions strategy to be a central objective of
the federal Act. See, e. g., 142 Cong. Rec., at 19212 (remarks of Sen.
Cohen) ("[T]o be effective, American policy in Burma has to be coordinated with our Asian friends and allies"); id., at 19219 (remarks of Sen.

Opinion of the Court
gress's explicit delegation to the President of power overeconomic sanctions, Congress's express command to the

President to take the initiative for the United States amongthe international community invested him with the maximum authority of the National Government, cf. YoungstownSheet & Tube Co., 343 U. S., at 635, in harmony with the
President's own constitutional powers, U. S. Const., Art. II,$ 2, cl. 2 ("[The President] shall have Power, by and with the
Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties" and"shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls"); $ 3 ("[The President] shall receive Ambassadors andother public Ministers"). This clear mandate and invocation
of exclusively national power belies any suggestion that Con-gress intended the President's effective voice to be obscured
by state or local action.Again, the state Act undermines the President's capacity,
in this instance for effective diplomacy. It is not merely thatthe differences between the state and federal Acts in scope
and type of sanctions threaten to complicate discussions;they compromise the very capacity of the President to speak
for the Nation with one voice in dealing with other govern-ments. We need not get into any general consideration of
limits of state action affecting foreign affairs to realize thatthe President's maximum power to persuade rests on his
capacity to bargain for the benefits of access to the entirenational economy without exception for enclaves fenced
off willy-nilly by inconsistent political tactics.16 When such

16 Such concerns have been raised by the President's representatives in

United States is speaking with one voice and consistent with our international obligations, such uncoordinated responses can put the US on the
political defensive and shift attention away from the problem to the issue
of sanctions themselves"). We have expressed similar concerns in our
cases on foreign commerce and foreign relations. See, e. g., Japan Line,

exceptions do qualify his capacity to present a coherentposition on behalf of the national economy, he is weakened,

of course, not only in dealing with the Burmese regime,but in working together with other nations in hopes of
reaching common policy and "comprehensive" strategy.17Cf. Dames & Moore, 453 U. S., at 673-674.

While the threat to the President's power to speak andbargain effectively with other nations seems clear enough,
the record is replete with evidence to answer any skeptics.First, in response to the passage of the state Act, a number
of this country's allies and trading partners filed formal pro-tests with the National Government, see 181 F. 3d, at 47
(noting protests from Japan, the European Union (EU), andASEAN), including an official

Note Verbale from the EU tothe Department of State protesting the state Act.

18 EU officials have warned that the state Act "could have a damag-ing effect on bilateral EU-US relations." Letter of Hugo

Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 449 (1979); Chy Lung v.
Freeman, 92 U. S. 275, 279 (1876); cf. The Federalist No. 80, pp. 535-536
(J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) ("[T]he peace of the whole ought not to
be left at the disposal of a part. The union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members").

17 The record reflects that sponsors of the federal Act were well aware

of this concern and provided flexibility to the President over sanctions for
that very reason. See, e. g., 142 Cong. Rec., at 19214 (statement of Sen.
Thomas) ("Although I will readily admit that our present relationship with
Burma is not especially deep, the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions would certainly downgrade what little relationship we have. Moreover, it would affect our relations with many of our allies in Asia as we
try to corral them into following our lead"); id., at 19219 (statement of
Sen. Feinstein) ("It is absolutely essential that any pressure we seek to
put on the Government of Burma be coordinated with the nations of
ASEAN and our European and Asian allies. If we act unilaterally, we
are more likely to have the opposite effect--alienating many of these
allies, while having no real impact on the ground").

build coalitions with our allies" to promote democracy andhuman rights in Burma. A. Larson, State and Local Sanctions: Remarks to the Council of State Governments 2 (Dec.8, 1998). "[T]he EU's opposition to the Massachusetts law
has meant that US government high level discussions withEU officials often have focused not on what to do about
Burma, but on what to do about the Massachusetts Burmalaw."

Id., at 3.21 This point has been consistently echoedin the State Department:

"While the [Massachusetts sanctions on Burma] wereadopted in pursuit of a noble goal, the restoration of democracy in Burma, these measures also risk shifting thefocus of the debate with our European Allies away from
the best way to bring pressure against the State Lawand Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to a potential
WTO dispute over its consistency with our internationalobligations. Let me be clear. We are working with
Massachusetts in the WTO dispute settlement process.But we must be honest in saying that the threatened
WTO case risks diverting United States' and Europe'sattention from focusing where it should be--on Burma."
Eizenstat testimony, App. 115.22
21 Assistant Secretary Larson also declared that the state law "has hindered our ability to speak with one voice on the grave human rights situation in Burma, become a significant irritant in our relations with the EU
and impeded our efforts to build a strong multilateral coalition on Burma
where we, Massachusetts and the EU share a common goal." Assistant

Opinion of the Court
This evidence in combination is more than sufficient to showthat the state Act stands as an obstacle in addressing the

congressional obligation to devise a comprehensive, multilat-eral strategy.

Our discussion in Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise TaxBd. of Cal., 512 U. S. 298, 327-329 (1994), of the limited
weight of evidence of formal diplomatic protests, risk of for-eign retaliation, and statements by the Executive does not
undercut the point. In Barclays, we had the question of thepreemptive effect of federal tax law on state tax law with
discriminatory extraterritorial effects. We found the reac-tions of foreign powers and the opinions of the Executive
irrelevant in fathoming congressional intent because Con-gress had taken specific actions rejecting the positions both
of foreign governments, id., at 324-328, and the Executive,
id., at 328-329. Here, however, Congress has done nothingto render such evidence beside the point. In consequence,

statements of foreign powers necessarily involved in thePresident's efforts to comply with the federal Act, indications
of concrete disputes with those powers, and opinions of senior National Government officials are competent and directevidence of the frustration of congressional objectives by the

state Act.23 Although we do not unquestioningly defer tothe legal judgments expressed in Executive Branch statements when determining a federal Act's preemptive characDavid Marchick before the Maryland House of Delegates Committee on
Commerce and Government Matters, Mar. 25, 1998, id., at 166 (same).

23 We find support for this conclusion in the statements of the congressional sponsors of the federal Act, who indicated their opinion that inflexible unilateral action would be likely to cause difficulties in our relations
with our allies and in crafting an effective policy toward Burma. See
n. 17, supra. Moreover, the facts that the Executive specifically called
for flexibility prior to the passage of the federal Act, and that the Congress
rejected less flexible alternatives and adopted the current law in response
to the Executive's communications, bolster the relevance of the Executive's opinion with regard to its ability to accomplish Congress's goals.
See n. 9, supra.

id., at 196; Bar-clays, supra, at 327. In this case, repeated representations

demonstrate that the state Act stands in the way of Con-gress's diplomatic objectives.

IV
The State's remaining argument is unavailing. It con-tends that the failure of Congress to preempt the state Act

24 The State appears to argue that we should ignore the evidence of the
WTO dispute because under the federal law implementing the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Congress foreclosed suits by
private persons and foreign governments challenging a state law on the
basis of GATT in federal or state courts, allowing only the National Government to raise such a challenge. See Uruguay Round Agreements Act
(URAA), $ 102(c)(1), 108 Stat. 4818, 19 U. S. C. $$ 3512(b)(2)(A), 3512(c)(1);
see also "Statement of Administrative Action" (SAA), reprinted in H. R.
Doc. No. 103-216, pp. 656, 675-677 (1994). To consider such evidence, in
its view, would effectively violate the ban by allowing private parties and
foreign nations to challenge state procurement laws in domestic courts.
But the terms of $ 102 of the URAA and of the SAA simply do not support
this argument. They refer to challenges to state law based on inconsistency with any of the "Uruguay Round Agreements." The challenge here
is based on the federal Burma law. We reject the State's argument that
the National Government's decisions to bar such WTO suits and to decline
to bring its own suit against the Massachusetts Burma law evince its approval. These actions simply do not speak to the preemptive effect of the
federal sanctions against Burma.

demonstrates implicit permission. The State points out thatCongress has repeatedly declined to enact express preemption provisions aimed at state and local sanctions, and it callsour attention to the large number of such measures passed
against South Africa in the 1980's, which various authori-ties cited have thought were not preempted.

25 The State

stresses that Congress was aware of the state Act in 1996,
but did not preempt it explicitly when it adopted its ownBurma statute.

26 The State would have us conclude that

Congress's continuing failure to enact express preemptionimplies approval, particularly in light of occasional instances

of express preemption of state sanctions in the past.27The argument is unconvincing on more than one level. A
failure to provide for preemption expressly may reflect noth25 See, e. g., Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore,

Cong. Rec. 23119-23129 (1986) (House debate on resolutions); id., at 23292
(Sen. Kennedy, quoting testimony of Laurence H. Tribe). Amicus Members of Congress in support of the State also note that when Congress
revoked its federal sanctions in response to the democratic transition in
that country, it refused to preempt the state and local measures, merely
"urg[ing]" both state and local governments and private boycott participants to rescind their sanctions. Brief for Senator Boxer et al. as Amici
Curiae 9, citing South African Democratic Transition Support Act of 1993,

$ 4(c)(1), 107 Stat. 1503.

26 The State also finds significant the fact that Congress did not preempt

state and local sanctions in a recent sanctions reform bill, even though
its sponsor seemed to be aware of such measures. See H. R. Rep.
No. 105-2708 (1997); 143 Cong. Rec. E2080 (Oct. 23, 1997) (Rep. Hamilton).

ing more than the settled character of implied preemptiondoctrine that courts will dependably apply, and in any event,

the existence of conflict cognizable under the SupremacyClause does not depend on express congressional recognition
that federal and state law may conflict, Hines, 312 U. S., at67. The State's inference of congressional intent is unwarranted here, therefore, simply because the silence of Con-gress is ambiguous. Since we never ruled on whether state
and local sanctions against South Africa in the 1980's werepreempted or otherwise invalid, arguable parallels between
the two sets of federal and state Acts do not tell us muchabout the validity of the latter.

V
Because the state Act's provisions conflict with Congress'sspecific delegation to the President of flexible discretion,

with limitation of sanctions to a limited scope of actions andactors, and with direction to develop a comprehensive, multilateral strategy under the federal Act, it is preempted, andits application is unconstitutional, under the Supremacy
Clause.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

pointless since the immediately succeeding footnote must
rely upon the statute itself (devoid of any support in statements by "sponsors" or the "Executive") to refute the quite
telling argument that the statements were addressed only to
flexibility in administering the sanctions of the federal Act,
and said nothing at all about state sanctions. See ante, at
376, n. 10.

It is perfectly obvious on the face of the statute that Congress expected the President to use his discretionary authority over sanctions to "move the Burmese regime in the democratic direction," ante, at 377. I therefore see no point in

proposition that "[t]he sponsors of the federal Act" shared
this expectation, ante, at 377, n. 12.

It is perfectly obvious on the face of the statute that Congress's Burma policy was a "calibrated" one, which "limit[ed]
economic pressure against the Burmese Government to a
specific range," ante, at 377. I therefore see no point in

proposition that bills imposing greater sanctions were introduced but not adopted, ante, at 378, n. 13, and to the (even
less surprising) proposition that the sponsors of the legislation made clear that its "limits were deliberate," ibid. And
I would feel this way even if I shared the Court's nai"ve assumption that the failure of a bill to make it out of committee,
or to be adopted when reported to the floor, is the same as
a congressional "reject[ion]" of what the bill contained, ibid.
Curiously, the Court later recognizes, in rejecting the argument that Congress's failure to enact express pre-emption
implies approval of the state Act, that "the silence of Congress [may be] ambiguous." Ante, at 388. Would that the
Court had come to this conclusion before it relied (several
times) upon the implications of Congress's failure to enact

It is perfectly obvious from the record, as the Court dis-cusses,

ante, at 382-385, that the inflexibility produced bythe Massachusetts statute has in fact caused difficulties with

our allies and has in fact impeded a "multilateral strategy."And as the Court later says in another context, "the existence of conflict cognizable under the Supremacy Clause doesnot depend on express congressional recognition that federal
and state law may conflict," ante, at 388. I therefore see nopoint in devoting a footnote to the interesting (albeit unsurprising) fact that the "congressional sponsors" of the Act and"the Executive" actually

predicted that inflexibility wouldhave the effect of causing difficulties with our allies and impeding a "multilateral strategy," ante, at 385, n. 23.Of course even if all of the Court's invocations of legislative history were not utterly irrelevant, I would still objectto them, since neither the statements of individual Members
of Congress (ordinarily addressed to a virtually emptyfloor),* nor Executive statements and letters addressed to
congressional committees, nor the nonenactment of otherproposed legislation, is a reliable indication of what a majority of both Houses of Congress intended when they voted forthe statute before us. The only reliable indication of that
intent--the only thing we know for sure can be attributed

*Debate on the bill that became the present Act seems, in this respect,
not to have departed from the ordinary. Cf. 142 Cong. Rec. 19263 (1996)
(statement of Sen. McConnell) (noting, in debate regarding which amendment to take up next: "I do not see anyone on the Democratic side in
the Chamber").

to all of them--is the words of the bill that they voted tomake law. In a way, using unreliable legislative history to

confirm what the statute plainly says anyway (or what therecord plainly shows) is less objectionable since, after all, it
has absolutely no effect upon the outcome. But in a way,this utter lack of necessity makes it even worse--calling to
mind St. Augustine's enormous remorse at stealing pearswhen he was not even hungry, and just for the devil of it
("not seeking aught through the shame, but the shame it-self!"). The Confessions, Book 2, || 9, in 18 Great Books of
the Western World 10-11 (1952) (E. Pusey transl. 1952).In any case, the portion of the Court's opinion that I consider irrelevant is quite extensive, comprising, in total, aboutone-tenth of the opinion's size and (since it is in footnote
type) even more of the opinion's content. I consider that tobe not just wasteful (it was not preordained, after all, that
this was to be a 25-page essay) but harmful, since it tellsfuture litigants that, even when a statute is clear on its face,
and its effects clear upon the record, statements from thelegislative history may help (and presumably harm) the case.
If so, they must be researched and discussed by counsel--which makes appellate litigation considerably more time consuming, and hence considerably more expensive, than it needbe. This to my mind outweighs the arguable good that may
come of such persistent irrelevancy, at least when it is in-dulged in the margins: that it may encourage readers to
ignore our footnotes.For this reason, I join only the judgment of the Court.

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA
on exceptions to report of special master

No. 8, Orig. Argued April 25, 2000--Decided June 19, 2000
This litigation began in 1952 when Arizona invoked this Court's original

jurisdiction to settle a dispute with California over the extent of each
State's right to use water from the Colorado River system. The United
States intervened, seeking water rights on behalf of, among others,
five Indian reservations, including the Fort Yuma (Quechan) Indian Reservation, the Colorado River Indian Reservation, and the Fort Mojave
Indian Reservation. The first round of the litigation culminated in Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546 (Arizona I), in which the Court held
that the United States had reserved water rights for the five reservations, id., at 565, 599-601; that those rights must be considered present perfected rights and given priority because they were effective as
of the time each reservation was created, id., at 600; and that those
rights should be based on the amount of each reservation's practicably
irrigable acreage as determined by the Special Master, ibid. In its 1964
decree, the Court specified the quantities and priorities of the water
entitlements for the parties and the Tribes, Arizona v. California, 376
U. S. 340, but held that the water rights for the Fort Mojave and Colorado River Reservations would be subject to appropriate adjustment by
future agreement or decree in the event the respective reservations'
disputed boundaries were finally determined, id., at 345. The Court's
1979 supplemental decree again deferred resolution of reservation
boundary disputes and allied water rights claims. Arizona v. California, 439 U. S. 419, 421 (per curiam). In Arizona v. California, 460
U. S. 605 (Arizona II), the Court concluded, among other things, that
various administrative actions taken by the Secretary of the Interior,
including his 1978 order recognizing the entitlement of the Quechan
Tribe (Tribe) to the disputed boundary lands of the Fort Yuma Reservation did not constitute final determinations of reservation boundaries
for purposes of the 1964 decree. Id., at 636-638. The Court also held
in Arizona II that certain lands within undisputed reservation boundaries, for which the United States had not sought water rights in
Arizona I--the so-called "omitted lands"--were not entitled to water
under res judicata principles. 460 U. S., at 626. The Court's 1984 supplemental decree again declared that water rights for all five reservations would be subject to appropriate adjustments if the reservations'
boundaries were finally determined. Arizona v. California, 466 U. S.

144, 145. In 1987, the Ninth Circuit dismissed, on grounds of the
United States' sovereign immunity, a suit by California state agencies
that could have finally determined the reservations' boundaries. This
Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's judgment by an equally divided vote.

The present phase of the litigation concerns claims by the Tribe and
the United States on the Tribe's behalf for increased water rights for
the Fort Yuma Reservation. These claims rest on the contention that
the Fort Yuma Reservation encompasses some 25,000 acres of disputed
boundary lands not attributed to that reservation in earlier stages of
the litigation. The land in question was purportedly ceded to the
United States under an 1893 Agreement with the Tribe. In 1936, the
Department of the Interior's Solicitor Margold issued an opinion stating
that, under the 1893 Agreement, the Tribe had unconditionally ceded
the lands. The Margold Opinion remained the Federal Government's
position for 42 years. In 1946, Congress enacted the Indian Claims
Commission Act, establishing a tribunal with power to decide tribes'
claims against the Government. The Tribe brought before the Commission an action, which has come to be known as Docket No. 320, challenging the 1893 Agreement on two mutually exclusive grounds: (1) that it
was void, in which case the United States owed the Tribe damages essentially for trespass, and (2) that it constituted an uncompensated taking of tribal lands. In 1976, the Commission transferred Docket No. 320
to the Court of Claims. In the meantime, the Tribe asked the Interior
Department to reconsider the Margold Opinion. Ultimately, in a 1978
Secretarial Order, the Department changed its position and confirmed
the Tribe's entitlement to most of the disputed lands. A few months
after this Court decided in Arizona II that the 1978 Secretarial Order
did not constitute a final determination of reservation boundaries, the
United States and the Tribe entered into a settlement of Docket No. 320,
which the Court of Claims approved and entered as its final judgment.
Under the settlement, the United States agreed to pay the Tribe $15
million in full satisfaction of the Tribe's Docket No. 320 claims, and the
Tribe agreed that it would not further assert those claims against the
Government. In 1989, this Court granted the motion of Arizona, California, and two municipal water districts (State parties) to reopen the
1964 decree to determine whether the Fort Yuma, Colorado River, and
Fort Mojave Reservations were entitled to claim additional boundary
lands and, if so, additional water rights. The State parties assert here
that the Fort Yuma claims of the Tribe and the United States are
precluded by Arizona I and by the Claims Court consent judgment in
Docket No. 320. The Special Master has prepared a report recommending that the Court reject the first ground for preclusion but accept the
second. The State parties have filed exceptions to the Special Master's

first recommendation, and the United States and the Tribe have filed
exceptions to the second. The Master has also recommended approval
of the parties' proposed settlements of claims for additional water for
the Fort Mojave and Colorado River Reservations, and has submitted a
proposed supplemental decree to effectuate the parties' accords.

Held:

1. In view of the State parties' failure to raise the preclusion argument earlier in the litigation, despite ample opportunity and cause to do
so, the claims of the United States and the Tribe to increased water
rights for the disputed boundary lands of the Fort Yuma Reservation
are not foreclosed by Arizona I. According to the State parties, those
claims are precluded by the finality rationale this Court employed in
dismissing the "omitted lands" claims in Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 620-
621, 626-627, because the United States could have raised the Fort
Yuma Reservation boundary lands claims in Arizona I, but deliberately
decided not to do so. In rejecting this argument, the Special Master
pointed out that the Government did not assert such claims in Arizona I
because, at that time, it was bound to follow the Margold Opinion, under
which the Tribe had no claim to the boundary lands. The Master concluded that the 1978 Secretarial Order, which overruled the Margold
Opinion and recognized the Tribe's beneficial ownership of the boundary
lands, was a circumstance not known in 1964, one that warranted an
exception to the application of res judicata doctrine. In so concluding,
the Special Master relied on an improper ground: The 1978 Secretarial
Order does not qualify as a previously unknown circumstance that can
overcome otherwise applicable preclusion principles. That order did
not change the underlying facts in dispute; it simply embodied one party's changed view of the import of unchanged facts. However, the
Court agrees with the United States and the Tribe that the State parties' preclusion defense is inadmissible. The State parties did not raise
the defense in 1978 in response to the United States' motion for a supplemental decree granting additional water rights for the Fort Yuma
Reservation or in 1982 when Arizona II was briefed and argued. Unaccountably, the State parties first raised their res judicata plea in 1989,
when they initiated the current round of proceedings. While preclusion
rules are not strictly applicable in the context of a single ongoing original action, the principles upon which they rest should inform the Court's
decision. Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 619. Those principles rank res judicata an affirmative defense ordinarily lost if not timely raised. See Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). The Court disapproves the notion that a party
may wake up and effectively raise a defense years after the first opportunity to raise it so long as the party was (though no fault of anyone

Syllabus
else) in the dark until its late awakening. Nothing in Arizona II supports the State parties' assertion that the Court expressly recognized
the possibility that future Fort Yuma boundary lands claims might be
precluded. 460 U. S., at 638, distinguished. Of large significance, this
Court's 1979 and 1984 supplemental decrees anticipated that the disputed boundary issues for all five reservations, including Fort Yuma,
would be "finally determined" in some forum, not by preclusion but on
the merits. The State parties themselves stipulated to the terms of the
1979 supplemental decree and appear to have litigated the Arizona II
proceedings on the understanding that the boundary disputes should be
resolved on the merits, see, e. g., id., at 634. Finally, the Court rejects
the State parties' argument that this Court should now raise the preclusion question sua sponte. The special circumstances in which such judicial initiative might be appropriate are not present here. See United
States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U. S. 371, 432 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).
Pp. 406-413.

2. The claims of the United States and the Tribe to increased water
rights for the disputed boundary lands of the Fort Yuma Reservation
are not precluded by the consent judgment in Docket No. 320. The
Special Master agreed with the State parties' assertion to the contrary.
He concluded that, because the settlement extinguished the Tribe's
claim to title in the disputed lands, the United States and the Tribe
cannot seek additional water rights based on the Tribe's purported beneficial ownership of those lands. Under standard preclusion doctrine,
the Master's recommendation cannot be sustained. As between the
Tribe and the United States, the settlement indeed had, and was intended to have, claim-preclusive effect. But settlements ordinarily lack
issue-preclusive effect. This differentiation is grounded in basic res judicata doctrine. The general rule is that issue preclusion attaches only
when an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final
judgment. See United States v. International Building Co., 345 U. S.
502, 505-506. The State parties assert that common-law principles of
issue preclusion do not apply in the special context of Indian land claims.
They maintain that the Indian Claims Commission Act created a special
regime of statutory preclusion. This Court need not decide whether
some consent judgments in that distinctive context might bar a tribe
from asserting title even in discrete litigation against third parties, for
the 1983 settlement of Docket No. 320 plainly could not qualify as such
a judgment. Not only was the issue of ownership of the disputed
boundary lands not actually litigated and decided in Docket No. 320, but,
most notably, the Tribe proceeded on alternative and mutually exclusive
theories of recovery, taking and trespass. The consent judgment embraced all of the Tribe's claims with no election by the Tribe of one

theory over the other. The Court need not accept the United States'
invitation to look behind the consent judgment at presettlement stipulations and memoranda purportedly demonstrating that the judgment was
grounded on the parties' shared view, after the 1978 Secretarial Order,
that the disputed lands belong to the Tribe. Because the settlement
was ambiguous as between mutually exclusive theories of recovery, the
consent judgment is too opaque to serve as a foundation for issue preclusion. Pp. 413-418.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
In the latest chapter of this long-litigated original-jurisdiction case, the Quechan Tribe (Tribe) and the United

States on the Tribe's behalf assert claims for increased rightsto water from the Colorado River. These claims are based
on the contention that the Fort Yuma (Quechan) Indian Res-ervation encompasses some 25,000 acres of disputed boundary lands not attributed to that reservation in earlier stagesof the litigation. In this decision, we resolve a threshold
question regarding these claims to additional water rights:Are the claims precluded by this Court's prior decision in
Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546 (1963) (Arizona I), orby a consent judgment entered by the United States Claims
Court in 1983? The Special Master has prepared a reportrecommending that the Court reject the first ground for preclusion but accept the second. We reject both grounds forpreclusion and remand the case to the Special Master for
consideration of the claims for additional water rights appur-tenant to the disputed boundary lands.

I
This litigation began in 1952 when Arizona invoked ouroriginal jurisdiction to settle a dispute with California over

the extent of each State's right to use water from the Colo-rado River system. Nevada intervened, seeking a determination of its water rights, and Utah and New Mexico werejoined as defendants. The United States intervened and
sought water rights on behalf of various federal establish-ments, including five Indian reservations: the Chemehuevi
Indian Reservation, the Cocopah Indian Reservation, theFort Yuma (Quechan) Indian Reservation, the Colorado
River Indian Reservation, and the Fort Mojave Indian Res-ervation. The Court appointed Simon Rifkind as Special
Master.The first round of the litigation culminated in our opinion
in Arizona I. We agreed with Special Master Rifkind that

530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
398 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
the apportionment of Colorado River water was governed bythe Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, 43 U. S. C. $ 617

et seq., and by contracts entered into by the Secretary of theInterior pursuant to the Act. We further agreed that the
United States had reserved water rights for the five reserva-tions under the doctrine of

Winters v. United States, 207
U. S. 564 (1908). See Arizona I, 373 U. S., at 565, 599-601.
Because the Tribes' water rights were effective as of thetime each reservation was created, the rights were considered present perfected rights and given priority under theAct.

Id., at 600. We also agreed with the Master that the
reservations' water rights should be based on the amount of
practicably irrigable acreage on each reservation and sustained his findings as to the relevant acreage for each reservation. Ibid. Those findings were incorporated in our decree of March 9, 1964, which specified the quantities and
priorities of the water entitlements for the States, the
United States, and the Tribes. Arizona v. California, 376
U. S. 340. The Court rejected as premature, however, Master Rifkind's recommendation to determine the disputed
boundaries of the Fort Mojave and Colorado River Indian
Reservations; we ordered, instead, that water rights for
those two reservations "shall be subject to appropriate adjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in the event
that the boundaries of the respective reservations are finally
determined." Id., at 345.

In 1978, the United States and the State parties jointly
moved this Court to enter a supplemental decree identifying
present perfected rights to the use of mainstream water in
each State and their priority dates. The Tribes then filed
motions to intervene, and the United States ultimately
joined the Tribes in moving for additional water rights for
the five reservations. Again, the Court deferred resolution
of reservation boundary disputes and allied water rights
claims. The supplemental decree we entered in 1979 set out
the water rights and priority dates for the five reservations

Opinion of the Court
under the 1964 decree, but added that the rights for all fivereservations (including the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation

at issue here) "shall continue to be subject to appropriateadjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in the
event that the boundaries of the respective reservations arefinally determined."

Arizona v. California, 439 U. S. 419,
421 (per curiam). The Court then appointed Senior Circuit
Judge Elbert P. Tuttle as Special Master and referred to himthe Tribes' motions to intervene and other pending matters.

Master Tuttle issued a report recommending that theTribes be permitted to intervene, and concluding that various administrative actions taken by the Secretary of the
Interior constituted "final determinations" of reservation
boundaries for purposes of allocating water rights under the
1964 decree. (Those administrative actions included a 1978
Secretarial Order, discussed in greater detail infra, at 404-
405, which recognized the Quechan Tribe's entitlement to
the disputed boundary lands of the Fort Yuma Reservation.)
Master Tuttle also concluded that certain lands within the
undisputed reservation boundaries but for which the United
States had not sought water rights in Arizona I--the socalled "omitted lands"--had in fact been practicably irrigable
at the time of Arizona I and were thus entitled to water.
On these grounds, Master Tuttle recommended that the
Court reopen the 1964 decree to award the Tribes additional
water rights.

In Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983) (Arizona
II), the Court permitted the Tribes to intervene, but otherwise rejected Master Tuttle's recommendations. The Secretary's determinations did not qualify as "final determinations" of reservation boundaries, we ruled, because the
States, agencies, and private water users had not had an opportunity to obtain judicial review of those determinations.
Id., at 636-637. In that regard, we noted that California
state agencies had initiated an action in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of California chal530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lenging the Secretary's decisions, and that the United Stateshad moved to dismiss that action on various grounds, including sovereign immunity. "There will be time enough," theCourt stated, "if any of these grounds for dismissal are sustained and not overturned on appellate review, to determinewhether the boundary issues foreclosed by such action are
nevertheless open for litigation in this Court." Id., at 638.
The Court also held that the United States was barred fromseeking water rights for the lands omitted from presentation

in the proceedings leading to Arizona I; "principles of resjudicata," we said, "advise against reopening the calculation
of the amount of practicably irrigable acreage." 460 U. S.,
at 626. In 1984, in another supplemental decree, the Court
again declared that water rights for all five reservations
"shall be subject to appropriate adjustments by agreement
or decree of this Court in the event that the boundaries of
the respective reservations are finally determined." Arizona v. California, 466 U. S. 144, 145.

The District Court litigation proceeded with the participation of eight parties: the United States, the States of Arizona
and California, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the Quechan, Fort Mojave, and Colorado River Indian Tribes. The
District Court rejected the United States' sovereign immunity defense; taking up the Fort Mojave Reservation matter first, the court voided the Secretary's determination of

that reservation's boundaries. Metropolitan Water Dist. of
S. Cal. v. United States, 628 F. Supp. 1018 (SD Cal. 1986).
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, accepted the United States' plea of sovereign immunity, and
on that ground reversed and remanded with instructions to
dismiss the entire case. Specifically, the Court of Appeals
held that the Quiet Title Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2409a, preserved
the United States' sovereign immunity from suits challenging the United States' title "to trust or restricted Indian
lands," $ 2409a(a), and therefore blocked recourse to the Dis530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

We granted certiorari and affirmed the Ninth Circuit's judg-ment by an equally divided Court. California v. United
States, 490 U. S. 920 (1989) (per curiam).The dismissal of the District Court action dispelled any
expectation that a "final determination" of reservationboundaries would occur in that forum. The State parties
then moved to reopen the 1964 decree, asking the Court todetermine whether the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation and
two other reservations were entitled to claim additionalboundary lands and, if so, additional water rights. Neither
the United States nor the Tribes objected to the reopeningof the decree, and the Court granted the motion.

of the third Special Master, Robert McKay, the Court ap-pointed Frank J. McGarr as Special Master. Special Master
McGarr has now filed a report and recommendation (McGarrReport), a full understanding of which requires a discussion
of issues and events specific to the Fort Yuma Indian Reser-vation. We now turn to those issues and events.

II
The specific dispute before us has its roots in an 1884 Exec-utive Order signed by President Chester A. Arthur, designating approximately 72 square miles of land along theColorado River in California as the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation (Reservation) for the benefit of the Quechan Tribe.The Tribe, which had traditionally engaged in farming, offered to cede its rights to a portion of the Reservation to theUnited States in exchange for allotments of irrigated land to
individual Indians. In 1893, the Secretary of the Interiorconcluded an agreement with the Tribe (1893 Agreement),
which Congress ratified in 1894. The 1893 Agreement pro-vided for the Tribe's cession of a 25,000-acre tract of boundary lands on the Reservation. Language in the agreement,

530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
however, could be read to condition the cession on the per-formance by the United States of certain obligations, including construction within three years of an irrigation canal,allotment of irrigated land to individual Indians, sale of certain lands to raise revenues for canal construction, and open-ing of certain lands to the public domain.

Doubts about the validity and effect of the 1893 Agree-ment arose as early as 1935. In that year the construction
of the All-American Canal, which prompted the interstatedispute in

Arizona I, see 373 U. S., at 554-555, also sparkeda controversy concerning the Fort Yuma Reservation.

When the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclama-tion sought to route the canal through the Reservation, the
Department's Indian Office argued that the Bureau had topay compensation to the Tribe for the right-of-way. The
Secretary of the Interior submitted the matter to the De-partment's Solicitor, Nathan Margold. In 1936, Solicitor
Margold issued an opinion (Margold Opinion) stating that,under the 1893 Agreement, the Tribe had unconditionally
ceded the lands in question to the United States. 1 Dept. ofInterior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating to Indian Affairs
596, 600 (No. M-28198, Jan. 8, 1936). The Margold Opinionremained the position of the Federal Government for 42
years.In 1946, Congress enacted the Indian Claims Commission
Act, 60 Stat. 1049, 25 U. S. C. $ 70 et seq. (1976 ed.), establish-ing an Article I tribunal with power to decide claims of
Indian tribes against the United States.1 See generally

Indian claims solely by the payment of compensation. Section 2 of the

principally on two mutually exclusive grounds for relief.First, the Tribe alleged that the 1893 Agreement was obtained through fraud, coercion, and/or inadequate consider-ation, rendering it "wholly nugatory." Petition for Loss of

Id., at || 31. In either event, the Tribe claimed continuingtitle to the disputed lands and sought damages essentially

for trespass. Alternatively, the Tribe alleged that the 1893Agreement was contractually valid but constituted an uncompensated taking of tribal lands, an appropriation of landsfor unconscionable consideration, and/or a violation of standards of fair and honorable dealing, for which $$ 2(3)-(5) of theAct authorized recovery.

Id., at |||| 19, 22, 25. According tothis theory of recovery, the 1893 Agreement had indeed

vested in the United States unconditional title to the disClaims, $ 70s(b), and, if upheld, were submitted to Congress for payment,

$ 70u. Section 15 authorized the Attorney General to represent the
United States before the Commission and, "with the approval of the
Commission, to compromise any claim presented to the Commission." 25
U. S. C. $ 70n (1976 ed.). The Act provided that such compromises "shall
be submitted by the Commission to the Congress as a part of its report
as provided in section 70t of this title in the same manner as final determinations of the Commission, and shall be subject to the provisions of section
70u of this title." Ibid. Section 22(a) of the Act provided that "[t]he

puted lands, and the Tribe sought damages as compensationfor that taking. During the more than quarter-century of

litigation in Docket No. 320, the Tribe vacillated betweenthese two grounds for relief, sometimes emphasizing one and
sometimes the other. See Quechan Tribe of Fort Yuma
Reservation v. United States, 26 Ind. Cl. Comm'n 15 (1971),
reprinted in Brief for United States in Support of Exception,
at 29a-34a.The Commission conducted a trial on liability, but stayed

further proceedings in 1970 because legislation had been pro-posed in Congress that would have restored the disputed
lands to the Tribe. The legislation was not enacted, and the
Commission vacated the stay. In 1976, the Commission
transferred the matter to the Court of Claims.

In the meantime, the Tribe had asked the Department of
the Interior to reconsider its 1936 Margold Opinion regarding the 1893 Agreement. In 1977, Interior Solicitor Scott
Austin concluded, in accord with the 1936 opinion, that the
1893 Agreement was valid and that the cession of the disputed lands had been unconditional. Opinion of the Solicitor, No. M-36886 (Jan. 18, 1977), 84 I. D. 1 (1977) (Austin
Opinion). It soon became clear both to the Tribe and to interested Members of Congress, however, that the Austin
Opinion had provoked controversy within the Department,
and, after the election of President Carter, the Department
revisited the issue and reversed course. In 1978, without
notice to the parties, Solicitor Leo Krulitz issued an opinion
concluding that the 1893 Agreement had provided for a conditional cession of the disputed lands, that the conditions had
not been met by the United States, and that "[t]itle to the
subject property is held by the United States in trust for the
Quechan Tribe." Opinion of the Solicitor, No. M-36908 (Jan.
2, 1979), 86 I. D. 3, 22 (1979) (Krulitz Opinion). On December 20, 1978, the Secretary of the Interior issued a Secretarial Order adopting the Krulitz Opinion and confirming

the Tribe's entitlement to the disputed lands, with the ex530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
press exception of certain lands that the United States hadacquired pursuant to Act of Congress or had conveyed to

third parties.The 1978 Secretarial Order caused the United States to
change its position both in Docket No. 320, which was stillpending in the Claims Court, and in the present litigation.
Because the Secretarial Order amounted to an admission
that the 1893 Agreement had been ineffective to transfertitle and that the Tribe enjoyed beneficial ownership of the

disputed boundary lands, the United States no longer op-posed the Tribe's claim for trespass in Docket No. 320. In
the present litigation, the Secretarial Order both prompted
the United States to file a water rights claim for the affected
boundary lands and provided the basis for the Tribe's intervention to assert a similar, albeit larger, water rights claim.
See Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 632-633. Those water rights
claims are the subject of the current proceedings.

In August 1983, a few months after this Court decided in
Arizona II that the 1978 Secretarial Order did not constitute
a final determination of reservation boundaries, see supra,
at 399-400, the United States and the Tribe entered into
a settlement of Docket No. 320, which the Court of Claims
approved and entered as its final judgment. Under the
terms of that settlement, the United States agreed to pay
the Tribe $15 million in full satisfaction of "all rights, claims,
or demands which plaintiff [i. e., the Tribe] has asserted or
could have asserted with respect to the claims in Docket
320." Final Judgment, Docket No. 320 (Aug. 11, 1983). The
judgment further provided that "plaintiff shall be barred
thereby from asserting any further rights, claims, or demands against the defendant and any future action on the
claims encompassed on Docket 320." Ibid. The United
States and the Tribe also stipulated that the "final judgment
is based on a compromise and settlement and shall not be
construed as an admission by either party for the purposes
of precedent or argument in any other case." Ibid. Both

the Tribe and the United States continue to recognize theTribe's entitlement to the disputed boundary lands.

III
Master McGarr has issued a series of orders culminatingin the report and recommendation now before the Court.

He has recommended that the Court reject the claims of theUnited States and the Tribe seeking additional water rights
for the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. The Master re-jected the State parties' contention that this Court's

ArizonaI decision precludes the United States and the Tribe from

seeking water rights for the disputed boundary lands. Heconcluded, however, that the United States and the Tribe are
precluded from pursuing those claims by operation of the1983 Claims Court consent judgment. The State parties
have filed an exception to the first of these preclusion recom-mendations, and the United States and the Tribe have filed
exceptions to the second. In Part III-A, infra, we considerthe exception filed by the State parties, and in Part III-B
we address the exceptions filed by the United States and theTribe. The Special Master has also recommended that the
Court approve the parties' proposed settlements respectingthe Fort Mojave and Colorado River Indian Reservations.
No party has filed an exception to those recommendations;we address them in Part III-C,

infra.

A
The States of Arizona and California, the Coachella ValleyWater District, and the Metropolitan Water District of

Southern California (State parties) argued before SpecialMaster McGarr, and repeat before this Court, that the water
rights claims associated with the disputed boundary landsof the Fort Yuma Reservation are precluded by the finality
rationale this Court employed in dismissing the "omittedlands" claims in

Arizona II. See supra, at 399-400. Ac-cording to the State parties, the United States could have

Opinion of the Court
raised a boundary lands claim for the Fort Yuma Reservation
in the Arizona I proceedings based on facts known at that
time, just as it did for the Fort Mojave and Colorado River
Reservations, but deliberately decided not to do so, just as
it did with respect to the "omitted lands." In Arizona II,
this Court rejected the United States' claim for water rights
for the "omitted lands," emphasizing that "[c]ertainty of
rights is particularly important with respect to water rights
in the Western United States" and noting "the strong interest in finality in this case." 460 U. S., at 620. Observing that the 1964 decree determined "the extent of irrigable
acreage within the uncontested boundaries of the reservations," id., at 621, n. 12, the Court refused to reconsider
issues "fully and fairly litigated 20 years ago," id., at 621.
The Court concomitantly held that the Tribes were bound
by the United States' representation of them in Arizona I.
460 U. S., at 626-627.

The Special Master rejected the State parties' preclusion
argument. He brought out first the evident reason why the
United States did not assert water rights claims for the Fort
Yuma Reservation boundary lands in Arizona I. At that
point in time, the United States was bound to follow the 1936
Margold Opinion, see supra, at 402, which maintained that
the Tribe had no claim to those lands. "[I]t is clear," the
Master stated, "that the later Secretary of the Interior opinion arbitrarily changing [the Margold] decision was a circumstance not known in 1964, thus constituting an exception to
the application of the rule of res adjudicata." Special Master McGarr Memorandum Opinion and Order No. 4, pp. 6-7
(Sept. 6, 1991). Characterizing the question as "close," the
Master went on to conclude that "the Tribe is not precluded
from asserting water rights based on boundary land claims
on [sic] this proceeding, because although the U. S. on behalf
of the Tribe failed to assert such claims in the proceeding
leading to the 1964 decree, a later and then unknown circum530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
stance bars the application of the doctrine of res judicata tothis issue." Id., at 7.

While the Special Master correctly recognized the rele-vance of the Margold Opinion to the litigating stance of the
United States, he ultimately relied on an improper ground inrejecting the State parties' preclusion argument. The Department of the Interior's 1978 Secretarial Order recogniz-ing the Tribe's beneficial ownership of the boundary lands,
see supra, at 404-405, does not qualify as a "later and thenunknown circumstance" that can overcome otherwise applicable preclusion principles. The 1978 Order did not changethe underlying facts in dispute; it simply embodied one party's changed view of the import of unchanged facts. More-over, the Tribe can hardly claim to have been surprised by
the Government's shift in assessment of the boundary landsownership question, for the Tribe had been advocating just
such a shift for decades.The United States and the Tribe, however, urge other
grounds on which to reject the State parties' argumentregarding the preclusive effect of Arizona I. The United
States and the Tribe maintain that the preclusion rationalethe Court applied to the "omitted lands" in Arizona II is not
equally applicable to the disputed boundary lands,2 and that,in any event, the State parties have forfeited their preclusion
defense. We agree that the State parties' preclusion de2 The United States and the Tribe point to the holding in Arizona I that
Special Master Rifkind had erred in prematurely considering boundary
lands claims relating to the Fort Mojave and Colorado River Reservations,
see 373 U. S., at 601; they contend that consideration of the Fort Yuma
Reservation boundaries would have been equally premature. They further stress that in Arizona II we held the omitted lands claims precluded
because we resisted "reopen[ing] an adjudication . . . to reconsider whether
initial factual determinations were correctly made," 460 U. S., at 623-624;
in contrast, they maintain, the present claims turn on the validity of the
1893 Agreement and the 1978 Secretarial Order, questions of law not

addressed in prior proceedings.

Opinion of the Court
fense is inadmissible at this late date, and therefore we donot reach the merits of that plea. The State parties could

have raised the defense in 1979 in response to the UnitedStates' motion for a supplemental decree granting additional
water rights for the Fort Yuma Reservation. The Stateparties did not do so then, nor did they raise the objection
in 1982 when Arizona II was briefed and argued.3 Unac-countably, they raised the preclusion argument for the first
time in 1989, when they initiated the current round of pro-ceedings. See Exception and Brief for State Parties 16; Motion of State Parties to Reopen Decree in Arizona v. California, O. T. 1989, No. 8 Orig., p. 6, n. 2. The State parties hadevery opportunity, and every incentive, to press their current

preclusion argument at earlier stages in the litigation, yetfailed to do so.

4

3 Noting that in Arizona II we "encouraged the parties to assert their
legal claims and defenses in another forum," The Chief Justice concludes that the Court probably would have declined to resolve the preclusion issue at that stage of the case even had the State parties raised it
then. Post, at 423 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).
One can only wonder why this should be so. If this Court had held in
Arizona II that the United States and the Tribe were precluded from
litigating their boundary lands claims, it would have been pointless for the
Court to encourage pursuit of those claims "in another forum"; further
assertion of the claims in any forum would have been barred. In any
event, a party generally forfeits an affirmative defense by failing to raise
it even if the relevant proceeding is ultimately resolved on other grounds.

4 The dissent's observation that "the only `pleadings' in this case were

filed in the 1950's," post, at 422, is beside the point. The State parties
could have properly raised the preclusion defense as early as February
1979, in their response to the United States' motion for modification of the
decree, yet did not do so. See Response of the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada and the Other California Defendants to the Motion of the
United States for Modification of Decree, O. T. 1978, No. 8 Orig. Alternatively, it was open to the State parties to seek leave to file a supplemental
pleading "setting forth . . . occurrences or events which have happened
since the date of the pleading sought to be amended." Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 15(d). In such a supplemental pleading, and in compliance with Rule

410 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
"[W]hile the technical rules of preclusion are not strictlyapplicable [in the context of a single ongoing original action],

the principles upon which these rules are founded should in-form our decision." Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 619. Those
principles rank res judicata an affirmative defense ordinarilylost if not timely raised. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c).
Counsel for the State parties conceded at oral argument that"no preclusion argument was made with respect to boundary
lands" in the proceedings leading up to Arizona II, and that"after this Court's decision in

Arizona II and after theCourt's later decision in [Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S.

110 (1983)], the light finally dawned on the State parties thatthere was a valid preclusion--or res judicata argument here
with respect to Fort Yuma." Tr. of Oral Arg. 46-47. Wedisapprove the notion that a party may wake up because a
"light finally dawned," years after the first opportunity toraise a defense, and effectively raise it so long as the party
was (though no fault of anyone else) in the dark until itslate awakening.

The State parties assert that our prior pronouncements inthis case have expressly recognized the possibility that future boundary lands claims for the Fort Yuma Reservationmight be precluded. If anything, the contrary is true.
Nothing in the Arizona II decision hints that the Court be-lieved the boundary lands issue might ultimately be held precluded. Rather, the Court expressly found it "necessary todecide whether any or all of these boundary disputes have
been `finally determined' within the meaning of Article
8(c), the preclusion defense could have been raised. No such supplemental pleading was ever presented, and by 1989 a reasonable time to do so
had surely expired.

The State parties' tardiness in raising their preclusion defense is hard
to account for, while the United States' decision not to assert claims for
the disputed boundary lands until 1978 can at least be explained by the
continued vitality of the Margold Opinion, see supra, at 402. It is puzzling that the dissent should go to such lengths to excuse the former delay
while relentlessly condemning the latter.

Opinion of the Court
II(D)(5) . . . ." 460 U. S., at 631 (emphasis added). That
Arizona II contains no discussion of preclusion with respect
to the disputed lands is hardly surprising, given that theState parties neglected to raise that issue until six years

later.The Court did note in

Arizona II that in the District
Court proceedings the United States had asserted defenses
based on "lack of standing, the absence of indispensable par-ties, sovereign immunity, and the applicable statute of limitations," and added that "[t]here will be time enough, if any of
these grounds for dismissal are sustained and not overturned on appellate review, to determine whether the boundary issues foreclosed by such [lower court] action are nevertheless open for litigation in this Court." 460 U. S., at 638
(emphasis added). This passage, however, is most sensibly
read to convey that the defenses just mentioned--standing,
indispensable parties, sovereign immunity, and the statute of
limitations--would not necessarily affect renewed litigation
in this Court. The passage contains no acknowledgment,
express or implied, of a lurking preclusion issue stemming
from our Arizona I disposition.

Moreover, and of large significance, the 1979 and 1984 supplemental decrees anticipated that the disputed boundary issues for all five reservations, including the Fort Yuma Reservation, would be "finally determined" in some forum, not by
preclusion but on the merits. See 1984 Supplemental Decree, Art. II(D)(5), Arizona v. California, 466 U. S., at 145
(Water rights for all five reservations "shall be subject to
appropriate adjustments by agreement or decree of this
Court in the event that the boundaries of the respective
reservations are finally determined."); 1979 Supplemental
Decree, Art. II(D)(5), Arizona v. California, 439 U. S., at
421 (same).

The State parties themselves stipulated to the terms of
the supplemental decree we entered in 1979. They also appear to have litigated the Arizona II proceedings on the un530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
412 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
derstanding that the boundary disputes should be resolvedon the merits. See 460 U. S., at 634 ("[The State parties]

argued . . . that the boundary controversies were ripe forjudicial review, and they urged the Special Master to receive
evidence, hear legal arguments, and resolve each of theboundary disputes, but only for the limited purpose of establishing additional Indian water rights, if any."); Report of
Special Master Tuttle, O. T. 1981, No. 8 Orig., p. 57 (describ-ing the State parties' contention "that the boundaries [of all

five reservations] have not been finally determined and thatI should make a de novo determination of the boundaries for
recommendation to the Court"). As late as 1988, the State
parties asked the Court to appoint a new Special Master and
direct him "to conclude his review of the boundary issues
as expeditiously as possible and to submit a recommended
decision to the Court." Brief for Petitioners in California
v. United States, O. T. 1987, No. 87-1165, p. 49.

Finally, the State parties argue that even if they earlier
failed to raise the preclusion defense, this Court should raise
it now sua sponte. Judicial initiative of this sort might be
appropriate in special circumstances. Most notably, "if a
court is on notice that it has previously decided the issue
presented, the court may dismiss the action sua sponte, even
though the defense has not been raised. This result is fully
consistent with the policies underlying res judicata: it is not
based solely on the defendant's interest in avoiding the burdens of twice defending a suit, but is also based on the avoidance of unnecessary judicial waste." United States v. Sioux
Nation, 448 U. S. 371, 432 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)
(citations omitted). That special circumstance is not present
here: While the State parties contend that the Fort Yuma
boundary dispute could have been decided in Arizona I, this
Court plainly has not "previously decided the issue presented." Therefore we do not face the prospect of redoing
a matter once decided. Where no judicial resources have
been spent on the resolution of a question, trial courts must

Opinion of the Court
be cautious about raising a preclusion bar sua sponte,
thereby eroding the principle of party presentation so basic
to our system of adjudication.

In view of the State parties' failure to raise the preclusion
argument earlier in the litigation, despite ample opportunity
and cause to do so, we hold that the claims of the United
States and the Tribe to increased water rights for the disputed boundary lands of the Fort Yuma Reservation are not
foreclosed by our decision in Arizona I.

B
The State parties also assert that the instant water rights
claims are precluded by the 1983 consent judgment in the
Claims Court proceeding, Docket No. 320. Special Master
McGarr agreed, noting the consent judgment's declaration
that the Tribe would "be barred thereby from asserting any
further rights, claims or demands against the defendant and
any future action encompassed on docket no. 320." See Special Master McGarr Memorandum Opinion and Order No. 4,
at 9-10. On reconsideration, the Special Master provided a
fuller account of his recommendation. The settlement, he
concluded, had extinguished the Tribe's claim to title in the
disputed boundary lands, vesting that title in the United
States against all the world: "The only viable basis for a
damage or trespass claim [in Docket No. 320] was that the
1893 taking was illegal and that title therefore remained
with the Tribe. When the Tribe accepted money in settlement of this claim, it relinquished its claim to title." Id.,
No. 7, at 5 (May 5, 1992). See also id., No. 13, at 3 (Apr. 13,
1993) ("[T]he relinquishment of all future claims regarding
the subject matter of Docket No. 320 in exchange for a sum
of money extinguished the Tribe's title in the subject
lands . . . ."). Because the settlement extinguished the
Tribe's title to the disputed boundary lands, the Master reasoned, the United States and the Tribe cannot now seek addi530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
414 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
tional water rights based on the Tribe's purported beneficialownership of those lands.

Under standard preclusion doctrine, the Master's recom-mendation cannot be sustained. As already noted, the express terms of the consent judgment in Docket No. 320barred the Tribe and the United States from asserting
against each other any claim or defense they raised or could
have raised in that action. See supra, at 405. As betweenthe parties to Docket No. 320, then, the settlement indeed

had, and was intended to have, claim-preclusive effect--amatter the United States and the Tribe readily concede.
Exception and Brief for United States 36; Exception and
Brief for Quechan Indian Tribe 20. But settlements ordinarily occasion no issue preclusion (sometimes called collateral estoppel), unless it is clear, as it is not here, that the
parties intend their agreement to have such an effect. "In
most circumstances, it is recognized that consent agreements
ordinarily are intended to preclude any further litigation on
the claim presented but are not intended to preclude further
litigation on any of the issues presented. Thus consent
judgments ordinarily support claim preclusion but not issue
preclusion." 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure $ 4443, pp. 384-385 (1981). This differentiation is grounded in basic res judicata doctrine. It is
the general rule that issue preclusion attaches only "[w]hen
an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined
by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment." Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 27, p. 250 (1982). "In the case of a judgment entered
by confession, consent, or default, none of the issues is actually litigated. Therefore, the rule of this Section [describing
issue preclusion's domain] does not apply with respect to any
issue in a subsequent action." Id., comment e, at 257.

This Court's decision in United States v. International
Building Co., 345 U. S. 502 (1953), is illustrative. In 1942,
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed deficiencies

530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
against a taxpayer for the taxable years 1933, 1938, and 1939,alleging that the taxpayer had claimed an excessive basis

for depreciation. Id., at 503. After the taxpayer filed forbankruptcy, however, the Commissioner and the taxpayer
filed stipulations in the pending Tax Court proceedings stat-ing that there was no deficiency for the taxable years
in question, and the Tax Court entered a formal decision tothat effect.

Id., at 503-504. In 1948, the Commissioner as-sessed deficiencies for the years 1943, 1944, and 1945, and the

taxpayer defended on the ground that the earlier Tax Courtdecision was preclusive on the issue of the correct basis for
depreciation. We disagreed, holding that the Tax Court de-cision, entered pursuant to the parties' stipulations, did not
accomplish an "estoppel by judgment," i. e., it had no issue-preclusive effect:

"We conclude that the decisions entered by the TaxCourt for the years 1933, 1938, and 1939 were only a
pro forma acceptance by the Tax Court of an agreementbetween the parties to settle their controversy for reasons undisclosed . . . . Perhaps, as the Court of Appealsinferred, the parties did agree on the basis for depreciation. Perhaps the settlement was made for a differentreason, for some exigency arising out of the bankruptcy
proceeding. As the case reaches us, we are unable totell whether the agreement of the parties was based on
the merits or on some collateral consideration. Cer-tainly the judgments entered are

res judicata of the taxclaims for the years 1933, 1938, and 1939, whether or not

the basis of the agreements on which they rest reachedthe merits . . . . Estoppel by judgment includes matters
in a second proceeding which were actually presentedand determined in an earlier suit. A judgment entered
with the consent of the parties may involve a determina-tion of questions of fact and law by the court. But unless a showing is made that that was the case, the judg-ment has no greater dignity, so far as collateral estoppel

is concerned, than any judgment entered only as acompromise of the parties." Id., at 505-506 (citations

omitted).
The State parties, perhaps recognizing the infirmity oftheir argument as a matter of standard preclusion doctrine,

assert that common-law principles of issue preclusion do notapply in the special context of Indian land claims. Instead,
they argue, $ 22 of the Indian Claims Commission Act cre-ated a special regime of "statutory preclusion."

5 According

to the State parties, the payment of a Commission judgmentfor claims to aboriginal or trust lands automatically and universally extinguishes title to the Indian lands upon whichthe claim is based and creates a statutory bar to further assertion of claims against either the United States or thirdparties based on the extinguished title. The State parties
point to several decisions of the Ninth Circuit in support ofthis contention. See Reply Brief for State Parties 17 (citing
United States v. Pend Oreille Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1, 926 F. 2d1502 (CA9 1991)); Reply Brief for State Parties 15 (citing

No. 320 plainly could not qualify as such a judgment. Notonly was the issue of ownership of the disputed boundary
lands not actually litigated and decided in Docket No. 320,but, most notably, the Tribe proceeded on alternative and
mutually exclusive theories of recovery. Had the case proceeded to final judgment upon trial, the Tribe might havewon damages for a taking, indicating that title was in the

United States. Alternatively, however, the Tribe mighthave obtained damages for trespass, indicating that title remained in the Tribe. The consent judgment embraced all of
the Tribe's claims. There was no election by the Tribe of
one theory over the other, nor was any such election required
to gain approval for the consent judgment. The Special
Master's assumption that the settlement necessarily and universally relinquished the Tribe's claim to title was thus unwarranted. Certainly, if the $15 million payment constituted a discharge of the Tribe's trespass claim, it would make
scant sense to say that the acceptance of the payment extinguished the Tribe's title. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit
cases cited by the State parties (the correctness of which we
do not address) all involved Indian Claims Commission Act
petitions in which tribes claimed no continuing title, choosing
instead to seek compensation from the United States for the
taking of their lands. See, e. g., Pend Oreille, 926 F. 2d, at
1507-1508; Dann, 873 F. 2d, at 1192, 1194; Gemmill, 535 F. 2d,
at 1149, and n. 6.

The United States invites us to look behind the consent
judgment in Docket No. 320 at presettlement stipulations
and memoranda purportedly demonstrating that the judgment was grounded on the parties' shared view, after the
1978 Secretarial Order, that the disputed lands belong to the
Tribe. We need not accept the Government's invitation.
On the matter of issue preclusion, it suffices to observe that
the settlement was ambiguous as between mutually exclu530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sive theories of recovery. Like the Tax Court settlement inInternational Building Co., then, the consent judgment in

the Tribe's Claims Court action is too opaque to serve as afoundation for issue preclusion. Accordingly, we hold that
the claims of the United States and the Tribe to increasedwater rights for the disputed boundary lands of the Fort
Yuma Reservation are not precluded by the consent judg-ment in Docket No. 320.

C
The Special Master has recommended that the Court ap-prove the parties' proposed settlement of the dispute respecting the Fort Mojave Reservation. The claim to addi-tional water for the Fort Mojave Reservation arises out of a
dispute over the accuracy of a survey of the so-called Hayand Wood Reserve portion of the Reservation. See Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 631-632. The parties agreed to resolvethe matter through an accord that (1) specifies the location of
the disputed boundary; (2) preserves the claims of the partiesregarding title to and jurisdiction over the bed of the last
natural course of the Colorado River within the agreed-uponboundary; (3) awards the Tribe the lesser of an additional
3,022 acre-feet of water or enough water to supply the needsof 468 acres; (4) precludes the United States and the Tribe
from claiming additional water rights from the ColoradoRiver for lands within the Hay and Wood Reserve; and (5)
disclaims any intent to affect any private claims to title to or
jurisdiction over any lands. See McGarr Report 8-9 (July28, 1999). We accept the Master's uncontested recommendation and approve the proposed settlement.The Master has also recommended that the Court approve
the parties' proposed settlement of the dispute respectingthe Colorado River Indian Reservation. The claim to additional water for that reservation stems principally from adispute over whether the reservation boundary is the ambulatory west bank of the Colorado River or a fixed line repre530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
senting a past location of the River. See Arizona II, 460U. S., at 631. The parties agreed to resolve the matter

through an accord that (1) awards the Tribes the lesser of anadditional 2,100 acre-feet of water or enough water to irrigate 315 acres; (2) precludes the United States or the Tribefrom seeking additional reserved water rights from the Colorado River for lands in California; (3) embodies the parties'intent not to adjudicate in these proceedings the correct location of the disputed boundary; (4) preserves the competingclaims of the parties to title to or jurisdiction over the bed
of the Colorado River within the reservation; and (5) pro-vides that the agreement will become effective only if the
Master and the Court approve the settlement. See McGarrReport 9-10. The Master expressed concern that the settlement does not resolve the location of the disputed boundary,but recognized that it did achieve the ultimate aim of determining water rights associated with the disputed boundarylands.

Id., at 10-12, 13-14. We again accept the Master'srecommendation and approve the proposed settlement.

For the foregoing reasons, we remand the outstandingwater rights claims associated with the disputed boundary

6 A group called the West Bank Homeowners Association has filed a
brief amicus curiae objecting to the proposed settlement of water rights
claims respecting the Colorado River Indian Reservation. The Association represents some 650 families who lease property from the United
States within the current boundaries of the Reservation. The Court and
the Special Master have each denied the Association's request to intervene
in these proceedings. See Arizona v. California, 514 U. S. 1081 (1995);
Special Master McGarr Memorandum Opinion and Order No. 17 (Mar. 29,
1995). The Master observed that the Association's members do "not own
land in the disputed area and [the Association] makes no claim to title or
water rights," id., at 2, thus their interests will "not be impeded or

impaired by the outcome of this litigation," id., at 6. Accordingly, we do
not further consider the Association's objections.

422 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
G. The Court shall retain jurisdiction herein to order suchfurther proceedings and enter such supplemental decree as

may be deemed appropriate.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Con-
nor and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dis-senting in part.

I believe that the United States' and the Quechan Tribe'sclaim for additional water rights is barred by the principles
of res judicata, and therefore I dissent. The Special Masterconcluded that an exception to the general preclusion rule
applied and that, therefore, the United States' claim was notbarred. The Court rejects the Special Master's reasoning
but concludes that the State parties' res judicata defense isnot properly before the Court. While I agree that the Special Master erred in finding the 1978 order of the Secretary
of the Interior a "new fact" justifying an exception to the
application of preclusion, I disagree with the Court's refusal
to reach the merits of the State parties' defense.

The Court first concludes that the State parties lost the
defense because they failed to assert it in a timely manner.
While the State parties concede that they did not raise their
claim of res judicata until 1989, it does not automatically follow that the defense is lost. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) provides that res judicata shall be pleaded as an
affirmative defense. But the only "pleadings" in this case
were filed in the 1950's, at which time no claim of res judicata
could have been made. The motions filed by the State parties in 1977 and 1979 were not in any sense comprehensive
pleadings, purporting to set forth all of the claims and defenses of the parties. More importantly, neither Special
Master Tuttle nor this Court focused on the merits of the
boundary dispute during the proceedings in Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983) (Arizona II). Rather, the Master only decided whether the Secretary's order was a final
boundary determination, and, similarly, this Court simply de530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

423Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
termined that the Secretary's order was subject to challengeand encouraged the parties to assert their legal claims and

defenses in another forum. Consequently, it is likely thatthe State parties' res judicata claim would not have been
resolved in Arizona II even if it had been raised.The State parties did expressly raise the defense of res
judicata in their 1989 motion, and neither the United States
nor the Tribe objected to its consideration. The Tribe con-tested the merits of the State parties' res judicata claim and

argued that its water rights' claim was not precluded. Inso doing, the Tribe asserted that the State parties had not
argued res judicata during the Arizona II proceedings.
But neither the Tribe nor the United States contended, in
response to the State parties' motion, that the Court could
not decide the res judicata issue because it was not timely
raised. We granted the motion, and Special Master McGarr
considered the claim on the merits. Under these circumstances, I believe that the State parties did not lose their
res judicata defense by failing to assert it in the earlier
proceedings.

The Court also concludes that this Court's 1979 and 1984
supplemental decrees "anticipated" that the boundary dispute would be finally resolved in some forum. See ante, at
411. To reach this conclusion, the Court reads too much into
the simple language of the supplemental decrees and ignores
language in our Arizona II opinion. The supplemental decrees stated that water rights for the five reservations "shall
be subject to appropriate adjustments by agreement or
decree of this Court in the event that the boundaries of

the respective reservations are finally determined." 1984
Supplemental Decree, Art. II(D)(5), Arizona v. California,
466 U. S. 144, 145 (1984); 1979 Supplemental Decree, Art.
II(D)(5), Arizona v. California, 439 U. S. 419, 421 (1979) (per
curiam). These decrees can best be interpreted as merely
providing that the reservation's water quantity can be adjusted if the boundary changes, without deciding whether

424 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
the boundary relied on in the 1964 decree could be properlychallenged, and without indicating that the boundary necessarily would be "finally determined" at some future point.This reading is supported by language in

Arizona II. In
discussing the pending District Court action, we explained:"We note that the United States has moved to dismiss the

action filed by the agencies based on lack of standing, the
absence of indispensable parties, sovereign immunity, andthe applicable statute of limitations.

There will be time
enough, if any of these grounds for dismissal are sustained
and not overturned on appellate review, to determine
whether the boundary issues foreclosed by such action are
nevertheless open for litigation in this Court." 460 U. S.,
at 638 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). As is evident
from this language, we did not "anticipate" that the dispute
would be finally resolved. Instead, we explicitly left open
the question whether the dispute could be litigated in this
Court.

The Court disregards this language in Arizona II because
it does not mention a potential preclusion defense. However, the point is not that this Court anticipated the State
parties' preclusion defense. Rather, it is that this Court recognized the possibility that the boundary issue would not be
judicially resolved at all, and left open the question whether
there was some defense precluding this Court's review.
What that defense might be was not before the Court.

Now that the question is squarely before us, I would hold
that the United States' claim for additional water rights is
barred by the principles of res judicata. Res judicata not
only bars relitigation of claims previously litigated, but also
precludes claims that could have been brought in earlier proceedings. Under the doctrine of res judicata, "when a final
judgment has been entered on the merits of a case, `[i]t is a
finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding
parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every
matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat

425Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matterwhich might have been offered for that purpose."

Nevada
v. United States, 463 U. S. 110, 129-130 (1983) (quoting Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351, 352 (1877)).

In Arizona II, we recognized that the general principles ofres judicata apply to our 1964 decree even though the decree

expressly provided for modification in appropriate circumstances. In so doing, we noted the importance of the cer-tainty of water rights in the Western United States. "A

major purpose of this litigation, from its inception to thepresent day, has been to provide the necessary assurance to
States of the Southwest and to various private interests, of
the amount of water they can anticipate to receive from the
Colorado River system. . . . If there is no surplus of water in
the Colorado River, an increase in federal reserved water
rights will require a `gallon-for-gallon reduction in the
amount of water available for water-needy state and private
appropriators.' " 460 U. S., at 620-621 (quoting United
States v. New Mexico, 438 U. S. 696, 699 (1978)). Thus, we
concluded that allowing recalculation of the amount of practicably irrigable acreage "runs directly counter to the strong
interest in finality in this case." 460 U. S., at 620. We also
noted that treating the 1964 calculation as final comported
with the clearly expressed intention of the parties and
was consistent with our previous treatment of original actions, allowing modifications after a change in the relevant
circumstances.

This reasoning is equally applicable to the United States'
and the Tribe's claim for additional water for the disputed
boundary lands. Even though the exact claim was not actually litigated in Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546 (1963)
(Arizona I), the United States could have raised the boundary claim and failed to do so. Indeed, in the proceedings
before Special Master Rifkind, the counsel for the United
States affirmatively represented that "[t]he testimony . . . as
reflected by these maps and by the other testimony will de530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
426 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
fine the maximum claim which the United States is assertingin this case." Earlier in the proceedings, the Master explicitly warned the United States about the preclusive effect offailing to assert potential claims: "In an action or a decree
quieting title, you cut out all claims not asserted. . . . I justwant you to be aware of the fact that the mere fact that it
has not been asserted does not mean that you may not lose
it . . . ." Exception by State Parties to Report of SpecialMaster and Supporting Brief 8-9 (colloquy between counsel

for the United States and the Special Master). Thus, underthe general principles of res judicata, the United States
would clearly be barred from now asserting the claim for
additional water rights.

Special Master McGarr concluded that the United States'
claim was not precluded because it fell within an exception
to the bar of res judicata. Wisely abandoning the Master's
reasoning, the United States instead defends the Master's
ruling on the ground that these claims "are not precluded,
under basic principles of res judicata, because [they] were
not decided, and could not have been decided, in the prior
proceedings." Reply Brief for United States in Response
to Exception of State Parties 21. But this argument fares
no better.

The issue before the Master in Arizona I was the amount
of water from the Colorado River to which the Quechan
Tribe was entitled. The Master made an allotment to the
reservation based on the evidence then before him as to the
amount of irrigable acreage within the reservation boundary,
which was undisputed at the time. Only years after that
decree was confirmed by this Court in Arizona I did the
United States assert a larger claim to water for the reservation based on a claim for a larger amount of irrigable acreage--not because of a miscalculation as to the irrigability of
acreage already claimed, but because of a claimed extension
of the boundaries of the reservation. But, at the time of
Arizona I, the United States had in its possession all of

530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

427Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
the facts that it later asserted in 1979 in Arizona II, and itcould have litigated the larger claim before Special Master

Rifkind.The United States offers no support for its contention that
the boundary dispute could not have been decided in Ari-zona I except for the fact that this Court rejected the Master's resolution of the Fort Mojave Reservation and Colo-rado River Reservation boundary disputes. However, those
boundary disputes are different. While we did not explainin

Arizona I why we believed it was improper to decide theboundary disputes, California's objection was based on the

fact that necessary parties were not participating in the pro-ceedings. Specifically, California argued that it lacked the
authority to represent private individuals claiming title tothe disputed lands and maintained that "it would be unfair
to prejudice any of the parties in future litigation over landtitles or political jurisdiction by approving findings on a tangential issue never pleaded by the United States." Arizona
II, supra, at 629. The Fort Yuma Reservation boundarydispute, on the other hand, is solely between the United

States and the Quechan Tribe--there are no private partiesclaiming title to the land. Thus, the United States could
have raised this claim in Arizona I, and the Master couldhave decided it.

Because I believe that the State parties' res judicata de-fense is properly before the Court and that the United
States' claim for additional water rights is precluded, I seeno need to remand for further proceedings. I agree with
the Court that we should approve the proposed settlementsof the remaining claims in this case and direct the parties to
submit any objections to the proposed supplemental decree.

DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 99-5525. Argued April 19, 2000--Decided June 26, 2000
In the wake of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, in which the Court held

that certain warnings must be given before a suspect's statement made
during custodial interrogation could be admitted in evidence, id., at
479, Congress enacted 18 U. S. C. $ 3501, which in essence makes the
admissibility of such statements turn solely on whether they were made
voluntarily. Petitioner, under indictment for bank robbery and related
federal crimes, moved to suppress a statement he had made to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, on the ground he had not received
"Miranda warnings" before being interrogated. The District Court
granted his motion, and the Government took an interlocutory appeal.
In reversing, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that petitioner had not
received Miranda warnings, but held that $ 3501 was satisfied because
his statement was voluntary. It concluded that Miranda was not a constitutional holding, and that, therefore, Congress could by statute have
the final say on the admissibility question.

Held: Miranda and its progeny in this Court govern the admissibility of

statements made during custodial interrogation in both state and
federal courts. Pp. 432-444.

(a) Miranda, being a constitutional decision of this Court, may not
be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress. Given $ 3501's express
designation of voluntariness as the touchstone of admissibility, its omission of any warning requirement, and its instruction for trial courts to
consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the giving of the
confession, this Court agrees with the Fourth Circuit that Congress
intended $ 3501 to overrule Miranda. The law is clear as to whether
Congress has constitutional authority to do so. This Court has supervisory authority over the federal courts to prescribe binding rules of
evidence and procedure. Carlisle v. United States, 517 U. S. 416, 426.
While Congress has ultimate authority to modify or set aside any such
rules that are not constitutionally required, e. g., Palermo v. United
States, 360 U. S. 343, 345-348, it may not supersede this Court's decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution, see, e. g., City of
Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517-521. That Miranda announced
a constitutional rule is demonstrated, first and foremost, by the fact
that both Miranda and two of its companion cases applied its rule to
proceedings in state courts, and that the Court has consistently done

530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

429Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)
Syllabus
so ever since. See, e. g., Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318 (per
curiam). The Court does not hold supervisory power over the state
courts, e. g., Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209, 221, as to which its authority is limited to enforcing the commands of the Constitution, e. g.,
Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 422. The conclusion that Miranda
is constitutionally based is also supported by the fact that that case
is replete with statements indicating that the majority thought it was
announcing a constitutional rule, see, e. g., 384 U. S., at 445. Although
Miranda invited legislative action to protect the constitutional right
against coerced self-incrimination, it stated that any legislative alternative must be "at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their
right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it."
Id., at 467.

A contrary conclusion is not required by the fact that the Court has
subsequently made exceptions from the Miranda rule, see, e. g., New
York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649. No constitutional rule is immutable,
and the sort of refinements made by such cases are merely a normal part
of constitutional law. Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 306--in which
the Court, in refusing to apply the traditional "fruits" doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases, stated that Miranda's exclusionary
rule serves the Fifth Amendment and sweeps more broadly than that
Amendment itself--does not prove that Miranda is a nonconstitutional
decision, but simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches
under the Fourth Amendment are different from unwarned interrogation under the Fifth. Finally, although the Court agrees with the
court-appointed amicus curiae that there are more remedies available
for abusive police conduct than there were when Miranda was decided--e. g., a suit under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,
403 U. S. 388--it does not agree that such additional measures supplement $ 3501's protections sufficiently to create an adequate substitute
for the Miranda warnings. Miranda requires procedures that will
warn a suspect in custody of his right to remain silent and assure him
that the exercise of that right will be honored, see, e. g., 384 U. S., at
467, while $ 3501 explicitly eschews a requirement of preinterrogation
warnings in favor of an approach that looks to the administration of
such warnings as only one factor in determining the voluntariness of
a suspect's confession. Section 3501, therefore, cannot be sustained if
Miranda is to remain the law. Pp. 432-443.

(b) This Court declines to overrule Miranda. Whether or not this
Court would agree with Miranda's reasoning and its rule in the first
instance, stare decisis weighs heavily against overruling it now. Even
in constitutional cases, stare decisis carries such persuasive force that
the Court has always required a departure from precedent to be
supported by some special justification. E. g., United States v. Inter530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
430 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
national Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 856. There is no such
justification here. Miranda has become embedded in routine police
practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture. See Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 331-332.
While the Court has overruled its precedents when subsequent cases
have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings, that has not happened
to Miranda. If anything, subsequent cases have reduced Miranda's
impact on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming the decision's
core ruling. The rule's disadvantage is that it may result in a guilty
defendant going free. But experience suggests that $ 3501's totalityof-the-circumstances test is more difficult than Miranda for officers to
conform to, and for courts to apply consistently. See, e. g., Haynes v.
Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 515. The requirement that Miranda warnings be given does not dispense with the voluntariness inquiry, but
cases in which a defendant can make a colorable argument that a selfincriminating statement was compelled despite officers' adherence to
Miranda are rare. Pp. 443-444.

432 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
evidence. In the wake of that decision, Congress enacted18 U. S. C. $ 3501, which in essence laid down a rule that the

admissibility of such statements should turn only on whetheror not they were voluntarily made. We hold that

Miranda,
being a constitutional decision of this Court, may not bein effect overruled by an Act of Congress, and we decline

to overrule Miranda ourselves. We therefore hold that
Miranda and its progeny in this Court govern the admissi-bility of statements made during custodial interrogation in

both state and federal courts.Petitioner Dickerson was indicted for bank robbery, conspiracy to commit bank robbery, and using a firearm in the
course of committing a crime of violence, all in violation of
the applicable provisions of Title 18 of the United States
Code. Before trial, Dickerson moved to suppress a statement he had made at a Federal Bureau of Investigation field
office, on the grounds that he had not received "Miranda
warnings" before being interrogated. The District Court
granted his motion to suppress, and the Government took an
interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit. That court, by a divided vote, reversed the District Court's suppression order. It agreed
with the District Court's conclusion that petitioner had not
received Miranda warnings before making his statement.
But it went on to hold that $ 3501, which in effect makes the
admissibility of statements such as Dickerson's turn solely
on whether they were made voluntarily, was satisfied in
this case. It then concluded that our decision in Miranda
was not a constitutional holding, and that, therefore, Congress could by statute have the final say on the question of
admissibility. 166 F. 3d 667 (1999).

Because of the importance of the questions raised by the
Court of Appeals' decision, we granted certiorari, 528 U. S.
1045 (1999), and now reverse.

We begin with a brief historical account of the law governing the admission of confessions. Prior to Miranda, we

Opinion of the Court
evaluated the admissibility of a suspect's confession under avoluntariness test. The roots of this test developed in the

common law, as the courts of England and then the UnitedStates recognized that coerced confessions are inherently untrustworthy. See, e. g., King v. Rudd, 1 Leach 115, 117-118,122-123, 168 Eng. Rep. 160, 161, 164 (K. B. 1783) (Lord Mansfield, C. J.) (stating that the English courts excluded confessions obtained by threats and promises); King v. Warickshall, 1 Leach 262, 263-264, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (K. B.
1783) ("A free and voluntary confession is deserving of thehighest credit, because it is presumed to flow from the strongest sense of guilt . . . but a confession forced from the mind
by the flattery of hope, or by the torture of fear, comes in
so questionable a shape . . . that no credit ought to be given
to it; and therefore it is rejected"); King v. Parratt, 4 Car. &
P. 570, 172 Eng. Rep. 829 (N. P. 1831); Queen v. Garner,
1 Den. 329, 169 Eng. Rep. 267 (Ct. Crim. App. 1848); Queen
v. Baldry, 2 Den. 430, 169 Eng. Rep. 568 (Ct. Crim. App.
1852); Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884); Pierce
v. United States, 160 U. S. 355, 357 (1896). Over time, our
cases recognized two constitutional bases for the requirement that a confession be voluntary to be admitted into evidence: the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination
and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
See, e. g., Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 542 (1897)
(stating that the voluntariness test "is controlled by that
portion of the Fifth Amendment . . . commanding that no
person `shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself ' "); Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S.
278 (1936) (reversing a criminal conviction under the Due
Process Clause because it was based on a confession obtained
by physical coercion).

While Bram was decided before Brown and its progeny,
for the middle third of the 20th century our cases based
the rule against admitting coerced confessions primarily, if
not exclusively, on notions of due process. We applied the

Opinion of the Court
due process voluntariness test in "some 30 different cases
decided during the era that intervened between Brown
and Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 [(1964)]." Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 223 (1973). See, e. g.,
Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Ashcraft v.
Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Chambers v. Florida, 309
U. S. 227 (1940). Those cases refined the test into an inquiry
that examines "whether a defendant's will was overborne"
by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession.
Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at 226. The due process test takes
into consideration "the totality of all the surrounding circumstances--both the characteristics of the accused and
the details of the interrogation." Ibid. See also Haynes,
supra, at 513; Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49, 55 (1962);
Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433, 440 (1961) ("[A]ll the circumstances attendant upon the confession must be taken into
account"); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 404 (1945)
("If all the attendant circumstances indicate that the confession was coerced or compelled, it may not be used to convict
a defendant"). The determination "depend[s] upon a weighing of the circumstances of pressure against the power of
resistance of the person confessing." Stein v. New York, 346
U. S. 156, 185 (1953).

We have never abandoned this due process jurisprudence,
and thus continue to exclude confessions that were obtained
involuntarily. But our decisions in Malloy v. Hogan, 378
U. S. 1 (1964), and Miranda changed the focus of much of
the inquiry in determining the admissibility of suspects' incriminating statements. In Malloy, we held that the Fifth
Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause is incorporated in
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and
thus applies to the States. 378 U. S., at 6-11. We decided
Miranda on the heels of Malloy.

In Miranda, we noted that the advent of modern custodial police interrogation brought with it an increased con530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

435Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
cern about confessions obtained by coercion.1 384 U. S., at445-458. Because custodial police interrogation, by its very

nature, isolates and pressures the individual, we statedthat "[e]ven without employing brutality, the `third degree'
or [other] specific stratagems, . . . custodial interrogationexacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the
weakness of individuals." Id., at 455. We concluded thatthe coercion inherent in custodial interrogation blurs the
line between voluntary and involuntary statements, andthus heightens the risk that an individual will not be "accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment . . . not tobe compelled to incriminate himself."

Id., at 439. Accord-ingly, we laid down "concrete constitutional guidelines for

law enforcement agencies and courts to follow." Id., at 442.Those guidelines established that the admissibility in evidence of any statement given during custodial interrogationof a suspect would depend on whether the police provided
the suspect with four warnings. These warnings (whichhave come to be known colloquially as "

Miranda rights") are:a suspect "has the right to remain silent, that anything he

says can be used against him in a court of law, that he hasthe right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot
afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to anyquestioning if he so desires." Id., at 479.

Two years after Miranda was decided, Congress enacted$ 3501. That section provides, in relevant part:

"(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the UnitedStates or by the District of Columbia, a confession . . .
shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.Before such confession is received in evidence, the trial

1 While our cases have long interpreted the Due Process and SelfIncrimination Clauses to require that a suspect be accorded a fair trial
free from coerced testimony, our application of those Clauses to the context of custodial police interrogation is relatively recent because the routine practice of such interrogation is itself a relatively new development.
See, e. g., Miranda, 384 U. S., at 445-458.

Opinion of the Court
judge shall, out of the presence of the jury, determineany issue as to voluntariness. If the trial judge determines that the confession was voluntarily made it shallbe admitted in evidence and the trial judge shall permit
the jury to hear relevant evidence on the issue of volun-tariness and shall instruct the jury to give such weight
to the confession as the jury feels it deserves under allthe circumstances.

"(b) The trial judge in determining the issue of vol-untariness shall take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, includ-ing (1) the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment
of the defendant making the confession, if it was madeafter arrest and before arraignment, (2) whether such
defendant knew the nature of the offense with which hewas charged or of which he was suspected at the time
of making the confession, (3) whether or not such de-fendant was advised or knew that he was not required
to make any statement and that any such statementcould be used against him, (4) whether or not such defendant had been advised prior to questioning of hisright to the assistance of counsel; and (5) whether or
not such defendant was without the assistance of counselwhen questioned and when giving such confession.

"The presence or absence of any of the above-mentioned factors to be taken into consideration by the
judge need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntari-ness of the confession."

Given $ 3501's express designation of voluntariness asthe touchstone of admissibility, its omission of any warning
requirement, and the instruction for trial courts to considera nonexclusive list of factors relevant to the circumstances
of a confession, we agree with the Court of Appeals thatCongress intended by its enactment to overrule Miranda.

Opinion of the Court
"voluntariness vel non was the touchstone of admissibility ofconfessions"). Because of the obvious conflict between our

decision in Miranda and $ 3501, we must address whetherCongress has constitutional authority to thus supersede
Miranda. If Congress has such authority, $ 3501's totality-of-the-circumstances approach must prevail over

Miranda's
requirement of warnings; if not, that section must yield to
Miranda's more specific requirements.The law in this area is clear. This Court has supervisory

authority over the federal courts, and we may use that au-thority to prescribe rules of evidence and procedure that
are binding in those tribunals. Carlisle v. United States,
517 U. S. 416, 426 (1996). However, the power to judicially
create and enforce nonconstitutional "rules of procedure
and evidence for the federal courts exists only in the absence of a relevant Act of Congress." Palermo v. United
States, 360 U. S. 343, 353, n. 11 (1959) (citing Funk v. United
States, 290 U. S. 371, 382 (1933), and Gordon v. United States,
344 U. S. 414, 418 (1953)). Congress retains the ultimate
authority to modify or set aside any judicially created rules
of evidence and procedure that are not required by the Constitution. Palermo, supra, at 345-348; Carlisle, supra, at
426; Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 265 (1980).

But Congress may not legislatively supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution. See, e. g.,
City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517-521 (1997). This
case therefore turns on whether the Miranda Court announced a constitutional rule or merely exercised its supervisory authority to regulate evidence in the absence of congressional direction. Recognizing this point, the Court of
Appeals surveyed Miranda and its progeny to determine the
constitutional status of the Miranda decision. 166 F. 3d,
at 687-692. Relying on the fact that we have created several exceptions to Miranda's warnings requirement and that
we have repeatedly referred to the Miranda warnings as
"prophylactic," New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 653

Opinion of the Court
(1984), and "not themselves rights protected by the Constitu-tion,"

Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 444 (1974),2 the
Court of Appeals concluded that the protections announcedin

Miranda are not constitutionally required. 166 F. 3d, at
687-690.We disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion, although we concede that there is language in some of our
opinions that supports the view taken by that court. Butfirst and foremost of the factors on the other side--that

Miranda is a constitutional decision--is that both Mirandaand two of its companion cases applied the rule to proceedings in state courts--to wit, Arizona, California, and NewYork. See 384 U. S., at 491-494, 497-499. Since that time,
we have consistently applied Miranda's rule to prosecutionsarising in state courts. See,

e. g., Stansbury v. California,
511 U. S. 318 (1994) (per curiam); Minnick v. Mississippi, 498U. S. 146 (1990);

Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988);
Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 481-482 (1981). It is beyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power over
the courts of the several States. Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S.
209, 221 (1982) ("Federal courts hold no supervisory authority over state judicial proceedings and may intervene only
to correct wrongs of constitutional dimension"); Cicenia v.
Lagay, 357 U. S. 504, 508-509 (1958). With respect to proceedings in state courts, our "authority is limited to enforcing the commands of the United States Constitution."

servance of any special procedures" in state courts "exceptwhen necessary to assure compliance with the dictates of the

Federal Constitution").3The Miranda opinion itself begins by stating that the
Court granted certiorari "to explore some facets of the prob-lems . . . of applying the privilege against self-incrimination
to in-custody interrogation, and to give concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courtsto follow." 384 U. S., at 441-442 (emphasis added). In fact,

the majority opinion is replete with statements indicatingthat the majority thought it was announcing a constitutional
rule.4 Indeed, the Court's ultimate conclusion was that the

3 Our conclusion regarding Miranda's constitutional basis is further
buttressed by the fact that we have allowed prisoners to bring alleged
Miranda violations before the federal courts in habeas corpus proceedings. See Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99 (1995); Withrow, supra, at
690-695. Habeas corpus proceedings are available only for claims that a
person "is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties
of the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). Since the Miranda rule is
clearly not based on federal laws or treaties, our decision allowing habeas
review for Miranda claims obviously assumes that Miranda is of constitutional origin.

4 See 384 U. S., at 445 ("The constitutional issue we decide in each of

these cases is the admissibility of statements obtained from a defendant
questioned while in custody"), 457 (stating that the Miranda Court was
concerned with "adequate safeguards to protect precious Fifth Amendment rights"), 458 (examining the "history and precedent underlying the
Self-Incrimination Clause to determine its applicability in this situation"),
476 ("The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is . . . fundamental
with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation"), 479 ("The whole
thrust of our foregoing discussion demonstrates that the Constitution has
prescribed the rights of the individual when confronted with the power
of government when it provided in the Fifth Amendment that an individual cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself"), 481, n. 52
(stating that the Court dealt with "constitutional standards in relation
to statements made"), 490 ("[T]he issues presented are of constitutional
dimensions and must be determined by the courts"), 489 (stating that the
Miranda Court was dealing "with rights grounded in a specific requirement of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution").

Opinion of the Court
unwarned confessions obtained in the four cases before theCourt in Miranda "were obtained from the defendant under

circumstances that did not meet constitutional standards forprotection of the privilege."

5 Id., at 491.

Additional support for our conclusion that Miranda isconstitutionally based is found in the Miranda Court's invitation for legislative action to protect the constitutionalright against coerced self-incrimination. After discussing
the "compelling pressures" inherent in custodial police in-terrogation, the

Miranda Court concluded that, "[i]n orderto combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to

exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accusedmust be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and
the exercise of those rights must be fully honored." Id., at467. However, the Court emphasized that it could not foresee "the potential alternatives for protecting the privilegewhich might be devised by Congress or the States," and it
accordingly opined that the Constitution would not precludelegislative solutions that differed from the prescribed

Mi-randa warnings but which were "at least as effective in

apprising accused persons of their right of silence and in as-suring a continuous opportunity to exercise it."

6 Ibid.

5 Many of our subsequent cases have also referred to Miranda's constitutional underpinnings. See, e. g., Withrow, supra, at 691 (" `Prophylactic' though it may be, in protecting a defendant's Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination, Miranda safeguards a `fundamental
trial right' "); Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 296 (1990) (describing Miranda's warning requirement as resting on "the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination"); Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 411
(1990) ("[T]he Fifth Amendment bars police-initiated interrogation following a suspect's request for counsel in the context of a separate investigation"); Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 629 (1986) ("The Fifth Amendment protection against compelled self-incrimination provides the right
to counsel at custodial interrogations"); Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412,
427 (1986) (referring to Miranda as "our interpretation of the Federal
Constitution"); Edwards, supra, at 481-482.

6 The Court of Appeals relied in part on our statement that the Miranda

decision in no way "creates a `constitutional straightjacket.' " See 166 F.
3d 667, 672 (CA4 1999) (quoting Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467). However, a

530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

441Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals also relied on the fact that we have,after our

Miranda decision, made exceptions from its rule
in cases such as New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984),and

Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971). See 166 F.
3d, at 672, 689-691. But we have also broadened the appli-cation of the

Miranda doctrine in cases such as Doyle v.
Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (1976), and Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S.
675 (1988). These decisions illustrate the principle--notthat

Miranda is not a constitutional rule--but that no constitutional rule is immutable. No court laying down a generalrule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which

counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modificationsrepresented by these cases are as much a normal part of
constitutional law as the original decision.The Court of Appeals also noted that in

Oregon v. Elstad,
470 U. S. 298 (1985), we stated that " `[t]he Miranda ex-clusionary rule . . . serves the Fifth Amendment and sweeps

more broadly than the Fifth Amendment itself.' " 166 F. 3d,at 690 (quoting

Elstad, supra, at 306). Our decision in that
case--refusing to apply the traditional "fruits" doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases--does not prove that
Miranda is a nonconstitutional decision, but simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the FourthAmendment are different from unwarned interrogation

under the Fifth Amendment.As an alternative argument for sustaining the Court of
Appeals' decision, the court-invited amicus curiae 7 contendsthat the section complies with the requirement that a legislative alternative to Miranda be equally as effective in preventing coerced confessions. See Brief for Paul G. Cassell

review of our opinion in Miranda clarifies that this disclaimer was intended to indicate that the Constitution does not require police to administer the particular Miranda warnings, not that the Constitution does not
require a procedure that is effective in securing Fifth Amendment rights.

7 Because no party to the underlying litigation argued in favor of $ 3501's

constitutionality in this Court, we invited Professor Paul Cassell to assist
our deliberations by arguing in support of the judgment below.

530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
442 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
as Amicus Curiae 28-39. We agree with the amicus' contention that there are more remedies available for abusive
police conduct than there were at the time Miranda was decided, see, e. g., Wilkins v. May, 872 F. 2d 190, 194 (CA7 1989)
(applying Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,
403 U. S. 388 (1971), to hold that a suspect may bring a federal cause of action under the Due Process Clause for police
misconduct during custodial interrogation). But we do not
agree that these additional measures supplement $ 3501's
protections sufficiently to meet the constitutional minimum.
Miranda requires procedures that will warn a suspect in
custody of his right to remain silent and which will assure
the suspect that the exercise of that right will be honored.
See, e. g., 384 U. S., at 467. As discussed above, $ 3501 explicitly eschews a requirement of preinterrogation warnings
in favor of an approach that looks to the administration of
such warnings as only one factor in determining the voluntariness of a suspect's confession. The additional remedies
cited by amicus do not, in our view, render them, together
with $ 3501, an adequate substitute for the warnings required by Miranda.

The dissent argues that it is judicial overreaching for this
Court to hold $ 3501 unconstitutional unless we hold that the
Miranda warnings are required by the Constitution, in the
sense that nothing else will suffice to satisfy constitutional
requirements. Post, at 453-454, 465 (opinion of Scalia, J.).
But we need not go further than Miranda to decide this case.
In Miranda, the Court noted that reliance on the traditional
totality-of-the-circumstances test raised a risk of overlooking
an involuntary custodial confession, 384 U. S, at 457, a risk
that the Court found unacceptably great when the confession
is offered in the case in chief to prove guilt. The Court
therefore concluded that something more than the totality
test was necessary. See ibid.; see also id., at 467, 490-491.
As discussed above, $ 3501 reinstates the totality test as

Opinion of the Court
sufficient. Section 3501 therefore cannot be sustained if
Miranda is to remain the law.

Whether or not we would agree with Miranda's reasoningand its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the

first instance, the principles of stare decisis weigh heavilyagainst overruling it now. See,

e. g., Rhode Island v. Innis,
446 U. S. 291, 304 (1980) (Burger, C. J., concurring in judgment) ("The meaning of Miranda has become reasonablyclear and law enforcement practices have adjusted to its

strictures; I would neither overrule Miranda, disparage it,nor extend it at this late date"). While " `

stare decisis is
not an inexorable command,' " State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522
U. S. 3, 20 (1997) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808,
828 (1991)), particularly when we are interpreting the Constitution, Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997), "even
in constitutional cases, the doctrine carries such persuasive force that we have always required a departure from
precedent to be supported by some `special justification.' "
United States v. International Business Machines Corp.,
517 U. S. 843, 856 (1996) (quoting Payne, supra, at 842 (Sou-
ter, J., concurring), in turn quoting Arizona v. Rumsey, 467
U. S. 203, 212 (1984)).

We do not think there is such justification for overruling
Miranda. Miranda has become embedded in routine police
practice to the point where the warnings have become part
of our national culture. See Mitchell v. United States, 526
U. S. 314, 331-332 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (stating that
the fact that a rule has found " `wide acceptance in the legal
culture' " is "adequate reason not to overrule" it). While we
have overruled our precedents when subsequent cases have
undermined their doctrinal underpinnings, see, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989), we
do not believe that this has happened to the Miranda decision. If anything, our subsequent cases have reduced the
impact of the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement
while reaffirming the decision's core ruling that unwarned

Scalia, J., dissenting
statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution'scase in chief.

The disadvantage of the Miranda rule is that statementswhich may be by no means involuntary, made by a defendant
who is aware of his "rights," may nonetheless be excludedand a guilty defendant go free as a result. But experience
suggests that the totality-of-the-circumstances test which$ 3501 seeks to revive is more difficult than

Miranda for lawenforcement officers to conform to, and for courts to apply in

a consistent manner. See, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373U. S., at 515 ("The line between proper and permissible
police conduct and techniques and methods offensive to dueprocess is, at best, a difficult one to draw"). The requirement that Miranda warnings be given does not, of course,dispense with the voluntariness inquiry. But as we said
in Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 (1984), "[c]ases inwhich a defendant can make a colorable argument that a
self-incriminating statement was `compelled' despite the factthat the law enforcement authorities adhered to the dictates
of Miranda are rare." Id., at 433, n. 20.In sum, we conclude that

Miranda announced a consti-tutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively.

Following the rule of stare decisis, we decline to overruleMiranda ourselves.

vored results will doubtless greet today's decision as a para-gon of moderation, since it declines to overrule

Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Those who understand thejudicial process will appreciate that today's decision is not a

reaffirmation of Miranda, but a radical revision of the mostsignificant element of

Miranda (as of all cases): the rationale
that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.

Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Actof Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it

prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.That was the basis on which

Miranda was decided. One
will search today's opinion in vain, however, for a statement
(surely simple enough to make) that what 18 U. S. C. $ 3501
prescribes--the use at trial of a voluntary confession, even
when a Miranda warning or its equivalent has failed to be
given--violates the Constitution. The reason the statement
does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that
it would be absurd, inasmuch as $ 3501 excludes from trial
precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz.,
compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are
needed to compose today's majority are on record as believing that a violation of Miranda is not a violation of the
Constitution. See Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,
457-458 (1994) (opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, J.,
joined); Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203 (1989) (opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, J., joined); Oregon v.
Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985) (opinion of the Court by O'Con-
nor, J.); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984) (opinion
of the Court by Rehnquist, J.). And so, to justify today's
agreed-upon result, the Court must adopt a significant new,
if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.
As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of
Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that "announced a
constitutional rule," ante, at 437. As I shall discuss in some

detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the contextof this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to

apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what itregards as useful "prophylactic" restrictions upon Congress
and the States. That is an immense and frightening anti-democratic power, and it does not exist.

It takes only a small step to bring today's opinion out ofthe realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal
reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefullycouched iterations that "

Miranda is a constitutional deci-sion," ante, at 438, that "Miranda is constitutionally based,"

ante, at 440, that Miranda has "constitutional underpin-nings," ante, at 440, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly:
"We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is notpreceded by Miranda warnings or their equivalent violates
the Constitution of the United States." It cannot say that,because a majority of the Court does not believe it. The
Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitutionwhen it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

I
Early in this Nation's history, this Court established thesound proposition that constitutional government in a system of separated powers requires judges to regard as in-operative any legislative Act, even of Congress itself, that is
"repugnant to the Constitution."

"So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if boththe law and the constitution apply to a particular case,

so that the court must either decide that case conforma-bly to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the courtmust determine which of these conflicting rules governs
the case." Marbury, supra, at 178.
The power we recognized in Marbury will thus permit us,indeed require us, to "disregar[d]" $ 3501, a duly enacted

Scalia, J., dissenting
statute governing the admissibility of evidence in the federal
courts, only if it "be in opposition to the constitution"--here,
assertedly, the dictates of the Fifth Amendment.

It was once possible to characterize the so-called Miranda
rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition
that what the statute here before us permits--the admission
at trial of un-Mirandized confessions--violates the Constitution. That is the fairest reading of the Miranda case itself.
The Court began by announcing that the Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of
extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460-
467--itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history
and precedent, see id., at 510-511 (Harlan, J., dissenting)
(characterizing the Court's conclusion that the Fifth Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process Clause, governed station house confessions as a "trompe l'oeil"). Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station
house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling
60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion
inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform
to the rules set forth in Miranda, or some functional equivalent. See id., at 458 ("Unless adequate protective devices
are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial
surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can
truly be the product of his free choice" (emphases added));
id., at 461 ("An individual swept from familiar surroundings
into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and
subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above
cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak"); id.,
at 467 ("We have concluded that without proper safeguards
the process of in-custody interrogation . . . contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he
would not otherwise do so freely"); id., at 457, n. 26 (noting

448 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
the "absurdity of denying that a confession obtained underthese circumstances is compelled").

The dissenters, for their part, also understood Miranda'sholding to be based on the "premise . . . that pressure on
the suspect must be eliminated though it be only the subtleinfluence of the atmosphere and surroundings."

Id., at 512
(Harlan, J., dissenting). See also id., at 535 (White, J., dissenting) ("[I]t has never been suggested, until today, thatsuch questioning was so coercive and accused persons so

lacking in hardihood that the very first response to the veryfirst question following the commencement of custody must
be conclusively presumed to be the product of an overborne
will"). And at least one case decided shortly after Miranda
explicitly confirmed the view. See Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S.
324, 326 (1969) ("[T]he use of these admissions obtained in
the absence of the required warnings was a flat violation
of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment as
construed in Miranda").

So understood, Miranda was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the fact that cases spanning more than
70 years had rejected its core premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the right to remain silent and
of the (thitherto unknown) right to have an attorney present,
a statement obtained pursuant to custodial interrogation was
necessarily the product of compulsion. See Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958) (confession not involuntary despite denial of access to counsel); Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S.
504 (1958) (same); Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303
(1912) (lack of warnings and counsel did not render statement before United States Commissioner involuntary); Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 (1896) (same). Moreover,
history and precedent aside, the decision in Miranda, if read
as an explication of what the Constitution requires, is preposterous. There is, for example, simply no basis in reason
for concluding that a response to the very first question
asked, by a suspect who already knows all of the rights de530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

449Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)
Scalia, J., dissenting
scribed in the Miranda warning, is anything other than avolitional act. See

Miranda, supra, at 533-534 (White, J.,
dissenting). And even if one assumes that the eliminationof compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most

knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it can-not conceivably require the right to have

counsel present.
There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized
under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in Miranda, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself
and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.Only the latter (which is

not required by the Constitution)
could explain the Court's inclusion of a right to counsel and
the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently
waived. Counsel's presence is not required to tell the suspect that he need not speak; the interrogators can do that.
The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can
be counted on to advise the suspect that he should not
speak. See Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 59 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring in result in part and dissenting in part)
("[A]ny lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any
circumstances").

Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is
likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested
in Miranda, see 384 U. S., at 444-445, 473-474), that courts
must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see
Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 105-106 (1975), or initiated
by police after the suspect has expressed a desire to have
counsel present, see Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-
485 (1981). Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without
more, enough to render a change of heart the product of
anything other than the suspect's free will. Thus, what is
most remarkable about the Miranda decision--and what

530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
450 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward con-stitutional interpretation in the Marbury tradition--is its

palpable hostility toward the act of confession per se, ratherthan toward what the Constitution abhors, compelled confession. See United States v. Washington, 431 U. S. 181, 187(1977) ("[F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution,
admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are in-herently desirable"). The Constitution is not, unlike the
Miranda majority, offended by a criminal's commendablequalm of conscience or fortunate fit of stupidity. Cf.

Min-nick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 166-167 (1990) (S
calia,J., dissenting).

For these reasons, and others more than adequately devel-oped in the

Miranda dissents and in the subsequent worksof the decision's many critics, any conclusion that a violation

of the Miranda rules necessarily amounts to a violation ofthe privilege against compelled self-incrimination can claim
no support in history, precedent, or common sense, and as aresult would at least presumptively be worth reconsidering
even at this late date. But that is unnecessary, since theCourt has (thankfully) long since abandoned the notion that
failure to comply with Miranda's rules is itself a violation ofthe Constitution.

II
As the Court today acknowledges, since Miranda we haveexplicitly, and repeatedly, interpreted that decision as having

announced, not the circumstances in which custodial interro-gation runs afoul of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment,
but rather only "prophylactic" rules that go beyond the rightagainst compelled self-incrimination. Of course the seeds of
this "prophylactic" interpretation of Miranda were presentin the decision itself. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 439 (discussing the "necessity for procedures which assure that the[suspect] is accorded his privilege"); id., at 447 ("[u]nless a
proper limitation upon custodial interrogation is achieved--such as these decisions will advance--there can be no assur530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
ance that practices of this nature will be eradicated"); id.,at 457 ("[i]n these cases, we might not find the defendants'

statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms");
ibid. (noting "concern for adequate safeguards to protect
precious Fifth Amendment rights" and the "potentiality forcompulsion" in Ernesto Miranda's interrogation). In subsequent cases, the seeds have sprouted and borne fruit: The
Court has squarely concluded that it is possible--indeed notuncommon--for the police to violate

Miranda without also
violating the Constitution.

Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433 (1974), an opinion for
the Court written by then-Justice Rehnquist, rejected the
true-to-Marbury, failure-to-warn-as-constitutional-violation
interpretation of Miranda. It held that exclusion of the
"fruits" of a Miranda violation--the statement of a witness
whose identity the defendant had revealed while in custody--was not required. The opinion explained that the
question whether the "police conduct complained of directly
infringed upon respondent's right against compulsory selfincrimination" was a "separate question" from "whether it
instead violated only the prophylactic rules developed to
protect that right." 417 U. S., at 439. The "procedural
safeguards" adopted in Miranda, the Court said, "were not
themselves rights protected by the Constitution but were
instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory
self-incrimination was protected," and to "provide practical
reinforcement for the right," 417 U. S., at 444. Comparing
the particular facts of the custodial interrogation with the
"historical circumstances underlying the privilege," ibid.,
the Court concluded, unequivocally, that the defendant's
statement could not be termed "involuntary as that term has
been defined in the decisions of this Court," id., at 445, and
thus that there had been no constitutional violation, notwithstanding the clear violation of the "procedural rules later
established in Miranda," ibid. Lest there be any confusion
on the point, the Court reiterated that the "police conduct at

452 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
issue here did not abridge respondent's constitutional privi-lege against compulsory self-incrimination, but departed

only from the prophylactic standards later laid down by thisCourt in

Miranda to safeguard that privilege." Id., at 446.
It is clear from our cases, of course, that if the statement in
Tucker had been obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, the statement and its fruits would have been excluded.
See Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 442 (1984).The next year, in

Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714 (1975), the
Court held that a defendant's statement taken in violationof

Miranda that was nonetheless voluntary could be used at
trial for impeachment purposes. This holding turned upon
the recognition that violation of Miranda is not unconstitutional compulsion, since statements obtained in actual violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination,
"as opposed to . . . taken in violation of Miranda," quite
simply "may not be put to any testimonial use whatever
against [the defendant] in a criminal trial," including as impeachment evidence. New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450,
459 (1979). See also Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 397-
398 (1978) (holding that while statements obtained in violation of Miranda may be used for impeachment if otherwise
trustworthy, the Constitution prohibits "any criminal trial
use against a defendant of his involuntary statement").

Nearly a decade later, in New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S.
649 (1984), the Court relied upon the fact that "[t]he prophylactic Miranda warnings . . . are `not themselves rights
protected by the Constitution,' " id., at 654 (quoting Tucker,
supra, at 444), to create a "public safety" exception. In that
case, police apprehended, after a chase in a grocery store, a
rape suspect known to be carrying a gun. After handcuffing
and searching him (and finding no gun)--but before reading him his Miranda warnings--the police demanded to
know where the gun was. The defendant nodded in the
direction of some empty cartons and responded that "the
gun is over there." The Court held that both the unwarned

Scalia, J., dissenting
statement--"the gun is over there"--and the recoveredweapon were admissible in the prosecution's case in chief

under a "public safety exception" to the "prophylactic rulesenunciated in

Miranda." 467 U. S., at 653. It explicitly
acknowledged that if the Miranda warnings were an im-perative of the Fifth Amendment itself, such an exigency

exception would be impossible, since the Fifth Amendment's
bar on compelled self-incrimination is absolute, and its" `strictures, unlike the Fourth's are not removed by showing

reasonableness,' " 467 U. S., at 653, n. 3. (For the latter rea-son, the Court found it necessary to note that respondent did
not "claim that [his] statements were actually compelled by
police conduct which overcame his will to resist," id., at 654.)

The next year, the Court again declined to apply the "fruit
of the poisonous tree" doctrine to a Miranda violation, this
time allowing the admission of a suspect's properly warned
statement even though it had been preceded (and, arguably,
induced) by an earlier inculpatory statement taken in violation of Miranda. Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985).
As in Tucker, the Court distinguished the case from those
holding that a confession obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search is inadmissible, on the ground that the
violation of Miranda does not involve an "actual infringement of the suspect's constitutional rights," 470 U. S., at 308.
Miranda, the Court explained, "sweeps more broadly than
the Fifth Amendment itself," and "Miranda's preventive
medicine provides a remedy even to the defendant who has
suffered no identifiable constitutional harm." 470 U. S., at
306-307. "[E]rrors [that] are made by law enforcement
officers in administering the prophylactic Miranda procedures . . . should not breed the same irremediable consequences as police infringement of the Fifth Amendment
itself." Id., at 308-309.

In light of these cases, and our statements to the same
effect in others, see, e. g., Davis v. United States, 512 U. S., at
457-458; Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 690-691 (1993);

Scalia, J., dissenting
Eagan, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible forthe Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation

of Miranda's rules is a violation of the Constitution. But asI explained at the outset, that is what is required before the
Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admis-sibility of evidence in federal court. The Court today insists
that the decision in Miranda is a "constitutional" one, ante,at 432, 438; that it has "constitutional underpinnings,"

ante,at 440, n. 5; a "constitutional basis" and a "constitutional origin," ante, at 439, n. 3; that it was "constitutionally based,"ante, at 440; and that it announced a "constitutional rule,"
ante, at 437, 439, 441, 444. It is fine to play these wordgames; but what makes a decision "constitutional" in the only
sense relevant here--in the sense that renders it imperviousto supersession by congressional legislation such as $ 3501--
is the determination that the Constitution requires the resultthat the decision announces and the statute ignores. By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not vio-late the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itselfprerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.

The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways:First, by misdescribing these postMiranda cases as meredicta. The Court concedes only "that there is language in

some of our opinions that supports the view" that Miranda'sprotections are not "constitutionally required." Ante, at
438. It is not a matter of language; it is a matter of hold-ings. The proposition that failure to comply with Miranda's
rules does not establish a constitutional violation was centralto the holdings of Tucker, Hass, Quarles, and Elstad.

The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact ofthese cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned
decisionmaking. It says:

"These decisions illustrate the principle--not that Miranda is not a constitutional rule--but that no constitu-tional rule is immutable. No court laying down a gen530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

455Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)
Scalia, J., dissenting
eral rule can possibly foresee the various circumstancesin which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of

modifications represented by these cases are as much anormal part of constitutional law as the original decision." Ante, at 441.
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are "mutable";they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of "various circumstances," they can be "modifi[ed]"; they assuredlycan. The issue is whether,

as mutated and modified, theymust make sense. The requirement that they do so is the

only thing that prevents this Court from being some sortof nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to
whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collectivefancy. And if confessions procured in violation of

Mirandaare confessions "compelled" in violation of the Constitution,

the post-Miranda decisions I have discussed do not makesense. The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that
a violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Constitution.If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding
of Elstad, "the traditional `fruits' doctrine developed inFourth Amendment cases" (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) doesnot apply to the fruits of Miranda violations, ante, at 441;
and if the reason for the difference is not that Miranda viola-tions are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and
flatly what Elstad said); then the Court must come up withsome

other explanation for the difference. (That will takequite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is not clear on

the face of the Fourth Amendment that evidence obtained inviolation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial,
whereas it is clear on the face of the Fifth Amendment thatunconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)
To say simply that "unreasonable searches under the FourthAmendment are different from unwarned interrogation
under the Fifth Amendment," ante, at 441, is true but su-premely unhelpful.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Finally, the Court asserts that Miranda must be a "consti-tutional decision" announcing a "constitutional rule," and

thus immune to congressional modification, because we havesince its inception applied it to the States. If this argument
is meant as an invocation of stare decisis, it fails because,though it is true that our cases applying

Miranda against
the States must be reconsidered if Miranda is not required
by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (dis-cussed above) based on the principle that

Miranda is not
required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered ifit

is. So the stare decisis argument is a wash. If, on the
other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic
rather than stare decisis, it is a classic example of begging
the question: Congress's attempt to set aside Miranda, since
it represents an assertion that violation of Miranda is not a
violation of the Constitution, also represents an assertion
that the Court has no power to impose Miranda on the
States. To answer this assertion--not by showing why violation of Miranda is a violation of the Constitution--but by
asserting that Miranda does apply against the States, is to
assume precisely the point at issue. In my view, our continued application of the Miranda code to the States despite
our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates
does not necessarily--or even usually--result in an actual
constitutional violation, represents not the source of Miranda's salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy. See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the
Law 173-198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal
Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U.
L. Rev. 100 (1985). As Justice Stevens has elsewhere explained: "This Court's power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely
on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the
Federal Constitution. . . . If the Court does not accept that
premise, it must regard the holding in the Miranda case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has

evolved from that decision, as nothing more than an illegiti-mate exercise of raw judicial power." Elstad, 470 U. S., at

370 (dissenting opinion). Quite so.

There was available to the Court a means of reconcilingthe established proposition that a violation of

Miranda doesnot itself offend the Fifth Amendment with the Court's assertion of a right to ignore the present statute. That meansof reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner
and the United States, who were evidently more concernedthan the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our
jurisprudence. It is not mentioned in the Court's opinionbecause, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil. Theymay be right.

Petitioner and the United States contend that there isnothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about
the Court's adopting prophylactic rules to buttress con-stitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and
the States. Indeed, the United States argues that "[p]ro-phylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Court's constitutional adjudication." Brief forUnited States 47. That statement is not wholly inaccurate,
if by "many years" one means since the mid-1960's. How-ever, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless
practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstatethe frequency with which we have engaged in it. For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quitesimply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the
scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the cir-cumstances in which they are violated. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 436-437(1982) (holding that a permanent physical occupation constitutes a per se taking); Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176(1985) (holding that the Sixth Amendment right to the assist530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
ance of counsel is actually "violated when the State obtains
incriminating statements by knowingly circumventing the
accused's right to have counsel present in a confrontation
between the accused and a state agent").

Similarly unsupportive of the supposed practice is Bruton
v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), where we concluded
that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment forbids the admission of a nontestifying codefendant's facially
incriminating confession in a joint trial, even where the jury
has been given a limiting instruction. That decision was
based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection "beyond" what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the
inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these
circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied
upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see
Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 207-208 (1987).

The United States also relies on our cases involving the
question whether a State's procedure for appointed counsel's
withdrawal of representation on appeal satisfies the State's
constitutional obligation to " `affor[d] adequate and effective
appellate review to indigent defendants.' " Smith v. Robbins, 528 U. S. 259, 276 (2000) (quoting Griffin v. Illinois, 351
U. S. 12, 20 (1956)). In Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738
(1967), we concluded that California's procedure governing
withdrawal fell short of the constitutional minimum, and we
outlined a procedure that would meet that standard. But
as we made clear earlier this Term in Smith, which upheld
a procedure different from the one Anders suggested, the
benchmark of constitutionality is the constitutional requirement of adequate representation, and not some excrescence
upon that requirement decreed, for safety's sake, by this
Court.

Scalia, J., dissenting
In a footnote, the United States directs our attention tocertain overprotective First Amendment rules that we have

adopted to ensure "breathing space" for expression. See
Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340, 342 (1974)
(recognizing that in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376U. S. 254 (1964), we "extended a measure of strategic protection to defamatory falsehood" of public officials); Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 58 (1965) (setting forth "pro-cedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a

censorship system" with respect to motion picture obscen-ity). In these cases, and others involving the First Amendment, the Court has acknowledged that in order to guarantee
that protected speech is not "chilled" and thus forgone, it is
in some instances necessary to incorporate in our substantive
rules a "measure of strategic protection." But that is because the Court has viewed the importation of "chill" as
itself a violation of the First Amendment--not because the
Court thought it could go beyond what the First Amendment
demanded in order to provide some prophylaxis.

Petitioner and the United States are right on target, however, in characterizing the Court's actions in a case decided
within a few years of Miranda, North Carolina v. Pearce,
395 U. S. 711 (1969). There, the Court concluded that due
process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction. Rather than simply
announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process
Clause, the Court went on to hold that "[i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, . . . the
reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear" and must "be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing
proceeding." Id., at 726. The Court later explicitly acknowledged Pearce's prophylactic character, see Michigan v.
Payne, 412 U. S. 47, 53 (1973). It is true, therefore, that the

460 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
case exhibits the same fundamental flaw as does Mirandawhen deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible)

pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itselfrequired. That is, although the Due Process Clause may
well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness,the Constitution by no means vests in the courts "any general power to prescribe particular devices `in order to assure
the absence of such a motivation,' " 395 U. S., at 741 (Black,J., dissenting). Justice Black surely had the right idea when

he derided the Court's requirement as "pure legislation ifthere ever was legislation,"

ibid., although in truth Pearce's
rule pales as a legislative achievement when compared to thedetailed code promulgated in

Miranda.1
The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioner's and theUnited States' suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding,

what the Court did in Miranda (assuming, as later caseshold, that

Miranda went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary. That the Court
has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does
not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential
for future mischief that the error entails. Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the
Federal Government some limited power to supplement its
guarantees, it has said so. See Amdt. 14, $ 5 ("The Congress
shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the
provisions of this article"). The power with which the
Court would endow itself under a "prophylactic" justification
for Miranda goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress
to do under authority of that text. Whereas we have in1 As for Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986), upon which petitioner
and the United States also rely, in that case we extended to the Sixth
Amendment, postindictment, context the Miranda-based prophylactic rule
of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), that the police cannot initiate
interrogation after counsel has been requested. I think it less a separate
instance of claimed judicial power to impose constitutional prophylaxis
than a direct, logic-driven consequence of Miranda itself.

sisted that congressional action under $ 5 of the FourteenthAmendment must be "congruent" with, and "proportional"

to, a constitutional violation, see City of Boerne v. Flores,521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997), the Miranda nontextual power to
embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive meas-ures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled
confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial em-powerment as a means of rendering today's decision rational.
In nonetheless joining the Court's judgment, however, theyoverlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence,
and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out. Sincethere is in fact no other principle that can reconcile today's
judgment with the post-Miranda cases that the Court re-fuses to abandon, what today's decision will stand for,
whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not,is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic,
extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress andthe States.

IV
Thus, while I agree with the Court that $ 3501 cannot beupheld without also concluding that Miranda represents an

illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-courtjudgments, I do not share the Court's hesitation in reaching that conclusion. For while the Court is also correct thatthe doctrine of

stare decisis demands some "special justifi-cation" for a departure from longstanding precedent--even

precedent of the constitutional variety--that criterion ismore than met here. To repeat

Justice Stevens' cogentobservation, it is "[o]bviou[s]" that "the Court's power to reverse Miranda's conviction rested entirely on the deter-mination that a violation of the Federal Constitution had
occurred." Elstad, 470 U. S., at 367, n. 9 (dissenting opinion)(emphasis added). Despite the Court's Orwellian assertion
to the contrary, it is undeniable that later cases (discussed

462 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
above) have "undermined [Miranda's] doctrinal underpin-nings," ante, at 443, denying constitutional violation and thus

stripping the holding of its only constitutionally legitimatesupport. Miranda's critics and supporters alike have long
made this point. See Office of Legal Policy, U. S. Dept. ofJustice, Report to Attorney General on Law of Pre-Trial
Interrogation 97 (Feb. 12, 1986) ("The current Court has re-pudiated the premises on which

Miranda was based, buthas drawn back from recognizing the full implications of its

decisions"); id., at 78 ("Michigan v. Tucker accordingly repu-diated the doctrinal basis of the Miranda decision"); Sonenshein, Miranda and the Burger Court: Trends and Counter-trends, 13 Loyola U. Chi. L. J. 405, 407-408 (1982) ("Although
the Burger Court has not overruled Miranda, the Court hasconsistently undermined the rationales, assumptions, and
values which gave Miranda life"); id., at 425-426 ("Seem-ingly, the Court [in Michigan v. Tucker] utterly destroyed
both Miranda's rationale and its holding"); Stone, The Mi-randa Doctrine in the Burger Court, 1977 S. Ct. Rev. 99, 118
("Mr. Justice Rehnquist's conclusion that there is a violationof the Self-Incrimination Clause only if a confession is involuntary . . . is an outright rejection of the core premisesof

Miranda").The Court cites Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491

U. S. 164, 173 (1989), as accurately reflecting our standardfor overruling, see ante, at 443--which I am pleased to accept, even though Patterson was speaking of overruling stat-utory cases and the standard for constitutional decisions is
somewhat more lenient. What is set forth there reads asthough it was written precisely with the current status of
Miranda in mind:

"In cases where statutory precedents have been over-ruled, the primary reason for the Court's shift in position has been the intervening development of the law,through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further
action taken by Congress. Where such changes have

removed or weakened the conceptual underpinningsfrom the prior decision, . . . or where the later law has

rendered the decision irreconcilable with competinglegal doctrines or policies, . . . the Court has not hesitated to overrule an earlier decision." 491 U. S., at 173.
Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining
Miranda that touts its supposed workability as comparedwith the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to

replace. Miranda's proponents cite ad nauseam the factthat the Court was called upon to make difficult and subtle
distinctions in applying the "voluntariness" test in some30-odd due process "coerced confessions" cases in the 30
years between Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936),and

Miranda. It is not immediately apparent, however,
that the judicial burden has been eased by the "bright-line"
rules adopted in Miranda. In fact, in the 34 years since
Miranda was decided, this Court has been called upon to
decide nearly 60 cases involving a host of Miranda issues,most of them predicted with remarkable prescience by Justice White in his Miranda dissent. 384 U. S., at 545.Moreover, it is not clear why the Court thinks that the
"totality-of-the-circumstances test . . . is more difficult than
Miranda for law enforcement officers to conform to, and for
courts to apply in a consistent manner." Ante, at 444. In-deed, I find myself persuaded by

Justice O'Connor's rejection of this same argument in her opinion in Williams,507 U. S., at 711-712 (O'C

onnor, J., joined by Rehnquist,
C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part):

"Miranda, for all its alleged brightness, is not without
its difficulties; and voluntariness is not without its
strengths. . . .

". . . Miranda creates as many close questions as it
resolves. The task of determining whether a defendant
is in `custody' has proved to be `a slippery one.' And
the supposedly `bright' lines that separate interrogation

530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
464 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a rightfrom waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim andill defined. . . .

"The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on theother hand, permits each fact to be taken into account
without resort to formal and dispositive labels. By dis-pensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered inshades and degrees,

the voluntariness inquiry often canmake judicial decisionmaking easier rather than more

onerous." (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)
But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply not

true that Miranda has banished it from the law and replacedit with a new test. Under the current regime, which the
Court today retains in its entirety, courts are frequentlycalled upon to undertake

both inquiries. That is because, asexplained earlier, voluntariness remains the constitutional

standard, and as such continues to govern the admissibilityfor impeachment purposes of statements taken in violation
of Miranda, the admissibility of the "fruits" of such state-ments, and the admissibility of statements challenged as unconstitutionally obtained despite the interrogator's compli-ance with

Miranda, see, e. g., Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S.157 (1986).

Finally, I am not convinced by petitioner's argument thatMiranda should be preserved because the decision occupies
a special place in the "public's consciousness." Brief forPetitioner 44. As far as I am aware, the public is not under
the illusion that we are infallible. I see little harm in admit-ting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people
the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyondthose required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable
in the criminal investigatory process. And I see much tobe gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality

that they govern themselves--which means that "[t]he pow-ers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution"

that the people adopted, "nor prohibited . . . to the States"by that Constitution, "are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people," U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.2

* * *
Today's judgment converts Miranda from a milestone ofjudicial overreaching into the very Cheops' Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx would be a better analogue) of judicial ar-rogance. In imposing its Court-made code upon the States,
the original opinion at least asserted that it was demandedby the Constitution. Today's decision does not pretend that
it is--and yet still asserts the right to impose it against thewill of the people's representatives in Congress. Far from
believing that stare decisis compels this result, I believe wecannot allow to remain on the books even a celebrated decision--especially a celebrated decision--that has come tostand for the proposition that the Supreme Court has power
to impose extraconstitutional constraints upon Congress andthe States. This is not the system that was established by
the Framers, or that would be established by any sane sup-porter of government by the people.

I dissent from today's decision, and, until $ 3501 is re-pealed, will continue to apply it in all cases where there has
been a sustainable finding that the defendant's confessionwas voluntary.

2 The Court cites my dissenting opinion in Mitchell v. United States,
526 U. S. 314, 331-332 (1999), for the proposition that "the fact that a rule
has found `wide acceptance in the legal culture' is `adequate reason not to
overrule' it." Ante, at 443. But the legal culture is not the same as the
"public's consciousness"; and unlike the rule at issue in Mitchell (prohibiting comment on a defendant's refusal to testify), Miranda has been continually criticized by lawyers, law enforcement officials, and scholars since its
pronouncement (not to mention by Congress, as $ 3501 shows). In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not
been demolished by subsequent cases.

APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY
certiorari to the supreme court of new jersey

No. 99-478. Argued March 28, 2000--Decided June 26, 2000
Petitioner Apprendi fired several shots into the home of an AfricanAmerican family and made a statement--which he later retracted--that
he did not want the family in his neighborhood because of their race.
He was charged under New Jersey law with, inter alia, second-degree
possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, which carries a prison
term of 5 to 10 years. The count did not refer to the State's hate crime
statute, which provides for an enhanced sentence if a trial judge finds,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed the
crime with a purpose to intimidate a person or group because of, inter
alia, race. After Apprendi pleaded guilty, the prosecutor filed a motion
to enhance the sentence. The court found by a preponderance of the
evidence that the shooting was racially motivated and sentenced Apprendi to a 12-year term on the firearms count. In upholding the sentence, the appeals court rejected Apprendi's claim that the Due Process
Clause requires that a bias finding be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The State Supreme Court affirmed.

Held: The Constitution requires that any fact that increases the penalty

for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, other than the
fact of a prior conviction, must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Pp. 474-497.

(a) The answer to the narrow constitutional question presented--
whether Apprendi's sentence was permissible, given that it exceeds the
10-year maximum for the offense charged--was foreshadowed by the
holding in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, that, with regard to
federal law, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Sixth
Amendment's notice and jury trial guarantees require that any fact
other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for a
crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved
beyond a reasonable doubt. The Fourteenth Amendment commands
the same answer when a state statute is involved. Pp. 474-476.

(b) The Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and the Sixth
Amendment right to trial by jury, taken together, entitle a criminal
defendant to a jury determination that he is guilty of every element
of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.
E. g., In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364. The historical foundation for
these principles extends down centuries into the common law. While

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

467Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)
Syllabus
judges in this country have long exercised discretion in sentencing,
such discretion is bound by the range of sentencing options prescribed
by the legislature. See, e. g., United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443,
447. The historic inseparability of verdict and judgment and the consistent limitation on judges' discretion highlight the novelty of a
scheme that removes the jury from the determination of a fact that
exposes the defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he could
receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict
alone. Pp. 476-485.

(c) McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, was the first case in
which the Court used "sentencing factor" to refer to a fact that was not
found by the jury but could affect the sentence imposed by the judge.
In finding that the scheme at issue there did not run afoul of Winship's
strictures, this Court did not budge from the position that (1) constitutional limits exist to States' authority to define away facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense, 477 U. S., at 85-88, and (2) a state
scheme that keeps from the jury facts exposing defendants to greater or
additional punishment may raise serious constitutional concerns, id., at
88. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224--in which the
Court upheld a federal law allowing a judge to impose an enhanced sentence based on prior convictions not alleged in the indictment--represents at best an exceptional departure from the historic
practice. Pp. 485-490.

(d) In light of the constitutional rule expressed here, New Jersey's
practice cannot stand. It allows a jury to convict a defendant of a
second-degree offense on its finding beyond a reasonable doubt and
then allows a judge to impose punishment identical to that New Jersey
provides for first-degree crimes on his finding, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the defendant's purpose was to intimidate his victim
based on the victim's particular characteristic. The State's argument
that the biased purpose finding is not an "element" of a distinct hate
crime offense but a "sentencing factor" of motive is nothing more than
a disagreement with the rule applied in this case. Beyond this, the
argument cannot succeed on its own terms. It does not matter how
the required finding is labeled, but whether it exposes the defendant to
a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury's verdict, as
does the sentencing "enhancement" here. The degree of culpability the
legislature associates with factually distinct conduct has significant implications both for a defendant's liberty and for the heightened stigma
associated with an offense the legislature has selected as worthy of
greater punishment. That the State placed the enhancer within the
criminal code's sentencing provisions does not mean that it is not an
essential element of the offense. Pp. 491-497.

159 N. J. 7, 731 A. 2d 485, reversed and remanded.

1999-2000). The extended term authorized by the hatecrime law for second-degree offenses is imprisonment for
"between 10 and 20 years." $ 2C:43-7(a)(3).The question presented is whether the Due Process Clause

I
At 2:04 a.m. on December 22, 1994, petitioner Charles C.Apprendi, Jr., fired several .22-caliber bullets into the home

of an African-American family that had recently moved intoa previously all-white neighborhood in Vineland, New Jersey.
Apprendi was promptly arrested and, at 3:05 a.m., admittedthat he was the shooter. After further questioning, at 6:04
a.m., he made a statement--which he later retracted--thateven though he did not know the occupants of the house personally, "because they are black in color he does not wantthem in the neighborhood." 159 N. J. 7, 10, 731 A. 2d 485,
486 (1999).A New Jersey grand jury returned a 23-count indictment
charging Apprendi with four first-degree, eight second-degree, six third-degree, and five fourth-degree offenses.
The charges alleged shootings on four different dates, as wellas the unlawful possession of various weapons. None of the
counts referred to the hate crime statute, and none allegedthat Apprendi acted with a racially biased purpose.

The parties entered into a plea agreement, pursuant towhich Apprendi pleaded guilty to two counts (3 and 18) of
second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful pur530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
pose, N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 2C:39-4a (West 1995), and one count(22) of the third-degree offense of unlawful possession of an

antipersonnel bomb, $ 2C:39-3a; the prosecutor dismissed theother 20 counts. Under state law, a second-degree offense
carries a penalty range of 5 to 10 years, $ 2C:43-6(a)(2); athird-degree offense carries a penalty range of between 3
and 5 years, $ 2C:43-6(a)(3). As part of the plea agreement,
however, the State reserved the right to request the courtto impose a higher "enhanced" sentence on count 18 (which

was based on the December 22 shooting) on the ground thatthat offense was committed with a biased purpose, as described in $ 2C:44-3(e). Apprendi, correspondingly, reserved the right to challenge the hate crime sentence enhancement on the ground that it violates the United States
Constitution.

At the plea hearing, the trial judge heard sufficient evidence to establish Apprendi's guilt on counts 3, 18, and 22;
the judge then confirmed that Apprendi understood the
maximum sentences that could be imposed on those counts.
Because the plea agreement provided that the sentence on
the sole third-degree offense (count 22) would run concurrently with the other sentences, the potential sentences on
the two second-degree counts were critical. If the judge
found no basis for the biased purpose enhancement, the
maximum consecutive sentences on those counts would
amount to 20 years in aggregate; if, however, the judge enhanced the sentence on count 18, the maximum on that count
alone would be 20 years and the maximum for the two counts
in aggregate would be 30 years, with a 15-year period of
parole ineligibility.

After the trial judge accepted the three guilty pleas, the
prosecutor filed a formal motion for an extended term. The
trial judge thereafter held an evidentiary hearing on the
issue of Apprendi's "purpose" for the shooting on December
22. Apprendi adduced evidence from a psychologist and
from seven character witnesses who testified that he did not

have a reputation for racial bias. He also took the standhimself, explaining that the incident was an unintended consequence of overindulgence in alcohol, denying that he wasin any way biased against African-Americans, and denying
that his statement to the police had been accurately de-scribed. The judge, however, found the police officer's testimony credible, and concluded that the evidence supported a
finding "that the crime was motivated by racial bias." App.to Pet. for Cert. 143a. Having found "by a preponderance

of the evidence" that Apprendi's actions were taken "with apurpose to intimidate" as provided by the statute,

id., at
138a, 139a, 144a, the trial judge held that the hate crime
enhancement applied. Rejecting Apprendi's constitutional
challenge to the statute, the judge sentenced him to a 12-
year term of imprisonment on count 18, and to shorter concurrent sentences on the other two counts.

Apprendi appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution requires that
the finding of bias upon which his hate crime sentence was
based must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,
In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). Over dissent, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey upheld
the enhanced sentence. 304 N. J. Super. 147, 698 A. 2d 1265
(1997). Relying on our decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), the appeals court found that the
state legislature decided to make the hate crime enhancement a "sentencing factor," rather than an element of an underlying offense--and that decision was within the State's
established power to define the elements of its crimes. The
hate crime statute did not create a presumption of guilt, the
court determined, and did not appear " `tailored to permit
the . . . finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.' " 304 N. J. Super., at 154, 698 A. 2d, at 1269
(quoting McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88). Characterizing the required finding as one of "motive," the court described it as a
traditional "sentencing factor," one not considered an "essen530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tial element" of any crime unless the legislature so provides.
304 N. J. Super., at 158, 698 A. 2d, at 1270. While recognizing that the hate crime law did expose defendants to
" `greater and additional punishment,' " id., at 156, 698 A. 2d,
at 1269 (citing McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88), the court held
that that "one factor standing alone" was not sufficient to
render the statute unconstitutional, 304 N. J. Super., at 156,
698 A. 2d, at 1269.

A divided New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed. 159 N. J.
7, 731 A. 2d 485 (1999). The court began by explaining that
while due process only requires the State to prove the "elements" of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the mere
fact that a state legislature has placed a criminal component
"within the sentencing provisions" of the criminal code "does
not mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidate
is not an essential element of the offense." Id., at 20, 731
A. 2d, at 492. "Were that the case," the court continued,
"the Legislature could just as easily allow judges, not juries,
to determine if a kidnapping victim has been released unharmed." Ibid. (citing state precedent requiring such a
finding to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt). Neither could the constitutional question be
settled simply by defining the hate crime statute's "purpose
to intimidate" as "motive" and thereby excluding the provision from any traditional conception of an "element" of a
crime. Even if one could characterize the language this
way--and the court doubted that such a characterization was
accurate--proof of motive did not ordinarily "increase the
penal consequences to an actor." Ibid. Such "[l]abels," the
court concluded, would not yield an answer to Apprendi's
constitutional question. Ibid.

While noting that we had just last year expressed serious
doubt concerning the constitutionality of allowing penaltyenhancing findings to be determined by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence, Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
227 (1999), the court concluded that those doubts were not
essential to our holding. Turning then, as the appeals court
had, to McMillan, as well as to Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), the court undertook a multifactor
inquiry and then held that the hate crime provision was
valid. In the majority's view, the statute did not allow impermissible burden shifting, and did not "create a separate
offense calling for a separate penalty." 159 N. J., at 24, 731
A. 2d, at 494. Rather, "the Legislature simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to
bear on punishment and dictated the weight to be given that
factor." Ibid., 731 A. 2d, at 494-495. As had the appeals
court, the majority recognized that the state statute was unlike that in McMillan inasmuch as it increased the maximum
penalty to which a defendant could be subject. But it was
not clear that this difference alone would "change the constitutional calculus," especially where, as here, "there is rarely
any doubt whether the defendants committed the crimes
with the purpose of intimidating the victim on the basis of
race or ethnicity." 159 N. J., at 24-25, 731 A. 2d, at 495.
Moreover, in light of concerns "idiosyncratic" to hate crime
statutes drawn carefully to avoid "punishing thought itself,"
the enhancement served as an appropriate balance between
those concerns and the State's compelling interest in vindicating the right "to be free of invidious discrimination."
Id., at 25-26, 731 A. 2d, at 495.

The dissent rejected this conclusion, believing instead that
the case turned on two critical characteristics: (1) "[A] defendant's mental state in committing the subject offense . . .
necessarily involves a finding so integral to the charged offense that it must be characterized as an element thereof ";
and (2) "the significantly increased sentencing range triggered by . . . the finding of a purpose to intimidate" means
that the purpose "must be treated as a material element
[that] must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt."

474 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

Opinion of the Court
Id., at 30, 731 A. 2d, at 498. In the dissent's view, the factsincreasing sentences in both Almendarez-Torres (recidivism)

and Jones (serious bodily injury) were quite distinct fromNew Jersey's required finding of purpose here; the latter
finding turns directly on the conduct of the defendant duringthe crime and defines a level of culpability necessary to form
the hate crime offense. While acknowledging "analyticaltensions" in this Court's postWinship jurisprudence, thedissenters concluded that "there can be little doubt that the

sentencing factor applied to this defendant--the purpose tointimidate a victim because of race--must fairly be regarded
as an element of the crime requiring inclusion in the indict-ment and proof beyond a reasonable doubt." 159 N. J., at
51, 731 A. 2d, at 512.We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1018 (1999), and now
reverse. II

It is appropriate to begin by explaining why certain as-pects of the case are not relevant to the narrow issue that
we must resolve. First, the State has argued that evenwithout the trial judge's finding of racial bias, the judge
could have imposed consecutive sentences on counts 3 and 18that would have produced the 12-year term of imprisonment
that Apprendi received; Apprendi's actual sentence was thuswithin the range authorized by statute for the three offenses
to which he pleaded guilty. Brief for Respondent 4. Theconstitutional question, however, is whether the 12-year
sentence imposed on count 18 was permissible, given thatit was above the 10-year maximum for the offense charged
in that count. The finding is legally significant because itincreased--indeed, it doubled--the maximum range within
which the judge could exercise his discretion, convertingwhat otherwise was a maximum 10-year sentence on that
count into a minimum sentence. The sentences on counts 3and 22 have no more relevance to our disposition than the
dismissal of the remaining 18 counts.

Opinion of the Court
Second, although the constitutionality of basing an en-hanced sentence on racial bias was argued in the New Jersey

courts, that issue was not raised here.1 The substantivebasis for New Jersey's enhancement is thus not at issue; the
adequacy of New Jersey's procedure is. The strength of thestate interests that are served by the hate crime legislation
has no more bearing on this procedural question than thestrength of the interests served by other provisions of the
criminal code.Third, we reject the suggestion by the State Supreme
Court that "there is rarely any doubt" concerning the exist-ence of the biased purpose that will support an enhanced
sentence, 159 N. J., at 25, 731 A. 2d, at 495. In this verycase, that issue was the subject of the full evidentiary hearing we described. We assume that both the purpose of theoffender, and even the known identity of the victim, will
sometimes be hotly disputed, and that the outcome may welldepend in some cases on the standard of proof and the identity of the factfinder.Fourth, because there is no ambiguity in New Jersey's
statutory scheme, this case does not raise any question con-cerning the State's power to manipulate the prosecutor's
burden of proof by, for example, relying on a presumptionrather than evidence to establish an element of an offense,
cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975); Sandstrom v.Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979), or by placing the affirmative
defense label on "at least some elements" of traditionalcrimes, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977).
The prosecutor did not invoke any presumption to buttressthe evidence of racial bias and did not claim that Apprendi
had the burden of disproving an improper motive. Thequestion whether Apprendi had a constitutional right to

enhanced sentence based on a jury finding that the defendant had intentionally selected his victim because of the victim's race. Wisconsin

Opinion of the Court
have a jury find such bias on the basis of proof beyond areasonable doubt is starkly presented.

Our answer to that question was foreshadowed by ouropinion in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), construing a federal statute. We there noted that "under theDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice
and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact(other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum
penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, sub-mitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
Id., at 243, n. 6. The Fourteenth Amendment commands thesame answer in this case involving a state statute.

III
In his 1881 lecture on the criminal law, Oliver WendellHolmes, Jr., observed: "The law threatens certain pains if

you do certain things, intending thereby to give you a newmotive for not doing them. If you persist in doing them,
it has to inflict the pains in order that its threats may con-tinue to be believed."

2 New Jersey threatened Apprendi

with certain pains if he unlawfully possessed a weapon andwith additional pains if he selected his victims with a purpose to intimidate them because of their race. As a matterof simple justice, it seems obvious that the procedural safeguards designed to protect Apprendi from unwarrantedpains should apply equally to the two acts that New Jersey
has singled out for punishment. Merely using the label"sentence enhancement" to describe the latter surely does
not provide a principled basis for treating them differently.At stake in this case are constitutional protections of
surpassing importance: the proscription of any deprivationof liberty without "due process of law," Amdt. 14, and the
guarantee that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accusedshall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an im2 O. Holmes, The Common Law 40 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

Opinion of the Court
partial jury," Amdt. 6.3 Taken together, these rights in-disputably entitle a criminal defendant to "a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime withwhich he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt." United
States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995); see also Sullivanv. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 278 (1993); Winship, 397 U. S., at
364 ("[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused againstconviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of
every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which heis charged").

As we have, unanimously, explained, Gaudin, 515 U. S.,at 510-511, the historical foundation for our recognition of
these principles extends down centuries into the commonlaw. "[T]o guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny
on the part of rulers," and "as the great bulwark of [our]
civil and political liberties," 2 J. Story, Commentaries on theConstitution of the United States 540-541 (4th ed. 1873),

trial by jury has been understood to require that "the truth
of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of
indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be
confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the de-fendant's] equals and neighbours . . . ." 4 W. Blackstone,

Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (here-inafter Blackstone) (emphasis added). See also

Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-154 (1968).

3 Apprendi has not here asserted a constitutional claim based on the
omission of any reference to sentence enhancement or racial bias in the
indictment. He relies entirely on the fact that the "due process of law"
that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the States to provide to persons
accused of crime encompasses the right to a trial by jury, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), and the right to have every element of the
offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358
(1970). That Amendment has not, however, been construed to include the
Fifth Amendment right to "presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury"
that was implicated in our recent decision in Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). We thus do not address the indictment question separately today.

Opinion of the Court
Equally well founded is the companion right to have thejury verdict based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

"The `demand for a higher degree of persuasion in criminalcases was recurrently expressed from ancient times, [though]
its crystallization into the formula "beyond a reasonabledoubt" seems to have occurred as late as 1798. It is now
accepted in common law jurisdictions as the measure of per-suasion by which the prosecution must convince the trier of
all the essential elements of guilt.' C. McCormick, Evidence$ 321, pp. 681-682 (1954); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence

$ 2497 (3d ed. 1940)." Winship, 397 U. S., at 361. We wenton to explain that the reliance on the "reasonable doubt"
standard among common-law jurisdictions " `reflect[s] a pro-found judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.' " Id., at 361-362 (quoting
Duncan, 391 U. S., at 155).Any possible distinction between an "element" of a felony

offense and a "sentencing factor" was unknown to the prac-tice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment by
court 4 as it existed during the years surrounding our Na-tion's founding. As a general rule, criminal proceedings
were submitted to a jury after being initiated by an in-dictment containing "all the facts and circumstances which
constitute the offence, . . . stated with such certainty andprecision, that the defendant . . . may be enabled to determine the species of offence they constitute, in order that hemay prepare his defence accordingly . . . and

that there maybe no doubt as to the judgment which should be given, if the

defendant be convicted." J. Archbold, Pleading and Evi-dence in Criminal Cases 44 (15th ed. 1862) (emphasis added).
The defendant's ability to predict with certainty the judg-ment from the face of the felony indictment flowed from the
invariable linkage of punishment with crime. See 4 Black4 "[A]fter trial and conviction are past," the defendant is submitted to
"judgment" by the court, 4 Blackstone 368--the stage approximating in
modern terms the imposition of sentence.

stone 369-370 (after verdict, and barring a defect in the in-dictment, pardon, or benefit of clergy, "the court must pronounce that judgment, which the law hath annexed to thecrime" (emphasis added)).

Thus, with respect to the criminal law of felonious conduct,"the English trial judge of the later eighteenth century had
very little explicit discretion in sentencing. The substantivecriminal law tended to be sanction-specific; it prescribed a
particular sentence for each offense. The judge was meantsimply to impose that sentence (unless he thought in the
circumstances that the sentence was so inappropriate thathe should invoke the pardon process to commute it)." Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on the Eve of theFrench Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France,
Germany 1700-1900, pp. 36-37 (A. Schioppa ed. 1987).5 AsBlackstone, among many others, has made clear,

6 "[t]he judg5 As we suggested in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), juries
devised extralegal ways of avoiding a guilty verdict, at least of the more
severe form of the offense alleged, if the punishment associated with the
offense seemed to them disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct
of the particular defendant. Id., at 245 ("This power to thwart Parliament and Crown took the form not only of flat-out acquittals in the face
of guilt but of what today we would call verdicts of guilty to lesser included offenses, manifestations of what Blackstone described as `pious
perjury' on the jurors' part. 4 Blackstone 238-239").

6 As the principal dissent would chide us for this single citation to Blackstone's third volume, rather than his fourth, post, at 525-526 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.), we suggest that Blackstone himself directs us to it for these
purposes. See 4 Blackstone 343 ("The antiquity and excellence of this
[jury] trial, for the settling of civil property, has before been explained at
large"). See 3 id., at 379 ("Upon these accounts the trial by jury ever has
been, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law.
And, if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property, how much must that advantage be heightened, when it is applied to
criminal cases!"); 4 id., at 343 ("And it will hold much stronger in criminal
cases; since, in times of difficulty and danger, more is to be apprehended
from the violence and partiality of judges appointed by the crown, in suits
between the king and the subject, than in disputes between one individual and another, to settle the metes and boundaries of private property");

ment, though pronounced or awarded by the judges, is not
their determination or sentence, but the determination and
sentence of the law." 3 Blackstone 396 (emphasis deleted).7

This practice at common law held true when indictments
were issued pursuant to statute. Just as the circumstances
of the crime and the intent of the defendant at the time of
commission were often essential elements to be alleged in
the indictment, so too were the circumstances mandating a
particular punishment. "Where a statute annexes a higher
degree of punishment to a common-law felony, if committed
under particular circumstances, an indictment for the offence, in order to bring the defendant within that higher degree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have been
committed under those circumstances, and must state the
circumstances with certainty and precision. [2 M. Hale,
Pleas of the Crown *170]." Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases, at 51. If, then, "upon an indictment under the statute, the prosecutor prove the felony to
have been committed, but fail in proving it to have been committed under the circumstances specified in the statute, the

4 id., at 344 ("What was said of juries in general, and the trial thereby, in
civil cases, will greatly shorten our present remarks, with regard to the
trial of criminal suits; indictments, informations, and appeals").

7 The common law of punishment for misdemeanors--those "smaller

faults, and omissions of less consequence," 4 id., at 5--was, as we noted in
Jones, 526 U. S., at 244, substantially more dependent upon judicial discretion. Subject to the limitations that the punishment not "touch life or
limb," that it be proportionate to the offense, and, by the 17th century, that
it not be "cruel or unusual," judges most commonly imposed discretionary
"sentences" of fines or whippings upon misdemeanants. J. Baker, Introduction to English Legal History 584 (3d ed. 1990). Actual sentences of
imprisonment for such offenses, however, were rare at common law until
the late 18th century, ibid., for "the idea of prison as a punishment would
have seemed an absurd expense," Baker, Criminal Courts and Procedure
at Common Law 1550-1800, in Crime in England 1550-1800, p. 43 (J. Cockburn ed. 1977).

We should be clear that nothing in this history suggeststhat it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion--

taking into consideration various factors relating both tooffense and offender--in imposing a judgment within the
range prescribed by statute. We have often noted thatjudges in this country have long exercised discretion of this
nature in imposing sentence within statutory limits in theindividual case. See,

e. g., Williams v. New York, 337 U. S.241, 246 (1949) ("[B]oth before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in Englandpracticed a policy under which a sentencing judge could
exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evi-dence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent
of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law"(emphasis added)). As in Williams, our periodic recognition
of judges' broad discretion in sentencing--since the 19th-century shift in this country from statutes providing fixedterm sentences to those providing judges discretion withina permissible range, Note, The Admissibility of Character
Evidence in Determining Sentence, 9 U. Chi. L. Rev. 715(1942)--has been regularly accompanied by the qualification
that that discretion was bound by the range of sentencingoptions prescribed by the legislature. See,

e. g., UnitedStates v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 447 (1972) (agreeing that

purpose, his Criminal Pleading treatise being generally viewed as "an essential reference book for every criminal lawyer working in the Crown

issue of guilt" has been resolved).9The historic link between verdict and judgment and the
consistent limitation on judges' discretion to operate withinthe limits of the legal penalties provided highlight the
novelty of a legislative scheme that removes the jury from

us legislation ordinarily fixes the penalties for the common law offences
equally with the statutory ones. . . . Under the common-law procedure,
the court determines in each case what within the limits of the law shall
be the punishment,--the question being one of discretion" (emphasis
added)); id., $ 948 ("[I]f the law has given the court a discretion as to the
punishment, it will look in pronouncing sentence into any evidence proper
to influence a judicious magistrate to make it heavier or lighter, yet not
to exceed the limits fixed for what of crime is within the allegation and
the verdict. Or this sort of evidence may be placed before the jury at the
trial, if it has the power to assess the punishment. But in such a case the
aggravating matter must not be of a crime separate from the one charged
in the indictment,--a rule not applicable where a delinquent offence under
an habitual criminal act is involved" (footnotes omitted)).

The principal dissent's discussion of Williams, post, at 545-546, 547, fails
to acknowledge the significance of the Court's caveat that judges' discretion is constrained by the "limits fixed by law." Nothing in Williams
implies that a judge may impose a more severe sentence than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury. Indeed, the commentators cited in the dissent recognize precisely this same limitation. See

receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the
jury verdict alone.10

We do not suggest that trial practices cannot change in
the course of centuries and still remain true to the principles that emerged from the Framers' fears "that the jury
right could be lost not only by gross denial, but by erosion."
Jones, 526 U. S., at 247-248.11 But practice must at least
adhere to the basic principles undergirding the requirements of trying to a jury all facts necessary to constitute a
statutory offense, and proving those facts beyond reason10 In support of its novel view that this Court has "long recognized" that
not all facts affecting punishment need go to the jury, post, at 524, the
principal dissent cites three cases decided within the past quarter century;
and each of these is plainly distinguishable. Rather than offer any historical account of its own that would support the notion of a "sentencing factor" legally increasing punishment beyond the statutory maximum--and
Justice Thomas' concurring opinion in this case makes clear that such an
exercise would be futile--the dissent proceeds by mischaracterizing our
account. The evidence we describe that punishment was, by law, tied to
the offense (enabling the defendant to discern, barring pardon or clergy,
his punishment from the face of the indictment), and the evidence that
American judges have exercised sentencing discretion within a legally
prescribed range (enabling the defendant to discern from the statute of
indictment what maximum punishment conviction under that statute could
bring), point to a single, consistent conclusion: The judge's role in sentencing is constrained at its outer limits by the facts alleged in the indictment and found by the jury. Put simply, facts that expose a defendant
to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by
definition "elements" of a separate legal offense.

example, commenting on the jury trial guarantee in Art. III, $ 2, echoed
Blackstone in warning of the need `to guard with the most jealous circumspection against the introduction of new, and arbitrary methods of trial,

able doubt. As we made clear in Winship, the "reasonabledoubt" requirement "has [a] vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons." 397 U. S., at 363. Prosecutionsubjects the criminal defendant both to "the possibility that
he may lose his liberty upon conviction and . . . the certaintythat he would be stigmatized by the conviction."

Ibid. We
thus require this, among other, procedural protections in
order to "provid[e] concrete substance for the presumptionof innocence," and to reduce the risk of imposing such deprivations erroneously. Ibid. If a defendant faces punishmentbeyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both the loss of liberty and the stigma attaching to
the offense are heightened; it necessarily follows that the
defendant should not--at the moment the State is put to
proof of those circumstances--be deprived of protections
that have, until that point, unquestionably attached.

Since Winship, we have made clear beyond peradventure
that Winship's due process and associated jury protections
extend, to some degree, "to determinations that [go] not to
a defendant's guilt or innocence, but simply to the length
of his sentence." Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 251
(Scalia, J., dissenting). This was a primary lesson of Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), in which we invalidated
a Maine statute that presumed that a defendant who acted
with an intent to kill possessed the "malice aforethought"
necessary to constitute the State's murder offense (and
therefore, was subject to that crime's associated punishment
of life imprisonment). The statute placed the burden on the
defendant of proving, in rebutting the statutory presumption, that he acted with a lesser degree of culpability, such
as in the heat of passion, to win a reduction in the offense
from murder to manslaughter (and thus a reduction of the
maximum punishment of 20 years).

The State had posited in Mullaney that requiring a defendant to prove heat-of-passion intent to overcome a pre530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sumption of murderous intent did not implicate Winshipprotections because, upon conviction of either offense, the

defendant would lose his liberty and face societal stigmajust the same. Rejecting this argument, we acknowledged
that criminal law "is concerned not only with guilt or in-nocence in the abstract, but also with the degree of criminal culpability" assessed. 421 U. S., at 697-698. Becausethe "

consequences" of a guilty verdict for murder and formanslaughter differed substantially, we dismissed the possibility that a State could circumvent the protections ofWinship merely by "redefin[ing] the elements that constitute
different crimes, characterizing them as factors that bearsolely on the extent of punishment." 421 U. S., at 698.

It was in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986),that this Court, for the first time, coined the term "sentencing factor" to refer to a fact that was not found by ajury but that could affect the sentence imposed by the

judge. That case involved a challenge to the State's Man12 Contrary to the principal dissent's suggestion, post, at 530-532, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 198 (1977), posed no direct challenge to
this aspect of Mullaney. In upholding a New York law allowing defendants to raise and prove extreme emotional distress as an affirmative defense to murder, Patterson made clear that the state law still required the
State to prove every element of that State's offense of murder and its
accompanying punishment. "No further facts are either presumed or

inferred in order to constitute the crime." 432 U. S., at 205-206. New
York, unlike Maine, had not made malice aforethought, or any described
mens rea, part of its statutory definition of second-degree murder; one
could tell from the face of the statute that if one intended to cause the
death of another person and did cause that death, one could be subject
to sentence for a second-degree offense. Id., at 198. Responding to the
argument that our view could be seen "to permit state legislatures to
reallocate burdens of proof by labeling as affirmative defenses at least
some elements of the crimes now defined in their statutes," the Court
made clear in the very next breath that there were "obviously constitutional limits beyond which the States may not go in this regard." Id.,
at 210.

Opinion of the Court
datory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9712(1982). According to its provisions, anyone convicted of

certain felonies would be subject to a mandatory minimumpenalty of five years' imprisonment if the judge found, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person "visibly pos-sessed a firearm" in the course of committing one of the specified felonies. 477 U. S., at 81-82. Articulating for the firsttime, and then applying, a multifactor set of criteria for determining whether the Winship protections applied to barsuch a system, we concluded that the Pennsylvania statute
did not run afoul of our previous admonitions against re-lieving the State of its burden of proving guilt, or tailoring
the mere form of a criminal statute solely to avoid Winship'sstrictures. 477 U. S., at 86-88.

We did not, however, there budge from the position that(1) constitutional limits exist to States' authority to define
away facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense, id., at85-88, and (2) that a state scheme that keeps from the jury
facts that "expos[e] [defendants] to greater or additional pun-ishment," id., at 88, may raise serious constitutional concern.
As we explained:

"Section 9712 neither alters the maximum penalty forthe crime committed nor creates a separate offense

calling for a separate penalty; it operates solely to limitthe sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty
within the range already available to it without the spe-cial finding of visible possession of a firearm. . . . The
statute gives no impression of having been tailored topermit the visible possession finding to be a tail which
wags the dog of the substantive offense. Petitioners'claim that visible possession under the Pennsylvania
statute is `really' an element of the offenses for whichthey are being punished--that Pennsylvania has in effect defined a new set of upgraded felonies--would haveat least more superficial appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or additional punish530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment, cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 2113(d) (providing separate and
greater punishment for bank robberies accomplished
through `use of a dangerous weapon or device'), but it
does not." Id., at 87-88.13

Finally, as we made plain in Jones last Term, AlmendarezTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), represents at
best an exceptional departure from the historic practice that
we have described. In that case, we considered a federal
grand jury indictment, which charged the petitioner with
"having been `found in the United States . . . after being
deported,' " in violation of 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(a)--an offense
carrying a maximum sentence of two years. 523 U. S., at
227. Almendarez-Torres pleaded guilty to the indictment,
admitting at the plea hearing that he had been deported,
that he had unlawfully reentered this country, and that
"the earlier deportation had taken place `pursuant to'
three earlier `convictions' for aggravated felonies." Ibid.
The Government then filed a presentence report indicating
that Almendarez-Torres' offense fell within the bounds of

$ 1326(b) because, as specified in that provision, his original
deportation had been subsequent to an aggravated felony
conviction; accordingly, Almendarez-Torres could be subject to a sentence of up to 20 years. Almendarez-Torres
objected, contending that because the indictment "had not
mentioned his earlier aggravated felony convictions," he
could be sentenced to no more than two years in prison.
Ibid.

13 The principal dissent accuses us of today "overruling McMillan."
Post, at 533. We do not overrule McMillan. We limit its holding to
cases that do not involve the imposition of a sentence more severe than
the statutory maximum for the offense established by the jury's verdict--
a limitation identified in the McMillan opinion itself. Conscious of the
likelihood that legislative decisions may have been made in reliance on
McMillan, we reserve for another day the question whether stare decisis
considerations preclude reconsideration of its narrower holding.

488 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

Opinion of the Court
Rejecting Almendarez-Torres' objection, we concludedthat sentencing him to a term higher than that attached to

the offense alleged in the indictment did not violate the stric-tures of Winship in that case. Because Almendarez-Torres
had admitted the three earlier convictions for aggravatedfelonies--all of which had been entered pursuant to proceedings with substantial procedural safeguards of their own--no question concerning the right to a jury trial or the standard of proof that would apply to a contested issue of fact wasbefore the Court. Although our conclusion in that case was
based in part on our application of the criteria we had in-voked in

McMillan, the specific question decided concernedthe sufficiency of the indictment. More important, as Jones

made crystal clear, 526 U. S., at 248-249, our conclusion inAlmendarez-Torres turned heavily upon the fact that the additional sentence to which the defendant was subject was"the prior commission of a serious crime." 523 U. S., at 230;
see also id., at 243 (explaining that "recidivism . . . is a tra-ditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing
court's increasing an offender's sentence"); id., at 244 (em-phasizing "the fact that recidivism `does not relate to the
commission of the offense . . .' "); Jones, 526 U. S., at 249-250,n. 10 ("The majority and the dissenters in

Almendarez-Torres disagreed over the legitimacy of the Court's decision

to restrict its holding to recidivism, but both sides agreedthat the Court had done just that"). Both the certainty that
procedural safeguards attached to any "fact" of prior convic-tion, and the reality that Almendarez-Torres did not challenge the accuracy of that "fact" in his case, mitigated thedue process and Sixth Amendment concerns otherwise implicated in allowing a judge to determine a "fact" increasingpunishment beyond the maximum of the statutory range.

14 The principal dissent's contention that our decision in Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721 (1998), "demonstrates that Almendarez-Torres was"
something other than a limited exception to the jury trial rule is both

Opinion of the Court
Even though it is arguable that Almendarez-Torres wasincorrectly decided,

15 and that a logical application of our

reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were

inaccurate and misleading. Post, at 536. Monge was another recidivism
case in which the question presented and the bulk of the Court's analysis
related to the scope of double jeopardy protections in sentencing. The
dissent extracts from that decision the majority's statement that "the
Court has rejected an absolute rule that an enhancement constitutes an
element of the offense any time that it increases the maximum sentence."
524 U. S., at 729. Far from being part of "reasoning essential" to the
Court's holding, post, at 536, that statement was in response to a dissent
by Justice Scalia on an issue that the Court itself had, a few sentences
earlier, insisted "was neither considered by the state courts nor discussed
in petitioner's brief before this Court." 524 U. S., at 728. Moreover, the
sole citation supporting the Monge Court's proposition that "the Court
has rejected" such a rule was none other than Almendarez-Torres; as we
have explained, that case simply cannot bear that broad reading. Most
telling of Monge's distance from the issue at stake in this case is that the
double jeopardy question in Monge arose because the State had failed to
satisfy its own statutory burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant had committed a prior offense (and was therefore
subject to an enhanced, recidivism-based sentence). 524 U. S., at 725
("According to California law, a number of procedural safeguards surround the assessment of prior conviction allegations: Defendants may invoke the right to a jury trial . . . ; the prosecution must prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt; and the rules of evidence apply"). The
Court thus itself warned against a contrary double jeopardy rule that
could "create disincentives that would diminish these important procedural protections." Id., at 734.

15 In addition to the reasons set forth in Justice Scalia's dissent, 523

U. S., at 248-260, it is noteworthy that the Court's extensive discussion of
the term "sentencing factor" virtually ignored the pedigree of the pleading
requirement at issue. The rule was succinctly stated by Justice Clifford
in his separate opinion in United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232-233
(1876): "[T]he indictment must contain an allegation of every fact which is
legally essential to the punishment to be inflicted." As he explained in
"[s]peaking of that principle, Mr. Bishop says it pervades the entire system
of the adjudged law of criminal procedure, as appears by all the cases;
that, wherever we move in that department of our jurisprudence, we come
in contact with it; and that we can no more escape from it than from

Opinion of the Court
contested, Apprendi does not contest the decision's validityand we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today

to treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rulewe recalled at the outset. Given its unique facts, it surely
does not warrant rejection of the otherwise uniform courseof decision during the entire history of our jurisprudence.

In sum, our reexamination of our cases in this area, andof the history upon which they rely, confirms the opinion that
we expressed in Jones. Other than the fact of a prior con-viction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submittedto a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. With that
exception, we endorse the statement of the rule set forth inthe concurring opinions in that case: "[I]t is unconstitutional
for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment offacts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which
a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear thatsuch facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable
doubt." 526 U. S., at 252-253 (opinion of Stevens, J.); seealso id., at 253 (opinion of

Scalia, J.).16

the atmosphere which surrounds us. 1 Bishop, Cr. Pro., 2d ed., sect. 81;
Archbold's Crim. Plead., 15th ed., 54; 1 Stark Crim. Plead., 236; 1 Am. Cr.
Law, 6th rev. ed., sect. 364; Steel v. Smith, 1 Barn. & Ald. 99."

16 The principal dissent would reject the Court's rule as a "meaningless

formalism," because it can conceive of hypothetical statutes that would
comply with the rule and achieve the same result as the New Jersey statute. Post, at 539-542. While a State could, hypothetically, undertake to
revise its entire criminal code in the manner the dissent suggests, post, at
540--extending all statutory maximum sentences to, for example, 50 years
and giving judges guided discretion as to a few specially selected factors
within that range--this possibility seems remote. Among other reasons,
structural democratic constraints exist to discourage legislatures from
enacting penal statutes that expose every defendant convicted of, for example, weapons possession, to a maximum sentence exceeding that which
is, in the legislature's judgment, generally proportional to the crime.
This is as it should be. Our rule ensures that a State is obliged "to make
its choices concerning the substantive content of its criminal laws with full
awareness of the consequences, unable to mask substantive policy choices"

Opinion of the Court

V
The New Jersey statutory scheme that Apprendi asks us
to invalidate allows a jury to convict a defendant of a
second-degree offense based on its finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he unlawfully possessed a prohibited weapon;
after a subsequent and separate proceeding, it then allows a
judge to impose punishment identical to that New Jersey
provides for crimes of the first degree, N. J. Stat. Ann.

$ 2C:43-6(a)(1) (West 1999), based upon the judge's finding,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant's
"purpose" for unlawfully possessing the weapon was "to intimidate" his victim on the basis of a particular characteristic
the victim possessed. In light of the constitutional rule exof exposing all who are convicted to the maximum sentence it provides.
Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 228-229, n. 13 (Powell, J., dissenting).
So exposed, "[t]he political check on potentially harsh legislative action is
then more likely to operate." Ibid.

In all events, if such an extensive revision of the State's entire criminal
code were enacted for the purpose the dissent suggests, or if New Jersey
simply reversed the burden of the hate crime finding (effectively assuming
a crime was performed with a purpose to intimidate and then requiring a
defendant to prove that it was not, post, at 542), we would be required to
question whether the revision was constitutional under this Court's prior
decisions. See Patterson, 432 U. S., at 210; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.
684, 698-702 (1975).

Finally, the principal dissent ignores the distinction the Court has often
recognized, see, e. g., Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987), between facts
in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation. See post, at 541-
542. If facts found by a jury support a guilty verdict of murder, the judge
is authorized by that jury verdict to sentence the defendant to the maximum sentence provided by the murder statute. If the defendant can escape the statutory maximum by showing, for example, that he is a war
veteran, then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorized
by the verdict according to statute, nor is the judge imposing upon the
defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone.
Core concerns animating the jury and burden-of-proof requirements are
thus absent from such a scheme.

492 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

Opinion of the Court
plained above, and all of the cases supporting it, this practicecannot stand.

New Jersey's defense of its hate crime enhancement stat-ute has three primary components: (1) The required finding
of biased purpose is not an "element" of a distinct hate crimeoffense, but rather the traditional "sentencing factor" of motive; (2) McMillan holds that the legislature can authorize ajudge to find a traditional sentencing factor on the basis of a
preponderance of the evidence; and (3) Almendarez-Torresextended

McMillan's holding to encompass factors that au-thorize a judge to impose a sentence beyond the maximum

provided by the substantive statute under which a defendantis charged. None of these persuades us that the constitutional rule that emerges from our history and case lawshould incorporate an exception for this New Jersey statute.

New Jersey's first point is nothing more than a disagree-ment with the rule we apply today. Beyond this, we do not
see how the argument can succeed on its own terms. Thestate high court evinced substantial skepticism at the suggestion that the hate crime statute's "purpose to intimidate"was simply an inquiry into "motive." We share that skepticism. The text of the statute requires the factfinder to de-termine whether the defendant possessed, at the time he
committed the subject act, a "purpose to intimidate" on ac-count of,

inter alia, race. By its very terms, this statutemandates an examination of the defendant's state of mind--

a concept known well to the criminal law as the defendant'smens rea.

17 It makes no difference in identifying the nature

17 Among the most common definitions of mens rea is "criminal intent."
Black's Law Dictionary 1137 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). That dictionary unsurprisingly defines "purpose" as synonymous with intent, id., at 1400, and
"intent" as, among other things, "a state of mind," id., at 947. But we
need not venture beyond New Jersey's own criminal code for a definition
of purpose that makes it central to the description of a criminal offense.
As the dissenting judge on the state appeals court pointed out, according
to the New Jersey Criminal Code, "[a] person acts purposely with respect
to the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is his conscious object

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
of this finding that Apprendi was also required, in order toreceive the sentence he did for weapons possession, to have

possessed the weapon with a "purpose to use [the weapon]unlawfully against the person or property of another,"

$ 2C:39-4(a). A second mens rea requirement hardly de-feats the reality that the enhancement statute imposes of its
own force an intent requirement necessary for the imposi-tion of sentence. On the contrary, the fact that the language
and structure of the "purpose to use" criminal offense isidentical in relevant respects to the language and structure of the "purpose to intimidate" provision demonstratesto us that it is precisely a particular criminal

mens rea thatthe hate crime enhancement statute seeks to target. The

defendant's intent in committing a crime is perhaps asclose as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense
"element." 18
to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result." N. J. Stat.
Ann. $ 2C:2-2(b)(1) (West 1999). The hate crime statute's application to
those who act "with a purpose to intimidate because of" certain statusbased characteristics places it squarely within the inquiry whether it was
a defendant's "conscious object" to intimidate for that reason.

18 Whatever the effect of the State Supreme Court's comment that the

law here targets "motive," 159 N. J. 7, 20, 731 A. 2d 485, 492 (1999)--and it
is highly doubtful that one could characterize that comment as a "binding"
interpretation of the state statute, see Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S., at
483-484 (declining to be bound by state court's characterization of state
law's "operative effect"), even if the court had not immediately thereafter
called into direct question its "ability to view this finding as merely a
search for motive," 159 N. J., at 21, 731 A. 2d, at 492--a State cannot
through mere characterization change the nature of the conduct actually
targeted. It is as clear as day that this hate crime law defines a particular
kind of prohibited intent, and a particular intent is more often than not
the sine qua non of a violation of a criminal law.

When the principal dissent at long last confronts the actual statute at
issue in this case in the final few pages of its opinion, it offers in response
to this interpretation only that our reading is contrary to "settled precedent" in Mitchell. Post, at 553. Setting aside the fact that Wisconsin's
hate crime statute was, in text and substance, different from New Jersey's,
Mitchell did not even begin to consider whether the Wisconsin hate crime

494 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

Opinion of the Court
The foregoing notwithstanding, however, the New JerseySupreme Court correctly recognized that it does not matter

whether the required finding is characterized as one of in-tent or of motive, because "[l]abels do not afford an acceptable answer." 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Thatpoint applies as well to the constitutionally novel and elusive distinction between "elements" and "sentencing factors." McMillan, 477 U. S., at 86 (noting that the sentenc-ing factor--visible possession of a firearm--"might well have

been included as an element of the enumerated offenses").Despite what appears to us the clear "elemental" nature of
the factor here, the relevant inquiry is one not of form,but of effect--does the required finding expose the defendant
to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury'sguilty verdict?

19

As the New Jersey Supreme Court itself understood inrejecting the argument that the required "motive" finding

was simply a "traditional" sentencing factor, proof of motive
did not ordinarily "increase the penal consequences to an
actor." 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Indeed, the effect
of New Jersey's sentencing "enhancement" here is unquestionably to turn a second-degree offense into a first-degree
offense, under the State's own criminal code. The law thus
runs directly into our warning in Mullaney that Winship is

requirement was an offense "element" or not; it did not have to--the
required finding under the Wisconsin statute was made by the jury.

19 This is not to suggest that the term "sentencing factor" is devoid of

meaning. The term appropriately describes a circumstance, which may
be either aggravating or mitigating in character, that supports a specific
sentence within the range authorized by the jury's finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular offense. On the other hand, when the term
"sentence enhancement" is used to describe an increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence, it is the functional equivalent of an
element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury's guilty
verdict. Indeed, it fits squarely within the usual definition of an "element" of the offense. See post, at 501-502 (Thomas, J., concurring) (reviewing the relevant authorities).

Opinion of the Court
concerned as much with the category of substantive offenseas "with the degree of criminal culpability" assessed. 421

U. S., at 698. This concern flows not only from the historicalpedigree of the jury and burden rights, but also from the
powerful interests those rights serve. The degree of crimi-nal culpability the legislature chooses to associate with particular, factually distinct conduct has significant implications
both for a defendant's very liberty, and for the heightenedstigma associated with an offense the legislature has selected

as worthy of greater punishment.The preceding discussion should make clear why the State's
reliance on McMillan is likewise misplaced. The differential
in sentence between what Apprendi would have received
without the finding of biased purpose and what he could receive with it is not, it is true, as extreme as the difference
between a small fine and mandatory life imprisonment.
Mullaney, 421 U. S., at 700. But it can hardly be said that
the potential doubling of one's sentence--from 10 years to
20--has no more than a nominal effect. Both in terms of
absolute years behind bars, and because of the more severe
stigma attached, the differential here is unquestionably of
constitutional significance. When a judge's finding based
on a mere preponderance of the evidence authorizes an increase in the maximum punishment, it is appropriately characterized as "a tail which wags the dog of the substantive
offense." McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88.

New Jersey would also point to the fact that the State
did not, in placing the required biased purpose finding in a
sentencing enhancement provision, create a "separate offense calling for a separate penalty." Ibid. As for this, we
agree wholeheartedly with the New Jersey Supreme Court
that merely because the state legislature placed its hate
crime sentence "enhancer" "within the sentencing provisions" of the criminal code "does not mean that the finding
of a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential element
of the offense." 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Indeed,

Opinion of the Court
the fact that New Jersey, along with numerous other States,
has also made precisely the same conduct the subject of an
independent substantive offense makes it clear that the mere
presence of this "enhancement" in a sentencing statute does
not define its character.20

New Jersey's reliance on Almendarez-Torres is also unavailing. The reasons supporting an exception from the
general rule for the statute construed in that case do not
apply to the New Jersey statute. Whereas recidivism "does
not relate to the commission of the offense" itself, 523 U. S.,
at 230, 244, New Jersey's biased purpose inquiry goes precisely to what happened in the "commission of the offense."
Moreover, there is a vast difference between accepting the
validity of a prior judgment of conviction entered in a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trial
and the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt, and allowing the judge to find the required fact under a lesser standard of proof.

Finally, this Court has previously considered and rejected
the argument that the principles guiding our decision today
render invalid state capital sentencing schemes requiring
judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a
capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death. Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S.
639, 647-649 (1990); id., at 709-714 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
For reasons we have explained, the capital cases are not
controlling:

("A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if in committing an offense [of harassment] under this section, he acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion,
gender, handicap, sexual orientation or ethnicity"), 26 States currently

crime laws).

Opinion of the Court
"Neither the cases cited, nor any other case, permitsa judge to determine the existence of a factor which

makes a crime a capital offense. What the cited caseshold is that, once a jury has found the defendant guilty
of all the elements of an offense which carries as its max-imum penalty the sentence of death, it may be left to
the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty,rather than a lesser one, ought to be imposed . . . . The
person who is charged with actions that expose him tothe death penalty has an absolute entitlement to jury
trial on all the elements of the charge." AlmendarezTorres, 523 U. S., at 257, n. 2 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (em-phasis deleted).

The New Jersey procedure challenged in this case is anunacceptable departure from the jury tradition that is an

indispensable part of our criminal justice system. Accord-ingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

on the benefits of determinate sentencing schemes, and the effect of today's decision on the federal Sentencing Guidelines. Post, at 544-552.
The Guidelines are, of course, not before the Court. We therefore express
no view on the subject beyond what this Court has already held. See,
e. g., Edwards v. United States, 523 U. S. 511, 515 (1998) (opinion of
Breyer, J., for a unanimous court) (noting that "[o]f course, petitioners'
statutory and constitutional claims would make a difference if it were possible to argue, say, that the sentences imposed exceeded the maximum
that the statutes permit for a cocaine-only conspiracy. That is because
a maximum sentence set by statute trumps a higher sentence set forth

in the Guidelines. [United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines

Scalia, J., concurring
Justice Scalia, concurring.
I feel the need to say a few words in response to Justice
Breyer's dissent. It sketches an admirably fair and effi-cient scheme of criminal justice designed for a society that

is prepared to leave criminal justice to the State. (Judges,it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves, are part of
the State--and an increasingly bureaucratic part of it, atthat.) The founders of the American Republic were not prepared to leave it to the State, which is why the jury-trialguarantee was one of the least controversial provisions of
the Bill of Rights. It has never been efficient; but it hasalways been free.

As for fairness, which Justice Breyer believes "[i]n mod-ern times,"

post, at 555, the jury cannot provide: I think itnot unfair to tell a prospective felon that if he commits his

contemplated crime he is exposing himself to a jail sentenceof 30 years--and that if, upon conviction, he gets anything
less than that he may thank the mercy of a tenderheartedjudge ( just as he may thank the mercy of a tenderhearted
parole commission if he is let out inordinately early, or themercy of a tenderhearted governor if his sentence is commuted). Will there be disparities? Of course. But thecriminal will never get

more punishment than he bargainedfor when he did the crime, and his guilt of the crime (and

hence the length of the sentence to which he is exposed) willbe determined beyond a reasonable doubt by the unanimous
vote of 12 of his fellow citizens.In

Justice Breyer's bureaucratic realm of perfect equity,by contrast, the facts that determine the length of sentence

to which the defendant is exposed will be determined toexist (on a more-likely-than-not basis) by a single employee
of the State. It is certainly arguable (Justice Breyer
argues it) that this sacrifice of prior protections is worth it.But it is not arguable that, just because one thinks it is a

better system, it must be, or is even more likely to be, the
system envisioned by a Constitution that guarantees trialby jury. What ultimately demolishes the case for the dis530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

senters is that they are unable to say what the right totrial by jury does guarantee if, as they assert, it does not

guarantee--what it has been assumed to guarantee through-out our history--the right to have a jury determine those
facts that determine the maximum sentence the law allows.They provide no coherent alternative.

Justice Breyer proceeds on the erroneous and all-too-common assumption that the Constitution means what we
think it ought to mean. It does not; it means what it says.And the guarantee that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right to . . . trial, by an impartialjury," has no intelligible content unless it means that all the
facts which must exist in order to subject the defendant toa legally prescribed punishment

must be found by the jury.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins as toParts I and II, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court in full. I write separatelyto explain my view that the Constitution requires a broader
rule than the Court adopts.

I
This case turns on the seemingly simple question of whatconstitutes a "crime." Under the Federal Constitution, "the

accused" has the right (1) "to be informed of the nature andcause of the accusation" (that is, the basis on which he is
accused of a crime), (2) to be "held to answer for a capital,or otherwise infamous crime" only on an indictment or presentment of a grand jury, and (3) to be tried by "an impartialjury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have
been committed." Amdts. 5 and 6. See also Art. III, $ 2,cl. 3 ("The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be by Jury"). With
the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, see Hurtado v. Cali-fornia, 110 U. S. 516, 538 (1884), the Court has held that
these protections apply in state prosecutions, Herring v.
New York, 422 U. S. 853, 857, and n. 7 (1975). Further, theCourt has held that due process requires that the jury find

beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitutethe crime. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970).

All of these constitutional protections turn on determiningwhich facts constitute the "crime"--that is, which facts are
the "elements" or "ingredients" of a crime. In order for anaccusation of a crime (whether by indictment or some other
form) to be proper under the common law, and thus properunder the codification of the common-law rights in the Fifth
and Sixth Amendments, it must allege all elements of thatcrime; likewise, in order for a jury trial of a crime to be
proper, all elements of the crime must be proved to the jury
(and, under Winship, proved beyond a reasonable doubt).See J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution $$ 928-

929, pp. 660-662, $ 934, p. 664 (1833); J. Archbold, Pleadingand Evidence in Criminal Cases *41, *99-*100 (hereinafter
Archbold).1Thus, it is critical to know which facts are elements. This
question became more complicated following the Court's
decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986),which spawned a special sort of fact known as a sentencing enhancement. See ante, at 478, 485, 494. Such a factincreases a defendant's punishment but is not subject to the
constitutional protections to which elements are subject.
Justice O'Connor's dissent, in agreement with McMillan
and Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224(1998), takes the view that a legislature is free (within unspecified outer limits) to decree which facts are elements andwhich are sentencing enhancements.

Post, at 524.
Sentencing enhancements may be new creatures, but thequestion that they create for courts is not. Courts have

1 Justice O'Connor mischaracterizes my argument. See post, at 527-
528 (dissenting opinion). Of course the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did
not codify common-law procedure wholesale. Rather, and as Story notes,
they codified a few particular common-law procedural rights. As I have
explained, the scope of those rights turns on what constitutes a "crime."
In answering that question, it is entirely proper to look to the common law.

long had to consider which facts are elements in order todetermine the sufficiency of an accusation (usually an indictment). The answer that courts have provided regarding theaccusation tells us what an element is, and it is then a simple
matter to apply that answer to whatever constitutional rightmay be at issue in a case--here, Winship and the right to
trial by jury. A long line of essentially uniform authorityaddressing accusations, and stretching from the earliest reported cases after the founding until well into the 20th cen-tury, establishes that the original understanding of which
facts are elements was even broader than the rule that theCourt adopts today.

This authority establishes that a "crime" includes everyfact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment (in contrast with a fact that mitigates punishment).Thus, if the legislature defines some core crime and then
provides for increasing the punishment of that crime upona finding of some aggravating fact--of whatever sort, including the fact of a prior conviction--the core crime andthe aggravating fact together constitute an aggravated
crime, just as much as grand larceny is an aggravated formof petit larceny. The aggravating fact is an element of the
aggravated crime. Similarly, if the legislature, rather thancreating grades of crimes, has provided for setting the punishment of a crime based on some fact--such as a fine thatis proportional to the value of stolen goods--that fact is
also an element. No multifactor parsing of statutes, of thesort that we have attempted since McMillan, is necessary.
One need only look to the kind, degree, or range of punish-ment to which the prosecution is by law entitled for a given
set of facts. Each fact necessary for that entitlement is anelement.

A
Cases from the founding to roughly the end of the CivilWar establish the rule that I have described, applying it to

Thomas, J., concurring
all sorts of facts, including recidivism. As legislatures varied common-law crimes and created new crimes, American
courts, particularly from the 1840's on, readily applied to
these new laws the common-law understanding that a fact
that is by law the basis for imposing or increasing punishment is an element.2

Massachusetts, which produced the leading cases in the
antebellum years, applied this rule as early as 1804, in Commonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. *245, and foreshadowed the
fuller discussion that was to come. Smith was indicted for
and found guilty of larceny, but the indictment failed to
allege the value of all of the stolen goods. Massachusetts
had abolished the common-law distinction between grand
and simple larceny, replacing it with a single offense of
larceny whose punishment (triple damages) was based on
the value of the stolen goods. The prosecutor relied on this
abolition of the traditional distinction to justify the indictment's omissions. The court, however, held that it could not
sentence the defendant for the stolen goods whose value was
not set out in the indictment. Id., at *246-*247.

The understanding implicit in Smith was explained in
Hope v. Commonwealth, 50 Mass. 134 (1845). Hope was indicted for and convicted of larceny. The larceny statute at

2 It is strange that Justice O'Connor faults me for beginning my analysis with cases primarily from the 1840's, rather from the time of the founding. See post, at 527-528 (dissenting opinion). As the Court explains,
ante, at 478-480, and as she concedes, post, at 525 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), the very idea of a sentencing enhancement was foreign to the common law of the time of the founding. Justice O'Connor therefore, and
understandably, does not contend that any history from the founding supports her position. As far as I have been able to tell, the argument that
a fact that was by law the basis for imposing or increasing punishment
might not be an element did not seriously arise (at least not in reported
cases) until the 1840's. As I explain below, from that time on--for at least
a century--essentially all authority rejected that argument, and much of
it did so in reliance upon the common law. I find this evidence more
than sufficient.

issue retained the single-offense structure of the statuteaddressed in Smith, and established two levels of sentencing

based on whether the value of the stolen property exceeded$100. The statute was structured similarly to the statutes
that we addressed in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227,230 (1999), and, even more, Castillo v. United States, ante,
at 122, in that it first set out the core crime and then, insubsequent clauses, set out the ranges of punishments.

3

Further, the statute opened by referring simply to "the of-fence of larceny," suggesting, at least from the perspective

of our post-McMillan cases, that larceny was the crimewhereas the value of the stolen property was merely a fact
for sentencing. But the matter was quite simple for theMassachusetts high court. Value was an element because
punishment varied with value:

"Our statutes, it will be remembered, prescribe the pun-ishment for larceny, with reference to the value of the

property stolen; and for this reason, as well as becauseit is in conformity with long established practice, the
court are of opinion that the value of the property al-leged to be stolen must be set forth in the indictment."
50 Mass., at 137.
Two years after Hope, the court elaborated on this rule in acase involving burglary, stating that if "certain acts are, by

force of the statutes, made punishable with greater severity,when accompanied with aggravating circumstances," then

3 The Massachusetts statute provided: "Every person who shall commit
the offence of larceny, by stealing of the property of another any money,
goods or chattels [or other sort of property], if the property stolen shall
exceed the value of one hundred dollars, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison, not more than five years, or by fine not exceeding
six hundred dollars, and imprisonment in the county jail, not more than
two years; and if the property stolen shall not exceed the value of one
hundred dollars, he shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison
or the county jail, not more than one year, or by fine not exceeding three
hundred dollars." Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 126, $ 17 (1836).

the statute has "creat[ed] two grades of crime." Larned v.Commonwealth, 53 Mass. 240, 242 (1847). See also id., at

241 ("[T]here is a gradation of offences of the same species"where the statute sets out "various degrees of punishment").

Conversely, where a fact was not the basis for punish-ment, that fact was, for that reason, not an element. Thus,
in Commonwealth v. McDonald, 59 Mass. 365 (1850), whichinvolved an indictment for attempted larceny from the person, the court saw no error in the failure of the indictmentto allege any value of the goods that the defendant had attempted to steal. The defendant, in challenging the indict-ment, apparently relied on

Smith and Hope, and the courtrejected his challenge by explaining that "[a]s the punishment . . . does not depend on the amount stolen, there wasno occasion for any allegation as to value in this indictment."
59 Mass., at 367. See Commonwealth v. Burke, 94 Mass.182, 183 (1866) (applying same reasoning to completed larceny from the person; finding no trial error where value wasnot proved to jury).

Similar reasoning was employed by the Wisconsin Su-preme Court in

Lacy v. State, 15 Wis. *13 (1862), in inter-preting a statute that was also similar to the statutes at issue

in Jones and Castillo. The statute, in a single paragraph,outlawed arson of a dwelling house at night. Arson that
killed someone was punishable by life in prison; arson thatdid not kill anyone was punishable by 7 to 14 years in prison;
arson of a house in which no person was lawfully dwellingwas punishable by 3 to 10 years.

4 The court had no trouble

4 The Wisconsin statute provided: "Every person who shall willfully and
maliciously burn, in the night time, the dwelling house of another, whereby
the life of any person shall be destroyed, or shall in the night time willfully
and maliciously set fire to any other building, owned by himself or another,
by the burning whereof such dwelling house shall be burnt in the night
time, whereby the life of any person shall be destroyed, shall suffer the
same punishment as provided for the crime of murder in the second degree; but if the life of no person shall have been destroyed, he shall be
punished by imprisonment in the state prison, not more than fourteen

concluding that the statute "creates three distinct statutoryoffenses," 15 Wis., at *15, and that the lawful presence of a

person in the dwelling was an element of the middle offense.The court reasoned from the gradations of punishment:
"That the legislature considered the circumstance that aperson was lawfully in the dwelling house when fire was set
to it most material and important, and as greatly aggra-vating the crime, is clear from the severity of the punishment
imposed." Id., at *16. The "aggravating circumstances"created "the higher statutory offense[s]."

Id., at *17. Be-cause the indictment did not allege that anyone had been

present in the dwelling, the court reversed the defendant's14-year sentence, but, relying on Larned, supra, the court
remanded to permit sentencing under the lowest grade ofthe crime (which was properly alleged in the indictment).
15 Wis., at *17.Numerous other state and federal courts in this period
took the same approach to determining which facts are ele-ments of a crime. See

Ritchey v. State, 7 Blackf. 168, 169(Ind. 1844) (citing Commonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. *245

(1804), and holding that indictment for arson must allegevalue of property destroyed, because statute set punishment
based on value); Spencer v. State, 13 Ohio 401, 406, 408 (1844)(holding that value of goods intended to be stolen is not
"an ingredient of the crime" of burglary with intent to steal,because punishment under statute did not depend on value;
contrasting larceny, in which "[v]alue must be laid, and valueproved, that the jury may find it, and the court, by that
means, know whether it is grand or petit, and apply thegrade of punishment the statute awards"); United States v.

rier of the mail is subject to a higher penalty where he stealsa letter out of the mail, which contains an article of value.

And when this offense is committed, the indictment mustallege the letter contained an article of value, which aggravates the offense and incurs a higher penalty"); Brightwellv.

State, 41 Ga. 482, 483 (1871) ("When the law prescribes a
different punishment for different phases of the same crime,
there is good reason for requiring the indictment to specifywhich of the phases the prisoner is charged with. The record ought to show that the defendant is convicted of theoffense for which he is sentenced"). Cf.

State v. Farr, 12
Rich. 24, 29 (S. C. App. 1859) (where two statutes barred purchasing corn from a slave, and one referred to purchasing
from slave who lacked a permit, absence of permit was not
an element, because both statutes had the same punishment).

Also demonstrating the common-law approach to determining elements was the well-established rule that, if a
statute increased the punishment of a common-law crime,
whether felony or misdemeanor, based on some fact, then
that fact must be charged in the indictment in order for the
court to impose the increased punishment. Archbold *106;
see id., at *50; ante, at 480-481. There was no question of
treating the statutory aggravating fact as merely a sentencing enhancement--as a nonelement enhancing the sentence of the common-law crime. The aggravating fact was
an element of a new, aggravated grade of the common-law
crime simply because it increased the punishment of the
common-law crime. And the common-law crime was, in relation to the statutory one, essentially just like any other
lesser included offense. See Archbold *106.

Further evidence of the rule that a crime includes every
fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment comes from early cases addressing recidivism statutes.
As Justice Scalia has explained, there was a tradition of
treating recidivism as an element. See Almendarez-Torres,
523 U. S., at 256-257, 261 (dissenting opinion). That tradi530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion stretches back to the earliest years of the Republic.See,

e. g., Commonwealth v. Welsh, 4 Va. 57 (1817); Smith v.
Commonwealth, 14 Serg. & Rawle 69 (Pa. 1826); see alsoArchbold *695-*696. For my purposes, however, what is

noteworthy is not so much the fact of that tradition as thereason for it: Courts treated the fact of a prior conviction
just as any other fact that increased the punishment by law.
By the same reasoning that the courts employed in Hope,
Lacy, and the other cases discussed above, the fact of a
prior conviction was an element, together with the facts con-stituting the core crime of which the defendant was charged,

of a new, aggravated crime.The two leading antebellum cases on whether recidivism
is an element were Plumbly v. Commonwealth, 43 Mass. 413(1841), and

Tuttle v. Commonwealth, 68 Mass. 505 (1854).
In the latter, the court explained the reason for treating asan element the fact of the prior conviction:

"When the statute imposes a higher penalty upon a sec-ond and third conviction, respectively, it makes the prior
conviction of a similar offence a part of the descriptionand character of the offence intended to be punished;
and therefore the fact of such prior conviction must becharged, as well as proved. It is essential to an indictment, that the facts constituting the offence intended to
be punished should be averred." Id., at 506.

The court rested this rule on the common law and the Massa-chusetts equivalent of the Sixth Amendment's Notice Clause.

Ibid. See also Commonwealth v. Haynes, 107 Mass. 194,198 (1871) (reversing sentence, upon confession of error by
attorney general, in case similar to Tuttle).

Numerous other cases treating the fact of a prior conviction as an element of a crime take the same view. They
make clear, by both their holdings and their language, that
when a statute increases punishment for some core crime
based on the fact of a prior conviction, the core crime and

Thomas, J., concurring
the fact of the prior crime together create a new, aggravated
crime. Kilbourn v. State, 9 Conn. 560, 563 (1833) ("No person ought to be, or can be, subjected to a cumulative penalty,
without being charged with a cumulative offence"); Plumbly,
supra, at 414 (conviction under recidivism statute is "one
conviction, upon one aggregate offence"); Hines v. State, 26
Ga. 614, 616 (1859) (reversing enhanced sentence imposed
by trial judge and explaining: "[T]he question, whether the
offence was a second one, or not, was a question for the
jury. . . . The allegation [of a prior offence] is certainly one
of the first importance to the accused, for if it is true, he
becomes subject to a greatly increased punishment"). See
also Commonwealth v. Phillips, 28 Mass. 28, 33 (1831)
("[U]pon a third conviction, the court may sentence the convict to hard labor for life. The punishment is to be awarded
upon that conviction, and for the offence of which he is then
and there convicted").

Even the exception to this practice of including the fact of
a prior conviction in the indictment and trying it to the jury
helps to prove the rule that that fact is an element because
it increases the punishment by law. In State v. Freeman,
27 Vt. 523 (1855), the Vermont Supreme Court upheld a
statute providing that, in an indictment or complaint for
violation of a liquor law, it was not necessary to allege a
prior conviction of that law in order to secure an increased
sentence. But the court did not hold that the prior conviction was not an element; instead, it held that the liquor law
created only minor offenses that did not qualify as crimes.
Thus, the state constitutional protections that would attach
were a "crime" at issue did not apply. Id., at 527; see Goeller v. State, 119 Md. 61, 66-67, 85 A. 954, 956 (1912) (discussing Freeman). At the same time, the court freely acknowledged that it had "no doubt" of the general rule, particularly

sentence is claimed on that account." Freeman, supra, at
526. Unsurprisingly, then, a leading treatise explained
Freeman as only "apparently" contrary to the general rule
and as involving a "special statute." 3 F. Wharton, Criminal
Law $ 3417, p. 307, n. r (7th rev. ed. 1874) (hereinafter Wharton). In addition, less than a decade after Freeman, the
same Vermont court held that if a defendant charged with a
successive violation of the liquor laws contested identity--
that is, whether the person in the record of the prior conviction was the same as the defendant--he should be permitted
to have a jury resolve the question. State v. Haynes, 35 Vt.
570, 572-573 (1863). (Freeman itself had anticipated this
holding by suggesting the use of a jury to resolve disputes
over identity. See 27 Vt., at 528.) In so holding, Haynes
all but applied the general rule, since a determination of
identity was usually the chief factual issue whenever recidivism was charged. See Archbold *695-*696; see also, e. g.,
Graham v. West Virginia, 224 U. S. 616, 620-621 (1912) (defendant had been convicted under three different names).5

5 Some courts read State v. Smith, 8 Rich. 460 (S. C. App. 1832), a South
Carolina case, to hold that the indictment need not allege a prior conviction in order for the defendant to suffer an enhanced punishment.
See, e. g., State v. Burgett, 22 Ark. 323, 324 (1860) (so reading Smith and
questioning its correctness). The Smith court's holding was somewhat
unclear because the court did not state whether the case involved a first
or second offense--if a first, the court was undoubtedly correct in rejecting the defendant's challenge to the indictment, because there is no need
in an indictment to negate the existence of any prior offense. See Burgett, supra, at 324 (reading indictment that was silent about prior offenses
as only charging first offense and as sufficient for that purpose). In addition, the Smith court did not acknowledge the possibility of disputes over
identity. Finally, the extent to which the court's apparent holding was
followed in practice in South Carolina is unclear, and subsequent South
Carolina decisions acknowledged that Smith was out of step with the general rule. See State v. Parris, 89 S. C. 140, 141, 71 S. E. 808, 809 (1911);
State v. Mitchell, 220 S. C. 433, 434-436, 68 S. E. 2d 350, 351-352 (1951).

B
An 1872 treatise by one of the leading authorities of the
era in criminal law and procedure confirms the common-law
understanding that the above cases demonstrate. The treatise condensed the traditional understanding regarding the
indictment, and thus regarding the elements of a crime,
to the following: "[T]he indictment must allege whatever is
in law essential to the punishment sought to be inflicted."
1 J. Bishop, Law of Criminal Procedure 50 (2d ed. 1872)
(hereinafter Bishop, Criminal Procedure). See id., $ 81, at
51 ("[T]he indictment must contain an allegation of every
fact which is legally essential to the punishment to be inflicted"); id., $ 540, at 330 ("[T]he indictment must . . . contain
an averment of every particular thing which enters into the
punishment"). Crimes, he explained, consist of those "acts
to which the law affixes . . . punishment," id., $ 80, at 51, or,
stated differently, a crime consists of the whole of "the
wrong upon which the punishment is based," id., $ 84, at 53.
In a later edition, Bishop similarly defined the elements of a
crime as "that wrongful aggregation out of which the punishment proceeds." 1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure $ 84,
p. 49 (4th ed. 1895).

Bishop grounded his definition in both a generalization
from well-established common-law practice, 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure $$ 81-84, at 51-53, and in the provisions of
Federal and State Constitutions guaranteeing notice of an
accusation in all criminal cases, indictment by a grand jury
for serious crimes, and trial by jury. With regard to the
common law, he explained that his rule was "not made apparent to our understandings by a single case only, but by
all the cases," id., $ 81, at 51, and was followed "in all
cases, without one exception," id., $ 84, at 53. To illustrate,
he observed that there are

"various statutes whereby, when . . . assault is committed with a particular intent, or with a particular

weapon, or the like, it is subjected to a particular corre-sponding punishment, heavier than that for common assault, or differing from it, pointed out by the statute.And the reader will notice that, in all cases where the
peculiar or aggravated punishment is to be inflicted, thepeculiar or aggravating matter is required to be set out
in the indictment." Id., $ 82, at 52.
He also found burglary statutes illustrative in the same way.
Id., $ 83, at 52-53. Bishop made no exception for the factof a prior conviction--he simply treated it just as any other

aggravating fact: "[If] it is sought to make the sentenceheavier by reason of its being [a second or third offence], the
fact thus relied on must be averred in the indictment; be-cause the rules of criminal procedure require the indictment,
in all cases, to contain an averment of every fact essential tothe punishment sought to be inflicted." 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on Criminal Law $ 961, pp. 564-565 (5th ed. 1872).The constitutional provisions provided further support, in
his view, because of the requirements for a proper accusa-tion at common law and because of the common-law understanding that a proper jury trial required a proper accusa-tion: "The idea of a jury trial, as it has always been known
where the common law prevails, includes the allegation, aspart of the machinery of the trial . . . . [A]n accusation
which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essen-tial to the punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements of the common law, and it is no accusation in reason."1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 87, at 55. See id., $ 88, at
56 (notice and indictment requirements ensure that before"persons held for crimes . . . shall be convicted, there
shall be an allegation made against them of every elementof crime which the law makes essential to the punishment
to be inflicted").Numerous high courts contemporaneously and explicitly
agreed that Bishop had accurately captured the common-lawunderstanding of what facts are elements of a crime. See,

In the half century following publication of Bishop's trea-tise, numerous courts applied his statement of the commonlaw understanding; most of them explicitly relied on his trea-tise. Just as in the earlier period, every fact that was by
law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment (includingthe fact of a prior conviction) was an element. Each such
fact had to be included in the accusation of the crime andproved to the jury.

Courts confronted statutes quite similar to the ones withwhich we have struggled since

McMillan, and, applying thetraditional rule, they found it not at all difficult to determine

whether a fact was an element. In Hobbs, supra, the de-fendant was indicted for a form of burglary punishable by
2 to 5 years in prison. A separate statutory section pro-vided for an increased sentence, up to double the punishment

to which the defendant would otherwise be subject, if theentry into the house was effected by force exceeding that

incidental to burglary. The trial court instructed the juryto sentence the defendant to 2 to 10 years if it found the
requisite level of force, and the jury sentenced him to 3.The Texas Supreme Court, relying on Bishop, reversed because the indictment had not alleged such force; even though
the jury had sentenced Hobbs within the range (2 to 5 years)that was permissible under the lesser crime that the indictment had charged, the court thought it "impossible tosay . . . that the erroneous charge of the court may not have
had some weight in leading the jury" to impose the sentencethat it did. 44 Tex., at 355.

6 See also Searcy v. State, 1

Tex. App. 440, 444 (1876) (similar); Garcia v. State, 19 Tex.App. 389, 393 (1885) (not citing

Hobbs, but relying on Bishop
to reverse 10-year sentence for assault with a bowie knife ordagger, where statute doubled range for assault from 2 to 7

to 4 to 14 years if the assault was committed with either
weapon but where indictment had not so alleged).

As in earlier cases, such as McDonald (discussed supra,
at 504), courts also used the converse of the Bishop rule
to explain when a fact was not an element of the crime. In
Perley, supra, the defendant was indicted for and convicted
of robbery, which was punishable by imprisonment for life

6 The gulf between the traditional approach to determining elements
and that of our recent cases is manifest when one considers how one
might, from the perspective of those cases, analyze the issue in Hobbs.
The chapter of the Texas code addressing burglary was entitled simply
"Of Burglary" and began with a section explicitly defining "the offense
of burglary." After a series of sections defining terms, it then set out
six separate sections specifying the punishment for various kinds of burglary. The section regarding force was one of these. See 1 G. Paschal,
Digest of Laws of Texas, Part II, Tit. 20, ch. 6, pp. 462-463 (4th ed. 1875).
Following an approach similar to that in Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U. S. 224, 231-234, 242-246 (1998), and Castillo v. United
States, ante, at 124-125, one would likely find a clear legislative intent to
make force a sentencing enhancement rather than an element.

or any term of years. The court, relying on Bishop, Hope,McDonald, and other authority, rejected his argument that

Maine's Notice Clause (which of course required all elementsto be alleged) required the indictment to allege the value
of the goods stolen, because the punishment did not turn onvalue: "[T]here is no provision of this statute which makes
the amount of property taken an essential element of theoffense; and there is no statute in this State which creates
degrees in robbery, or in any way makes the punishment ofthe offense dependent upon the value of the property taken."
86 Me., at 432, 30 A., at 75. The court further explainedthat "where the value is not essential to the punishment it
need not be distinctly alleged or proved." Id., at 433, 30 A.,at 76.

Reasoning similar to Perley and the Texas cases is evidentin other cases as well. See

Jones v. State, 63 Ga. 141, 143(1879) (where punishment for burglary in the day is 3 to 5

years in prison and for burglary at night is 5 to 20, time ofburglary is a "constituent of the offense"; indictment should
"charge all that is requisite to render plain and certain everyconstituent of the offense");

United States v. Woodruff, 68 F.536, 538 (Kan. 1895) (where embezzlement statute "contemplates that there should be an ascertainment of the exactsum for which a fine may be imposed" and jury did not determine amount, judge lacked authority to impose fine; "[o]nsuch an issue the defendant is entitled to his constitutional
right of trial by jury").Courts also, again just as in the pre-Bishop period, applied
the same reasoning to the fact of a prior conviction as theydid to any other fact that aggravated the punishment by law.
Many, though far from all, of these courts relied on Bishop.In 1878, Maryland's high court, in

Maguire v. State, 47 Md.485, stated the rule and the reason for it in language indistinguishable from that of Tuttle a quarter century before:

"The law would seem to be well settled, that if the partybe proceeded against for a second or third offence under

the statute, and the sentence prescribed be differentfrom the first, or severer, by reason of its being such

second or third offence, the fact thus relied on must beaverred in the indictment; for the settled rule is, that
the indictment must contain an averment of every factessential to justify the punishment inflicted." Maguire,
supra, at 496 (citing English cases, Plumbly v. Commonwealth, 43 Mass. 413 (1841), Wharton, and Bishop).

In Goeller v. State, 119 Md. 61, 85 A. 954 (1912), the samecourt reaffirmed Maguire and voided, as contrary to Maryland's Notice Clause, a statute that permitted the trial judgeto determine the fact of a prior conviction. The court extensively quoted Bishop, who had, in the court's view, treatedthe subject "more fully, perhaps, than any other legal
writer," and it cited, among other authorities, "a line ofMassachusetts decisions" and

Riggs (quoted supra, at 512).119 Md., at 66, 85 A., at 955. In Larney, 34 Ohio St., at

600-601, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in an opinion citingonly Bishop, reversed a conviction under a recidivism statute
where the indictment had not alleged any prior conviction.(The defendant had also relied on Plumbly, supra, and
Kilbourn v. State, 9 Conn. 560 (1833). 34 Ohio St., at 600.)And in State v. Adams, 64 N. H. 440, 13 A. 785 (1888), the
court, relying on Bishop, explained that "[t]he former con-viction being a part of the description and character of the
offense intended to be punished, because of the higher pen-alty imposed, it must be alleged."

Id., at 442, 13 A., at 786.The defendant had been "charged with an offense aggravated

by its repetitious character." Ibid. See also Evans v.State, 150 Ind. 651, 653, 50 N. E. 820 (1898) (similar); Shiflett
v. Commonwealth, 114 Va. 876, 877, 77 S. E. 606, 607 (1913)(similar).

Even without any reliance on Bishop, other courts ad-dressing recidivism statutes employed the same reasoning
as did he and the above cases--that a crime includes any factto which punishment attaches. One of the leading cases was

Thomas, J., concurring
Wood v. People, 53 N. Y. 511 (1873). The statute in Woodprovided for increased punishment if the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony then discharged from theconviction. The court, repeatedly referring to "the aggravated offence," id., at 513, 515, held that the facts of the priorconviction and of the discharge must be proved to the jury,
for "[b]oth enter into and make a part of the offence . . .subjecting the prisoner to the increased punishment."

Id.,at 513; see ibid. (fact of prior conviction was an "essential

ingredient" of the offense). See also Johnson v. People, 55N. Y. 512, 514 (1874) ("A more severe penalty is denounced
by the statute for a second offence; and all the facts to bringthe case within the statute must be [alleged in the indictment and] established on the trial"); People v. Sickles, 156N. Y. 541, 544-545, 51 N. E. 288, 289 (1898) (reaffirming Wood
and Johnson and explaining that "the charge is not merelythat the prisoner has committed the offense specifically described, but that, as a former convict, his second offense hassubjected him to an enhanced penalty").

Contemporaneously with the New York Court of Appealsin

Wood and Johnson, state high courts in California andPennsylvania offered similar explanations for why the fact

of a prior conviction is an element. In People v. Delany,49 Cal. 394 (1874), which involved a statute making petit
larceny (normally a misdemeanor) a felony if committedfollowing a prior conviction for petit larceny, the court left
no doubt that the fact of the prior conviction was an elementof an aggravated crime consisting of petit larceny committed
following a prior conviction for petit larceny:

"The particular circumstances of the offense are stated[in the indictment], and consist of the prior convictions

and of the facts constituting the last larceny.. . . . .
"[T]he former convictions are made to adhere to andconstitute a portion of the aggravated offense."

Id., at395.

"The felony consists both of the former convictions andof the particular larceny. . . . [T]he former convictions

See also People v. Coleman, 145 Cal. 609, 610-611, 79 P. 283,284-285 (1904).

Similarly, in Rauch v. Commonwealth, 78 Pa. 490 (1876),the court applied its 1826 decision in Smith v. Commonwealth, 14 Serg. & Rawle 69, and reversed the trial court'simposition of an enhanced sentence "upon its own knowledge
of its records." 78 Pa., at 494. The court explained that"imprisonment in jail is not a lawful consequence of a mere
conviction for an unlawful sale of liquors. It is the lawfulconsequence of a second sale only after a former conviction.
On every principle of personal security and the due adminis-tration of justice, the fact which gives rightfulness to the
greater punishment should appear in the record." Ibid.See also

id., at 495 ("But clearly the substantive offence,which draws to itself the greater punishment, is the unlawful

sale after a former conviction. This, therefore, is the veryoffence he is called upon to defend against").

Meanwhile, Massachusetts reaffirmed its earlier decisions,striking down, in Commonwealth v. Harrington, 130 Mass.
35 (1880), a liquor law that provided a small fine for a firstor second conviction, provided a larger fine or imprisonment
up to a year for a third conviction, and specifically providedthat a prior conviction need not be alleged in the complaint.
The court found this law plainly inconsistent with Tuttle andwith the State's Notice Clause, explaining that "the offence
which is punishable with the higher penalty is not fully and

7 The court held that a general plea of "guilty" to an indictment that
includes an allegation of a prior conviction applies to the fact of the prior

substantially described to the defendant, if the complaint
fails to set forth the former convictions which are essential
features of it." 130 Mass., at 36.8

Without belaboring the point any further, I simply note
that this traditional understanding--that a "crime" includes
every fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing
punishment--continued well into the 20th century, at least
until the middle of the century. See Knoll & Singer, Searching for the "Tail of the Dog": Finding "Elements" of Crimes
in the Wake of McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 22 Seattle U. L.
Rev. 1057, 1069-1081 (1999) (surveying 20th-century decisions of federal courts prior to McMillan); see also People
v. Ratner, 67 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 902, 903-906, 153 P. 2d 790,
791-793 (1944). In fact, it is fair to say that McMillan
began a revolution in the law regarding the definition of
"crime." Today's decision, far from being a sharp break
with the past, marks nothing more than a return to the
status quo ante--the status quo that reflected the original
meaning of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

III
The consequence of the above discussion for our decisions
in Almendarez-Torres and McMillan should be plain enough,
but a few points merit special mention.

conviction is a "material fac[t]" of the "aggravated offense"); Bandy v.
Hehn, 10 Wyo. 167, 172-174, 67 P. 979, 980 (1902) ("[I]n reason, and by the
great weight of authority, as the fact of a former conviction enters into
the offense to the extent of aggravating it and increasing the punishment,
it must be alleged in the information and proved like any other material

prior conviction a part of the description and character of the offense
intended to be punished" (citing Tuttle v. Commonwealth, 68 Mass. 505

First, it is irrelevant to the question of which facts are ele-ments that legislatures have allowed sentencing judges discretion in determining punishment (often within extremelybroad ranges). See ante, at 481-482; post, at 544-545
(O'Connor, J., dissenting). Bishop, immediately after set-ting out the traditional rule on elements, explained why:

"The reader should distinguish between the foregoingdoctrine, and the doctrine . . . that, within the limits
of any discretion as to the punishment which the lawmay have allowed, the judge, when he pronounces sentence, may suffer his discretion to be influenced by mat-ter shown in aggravation or mitigation, not covered
by the allegations of the indictment. . . . The aggra-vating circumstances spoken of cannot swell the penalty
above what the law has provided for the acts chargedagainst the prisoner, and they are interposed merely
to check the judicial discretion in the exercise of thepermitted mercy [in finding mitigating circumstances].
This is an entirely different thing from punishing one forwhat is not alleged against him." 1 Bishop, Criminal
Procedure $ 85, at 54.
See also 1 J. Bishop, New Commentaries on the CriminalLaw $$ 600-601, pp. 370-371, $ 948, p. 572 (8th ed. 1892) (similar). In other words, establishing what punishment isavailable by law and setting a specific punishment within the
bounds that the law has prescribed are two different things.9

9 This is not to deny that there may be laws on the borderline of this
distinction. In Brightwell v. State, 41 Ga. 482 (1871), the court stated a
rule for elements equivalent to Bishop's, then held that whether a defendant had committed arson in the day or at night need not be in the
indictment. The court explained that there was "no provision that arson
in the night shall be punished for any different period" than arson in
the day (both being punishable by 2 to 7 years in prison). Id., at 483.
Although there was a statute providing that "arson in the day time shall
be punished for a less period than arson in the night time," the court
concluded that it merely set "a rule for the exercise of [the sentencing

Cf. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Law of England371-372 (1769) (noting judges' broad discretion in setting

amount of fine and length of imprisonment for misdemeanors,but praising determinate punishment and "discretion . . .
regulated by law"); Perley, 86 Me., at 429, 432, 30 A., at 74,75-76 (favorably discussing Bishop's rule on elements without mentioning, aside from quotation of statute in state-ment of facts, that defendant's conviction for robbery exposed him to imprisonment for life or any term of years).Thus, it is one thing to consider what the Constitution
requires the prosecution to do in order to entitle itself toa particular kind, degree, or range of punishment of the
accused, see Woodruff, 68 F., at 538, and quite another toconsider what constitutional constraints apply either to the
imposition of punishment within the limits of that entitle-ment or to a legislature's ability to set broad ranges of punishment. In answering the former constitutional question,I need not, and do not, address the latter.

Second, and related, one of the chief errors of Almendarez-Torres--an error to which I succumbed--was to attempt to
discern whether a particular fact is traditionally (or typically)a basis for a sentencing court to increase an offender's sentence. 523 U. S., at 243-244; see id., at 230, 241. For the
judge's] discretion" by specifying a particular fact for the judge to consider
along with the many others that would enter into his sentencing decision.
Ibid. Cf. Jones v. State, 63 Ga. 141, 143 (1879) (whether burglary occurred
in day or at night is a "constituent of the offense" because law fixes different ranges of punishment based on this fact). And the statute attached
no definite consequence to that particular fact: A sentencing judge presumably could have imposed a sentence of seven years less one second for
daytime arson. Finally, it is likely that the statute in Brightwell, given
its language ("a less period") and its placement in a separate section, was
read as setting out an affirmative defense or mitigating circumstance.
See Wright v. State, 113 Ga. App. 436, 437-438, 148 S. E. 2d 333, 335-336

of this statute to jury upon request of defendant). See generally Archbold *52, *105-*106 (discussing rules for determining whether fact is an
element or a defense).

reasons I have given, it should be clear that this approachjust defines away the real issue. What matters is the way

by which a fact enters into the sentence. If a fact is by lawthe basis for imposing or increasing punishment--for establishing or increasing the prosecution's entitlement--it is anelement. (To put the point differently, I am aware of no
historical basis for treating as a nonelement a fact that bylaw sets or increases punishment.) When one considers the
question from this perspective, it is evident why the fact ofa prior conviction is an element under a recidivism statute.
Indeed, cases addressing such statutes provide some of thebest discussions of what constitutes an element of a crime.
One reason frequently offered for treating recidivism differ-ently, a reason on which we relied in

Almendarez-Torres,supra, at 235, is a concern for prejudicing the jury by informing it of the prior conviction. But this concern, of whichearlier courts were well aware, does not make the traditional
understanding of what an element is any less applicable tothe fact of a prior conviction. See,

e. g., Maguire, 47 Md., at498; Sickles, 156 N. Y., at 547, 51 N. E., at 290.

Third, I think it clear that the common-law rule wouldcover the McMillan situation of a mandatory minimum sentence (in that case, for visible possession of a firearm duringthe commission of certain crimes). No doubt a defendant
could, under such a scheme, find himself sentenced to thesame term to which he could have been sentenced absent the
mandatory minimum. The range for his underlying crime

10 In addition, it has been common practice to address this concern by
permitting the defendant to stipulate to the prior conviction, in which case
the charge of the prior conviction is not read to the jury, or, if the defendant decides not to stipulate, to bifurcate the trial, with the jury only considering the prior conviction after it has reached a guilty verdict on the
core crime. See, e. g., 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law $ 964, pp. 566-567 (5th
ed. 1872) (favorably discussing English practice of bifurcation); People v.
Saunders, 5 Cal. 4th 580, 587-588, 853 P. 2d 1093, 1095-1096 (1993) (detailing California approach, since 1874, of permitting stipulation and, more
recently, of also permitting bifurcation).

could be 0 to 10 years, with the mandatory minimum of 5years, and he could be sentenced to 7. (Of course, a similar

scenario is possible with an increased maximum.) But it isequally true that his expected punishment has increased as
a result of the narrowed range and that the prosecution isempowered, by invoking the mandatory minimum, to require
the judge to impose a higher punishment than he might wish.
The mandatory minimum "entitl[es] the government," Woodruff, supra, at 538, to more than it would otherwise be entitled (5 to 10 years, rather than 0 to 10 and the risk of asentence below 5). Thus, the fact triggering the mandatory

minimum is part of "the punishment sought to be inflicted,"Bishop, Criminal Procedure 50; it undoubtedly "enters into
the punishment" so as to aggravate it, id., $ 540, at 330, andis an "ac[t] to which the law affixes . . . punishment,"

id., $ 80,
at 51. Further, just as in Hobbs and Searcy, see supra, at512-513, it is likely that the change in the range available to

the judge affects his choice of sentence. Finally, in numer-ous cases, such as

Lacy, Garcia, and Jones, see supra, at
504-505, 514, the aggravating fact raised the whole range--
both the top and bottom. Those courts, in holding that sucha fact was an element, did not bother with any distinction

between changes in the maximum and the minimum. What
mattered was simply the overall increase in the punishment
provided by law. And in several cases, such as Smith
and Woodruff, see supra, at 502, 514, the very concept of
maximums and minimums had no applicability, yet the same
rule for elements applied. See also Harrington (discussed
supra, at 517-518).

Finally, I need not in this case address the implications of
the rule that I have stated for the Court's decision in Walton
v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 647-649 (1990). See ante, at 496.
Walton did approve a scheme by which a judge, rather than
a jury, determines an aggravating fact that makes a convict
eligible for the death penalty, and thus eligible for a greater
punishment. In this sense, that fact is an element. But
that scheme exists in a unique context, for in the area of cap530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ital punishment, unlike any other area, we have imposed special constraints on a legislature's ability to determine what
facts shall lead to what punishment--we have restricted the
legislature's ability to define crimes. Under our recent
capital-punishment jurisprudence, neither Arizona nor any
other jurisdiction could provide--as, previously, it freely
could and did--that a person shall be death eligible automatically upon conviction for certain crimes. We have interposed a barrier between a jury finding of a capital crime and
a court's ability to impose capital punishment. Whether this
distinction between capital crimes and all others, or some
other distinction, is sufficient to put the former outside the
rule that I have stated is a question for another day.11

For the foregoing reasons, as well as those given in the
Court's opinion, I agree that the New Jersey procedure at
issue is unconstitutional.

the Guidelines "have the force and effect of laws." Id., at 413 (Scalia,

constitutional principle; for the inconsistency of that principle with our prior cases; and for the serious doubt that the
holding cast on sentencing systems employed by the Federal
Government and States alike. Id., at 254, 264-272 (dissenting opinion). Today, in what will surely be remembered
as a watershed change in constitutional law, the Court imposes as a constitutional rule the principle it first identified
in Jones.

I

Our Court has long recognized that not every fact that
bears on a defendant's punishment need be charged in an
indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, we have held that
the "legislature's definition of the elements of the offense is
usually dispositive." McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.
79, 85 (1986); see also Almendarez-Torres v. United States,
523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998); Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S.
197, 210, 211, n. 12 (1977). Although we have recognized
that "there are obviously constitutional limits beyond which
the States may not go in this regard," id., at 210, and that
"in certain limited circumstances Winship's reasonabledoubt requirement applies to facts not formally identified as
elements of the offense charged," McMillan, supra, at 86,
we have proceeded with caution before deciding that a certain fact must be treated as an offense element despite the
legislature's choice not to characterize it as such. We have
therefore declined to establish any bright-line rule for making such judgments and have instead approached each case
individually, sifting through the considerations most relevant
to determining whether the legislature has acted properly
within its broad power to define crimes and their punishments or instead has sought to evade the constitutional requirements associated with the characterization of a fact
as an offense element. See, e. g., Monge v. California, 524
U. S. 721, 728-729 (1998); McMillan, supra, at 86.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
In one bold stroke the Court today casts aside our tradi-tional cautious approach and instead embraces a universal

and seemingly bright-line rule limiting the power of Con-gress and state legislatures to define criminal offenses and
the sentences that follow from convictions thereunder. TheCourt states: "Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any
fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, andproved beyond a reasonable doubt."

Ante, at 490. In its
opinion, the Court marshals virtually no authority to supportits extraordinary rule. Indeed, it is remarkable that the

Court cannot identify a single instance, in the over 200 yearssince the ratification of the Bill of Rights, that our Court
has applied, as a constitutional requirement, the rule it an-nounces today.

According to the Court, its constitutional rule "emergesfrom our history and case law."

Ante, at 492. None of the
history contained in the Court's opinion requires the rule itultimately adopts. The history cited by the Court can be

divided into two categories: first, evidence that judges at
common law had virtually no discretion in sentencing, ante,at 478-480, and, second, statements from a 19th-century

criminal procedure treatise that the government must
charge in an indictment and prove at trial the elements of a
statutory offense for the defendant to be sentenced to the
punishment attached to that statutory offense, ante, at 480-
481. The relevance of the first category of evidence can be
easily dismissed. Indeed, the Court does not even claim
that the historical evidence of nondiscretionary sentencing
at common law supports its "increase in the maximum
penalty" rule. Rather, almost as quickly as it recites that
historical practice, the Court rejects its relevance to the constitutional question presented here due to the conflicting
American practice of judges exercising sentencing discretion
and our decisions recognizing the legitimacy of that American practice. See ante, at 481-482 (citing Williams v. New
York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949)). Even if the Court were to

526 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
claim that the common-law history on this point did bear onthe instant case, one wonders why the historical practice of

judges pronouncing judgments in cases between private par-ties is relevant at all to the question of criminal punishment
presented here. See ante, at 479-480 (quoting 3 W. Black-stone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 396 (1768),
which pertains to "remed[ies] prescribed by law for the redress of injuries").Apparently, then, the historical practice on which the

Court places so much reliance consists of only two quotationstaken from an 1862 criminal procedure treatise. See

ante,
at 480-481 (quoting J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in
Criminal Cases 51, 188 (15th ed. 1862)). A closer examination of the two statements reveals that neither supports the
Court's "increase in the maximum penalty" rule. Both of
the excerpts pertain to circumstances in which a commonlaw felony had also been made a separate statutory offense
carrying a greater penalty. Taken together, the statements
from the Archbold treatise demonstrate nothing more than
the unremarkable proposition that a defendant could receive
the greater statutory punishment only if the indictment expressly charged and the prosecutor proved the facts that
made up the statutory offense, as opposed to simply those
facts that made up the common-law offense. See id., at 51
(indictment); id., at 188 (proof). In other words, for the defendant to receive the statutory punishment, the prosecutor
had to charge in the indictment and prove at trial the elements of the statutory offense. To the extent there is any
doubt about the precise meaning of the treatise excerpts,
that doubt is dispelled by looking to the treatise sections
from which the excerpts are drawn and the broader principle
each section is meant to illustrate. See id., at 43 ("Every
offence consists of certain acts done or omitted under certain
circumstances; and in an indictment for the offence, it is not
sufficient to charge the defendant generally with having committed it, . . . but all the facts and circumstances constituting

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
the offence must be specially set forth"); id., at 180 ("Everyoffence consists of certain acts done or omitted, under

certain circumstances, all of which must be stated in theindictment . . . and be proved as laid"). And, to the extent
further clarification is needed, the authority cited by theArchbold treatise to support its stated proposition with respect to the requirements of an indictment demonstrates
that the treatise excerpts mean only that the prosecutormust charge and then prove at trial

the elements of the statutory offense. See 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170(hereinafter Hale) ("An indictment grounded upon an offense

made by act of parliament must by express words bring the
offense within the substantial description made in the act of
parliament"). No Member of this Court questions the proposition that a State must charge in the indictment and prove
at trial beyond a reasonable doubt the actual elements of the
offense. This case, however, concerns the distinct question
of when a fact that bears on a defendant's punishment, but
which the legislature has not classified as an element of the
charged offense, must nevertheless be treated as an offense
element. The excerpts drawn from the Archbold treatise do
not speak to this question at all. The history on which the
Court's opinion relies provides no support for its "increase
in the maximum penalty" rule.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas cites additional historical evidence that, in his view, dictates an even
broader rule than that set forth in the Court's opinion. The
history cited by Justice Thomas does not require, as a matter of federal constitutional law, the application of the rule
he advocates. To understand why, it is important to focus
on the basis for Justice Thomas' argument. First, he
claims that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments "codified" preexisting common law. Second, he contends that the relevant
common law treated any fact that served to increase a defendant's punishment as an element of an offense. See ante,
at 500-501. Even if Justice Thomas' first assertion were

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
528 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
correct--a proposition this Court has not before embraced--he fails to gather the evidence necessary to support his second assertion. Indeed, for an opinion that purports to befounded upon the original understanding of the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments, Justice Thomas' concurrence is notablefor its failure to discuss any historical practice, or to cite any
decisions, predating (or contemporary with) the ratification
of the Bill of Rights. Rather, Justice Thomas divines thecommon-law understanding of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by consulting decisions rendered by Americancourts well after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, ranging
primarily from the 1840's to the 1890's. Whatever those decisions might reveal about the way American state courts
resolved questions regarding the distinction between a crime
and its punishment under general rules of criminal pleading
or their own state constitutions, the decisions fail to demonstrate any settled understanding with respect to the definition of a crime under the relevant, pre-existing common law.
Thus, there is a crucial disconnect between the historical evidence Justice Thomas cites and the proposition he seeks to
establish with that evidence.

An examination of the decisions cited by Justice Thomas
makes clear that they did not involve a simple application of
a long-settled common-law rule that any fact that increases
punishment must constitute an offense element. That would
have been unlikely, for there does not appear to have been
any such common-law rule. The most relevant common-law
principles in this area were that an indictment must charge
the elements of the relevant offense and must do so with
certainty. See, e. g., 2 Hale *182 ("Touching the thing
wherein or of which the offense is committed, there is required a certainty in an indictment"); id., at *183 ("The fact
itself must be certainly set down in an indictment"); id., at
*184 ("The offense itself must be alledged, and the manner
of it"). Those principles, of course, say little about when a
specific fact constitutes an element of the offense.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas is correct to note that American courtsin the 19th century came to confront this question in their

cases, and often treated facts that served to increase punish-ment as elements of the relevant statutory offenses. To the
extent Justice Thomas' broader rule can be drawn fromthose decisions, the rule was one of those courts' own invention, and not a previously existing rule that would have been
"codified" by the ratification of the Fifth and Sixth Amend-ments. Few of the decisions cited by

Justice Thomas indicate a reliance on pre-existing common-law principles. Infact, the converse rule that he identifies in the 19th-century

American cases--that a fact that does not make a difference in punishment need not be charged in an indictment,
see, e. g., Larned v. Commonwealth, 53 Mass. 240, 242-244
(1847)--was assuredly created by American courts, given
that English courts of roughly the same period followed a
contrary rule. See, e. g., Rex v. Marshall, 1 Moody C. C.
158, 168 Eng. Rep. 1224 (1827). Justice Thomas' collection
of state-court opinions is therefore of marginal assistance in
determining the original understanding of the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments. While the decisions Justice Thomas
cites provide some authority for the rule he advocates, they
certainly do not control our resolution of the federal constitutional question presented in the instant case and cannot,
standing alone, justify overruling three decades' worth of
decisions by this Court.

In contrast to Justice Thomas, the Court asserts that its
rule is supported by "our cases in this area." Ante, at 490.
That the Court begins its review of our precedent with a
quotation from a dissenting opinion speaks volumes about
the support that actually can be drawn from our cases for
the "increase in the maximum penalty" rule announced
today. See ante, at 484 (quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523
U. S., at 251 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). The Court then cites
our decision in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), to
demonstrate the "lesson" that due process and jury protec530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
tions extend beyond those factual determinations that affect
a defendant's guilt or innocence. Ante, at 484. The Court
explains Mullaney as having held that the due process
proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirement applies to
those factual determinations that, under a State's criminal
law, make a difference in the degree of punishment the defendant receives. Ante, at 484. The Court chooses to ignore, however, the decision we issued two years later, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), which clearly
rejected the Court's broad reading of Mullaney.

In Patterson, the jury found the defendant guilty of
second-degree murder. Under New York law, the fact that
a person intentionally killed another while under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance distinguished the reduced offense of first-degree manslaughter from the more
serious offense of second-degree murder. Thus, the presence or absence of this one fact was the defining factor separating a greater from a lesser punishment. Under New
York law, however, the State did not need to prove the absence of extreme emotional disturbance beyond a reasonable
doubt. Rather, state law imposed the burden of proving the
presence of extreme emotional disturbance on the defendant,
and required that the fact be proved by a preponderance of
the evidence. 432 U. S., at 198-200. We rejected Patterson's due process challenge to his conviction:

"We thus decline to adopt as a constitutional imperative, operative countrywide, that a State must disprove
beyond a reasonable doubt every fact constituting any
and all affirmative defenses related to the culpability of
an accused. Traditionally, due process has required
that only the most basic procedural safeguards be observed; more subtle balancing of society's interests
against those of the accused have been left to the legislative branch." Id., at 210.

531Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
Although we characterized the factual determination under
New York law as one going to the mitigation of culpability,
id., at 206, as opposed to the aggravation of the punishment,
it is difficult to understand why the rule adopted by the
Court in today's case (or the broader rule advocated by Jus-
tice Thomas) would not require the overruling of Patterson. Unless the Court is willing to defer to a legislature's
formal definition of the elements of an offense, it is clear that
the fact that Patterson did not act under the influence of
extreme emotional disturbance, in substance, "increase[d]
the penalty for [his] crime beyond the prescribed statutory
maximum" for first-degree manslaughter. Ante, at 490.
Nonetheless, we held that New York's requirement that the
defendant, rather than the State, bear the burden of proof
on this factual determination comported with the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause. Patterson, 432 U. S., at
205-211, 216; see also id., at 204-205 (reaffirming Leland v.
Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952), which upheld against due process challenge Oregon's requirement that the defendant,
rather than the State, bear the burden on factual determination of defendant's insanity).

Patterson is important because it plainly refutes the
Court's expansive reading of Mullaney. Indeed, the defendant in Patterson characterized Mullaney exactly as the
Court has today and we rejected that interpretation:

"Mullaney's holding, it is argued, is that the State
may not permit the blameworthiness of an act or the
severity of punishment authorized for its commission
to depend on the presence or absence of an identified
fact without assuming the burden of proving the presence or absence of that fact, as the case may be, beyond
a reasonable doubt. In our view, the Mullaney holding
should not be so broadly read." Patterson, supra, at
214-215 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).

532 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
We explained Mullaney instead as holding only "that a State
must prove every ingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it may not shift the burden of proof to
the defendant by presuming that ingredient upon proof of
the other elements of the offense." 432 U. S., at 215. Because nothing had been presumed against Patterson under
New York law, we found no due process violation. Id., at
216. Ever since our decision in Patterson, we have consistently explained the holding in Mullaney in these limited
terms and have rejected the broad interpretation the Court
gives Mullaney today. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 241 ("We
identified the use of a presumption to establish an essential
ingredient of the offense as the curse of the Maine law [in
Mullaney]"); Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 240 ("[Mullaney] suggests that Congress cannot permit judges to increase a sentence in light of recidivism, or any other factor,
not set forth in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt. This Court's later case, Patterson v. New
York, . . . however, makes absolutely clear that such a reading of Mullaney is wrong"); McMillan, 477 U. S., at 84
(same).

The case law from which the Court claims that its rule
emerges consists of only one other decision--McMillan v.
Pennsylvania. The Court's reliance on McMillan is also
puzzling, given that our holding in that case points to the
rejection of the Court's rule. There, we considered a Pennsylvania statute that subjected a defendant to a mandatory
minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment if a judge
found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of
the offense for which he had been convicted. Id., at 81.
The petitioners claimed that the Fourteenth Amendment's
Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment's jury trial
guarantee (as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment)
required the State to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable

533Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
doubt that they had visibly possessed firearms. We re-jected both constitutional claims.

Id., at 84-91, 93.
The essential holding of McMillan conflicts with at leasttwo of the several formulations the Court gives to the rule

it announces today. First, the Court endorses the followingprinciple: " `[I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the
prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendantis exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.' " Ante, at 490(emphasis added) (quoting

Jones, supra, at 252-253 (Ste-
vens, J., concurring)). Second, the Court endorses the rule
as restated in Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in Jones.
See ante, at 490. There, Justice Scalia wrote: "[I]t is unconstitutional to remove from the jury the assessment of
facts that alter the congressionally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed." Jones,
supra, at 253 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court appears to
hold that any fact that increases or alters the range of penalties to which a defendant is exposed--which, by definition,
must include increases or alterations to either the minimum
or maximum penalties--must be proved to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt. In McMillan, however, we rejected such
a rule to the extent it concerned those facts that increase or
alter the minimum penalty to which a defendant is exposed.
Accordingly, it is incumbent on the Court not only to admit
that it is overruling McMillan, but also to explain why such
a course of action is appropriate under normal principles of
stare decisis.

The Court's opinion does neither. Instead, it attempts to
lay claim to McMillan as support for its "increase in the
maximum penalty" rule. According to the Court, McMillan
acknowledged that permitting a judge to make findings that
expose a defendant to greater or additional punishment "may
raise serious constitutional concern." Ante, at 486. We
said nothing of the sort in McMillan. To the contrary, we

O'Connor, J., dissenting
began our discussion of the petitioners' constitutional claimsby emphasizing that we had already "rejected the claim that

whenever a State links the `severity of punishment' to `thepresence or absence of an identified fact' the State must
prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt." 477 U. S., at 84(quoting

Patterson, 432 U. S., at 214). We then reaffirmed
the rule set forth in Patterson--"that in determining what
facts must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt the statelegislature's definition of the elements of the offense is usually dispositive." McMillan, 477 U. S., at 85. Although weacknowledged that there are constitutional limits to the
State's power to define crimes and prescribe penalties, we
found no need to establish those outer boundaries in McMillan because "several factors" persuaded us that the Pennsylvania statute did not exceed those limits, however those limits might be defined. Id., at 86. The Court's assertion that
McMillan supports the application of its bright-line rule in
this area is, therefore, unfounded.

The Court nevertheless claims to find support for its rule
in our discussion of one factor in McMillan--namely, our
statement that the petitioners' claim would have had "at
least more superficial appeal" if the firearm possession finding had exposed them to greater or additional punishment.
Id., at 88. To say that a claim may have had "more superficial appeal" is, of course, a far cry from saying that a claim
would have been upheld. Moreover, we made that statement in the context of examining one of several factors that,
in combination, ultimately gave "no doubt that Pennsylvania's [statute fell] on the permissible side of the constitutional
line." Id., at 91. The confidence of that conclusion belies
any argument that our ruling would have been different had
the Pennsylvania statute instead increased the maximum
penalty to which the petitioners were exposed. In short, it
is clear that we did not articulate any bright-line rule that
States must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt any
fact that exposes a defendant to a greater punishment.

Such a rule would have been in substantial tension with bothour earlier acknowledgment that

Patterson rejected such a
rule, see 477 U. S., at 84, and our recognition that a statelegislature's definition of the elements is normally dispositive, see id., at 85. If any single rule can be derived from
McMillan, it is not the Court's "increase in the maximum
penalty" principle, but rather the following: When a State
takes a fact that has always been considered by sentencingcourts to bear on punishment, and dictates the precise

weight that a court should give that fact in setting a defend-ant's sentence, the relevant fact need not be proved to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt as would an element of the offense. See id., at 89-90.

Apart from Mullaney and McMillan, the Court does not
claim to find support for its rule in any other pre-Jones decision. Thus, the Court is in error when it says that its rule
emerges from our case law. Nevertheless, even if one were
willing to assume that Mullaney and McMillan lend some
support for the Court's position, that feeble foundation is
shattered by several of our precedents directly addressing
the issue. The only one of those decisions that the Court
addresses at any length is Almendarez-Torres. There, we
squarely rejected the "increase in the maximum penalty"
rule: "Petitioner also argues, in essence, that this Court
should simply adopt a rule that any significant increase in a
statutory maximum sentence would trigger a constitutional
`elements' requirement. We have explained why we believe
the Constitution, as interpreted in McMillan and earlier
cases, does not impose that requirement." 523 U. S., at 247.
Whether Almendarez-Torres directly refuted the "increase
in the maximum penalty" rule was extensively debated in
Jones, and that debate need not be repeated here. See 526
U. S., at 248-249; id., at 268-270 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). I continue to agree with Justice Kennedy that
Almendarez-Torres constituted a clear repudiation of the
rule the Court adopts today. See Jones, supra, at 268 (dis530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

senting opinion). My understanding is bolstered by Mongev.

California, a decision relegated to a footnote by the Court
today. In Monge, in reasoning essential to our holding, wereiterated that "the Court has rejected an absolute rule that

an enhancement constitutes an element of the offense anytime that it increases the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed." 524 U. S., at 729 (citing AlmendarezTorres). At the very least, Monge demonstrates that
Almendarez-Torres was not an "exceptional departure" from
"historic practice." Ante, at 487.Of all the decisions that refute the Court's "increase in

the maximum penalty" rule, perhaps none is as important as
Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). There, a jury found
Walton, the petitioner, guilty of first-degree murder. Under
Arizona law, a trial court conducts a separate sentencing
hearing to determine whether a defendant convicted of
first-degree murder should receive the death penalty or life
imprisonment. See id., at 643 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 13-703(B) (1989)). At that sentencing hearing, the judge,
rather than the jury, must determine the existence or nonexistence of the statutory aggravating and mitigating factors. See Walton, 497 U. S., at 643 (quoting $ 13-703(B)).
The Arizona statute directs the judge to " `impose a sentence
of death if the court finds one or more of the aggravating
circumstances enumerated in [the statute] and that there are
no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call
for leniency.' " Id., at 644 (quoting $ 13-703(E)). Thus,
under Arizona law, a defendant convicted of first-degree
murder can be sentenced to death only if the judge finds the
existence of a statutory aggravating factor.

Walton challenged the Arizona capital sentencing scheme,
arguing that the Constitution requires that the jury, and not
the judge, make the factual determination of the existence
or nonexistence of the statutory aggravating factors. We
rejected that contention: " `Any argument that the Constitution requires that a jury impose the sentence of death or

O'Connor, J., dissenting
make the findings prerequisite to imposition of such a sen-tence has been soundly rejected by prior decisions of this

Court.' " Id., at 647 (quoting Clemons v. Mississippi, 494U. S. 738, 745 (1990)). Relying in part on our decisions rejecting challenges to Florida's capital sentencing scheme,which also provided for sentencing by the trial judge, we
added that " `the Sixth Amendment does not require that the
specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentenceof death be made by the jury.' "

Walton, supra, at 648 (quoting Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U. S. 638, 640-641 (1989) (per
curiam)).

While the Court can cite no decision that would require
its "increase in the maximum penalty" rule, Walton plainly
rejects it. Under Arizona law, the fact that a statutory aggravating circumstance exists in the defendant's case " `increases the maximum penalty for [the] crime' " of first-degree
murder to death. Ante, at 476 (quoting Jones, supra, at 243,
n. 6). If the judge does not find the existence of a statutory
aggravating circumstance, the maximum punishment authorized by the jury's guilty verdict is life imprisonment. Thus,
using the terminology that the Court itself employs to describe the constitutional fault in the New Jersey sentencing
scheme presented here, under Arizona law, the judge's finding that a statutory aggravating circumstance exists "exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts
reflected in the jury verdict alone." Ante, at 483 (emphasis
in original). Even Justice Thomas, whose vote is necessary to the Court's opinion today, agrees on this point. See
ante, at 522 (concurring opinion). If a State can remove
from the jury a factual determination that makes the difference between life and death, as Walton holds that it can, it
is inconceivable why a State cannot do the same with respect
to a factual determination that results in only a 10-year increase in the maximum sentence to which a defendant is
exposed.

538 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The distinction of Walton offered by the Court today isbaffling, to say the least. The key to that distinction is the

Court's claim that, in Arizona, the jury makes all of the find-ings necessary to expose the defendant to a death sentence.
See ante, at 496-497 (quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S.,at 257, n. 2 (

Scalia, J., dissenting)). As explained above,
that claim is demonstrably untrue. A defendant convicted
of first-degree murder in Arizona cannot receive a death sen-tence unless a judge makes the factual determination that

a statutory aggravating factor exists. Without that criticalfinding, the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment, and not the death penalty. Indeed, at the time Walton was decided, the author of the
Court's opinion today understood well the issue at stake.
See Walton, 497 U. S., at 709 (Stevens, J., dissenting)
("[U]nder Arizona law, as construed by Arizona's highest
court, a first-degree murder is not punishable by a death sentence until at least one statutory aggravating circumstance
has been proved"). In any event, the extent of our holding
in Walton should have been perfectly obvious from the face
of our decision. We upheld the Arizona scheme specifically
on the ground that the Constitution does not require the jury
to make the factual findings that serve as the " `prerequisite
to imposition of [a death] sentence,' " id., at 647 (quoting
Clemons, supra, at 745), or " `the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death,' " Walton, supra,
at 648 (quoting Hildwin, supra, at 640-641). If the Court
does not intend to overrule Walton, one would be hard
pressed to tell from the opinion it issues today.

The distinction of Walton offered by Justice Thomas
is equally difficult to comprehend. According to Justice
Thomas, because the Constitution requires state legislatures
to narrow sentencing discretion in the capital punishment
context, facts that expose a convicted defendant to a capital
sentence may be different from all other facts that expose a
defendant to a more severe sentence. See ante, at 522-523.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas gives no specific reason for excepting capital defendants from the constitutional protections he would
extend to defendants generally, and none is readily apparent.
If Justice Thomas means to say that the Eighth Amendment's restriction on a state legislature's ability to define
capital crimes should be compensated for by permitting
States more leeway under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments
in proving an aggravating fact necessary to a capital sentence, his reasoning is without precedent in our constitutional jurisprudence.

In sum, the Court's statement that its "increase in the
maximum penalty" rule emerges from the history and case
law that it cites is simply incorrect. To make such a claim,
the Court finds it necessary to rely on irrelevant historical
evidence, to ignore our controlling precedent (e. g., Patterson), and to offer unprincipled and inexplicable distinctions
between its decision and previous cases addressing the same
subject in the capital sentencing context (e. g., Walton).
The Court has failed to offer any meaningful justification for
deviating from years of cases both suggesting and holding
that application of the "increase in the maximum penalty"
rule is not required by the Constitution.

II
That the Court's rule is unsupported by the history and
case law it cites is reason enough to reject such a substantial
departure from our settled jurisprudence. Significantly, the
Court also fails to explain adequately why the Due Process
Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and the
jury trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment require application of its rule. Upon closer examination, it is possible
that the Court's "increase in the maximum penalty" rule
rests on a meaningless formalism that accords, at best, marginal protection for the constitutional rights that it seeks
to effectuate.

540 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Any discussion of either the constitutional necessity or thelikely effect of the Court's rule must begin, of course, with

an understanding of what exactly that rule is. As was thecase in

Jones, however, that discussion is complicated here
by the Court's failure to clarify the contours of the constitu-tional principle underlying its decision. See

Jones, 526
U. S., at 267 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In fact, there appear
to be several plausible interpretations of the constitutionalprinciple on which the Court's decision rests.

For example, under one reading, the Court appears to holdthat the Constitution requires that a fact be submitted to a
jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt only if that fact,
as a formal matter, extends the range of punishment beyond
the prescribed statutory maximum. See, e. g., ante, at 490.
A State could, however, remove from the jury (and subject
to a standard of proof below "beyond a reasonable doubt")
the assessment of those facts that define narrower ranges of
punishment, within the overall statutory range, to which the
defendant may be sentenced. See, e. g., ante, at 494, n. 19.
Thus, apparently New Jersey could cure its sentencing
scheme, and achieve virtually the same results, by drafting
its weapons possession statute in the following manner:
First, New Jersey could prescribe, in the weapons possession
statute itself, a range of 5 to 20 years' imprisonment for one
who commits that criminal offense. Second, New Jersey
could provide that only those defendants convicted under the
statute who are found by a judge, by a preponderance of
the evidence, to have acted with a purpose to intimidate an
individual on the basis of race may receive a sentence
greater than 10 years' imprisonment.

The Court's proffered distinction of Walton v. Arizona
suggests that it means to announce a rule of only this limited
effect. The Court claims the Arizona capital sentencing
scheme is consistent with the constitutional principle underlying today's decision because Arizona's first-degree murder statute itself authorizes both life imprisonment and

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
the death penalty. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-1105(C)(1989). " `[O]nce a

jury has found the defendant guilty of
all the elements of an offense which carries as its maximumpenalty the sentence of death, it may be left to the judge to

decide whether that maximum penalty, rather than a lesserone, ought to be imposed.' "

Ante, at 497 (emphasis in original) (quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 257, n. 2
(Scalia, J., dissenting)). Of course, as explained above, anArizona sentencing judge can impose the maximum penalty

of death only if the judge first makes a statutorily requiredfinding that at least one aggravating factor exists in the defendant's case. Thus, the Arizona first-degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal
sense. In real terms, however, the Arizona sentencing
scheme removes from the jury the assessment of a fact that
determines whether the defendant can receive that maximum punishment. The only difference, then, between the
Arizona scheme and the New Jersey scheme we consider
here--apart from the magnitude of punishment at stake--is
that New Jersey has not prescribed the 20-year maximum
penalty in the same statute that it defines the crime to be
punished. It is difficult to understand, and the Court does
not explain, why the Constitution would require a state legislature to follow such a meaningless and formalistic difference in drafting its criminal statutes.

Under another reading of the Court's decision, it may
mean only that the Constitution requires that a fact be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt if it,
as a formal matter, increases the range of punishment beyond that which could legally be imposed absent that fact.
See, e. g., ante, at 482-483, 490. A State could, however,
remove from the jury (and subject to a standard of proof
below "beyond a reasonable doubt") the assessment of those
facts that, as a formal matter, decrease the range of punishment below that which could legally be imposed absent that
fact. Thus, consistent with our decision in Patterson, New

Jersey could cure its sentencing scheme, and achieve virtu-ally the same results, by drafting its weapons possession

statute in the following manner: First, New Jersey could pre-scribe, in the weapons possession statute itself, a range of 5
to 20 years' imprisonment for one who commits that criminaloffense. Second, New Jersey could provide that a defendant
convicted under the statute whom a judge finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, not to have acted with a purpose tointimidate an individual on the basis of race may receive a

sentence no greater than 10 years' imprisonment.The rule that

Justice Thomas advocates in his concurring
opinion embraces this precise distinction between a fact that
increases punishment and a fact that decreases punishment.
See ante, at 501 ("[A] `crime' includes every fact that is by
law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment (in contrast with a fact that mitigates punishment)"). The historical evidence on which Justice Thomas relies, however, demonstrates both the difficulty and the pure formalism of
making a constitutional "elements" rule turn on such a difference. For example, the Wisconsin statute considered in
Lacy v. State, 15 Wis. *13 (1862), could plausibly qualify as
either increasing or mitigating punishment on the basis of
the same specified fact. There, Wisconsin provided that the
willful and malicious burning of a dwelling house in which
"the life of no person shall have been destroyed" was punishable by 7 to 14 years in prison, but that the same burning at
a time in which "there was no person lawfully in the dwelling
house" was punishable by only 3 to 10 years in prison. Wis.
Rev. Stat., ch. 165, $ 1 (1858). Although the statute appeared to make the absence of persons from the affected
dwelling house a fact that mitigated punishment, the Wisconsin Supreme Court found that the presence of a person in
the affected house constituted an aggravating circumstance.
Lacy, supra, at *15-*16. As both this example and the
above hypothetical redrafted New Jersey statute demonstrate, see supra, at 540, whether a fact is responsible for an

O'Connor, J., dissenting
increase or a decrease in punishment rests in the eye of thebeholder. Again, it is difficult to understand, and neither

the Court nor Justice Thomas explains, why the Constitu-tion would require a state legislature to follow such a meaningless and formalistic difference in drafting its criminalstatutes.

If either of the above readings is all that the Court's decision means, "the Court's principle amounts to nothing morethan chastising [the New Jersey Legislature] for failing to

use the approved phrasing in expressing its intent as to how[unlawful weapons possession] should be punished."

Jones,
526 U. S., at 267 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). If New Jersey
can, consistent with the Constitution, make precisely the
same differences in punishment turn on precisely the same
facts, and can remove the assessment of those facts from the
jury and subject them to a standard of proof below "beyond
a reasonable doubt," it is impossible to say that the Fifth,
Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments require the Court's rule.
For the same reason, the "structural democratic constraints"
that might discourage a legislature from enacting either of
the above hypothetical statutes would be no more significant
than those that would discourage the enactment of New Jersey's present sentence-enhancement statute. See ante, at
490-491, n. 16 (majority opinion). In all three cases, the legislature is able to calibrate punishment perfectly, and subject
to a maximum penalty only those defendants whose cases
satisfy the sentence-enhancement criterion. As Justice
Kennedy explained in Jones, "[n]o constitutional values are
served by so formalistic an approach, while its constitutional
costs in statutes struck down . . . are real." 526 U. S., at 267.

Given the pure formalism of the above readings of the
Court's opinion, one suspects that the constitutional principle
underlying its decision is more far reaching. The actual
principle underlying the Court's decision may be that any
fact (other than prior conviction) that has the effect, in real
terms, of increasing the maximum punishment beyond an

O'Connor, J., dissenting
otherwise applicable range must be submitted to a jury andproved beyond a reasonable doubt. See,

e. g., ante, at 494
("[T]he relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect--does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater

punishment than that authorized by the jury's guilty ver-dict?"). The principle thus would apply not only to schemes
like New Jersey's, under which a factual determination exposes the defendant to a sentence beyond the prescribedstatutory maximum, but also to all determinate-sentencing

schemes in which the length of a defendant's sentence withinthe statutory range turns on specific factual determinations
(e. g., the federal Sentencing Guidelines). Justice Thomas
essentially concedes that the rule outlined in his concurring
opinion would require the invalidation of the Sentencing
Guidelines. See ante, at 523, n. 11.

I would reject any such principle. As explained above, it
is inconsistent with our precedent and would require the
Court to overrule, at a minimum, decisions like Patterson
and Walton. More importantly, given our approval of--and
the significant history in this country of--discretionary sentencing by judges, it is difficult to understand how the Fifth,
Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments could possibly require
the Court's or Justice Thomas' rule. Finally, in light of
the adoption of determinate-sentencing schemes by many
States and the Federal Government, the consequences of the
Court's and Justice Thomas' rules in terms of sentencing
schemes invalidated by today's decision will likely be severe.

As the Court acknowledges, we have never doubted that
the Constitution permits Congress and the state legislatures
to define criminal offenses, to prescribe broad ranges of punishment for those offenses, and to give judges discretion to
decide where within those ranges a particular defendant's
punishment should be set. See ante, at 481-482. That
view accords with historical practice under the Constitution.
"From the beginning of the Republic, federal judges were
entrusted with wide sentencing discretion. The great

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
majority of federal criminal statutes have stated only amaximum term of years and a maximum monetary fine,

permitting the sentencing judge to impose any term ofimprisonment and any fine up to the statutory maximum."
K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guide-lines in the Federal Courts 9 (1998) (footnote omitted).
Under discretionary-sentencing schemes, a judge bases the
defendant's sentence on any number of facts neither pre-sented at trial nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable

doubt. As one commentator has explained:

"During the age of broad judicial sentencing discretion,judges frequently made sentencing decisions on the

basis of facts that they determined for themselves, on
less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, without elic-iting very much concern from civil libertarians. . . . The

sentence in any number of traditional discretionary situ-ations depended quite directly on judicial findings of specific contested facts. . . . Whether because such factswere directly relevant to the judge's retributionist assessment of how serious the particular offense was(within the spectrum of conduct covered by the statute
of conviction), or because they bore on a determinationof how much rehabilitation the offender's character was
likely to need, the sentence would be higher or lower, in
some specific degree determined by the judge, based onthe judge's factual conclusions." Lynch, Towards A

Model Penal Code, Second (Federal?), 2 Buffalo Crim.L. Rev. 297, 320 (1998) (footnote omitted).

Accordingly, under the discretionary-sentencing schemes, a
factual determination made by a judge on a standard of proof
below "beyond a reasonable doubt" often made the difference
between a lesser and a greater punishment.

For example, in Williams v. New York, a jury found the
defendant guilty of first-degree murder and recommended
life imprisonment. The judge, however, rejected the jury's

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
546 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
recommendation and sentenced Williams to death on thebasis of additional facts that he learned through a presentence investigation report and that had neither beencharged in an indictment nor presented to the jury. 337
U. S., at 242-245. In rejecting Williams' due process chal-lenge to his death sentence, we explained that there was a
long history of sentencing judges exercising "wide discretion
in the sources and types of evidence used to assist [them] indetermining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law." Id., at 246. Specifically,we held that the Constitution does not restrict a judge's sentencing decision to information that is charged in an indictment and subject to cross-examination in open court. "The
due process clause should not be treated as a device for freezing the evidential procedure of sentencing in the mold of trial
procedure." Id., at 251.

Under our precedent, then, a State may leave the determination of a defendant's sentence to a judge's discretionary
decision within a prescribed range of penalties. When a
judge, pursuant to that sentencing scheme, decides to increase a defendant's sentence on the basis of certain contested facts, those facts need not be proved to a jury beyond
a reasonable doubt. The judge's findings, whether by proof
beyond a reasonable doubt or less, suffice for purposes of the
Constitution. Under the Court's decision today, however, it
appears that once a legislature constrains judges' sentencing
discretion by prescribing certain sentences that may only be
imposed (or must be imposed) in connection with the same
determinations of the same contested facts, the Constitution
requires that the facts instead be proved to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt. I see no reason to treat the two schemes
differently. See, e. g., McMillan, 477 U. S., at 92 ("We have
some difficulty fathoming why the due process calculus
would change simply because the legislature has seen fit to
provide sentencing courts with additional guidance"). In
this respect, I agree with the Solicitor General that "[a] sen530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tence that is constitutionally permissible when selected by acourt on the basis of whatever factors it deems appropriate

does not become impermissible simply because the court ispermitted to select that sentence only after making a finding
prescribed by the legislature." Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 7. Although the Court acknowledges the
legitimacy of discretionary sentencing by judges, see ante,
at 481-482, it never provides a sound reason for treatingjudicial factfinding under determinate-sentencing schemes

differently under the Constitution.

Justice Thomas' attempt to explain this distinction is
similarly unsatisfying. His explanation consists primarily
of a quotation, in turn, of a 19th-century treatise writer, who
contended that the aggravation of punishment within a statutory range on the basis of facts found by a judge " `is an
entirely different thing from punishing one for what is not
alleged against him.' " Ante, at 519 (quoting 1 J. Bishop,
Commentaries on Law of Criminal Procedure $ 85, p. 54 (rev.
2d ed. 1872)). As our decision in Williams v. New York
demonstrates, however, that statement does not accurately
describe the reality of discretionary sentencing conducted by
judges. A defendant's actual punishment can be affected in
a very real way by facts never alleged in an indictment,
never presented to a jury, and never proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In Williams' case, facts presented for the first
time to the judge, for purposes of sentencing alone, made the
difference between life imprisonment and a death sentence.

Consideration of the purposes underlying the Sixth
Amendment's jury trial guarantee further demonstrates why
our acceptance of judge-made findings in the context of discretionary sentencing suggests the approval of the same
judge-made findings in the context of determinate sentencing as well. One important purpose of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee is to protect the criminal defendant against potentially arbitrary judges. It effectuates this
promise by preserving, as a constitutional matter, certain

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
548 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
fundamental decisions for a jury of one's peers, as opposedto a judge. For example, the Court has recognized that the

Sixth Amendment's guarantee was motivated by the Englishexperience of "competition . . . between judge and jury over
the real significance of their respective roles," Jones, 526U. S., at 245, and "measures [that were taken] to diminish the
juries' power," ibid. We have also explained that the jury
trial guarantee was understood to provide "an inestimablesafeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and

against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the de-fendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to
the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of
the single judge, he was to have it." Duncan v. Louisiana,
391 U. S. 145, 156 (1968). Blackstone explained that the
right to trial by jury was critically important in criminal
cases because of "the violence and partiality of judges appointed by the crown, . . . who might then, as in France or
Turkey, imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that was obnoxious to the government, by an instant declaration, that such
is their will and pleasure." 4 Blackstone, Commentaries, at
343. Clearly, the concerns animating the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee, if they were to extend to the
sentencing context at all, would apply with greater strength
to a discretionary-sentencing scheme than to determinate
sentencing. In the former scheme, the potential for mischief by an arbitrary judge is much greater, given that the

judge's decision of where to set the defendant's sentence
within the prescribed statutory range is left almost entirely
to discretion. In contrast, under a determinate-sentencing
system, the discretion the judge wields within the statutory
range is tightly constrained. Accordingly, our approval of
discretionary-sentencing schemes, in which a defendant is
not entitled to have a jury make factual findings relevant to
sentencing despite the effect those findings have on the
severity of the defendant's sentence, demonstrates that the
defendant should have no right to demand that a jury make

O'Connor, J., dissenting
the equivalent factual determinations under a determinate-sentencing scheme.

The Court appears to hold today, however, that a defend-ant is entitled to have a jury decide, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, every fact relevant to the determination ofsentence under a determinate-sentencing scheme. If this is
an accurate description of the constitutional principle underlying the Court's opinion, its decision will have the effect ofinvalidating significant sentencing reform accomplished at

the federal and state levels over the past three decades.
Justice Thomas' rule, as he essentially concedes, see ante,
at 523, n. 11, would have the same effect.

Prior to the most recent wave of sentencing reform,
the Federal Government and the States employed
indeterminate-sentencing schemes in which judges and
executive branch officials (e. g., parole board officials) had
substantial discretion to determine the actual length of a
defendant's sentence. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Justice, S.
Shane-DuBow, A. Brown, & E. Olsen, Sentencing Reform in
the United States: History, Content, and Effect 6-7 (Aug.
1985) (hereinafter Shane-DuBow); Report of Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on Criminal Sentencing, Fair and Certain Punishment 11-13 (1976) (hereinafter Task Force Report); A. Dershowitz, Criminal Sentencing in the United
States: An Historical and Conceptual Overview, 423 Annals
Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 117, 128-129 (1976). Studies of
indeterminate-sentencing schemes found that similarly situated defendants often received widely disparate sentences.
See, e. g., Shane-Dubow 7; Task Force Report 14. Although
indeterminate sentencing was intended to soften the harsh
and uniform sentences formerly imposed under mandatorysentencing systems, some studies revealed that indeterminate sentencing actually had the opposite effect. See, e. g.,

an actual increase of the average criminal's incarceration
term"); Task Force Report 13 ("[T]he data seem to indicate
that in those jurisdictions where the sentencing structure
is more indeterminate, judicially imposed sentences tend to
be longer").

In response, Congress and the state legislatures shifted to
determinate-sentencing schemes that aimed to limit judges'
sentencing discretion and, thereby, afford similarly situated
offenders equivalent treatment. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code
Ann. $ 1170 (West Supp. 2000). The most well known of
these reforms was the federal Sentencing Reform Act of
1984, 18 U. S. C. $ 3551 et seq. In the Act, Congress created
the United States Sentencing Commission, which in turn
promulgated the Sentencing Guidelines that now govern sentencing by federal judges. See, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1998). Whether
one believes the determinate-sentencing reforms have
proved successful or not--and the subject is one of extensive
debate among commentators--the apparent effect of the
Court's opinion today is to halt the current debate on sentencing reform in its tracks and to invalidate with the stroke
of a pen three decades' worth of nationwide reform, all in
the name of a principle with a questionable constitutional
pedigree. Indeed, it is ironic that the Court, in the name of
constitutional rights meant to protect criminal defendants
from the potentially arbitrary exercise of power by prosecutors and judges, appears to rest its decision on a principle
that would render unconstitutional efforts by Congress and
the state legislatures to place constraints on that very power
in the sentencing context.

Finally, perhaps the most significant impact of the Court's
decision will be a practical one--its unsettling effect on
sentencing conducted under current federal and state
determinate-sentencing schemes. As I have explained, the
Court does not say whether these schemes are constitutional,

O'Connor, J., dissenting
but its reasoning strongly suggests that they are not. Thus,
with respect to past sentences handed down by judges under
determinate-sentencing schemes, the Court's decision threatens to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted defendants
seeking to invalidate their sentences in whole or in part on
the authority of the Court's decision today. Statistics compiled by the United States Sentencing Commission reveal
that almost a half-million cases have been sentenced under
the Sentencing Guidelines since 1989. See Memorandum
from U. S. Sentencing Commission to Supreme Court Library, dated June 8, 2000 (total number of cases sentenced
under federal Sentencing Guidelines since 1989) (available
in Clerk of Court's case file). Federal cases constitute only
the tip of the iceberg. In 1998, for example, federal criminal prosecutions represented only about 0.4% of the total
number of criminal prosecutions in federal and state courts.
See National Center for State Courts, A National Perspective: Court Statistics Project (federal and state court
filings, 1998), http://www.ncsc.dni.us/divisions/research/csp/
csp98-fscf.html (showing that, in 1998, 57,691 criminal cases
were filed in federal court compared to 14,623,330 in state
courts) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). Because
many States, like New Jersey, have determinate-sentencing
schemes, the number of individual sentences drawn into
question by the Court's decision could be colossal.

The decision will likely have an even more damaging effect
on sentencing conducted in the immediate future under current determinate-sentencing schemes. Because the Court
fails to clarify the precise contours of the constitutional principle underlying its decision, federal and state judges are
left in a state of limbo. Should they continue to assume
the constitutionality of the determinate-sentencing schemes
under which they have operated for so long, and proceed to
sentence convicted defendants in accord with those governing statutes and guidelines? The Court provides no answer,

552 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
yet its reasoning suggests that each new sentence will reston shaky ground. The most unfortunate aspect of today's

decision is that our precedents did not foreordain this disrup-tion in the world of sentencing. Rather, our cases traditionally took a cautious approach to questions like the one pre-sented in this case. The Court throws that caution to the
wind and, in the process, threatens to cast sentencing in theUnited States into what will likely prove to be a lengthy
period of considerable confusion.

III
Because I do not believe that the Court's "increase in themaximum penalty" rule is required by the Constitution,

I would evaluate New Jersey's sentence-enhancement stat-ute, N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 2C:44-3 (West Supp. 2000), by analyzing the factors we have examined in past cases. See, e. g.,Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 242-243; McMillan, 477
U. S., at 86-90. First, the New Jersey statute does not shiftthe burden of proof on an essential ingredient of the offense
by presuming that ingredient upon proof of other elementsof the offense. See, e. g., id., at 86-87; Patterson, 432 U. S.,
at 215. Second, the magnitude of the New Jersey sentenceenhancement, as applied in petitioner's case, is constitutionally permissible. Under New Jersey law, the weapons pos-session offense to which petitioner pleaded guilty carries a
sentence range of 5 to 10 years' imprisonment. N. J. Stat.Ann. $$ 2C:39-4(a), 2C:43-6(a)(2) (West 1995). The fact that
petitioner, in committing that offense, acted with a purposeto intimidate because of race exposed him to a higher sentence range of 10 to 20 years' imprisonment. $ 2C:43-7(a)(3). The 10-year increase in the maximum penalty to
which petitioner was exposed falls well within the range we
have found permissible. See Almendarez-Torres, supra, at226, 242-243 (approving 18-year enhancement). Third, the

New Jersey statute gives no impression of having been

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

553Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
enacted to evade the constitutional requirements that attach
when a State makes a fact an element of the charged offense.
For example, New Jersey did not take what had previously
been an element of the weapons possession offense and transform it into a sentencing factor. See McMillan, 477 U. S.,
at 89.

In sum, New Jersey "simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment"--a defendant's motive for committing the criminal
offense--"and dictated the precise weight to be given that
factor" when the motive is to intimidate a person because
of race. Id., at 89-90. The Court claims that a purpose to
intimidate on account of race is a traditional mens rea element, and not a motive. See ante, at 492-493. To make
this claim, the Court finds it necessary once again to ignore
our settled precedent. In Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S.
476 (1993), we considered a statute similar to the one at issue
here. The Wisconsin statute provided for an increase in a
convicted defendant's punishment if the defendant intentionally selected the victim of the crime because of that victim's
race. Id., at 480. In a unanimous decision upholding the
statute, we specifically characterized it as providing a sentence enhancement based on the "motive" of the defendant.
See id., at 485 (distinguishing between punishment of defendant's "criminal conduct" and penalty enhancement "for conduct motivated by a discriminatory point of view" (emphasis
added)); id., at 484-485 ("[U]nder the Wisconsin statute the
same criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the
victim is selected because of his race . . . than if no such
motive obtained" (emphasis added)). That same characterization applies in the case of the New Jersey statute. As
we also explained in Mitchell, the motive for committing an
offense has traditionally been an important factor in determining a defendant's sentence. Id., at 485. New Jersey,
therefore, has done no more than what we held permissible

554 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

O'Connor, J., dissenting
in McMillan; it has taken a traditional sentencing factor and
dictated the precise weight judges should attach to that factor when the specific motive is to intimidate on the basis
of race.

The New Jersey statute resembles the Pennsylvania statute we upheld in McMillan in every respect but one. That
difference--that the New Jersey statute increases the maximum punishment to which petitioner was exposed--does not
persuade me that New Jersey "sought to evade the constitutional requirements associated with the characterization of
a fact as an offense element." Supra, at 524. There is no
question that New Jersey could prescribe a range of 5 to 20
years' imprisonment as punishment for its weapons possession offense. Thus, as explained above, the specific means
by which the State chooses to control judges' discretion
within that permissible range is of no moment. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 207-208 ("The Due Process Clause, as we see
it, does not put New York to the choice of abandoning [the
affirmative defense] or undertaking to disprove [its] existence in order to convict of a crime which otherwise is within
its constitutional powers to sanction by substantial punishment"). The New Jersey statute also resembles in virtually every respect the federal statute we considered in
Almendarez-Torres. That the New Jersey statute provides
an enhancement based on the defendant's motive while the
statute in Almendarez-Torres provided an enhancement
based on the defendant's commission of a prior felony is a
difference without constitutional importance. Both factors
are traditional bases for increasing an offender's sentence
and, therefore, may serve as the grounds for a sentence
enhancement.

On the basis of our prior precedent, then, I would hold
that the New Jersey sentence-enhancement statute is constitutional, and affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of
New Jersey.

Justice Breyer, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.

The majority holds that the Constitution contains the fol-lowing requirement: "[A]ny fact [other than recidivism] that
increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed stat-utory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved
beyond a reasonable doubt." Ante, at 490. This rule wouldseem to promote a procedural ideal--that of juries, not
judges, determining the existence of those facts upon whichincreased punishment turns. But the real world of criminal
justice cannot hope to meet any such ideal. It can functiononly with the help of procedural compromises, particularly
in respect to sentencing. And those compromises, which arethemselves necessary for the fair functioning of the criminal
justice system, preclude implementation of the proceduralmodel that today's decision reflects. At the very least, the
impractical nature of the requirement that the majority nowrecognizes supports the proposition that the Constitution
was not intended to embody it.

I
In modern times, the law has left it to the sentencingjudge to find those facts which (within broad sentencing

limits set by the legislature) determine the sentence of aconvicted offender. The judge's factfinding role is not inevitable. One could imagine, for example, a pure "charge of-fense" sentencing system in which the degree of punishment
depended only upon the crime charged (e. g., eight mandatoryyears for robbery, six for arson, three for assault). But such
a system would ignore many harms and risks of harm thatthe offender caused or created, and it would ignore many
relevant offender characteristics. See United States Sen-tencing Commission, Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements, Part A, at 1.5 (1987) (hereinafter Sentencing Guide-lines or Guidelines) (pointing out that a "charge offense"

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
556 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

Breyer, J., dissenting
system by definition would ignore any fact "that did not con-stitute [a] statutory elemen[t] of the offens[e] of which the

defendant was convicted"). Hence, that imaginary "chargeoffense" system would not be a fair system, for it would lack
proportionality, i. e., it would treat different offenders simi-larly despite major differences in the manner in which each
committed the same crime.

There are many such manner-related differences in re-spect to criminal behavior. Empirical data collected by the

Sentencing Commission make clear that, before the Guide-lines, judges who exercised discretion within broad legislatively determined sentencing limits (say, a range of 0 to 20
years) would impose very different sentences upon offenders
engaged in the same basic criminal conduct, depending, for
example, upon the amount of drugs distributed (in respect
to drug crimes), the amount of money taken (in respect to
robbery, theft, or fraud), the presence or use of a weapon,
injury to a victim, the vulnerability of a victim, the offender's
role in the offense, recidivism, and many other offenserelated or offender-related factors. See United States Sentencing Commission, Supplementary Report on the Initial
Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements 35-39 (1987)
(hereinafter Supplementary Report) (table listing data representing more than 20 such factors); see generally Department of Justice, W. Rhodes & C. Conly, Analysis of Federal
Sentencing (May 1981). The majority does not deny that
judges have exercised, and, constitutionally speaking, may
exercise sentencing discretion in this way.

Nonetheless, it is important for present purposes to understand why judges, rather than juries, traditionally have determined the presence or absence of such sentence-affecting
facts in any given case. And it is important to realize that
the reason is not a theoretical one, but a practical one. It
does not reflect (Justice Scalia's opinion to the contrary
notwithstanding) an ideal of procedural "fairness," ante, at
498 (concurring opinion), but rather an administrative need

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

557Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)
Breyer, J., dissenting
for procedural compromise. There are, to put it simply, fartoo many potentially relevant sentencing factors to permit

submission of all (or even many) of them to a jury. As theSentencing Guidelines state the matter,

"[a] bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the rob-ber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened
(or merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously),tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, a teller or a customer, at night (or at noon), for a bad (or arguably lessbad) motive, in an effort to obtain money for other
crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few(or many) other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time
that day, while sober (or under the influence of drugs or
alcohol), and so forth." Sentencing Guidelines, Part A,at 1.2.

The Guidelines note that "a sentencing system tailored to
fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case can become un-workable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect." Ibid. To ask a jury toconsider all, or many, such matters would do the same.

At the same time, to require jury consideration of all
such factors--say, during trial where the issue is guilt orinnocence--could easily place the defendant in the awkward

(and conceivably unfair) position of having to deny he com-mitted the crime yet offer proof about how he committed
it, e. g., "I did not sell drugs, but I sold no more than 500grams." And while special postverdict sentencing juries
could cure this problem, they have seemed (but for capitalcases) not worth their administrative costs. Hence, before
the Guidelines, federal sentencing judges typically would
obtain relevant factual sentencing information from probation officers' presentence reports, while permitting a convicted offender to challenge the information's accuracy at a
hearing before the judge without benefit of trial-type evidentiary rules. See Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241,

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
249-251 (1949) (describing the modern "practice of individ-ualizing punishments" under which judges often consider

otherwise inadmissible information gleaned from probationreports); see also Kadish, Legal Norm and Discretion in
the Police and Sentencing Processes, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 904,915-917 (1962).

It is also important to understand how a judge traditionally determined which factors should be taken into ac-count for sentencing purposes. In principle, the number

of potentially relevant behavioral characteristics is endless.A judge might ask, for example, whether an unlawfully possessed knife was "a switchblade, drawn or concealed, opened
or closed, large or small, used in connection with a car theft
(where victim confrontation is rare), a burglary (where confrontation is unintended) or a robbery (where confrontation
is intentional)." United States Sentencing Commission,
Preliminary Observations of the Commission on Commissioner Robinson's Dissent 3, n. 3 (May 1, 1987). Again, the
method reflects practical, rather than theoretical, considerations. Prior to the Sentencing Guidelines, federal law left
the individual sentencing judge free to determine which factors were relevant. That freedom meant that each judge, in
an effort to tailor punishment to the individual offense and
offender, was guided primarily by experience, relevance, and
a sense of proportional fairness. Cf. Supplementary Report
16-17 (noting that the goal of the Sentencing Guidelines was
to create greater sentencing uniformity among judges, but
in doing so the Guidelines themselves had to rely primarily
upon empirical studies that showed which factors had proved
important to federal judges in the past).

Finally, it is important to understand how a legislature
decides which factual circumstances among all those potentially related to generally harmful behavior it should transform into elements of a statutorily defined crime (where
they would become relevant to the guilt or innocence of an
accused), and which factual circumstances it should leave to

Breyer, J., dissenting
the sentencing process (where, as sentencing factors, theywould help to determine the sentence imposed upon one who

has been found guilty). Again, theory does not provide ananswer. Legislatures, in defining crimes in terms of elements, have looked for guidance to common-law tradition, tohistory, and to current social need. And, traditionally, the
Court has left legislatures considerable freedom to make theelement determination. See

Almendarez-Torres v. UnitedStates, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998); McMillan v. Pennsylvania,

477 U. S. 79, 85 (1986).By placing today's constitutional question in a broader
context, this brief survey may help to clarify the nature oftoday's decision. It also may explain why, in respect to
sentencing systems, proportionality, uniformity, and admin-istrability are all aspects of that basic "fairness" that the
Constitution demands. And it suggests my basic problemwith the Court's rule: A sentencing system in which judges
have discretion to find sentencing-related factors is a work-able system and one that has long been thought consistent
with the Constitution; why, then, would the Constitutiontreat sentencing

statutes any differently?

II
As Justice Thomas suggests, until fairly recent timesmany legislatures rarely focused upon sentencing factors.

Rather, it appears they simply identified typical forms ofantisocial conduct, defined basic "crimes," and attached a
broad sentencing range to each definition--leaving judgesfree to decide how to sentence within those ranges in light
of such factors as they found relevant. Ante, at 510-512, 518(concurring opinion). But the Constitution does not freeze
19th-century sentencing practices into permanent law. Anddissatisfaction with the traditional sentencing system (reflecting its tendency to treat similar cases differently) hasled modern legislatures to write new laws that refer specifically to sentencing factors. See Supplementary Report 1

Breyer, J., dissenting
(explaining that "a growing recognition of the need tobring greater rationality and consistency to penal statutes

and to sentences imposed under those statutes" led to reformefforts such as the Federal Sentencing Guidelines).

Legislatures have tended to address the problem of toomuch judicial sentencing discretion in two ways. First,
legislatures sometimes have created sentencing commissions armed with delegated authority to make more uni-form judicial exercise of that discretion. Congress, for example, has created a federal Sentencing Commission, givingit the power to create Guidelines that (within the sentencing
range set by individual statutes) reflect the host of factors
that might be used to determine the actual sentence imposed
for each individual crime. See 28 U. S. C. $ 994(a); see also
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual
(Nov. 1999). Federal judges must apply those Guidelines in
typical cases (those that lie in the "heartland" of the crime
as the statute defines it) while retaining freedom to depart
in atypical cases. Id., ch. 1, pt. A, 4(b).

Second, legislatures sometimes have directly limited the
use (by judges or by a commission) of particular factors in
sentencing, either by specifying statutorily how a particular
factor will affect the sentence imposed or by specifying
how a commission should use a particular factor when writing a guideline. Such a statute might state explicitly, for
example, that a particular factor, say, use of a weapon, recidivism, injury to a victim, or bad motive, "shall" increase,
or "may" increase, a particular sentence in a particular way.
See, e. g., McMillan, supra, at 83 (Pennsylvania statute expressly treated "visible possession of a firearm" as a sentencing consideration that subjected a defendant to a mandatory 5-year term of imprisonment).

The issue the Court decides today involves this second
kind of legislation. The Court holds that a legislature cannot enact such legislation (where an increase in the maximum is involved) unless the factor at issue has been charged,

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

561Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)
Breyer, J., dissenting
tried to a jury, and found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.
My question in respect to this holding is, simply, "why would
the Constitution contain such a requirement"?

III
In light of the sentencing background described in Parts
I and II, I do not see how the majority can find in the Constitution a requirement that "any fact" (other than recidivism) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime "must
be submitted to a jury." Ante, at 490. As Justice O'Con-
nor demonstrates, this Court has previously failed to view
the Constitution as embodying any such principle, while
sometimes finding to the contrary. See Almendarez-Torres,
supra, at 239-247; McMillan, supra, at 84-91. The majority raises no objection to traditional pre-Guidelines sentencing procedures under which judges, not juries, made
the factual findings that would lead to an increase in an individual offender's sentence. How does a legislative determination differ in any significant way? For example, if a
judge may on his or her own decide that victim injury or bad
motive should increase a bank robber's sentence from 5 years
to 10, why does it matter that a legislature instead enacts a
statute that increases a bank robber's sentence from 5 years
to 10 based on this same judicial finding?

With the possible exception of the last line of Justice
Scalia's concurring opinion, the majority also makes no
constitutional objection to a legislative delegation to a commission of the authority to create guidelines that determine
how a judge is to exercise sentencing discretion. See also

ante, at 523, n. 11 (Thomas, J., concurring) (reserving the
question). But if the Constitution permits Guidelines, why
does it not permit Congress similarly to guide the exercise
of a judge's sentencing discretion? That is, if the Constitution permits a delegatee (the commission) to exercise
sentencing-related rulemaking power, how can it deny the

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
562 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEY

Breyer, J., dissenting
delegator (the legislature) what is, in effect, the same rule-making power?

The majority appears to offer two responses. First, it ar-gues for a limiting principle that would prevent a legislature
with broad authority from transforming ( jury-determined)facts that constitute elements of a crime into ( judgedetermined) sentencing factors, thereby removing procedural protections that the Constitution would otherwise re-quire. See

ante, at 486 ("[C]onstitutional limits" prevent
States from "defin[ing] away facts necessary to constitute acriminal offense"). The majority's cure, however, is not

aimed at the disease.

The same "transformational" problem exists under traditional sentencing law, where legislation, silent as to sentencing factors, grants the judge virtually unchecked discretion
to sentence within a broad range. Under such a system,
judges or prosecutors can similarly "transform" crimes, punishing an offender convicted of one crime as if he had committed another. A prosecutor, for example, might charge an
offender with five counts of embezzlement (each subject to a
10-year maximum penalty), while asking the judge to impose
maximum and consecutive sentences because the embezzler
murdered his employer. And, as part of the traditional sentencing discretion that the majority concedes judges retain,
the judge, not a jury, would determine the last-mentioned
relevant fact, i. e., that the murder actually occurred.

This egregious example shows the problem's complexity.
The source of the problem lies not in a legislature's power
to enact sentencing factors, but in the traditional legislative
power to select elements defining a crime, the traditional
legislative power to set broad sentencing ranges, and the traditional judicial power to choose a sentence within that range
on the basis of relevant offender conduct. Conversely, the
solution to the problem lies, not in prohibiting legislatures
from enacting sentencing factors, but in sentencing rules
that determine punishments on the basis of properly defined

530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
relevant conduct, with sensitivity to the need for proceduralprotections where sentencing factors are determined by a

judge (for example, use of a "reasonable doubt" standard),and invocation of the Due Process Clause where the history
of the crime at issue, together with the nature of the factsto be proved, reveals unusual and serious procedural unfairness. Cf. McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88 (upholding statute in
part because it "gives no impression of having been tailoredto permit the [sentencing factor] to be a tail which wags the

dog of the substantive offense").Second, the majority, in support of its constitutional rule,
emphasizes the concept of a statutory "maximum." The
Court points out that a sentencing judge (or a commission)
traditionally has determined, and now still determines, sentences within a legislated range capped by a maximum (a
range that the legislature itself sets). See ante, at 481-482.
I concede the truth of the majority's statement, but I do not
understand its relevance.

From a defendant's perspective, the legislature's decision
to cap the possible range of punishment at a statutorily prescribed "maximum" would affect the actual sentence imposed
no differently than a sentencing commission's (or a sentencing judge's) similar determination. Indeed, as a practical
matter, a legislated mandatory "minimum" is far more important to an actual defendant. A judge and a commission,
after all, are legally free to select any sentence below a statute's maximum, but they are not free to subvert a statutory
minimum. And, as Justice Thomas indicates, all the considerations of fairness that might support submission to a
jury of a factual matter that increases a statutory maximum
apply a fortiori to any matter that would increase a statutory minimum. See ante, at 521-522 (concurring opinion).
To repeat, I do not understand why, when a legislature authorizes a judge to impose a higher penalty for bank robbery
(based, say, on the court's finding that a victim was injured
or the defendant's motive was bad), a new crime is born; but

where a legislature requires a judge to impose a higher pen-alty than he otherwise would (within a pre-existing statutory

range) based on similar criteria, it is not. Cf. Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 246.

IV
I certainly do not believe that the present sentencingsystem is one of "perfect equity,"

ante, at 498 (Scalia, J.,concurring), and I am willing, consequently, to assume that

the majority's rule would provide a degree of increased pro-cedural protection in respect to those particular sentencing
factors currently embodied in statutes. I nonetheless be-lieve that any such increased protection provides little practical help and comes at too high a price. For one thing, byleaving mandatory minimum sentences untouched, the majority's rule simply encourages any legislature interestedin asserting control over the sentencing process to do so
by creating those minimums. That result would mean sig-nificantly less procedural fairness, not more.

For another thing, this Court's case law, prior to Jonesv.

United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6 (1999), led legis-latures to believe that they were permitted to increase a

statutory maximum sentence on the basis of a sentencingfactor. See ante, at 529-539 (O'C

onnor, J., dissenting); seealso,
e. g., McMillan, supra, at 84-91 (indicating that a leg-islature could impose mandatory sentences on the basis of

sentencing factors, thereby suggesting it could impose moreflexible statutory maximums on same basis). And legislatures may well have relied upon that belief. See, e. g., 21U. S. C. $ 841(b) (1994 ed. and Supp. III) (providing penalties
for, among other things, possessing a "controlled substance"with intent to distribute it, which sentences vary dramatically depending upon the amount of the drug possessed,without requiring jury determination of the amount); N. J.

(West Supp. 2000) (similar); see also Cal. Court Rule 420(b)(1996) (providing that "[c]ircumstances in aggravation and
mitigation" are to be established by the sentencing judgebased on "the case record, the probation officer's report,
[and] other reports and statements properly received").

As Justice O'Connor points out, the majority's rulecreates serious uncertainty about the constitutionality of

such statutes and about the constitutionality of the con-finement of those punished under them. See

ante, at 549-
552 (dissenting opinion). The few amicus briefs that the
Court received in this case do not discuss the impact of
the Court's new rule on, for example, drug crime statutes
or state criminal justice systems. This fact, I concede,
may suggest that my concerns about disruption are overstated; yet it may also suggest that (despite Jones and given
Almendarez-Torres) so absolute a constitutional prohibition
is unexpected. Moreover, the rationale that underlies the
Court's rule suggests a principle--jury determination of all
sentencing-related facts--that, unless restricted, threatens
the workability of every criminal justice system (if applied
to judges) or threatens efforts to make those systems more
uniform, hence more fair (if applied to commissions).

Finally, the Court's new rule will likely impede legislative
attempts to provide authoritative guidance as to how courts
should respond to the presence of traditional sentencing
factors. The factor at issue here--motive--is such a factor.
Whether a robber takes money to finance other crimes or
to feed a starving family can matter, and long has mattered, when the length of a sentence is at issue. The State
of New Jersey has determined that one motive--racial hatred--is particularly bad and ought to make a difference in
respect to punishment for a crime. That determination is
reasonable. The procedures mandated are consistent with
traditional sentencing practice. Though additional proce530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dural protections might well be desirable, for the reasons
Justice O'Connor discusses and those I have discussed,I do not believe the Constitution requires them where ordinary sentencing factors are at issue. Consequently, in myview, New Jersey's statute is constitutional.

I respectfully dissent.

CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY et al. v. JONES,SECRETARY OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-401. Argued April 24, 2000--Decided June 26, 2000
One way that candidates for public office in California gain access to the

general ballot is by winning a qualified political party's primary. In
1996, Proposition 198 changed the State's partisan primary from a
closed primary, in which only a political party's members can vote on
its nominees, to a blanket primary, in which each voter's ballot lists
every candidate regardless of party affiliation and allows the voter to
choose freely among them. The candidate of each party who wins the
most votes is that party's nominee for the general election. Each of
petitioner political parties prohibits nonmembers from voting in the
party's primary. They filed suit against respondent state official, alleging, inter alia, that the blanket primary violated their First Amendment rights of association. Respondent Californians for an Open Primary intervened. The District Court held that the primary's burden
on petitioners' associational rights was not severe and was justified by
substantial state interests. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held: California's blanket primary violates a political party's First Amendment right of association. Pp. 572-586.

(a) States play a major role in structuring and monitoring the primary election process, but the processes by which political parties select their nominees are not wholly public affairs that States may regulate freely. To the contrary, States must act within limits imposed by
the Constitution when regulating parties' internal processes. See, e. g.,
Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214.
Respondents misplace their reliance on Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S.
649, and Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461, which held not that party affairs
are public affairs, free of First Amendment protections, see, e. g., Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, but only that, when a
State prescribes an election process that gives a special role to political
parties, the parties' discriminatory action becomes state action under
the Fifteenth Amendment. This Nation has a tradition of political associations in which citizens band together to promote candidates who
espouse their political views. The First Amendment protects the freedom to join together to further common political beliefs, id., at 214-215,
which presupposes the freedom to identify those who constitute the

association, and to limit the association to those people, Democratic
Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107,
122. In no area is the political association's right to exclude more important than in its candidate-selection process. That process often
determines the party's positions on significant public policy issues, and
it is the nominee who is the party's ambassador charged with winning
the general electorate over to its views. The First Amendment reserves a special place, and accords a special protection, for that process,
Eu, supra, at 224, because the moment of choosing the party's nominee
is the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be
translated into concerted action, and hence to political power, Tashjian,
supra, at 216. California's blanket primary violates these principles.
Proposition 198 forces petitioners to adulterate their candidate-selection
process--a political party's basic function--by opening it up to persons
wholly unaffiliated with the party, who may have different views from
the party. Such forced association has the likely outcome--indeed, it is
Proposition 198's intended outcome--of changing the parties' message.
Because there is no heavier burden on a political party's associational freedom, Proposition 198 is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling state interest. See Timmons v. Twin
Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 358. Pp. 572-582.

(b) None of respondents' seven proffered state interests--producing
elected officials who better represent the electorate, expanding candidate debate beyond the scope of partisan concerns, ensuring that disenfranchised persons enjoy the right to an effective vote, promoting
fairness, affording voters greater choice, increasing voter participation,
and protecting privacy--is a compelling interest justifying California's
intrusion into the parties' associational rights. Pp. 582-586.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the State ofCalifornia may, consistent with the First Amendment to

the United States Constitution, use a so-called "blanket"primary to determine a political party's nominee for the
general election. I

Under California law, a candidate for public office has tworoutes to gain access to the general ballot for most state and
federal elective offices. He may receive the nomination ofa qualified political party by winning its primary,

gubernatorial election, one of its statewide candidates polled at least two
percent of the statewide vote; (2) the party's membership is at least one

or (3) voters numbering at least 10 percent of the statewide vote at the
last gubernatorial election sign a petition stating that they intend to form
a new party. See Cal. Elec. Code Ann. $ 5100 (West 1996 and Supp. 2000).

Until 1996, to determine the nominees of qualified partiesCalifornia held what is known as a "closed" partisan primary, in which only persons who are members of the politi-cal party--

i. e., who have declared affiliation with that partywhen they register to vote, see Cal. Elec. Code Ann. $$ 2150,

2151 (West 1996 and Supp. 2000)--can vote on its nominee,see Cal. Elec. Code Ann. $ 2151 (West 1996). In 1996 the
citizens of California adopted by initiative Proposition 198.Promoted largely as a measure that would "weaken" party
"hard-liners" and ease the way for "moderate problem-solvers," App. 89-90 (reproducing ballot pamphlet distributed to voters), Proposition 198 changed California'spartisan primary from a closed primary to a blanket primary.
Under the new system, "[a]ll persons entitled to vote, includ-ing those not affiliated with any political party, shall have
the right to vote . . . for any candidate regardless of thecandidate's political affiliation." Cal. Elec. Code Ann. $ 2001
(West Supp. 2000); see also $ 2151. Whereas under theclosed primary each voter received a ballot limited to candidates of his own party, as a result of Proposition 198 eachvoter's primary ballot now lists every candidate regardless
of party affiliation and allows the voter to choose freelyamong them. It remains the case, however, that the candidate of each party who wins the greatest number of votes"is the nominee of that party at the ensuing general election." Cal. Elec. Code Ann. $ 15451 (West 1996).2

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners in this case are four political parties--the California Democratic Party, the California Republican Party,
the Libertarian Party of California, and the Peace and Freedom Party--each of which has a rule prohibiting persons not
members of the party from voting in the party's primary.3
Petitioners brought suit in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of California against respondent
California Secretary of State, alleging, inter alia, that California's blanket primary violated their First Amendment
rights of association, and seeking declaratory and injunctive
relief. The group Californians for an Open Primary, also
respondent, intervened as a party defendant. The District
Court recognized that the new law would inject into each
party's primary substantial numbers of voters unaffiliated
with the party. 984 F. Supp. 1288, 1298-1299 (1997). It further recognized that this might result in selection of a nominee different from the one party members would select, or
at the least cause the same nominee to commit himself to
different positions. Id., at 1299. Nevertheless, the District
Court held that the burden on petitioners' rights of association was not a severe one, and was justified by state interests ultimately reducing to this: "enhanc[ing] the democratic
nature of the election process and the representativeness of
elected officials." Id., at 1301. The Ninth Circuit, adopting
the District Court's opinion as its own, affirmed. 169 F. 3d

each candidate received from the entire voter pool and according to the
amount each received from members of his own party. The national parties may then use the latter figure to apportion delegates. Nor does it
apply to the election of political party central or district committee members; only party members may vote in these elections. See Cal. Elec.
Code Ann. $ 2151 (West 1996 and Supp. 2000).

3 Each of the four parties was qualified under California law when they

filed this suit. Since that time, the Peace and Freedom Party has apparently lost its qualified status. See Brief for Petitioners 16 (citing Child
of the '60s Slips, Los Angeles Times, Feb. 17, 1999, p. B-6).

572 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Opinion of the Court

II
Respondents rest their defense of the blanket primary
upon the proposition that primaries play an integral role
in citizens' selection of public officials. As a consequence,
they contend, primaries are public rather than private proceedings, and the States may and must play a role in ensuring that they serve the public interest. Proposition 198,
respondents conclude, is simply a rather pedestrian example
of a State's regulating its system of elections.

We have recognized, of course, that States have a major
role to play in structuring and monitoring the election process, including primaries. See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S.
428, 433 (1992); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479
U. S. 208, 217 (1986). We have considered it "too plain for
argument," for example, that a State may require parties
to use the primary format for selecting their nominees, in
order to assure that intraparty competition is resolved in
a democratic fashion. American Party of Tex. v. White,
415 U. S. 767, 781 (1974); see also Tashjian, supra, at 237
(Scalia, J., dissenting). Similarly, in order to avoid burdening the general election ballot with frivolous candidacies, a State may require parties to demonstrate "a significant modicum of support" before allowing their candidates a
place on that ballot. See Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431,
442 (1971). Finally, in order to prevent "party raiding"--a
process in which dedicated members of one party formally
switch to another party to alter the outcome of that party's
primary--a State may require party registration a reasonable period of time before a primary election. See Rosario
v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S. 752 (1973). Cf. Kusper v. Pontikes,
414 U. S. 51 (1973) (23-month waiting period unreasonable).

What we have not held, however, is that the processes by
which political parties select their nominees are, as respondents would have it, wholly public affairs that States

530US2 Unit: $U80 [10-22-01 18:08:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

573Cite as: 530 U. S. 567 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
may regulate freely.4 To the contrary, we have continu-ally stressed that when States regulate parties' internal

processes they must act within limits imposed by the Con-stitution. See, e. g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214 (1989); DemocraticParty of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450
U. S. 107 (1981). In this regard, respondents' reliance on
Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944), and Terry v. Adams,345 U. S. 461 (1953), is misplaced. In Allwright, we invalidated the Texas Democratic Party's rule limiting partici-pation in its primary to whites; in Terry, we invalidated the
same rule promulgated by the Jaybird Democratic Associa-tion, a "self-governing voluntary club," 345 U. S., at 463.
These cases held only that, when a State prescribes an elec-tion process that gives a special role to political parties, it
"endorses, adopts and enforces the discrimination againstNegroes" that the parties (or, in the case of the Jaybird Democratic Association, organizations that are "part and parcel"of the parties, see

id., at 482 (Clark, J., concurring)) bringinto the process--so that the parties' discriminatory action

becomes state action under the Fifteenth Amendment. All-wright, supra, at 664; see also Terry, 345 U. S., at 484 (Clark,
J., concurring); id., at 469 (opinion of Black, J.). They do notstand for the proposition that party affairs are public affairs,
free of First Amendment protections--and our later holdingsmake that entirely clear.

5 See, e. g., Tashjian, supra.

4 On this point, the dissent shares respondents' view, at least where
the selection process is a state-run election. The right not to associate, it says, "is simply inapplicable to participation in a state election."
"[A]n election, unlike a convention or caucus, is a public affair." Post, at
595 (opinion of Stevens, J.). Of course it is, but when the election determines a party's nominee it is a party affair as well, and, as the cases to be
discussed in text demonstrate, the constitutional rights of those composing
the party cannot be disregarded.

5 The dissent is therefore wrong to conclude that Allwright and Terry

demonstrate that "[t]he protections that the First Amendment affords

574 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
Representative democracy in any populous unit of gov-ernance is unimaginable without the ability of citizens to

band together in promoting among the electorate candidateswho espouse their political views. The formation of national
political parties was almost concurrent with the formationof the Republic itself. See Cunningham, The Jeffersonian
Republican Party, in 1 History of U. S. Political Parties 239,
241 (A. Schlesinger ed. 1973). Consistent with this tradi-tion, the Court has recognized that the First Amendment

protects "the freedom to join together in furtherance ofcommon political beliefs,"

Tashjian, supra, at 214-215, which
"necessarily presupposes the freedom to identify the peoplewho constitute the association, and to limit the association

to those people only," La Follette, 450 U. S., at 122. Thatis to say, a corollary of the right to associate is the right
not to associate. " `Freedom of association would prove anempty guarantee if associations could not limit control over
their decisions to those who share the interests and persuasions that underlie the association's being.' " Id., at 122,

to the internal processes of a political party do not encompass a right
to exclude nonmembers from voting in a state-required, state-financed
primary election." Post, at 594-595 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Those cases simply prevent exclusion that violates some
independent constitutional proscription. The closest the dissent comes to
identifying such a proscription in this case is its reference to "the First
Amendment associational interests" of citizens to participate in the primary of a party to which they do not belong, and the "fundamental right"
of citizens "to cast a meaningful vote for the candidate of their choice."
Post, at 601. As to the latter: Selecting a candidate is quite different from
voting for the candidate of one's choice. If the "fundamental right" to
cast a meaningful vote were really at issue in this context, Proposition
198 would be not only constitutionally permissible but constitutionally required, which no one believes. As for the associational "interest" in selecting the candidate of a group to which one does not belong, that falls
far short of a constitutional right, if indeed it can even fairly be characterized as an interest. It has been described in our cases as a "desire"--and
rejected as a basis for disregarding the First Amendment right to exclude.

Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S.
609, 623 (1984).In no area is the political association's right to exclude

more important than in the process of selecting its nominee.That process often determines the party's positions on the
most significant public policy issues of the day, and even
when those positions are predetermined it is the nomineewho becomes the party's ambassador to the general electorate in winning it over to the party's views. See Timmonsv.

(Stevens, J., dissenting) ("But a party's choice of a candidate is the most effective way in which that party can
communicate to the voters what the party represents and,
thereby, attract voter interest and support"). Some political parties--such as President Theodore Roosevelt's Bull
Moose Party, the La Follette Progressives of 1924, the Henry
Wallace Progressives of 1948, and the George Wallace American Independent Party of 1968--are virtually inseparable
from their nominees (and tend not to outlast them). See
generally E. Kruschke, Encyclopedia of Third Parties in the
United States (1991).

Unsurprisingly, our cases vigorously affirm the special
place the First Amendment reserves for, and the special protection it accords, the process by which a political party
"select[s] a standard bearer who best represents the party's
ideologies and preferences." Eu, supra, at 224 (internal

te-
vens, J., dissenting) ("The members of a recognized politicalparty unquestionably have a constitutional right to select

their nominees for public office").In La Follette, the State of Wisconsin conducted an open
presidential preference primary.6 Although the voters didnot select the delegates to the Democratic Party's National
Convention directly--they were chosen later at caucuses ofparty members--Wisconsin law required these delegates to
vote in accord with the primary results. Thus allowing non-party members to participate in the selection of the party's
nominee conflicted with the Democratic Party's rules. Weheld that, whatever the strength of the state interests supporting the open primary itself, they could not justify this"substantial intrusion into the associational freedom of members of the National Party." 7 450 U. S., at 126.

6 An open primary differs from a blanket primary in that, although
as in the blanket primary any person, regardless of party affiliation, may
vote for a party's nominee, his choice is limited to that party's nominees
for all offices. He may not, for example, support a Republican nominee
for Governor and a Democratic nominee for attorney general.

7 The dissent, in attempting to fashion its new rule--that the right not

to associate does not exist with respect to primary elections, see post, at
594-595--rewrites Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel.
La Follette, 450 U. S. 107 (1981), to stand merely for the proposition that
a political party has a First Amendment right to "defin[e] the organization
and composition of its governing units," post, at 592. In fact, however,
the state-imposed burden at issue in La Follette was the " `intrusion by
those with adverse political principles' " upon the selection of the party's
nominee (in that case its presidential nominee). 450 U. S., at 122 (quoting
Ray v. Blair, 343 U. S. 214, 221-222 (1952)). See also 450 U. S., at 125
(comparing asserted state interests with burden created by the "imposition of voting requirements upon" delegates). Of course La Follette involved the burden a state regulation imposed on a national party, but that
factor affected only the weight of the State's interest, and had no bearing
upon the existence vel non of a party's First Amendment right to exclude.
Id., at 121-122, 125-126. Although Justice Stevens now considers this
interpretation of La Follette "specious," see post, at 592, n. 3, he once

Opinion of the Court
California's blanket primary violates the principles setforth in these cases. Proposition 198 forces political parties

to associate with--to have their nominees, and hence theirpositions, determined by--those who, at best, have refused
to affiliate with the party, and, at worst, have expressly affil-iated with a rival. In this respect, it is qualitatively different from a closed primary. Under that system, even whenit is made quite easy for a voter to change his party affiliation the day of the primary, and thus, in some sense, to "crossover," at least he must formally

become a member of theparty; and once he does so, he is limited to voting for candidates of that party.8
subscribed to it himself. His dissent from the order dismissing the appeals in Bellotti v. Connolly, 460 U. S. 1057 (1983), described La Follette
thusly: "There this Court rejected Wisconsin's requirement that delegates
to the party's Presidential nominating convention, selected in a primary
open to nonparty voters, must cast their convention votes in accordance
with the primary election results. In our view, the interests advanced by
the State . . . did not justify its substantial intrusion into the associational
freedom of members of the National Party. . . . Wisconsin required convention delegates to cast their votes for candidates who might have drawn
their support from nonparty members. The results of the party's decisionmaking process might thereby have been distorted." 460 U. S., at
1062-1063 (emphasis in original).

Not only does the dissent's principle of no right to exclude conflict with
our precedents, but it also leads to nonsensical results. In Tashjian v.
Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208 (1986), we held that the First
Amendment protects a party's right to invite independents to participate
in the primary. Combining Tashjian with the dissent's rule affirms a
party's constitutional right to allow outsiders to select its candidates,
but denies a party's constitutional right to reserve candidate selection to
its own members. The First Amendment would thus guarantee a party's
right to lose its identity, but not to preserve it.

8 In this sense, the blanket primary also may be constitutionally distinct

from the open primary, see n. 6, supra, in which the voter is limited to
one party's ballot. See La Follette, supra, at 130, n. 2 (Powell, J., dissenting) ("[T]he act of voting in the Democratic primary fairly can be described as an act of affiliation with the Democratic Party. . . . The situation

578 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
The evidence in this case demonstrates that under Califor-nia's blanket primary system, the prospect of having a party's nominee determined by adherents of an opposing partyis far from remote--indeed, it is a clear and present danger.
For example, in one 1997 survey of California voters 37 per-cent of Republicans said that they planned to vote in the
1998 Democratic gubernatorial primary, and 20 percent ofDemocrats said they planned to vote in the 1998 Republican
United States Senate primary. Tr. 668-669. Those figuresare comparable to the results of studies in other States with
blanket primaries. One expert testified, for example, thatin Washington the number of voters crossing over from one
party to another can rise to as high as 25 percent, id., at 511,and another that only 25 to 33 percent of all Washington voters
limit themselves to candidates of one party throughout theballot, App. 136. The impact of voting by nonparty members
is much greater upon minor parties, such as the LibertarianParty and the Peace and Freedom Party. In the first primaries these parties conducted following California's imple-mentation of Proposition 198, the total votes cast for party
candidates in some races was more than double the totalnumber of registered party members. California Secretary
of State, Statement of Vote, Primary Election, June 2, 1998,http://primary98.ss.ca.gov/Final/Official Results.htm; California Secretary of State, Report of Registration, May 1998,http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/elections u.htm.

The record also supports the obvious proposition thatthese substantial numbers of voters who help select the nominees of parties they have chosen not to join often have policyviews that diverge from those of the party faithful. The 1997
survey of California voters revealed significantly differentpolicy preferences between party members and primary
voters who "crossed over" from another party. Pl. Exh. 8

to determine the constitutionality of open primaries.

Opinion of the Court
(Addendum to Mervin Field Report). One expert went sofar as to describe it as "inevitable [under Proposition 198]

that parties will be forced in some circumstances to givetheir official designation to a candidate who's not preferred
by a majority or even plurality of party members." Tr. 421(expert testimony of Bruce Cain).

In concluding that the burden Proposition 198 imposeson petitioners' rights of association is not severe, the Ninth
Circuit cited testimony that the prospect of malicious cross-over voting, or raiding, is slight, and that even though the
numbers of "benevolent" crossover voters were significant,they would be determinative in only a small number of
races.9 169 F. 3d, at 656-657. But a single election inwhich the party nominee is selected by nonparty members
could be enough to destroy the party. In the 1860 Presi-dential election, if opponents of the fledgling Republican
Party had been able to cause its nomination of a proslaverycandidate in place of Abraham Lincoln, the coalition of intraparty factions forming behind him likely would have disinte-grated, endangering the party's survival and thwarting its
effort to fill the vacuum left by the dissolution of the Whigs.See generally 1 Political Parties & Elections in the United
States: An Encyclopedia 398-408, 587 (L. Maisel ed. 1991).Ordinarily, however, being saddled with an unwanted, and
possibly antithetical, nominee would not destroy the partybut severely transform it. "[R]egulating the identity of the
parties' leaders," we have said, "may . . . color the parties'message and interfere with the parties' decisions as to the
best means to promote that message." Eu, 489 U. S., at231, n. 21.

In any event, the deleterious effects of Proposition 198 arenot limited to altering the identity of the nominee. Even

9 The Ninth Circuit defined a crossover voter as one "who votes for
a candidate of a party in which the voter is not registered. Thus, the
cross-over voter could be an independent voter or one who is registered
to a competing political party." 169 F. 3d 646, 656 (1999).

580 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
when the person favored by a majority of the party membersprevails, he will have prevailed by taking somewhat different

positions--and, should he be elected, will continue to takesomewhat different positions in order to be

renominated.
As respondents' own expert concluded: "The policy posi-tions of Members of Congress elected from blanket primary

states are . . . more moderate, both in an absolute sense
and relative to the other party, and so are more reflective ofthe preferences of the mass of voters at the center of the

ideological spectrum." App. 109 (expert report of ElisabethR. Gerber). It is unnecessary to cumulate evidence of this
phenomenon, since, after all, the whole purpose of Proposition 198 was to favor nominees with "moderate" positions.
Id., at 89. It encourages candidates--and officeholders who
hope to be renominated--to curry favor with persons whose
views are more "centrist" than those of the party base. In
effect, Proposition 198 has simply moved the general election
one step earlier in the process, at the expense of the parties'
ability to perform the "basic function" of choosing their own
leaders. Kusper, 414 U. S., at 58.

Nor can we accept the Court of Appeals' contention that
the burden imposed by Proposition 198 is minor because
petitioners are free to endorse and financially support the
candidate of their choice in the primary. 169 F. 3d, at 659.
The ability of the party leadership to endorse a candidate
is simply no substitute for the party members' ability to
choose their own nominee. In Eu, we recognized that
party-leadership endorsements are not always effective--
for instance, in New York's 1982 gubernatorial primary,
Edward Koch, the Democratic Party leadership's choice, lost
out to Mario Cuomo. 489 U. S., at 228, n. 18. One study
has concluded, moreover, that even when the leadershipendorsed candidate has won, the effect of the endorsement
has been negligible. Ibid. (citing App. in Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., O. T. 1988, No. 87-
1269, pp. 97-98). New York's was a closed primary; one

581Cite as: 530 U. S. 567 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
would expect leadership endorsement to be even less effec-tive in a blanket primary, where many of the voters are unconnected not only to the party leadership but even to theparty itself. In any event, the ability of the party leadership
to endorse a candidate does not assist the party rank andfile, who may not themselves agree with the party leadership, but do not want the party's choice decided by outsiders.

We are similarly unconvinced by respondents' claim thatthe burden is not severe because Proposition 198 does not

limit the parties from engaging fully in other traditionalparty behavior, such as ensuring orderly internal party governance, maintaining party discipline in the legislature, and
conducting campaigns. The accuracy of this assertion is
highly questionable, at least as to the first two activities.
That party nominees will be equally observant of internal
party procedures and equally respectful of party discipline
when their nomination depends on the general electorate
rather than on the party faithful seems to us improbable.
Respondents themselves suggest as much when they assert
that the blanket primary system " `will lead to the election
of more representative "problem solvers" who are less beholden to party officials.' " Brief for Respondents 41 (emphasis added) (quoting 169 F. 3d, at 661). In the end, however, the effect of Proposition 198 on these other activities
is beside the point. We have consistently refused to overlook an unconstitutional restriction upon some First Amendment activity simply because it leaves other First Amendment activity unimpaired. See, e. g., Spence v. Washington,
418 U. S. 405, 411, n. 4 (1974) (per curiam); Kusper, 414 U. S.,
at 58. There is simply no substitute for a party's selecting
its own candidates.

In sum, Proposition 198 forces petitioners to adulterate
their candidate-selection process--the "basic function of a
political party," ibid.--by opening it up to persons wholly
unaffiliated with the party. Such forced association has the
likely outcome--indeed, in this case the intended outcome--

582 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
of changing the parties' message. We can think of no heav-ier burden on a political party's associational freedom.

Proposition 198 is therefore unconstitutional unless it is nar-rowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. See
Timmons, 520 U. S., at 358 ("Regulations imposing severeburdens on [parties'] rights must be narrowly tailored and
advance a compelling state interest"). It is to that questionwhich we now turn.

III
Respondents proffer seven state interests they claim arecompelling. Two of them--producing elected officials who

better represent the electorate and expanding candidatedebate beyond the scope of partisan concerns--are simply
circumlocution for producing nominees and nominee posi-tions other than those the parties would choose if left to their
own devices. Indeed, respondents admit as much. For in-stance, in substantiating their interest in "representativeness," respondents point to the fact that "officials electedunder blanket primaries stand closer to the median policy
positions of their districts" than do those selected only byparty members. Brief for Respondents 40. And in explaining their desire to increase debate, respondents claimthat a blanket primary forces parties to reconsider long
standing positions since it "compels [their] candidates toappeal to a larger segment of the electorate."

Id., at 46.Both of these supposed interests, therefore, reduce to nothing more than a stark repudiation of freedom of political as-sociation: Parties should not be free to select their own nominees because those nominees, and the positions taken bythose nominees, will not be congenial to the majority.

We have recognized the inadmissibility of this sort of"interest" before. In Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557(1995), the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council refused to allow an organization of openly gay, lesbian, andbisexual persons (GLIB) to participate in the council's annual

Opinion of the Court
St. Patrick's Day parade. GLIB sued the council underMassachusetts' public accommodation law, claiming that the

council impermissibly denied them access on account of theirsexual orientation. After noting that parades are expressive endeavors, we rejected GLIB's contention that Massa-chusetts' public accommodation law overrode the council's
right to choose the content of its own message. Applying
the law in such circumstances, we held, made apparent thatits "object [was] simply to require speakers to modify the

content of their expression to whatever extent beneficiariesof the law choose to alter it with messages of their own. . . .
[I]n the absence of some further, legitimate end, this object
is merely to allow exactly what the general rule of speaker's
autonomy forbids." Id., at 578.

Respondents' third asserted compelling interest is that
the blanket primary is the only way to ensure that disenfranchised persons enjoy the right to an effective vote. By "disenfranchised," respondents do not mean those who cannot
vote; they mean simply independents and members of the
minority party in "safe" districts. These persons are disenfranchised, according to respondents, because under a closed
primary they are unable to participate in what amounts to
the determinative election--the majority party's primary;
the only way to ensure they have an "effective" vote is to
force the party to open its primary to them. This also appears to be nothing more than reformulation of an asserted
state interest we have already rejected--recharacterizing
nonparty members' keen desire to participate in selection
of the party's nominee as "disenfranchisement" if that desire
is not fulfilled. We have said, however, that a "nonmember's
desire to participate in the party's affairs is overborne by
the countervailing and legitimate right of the party to determine its own membership qualifications." Tashjian, 479
U. S., at 215-216, n. 6 (citing Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S.
752 (1973), and Nader v. Schaffer, 417 F. Supp. 837 (Conn.),
summarily aff 'd, 429 U. S. 989 (1976)). The voter's desire to

584 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
participate does not become more weighty simply becausethe State supports it. Moreover, even if it were accurate to

describe the plight of the non-party-member in a safe districtas "disenfranchisement," Proposition 198 is not needed to
solve the problem. The voter who feels himself disenfran-chised should simply join the party. That may put him to a
hard choice, but it is not a state-imposed restriction upon his
freedom of association, whereas compelling party membersto accept his selection of their nominee

is a state-imposed
restriction upon theirs.Respondents' remaining four asserted state interests--

promoting fairness, affording voters greater choice, increasing voter participation, and protecting privacy--are not, like
the others, automatically out of the running; but neither are
they, in the circumstances of this case, compelling. That
determination is not to be made in the abstract, by asking
whether fairness, privacy, etc., are highly significant values;
but rather by asking whether the aspect of fairness, privacy,
etc., addressed by the law at issue is highly significant. And
for all four of these asserted interests, we find it not to be.

The aspect of fairness addressed by Proposition 198 is presumably the supposed inequity of not permitting nonparty
members in "safe" districts to determine the party nominee.
If that is unfair at all (rather than merely a consequence
of the eminently democratic principle that--except where
constitutional imperatives intervene--the majority rules), it
seems to us less unfair than permitting nonparty members
to hijack the party. As for affording voters greater choice,
it is obvious that the net effect of this scheme--indeed, its
avowed purpose--is to reduce the scope of choice, by assuring a range of candidates who are all more "centrist." This
may well be described as broadening the range of choices
favored by the majority--but that is hardly a compelling
state interest, if indeed it is even a legitimate one. The interest in increasing voter participation is just a variation on
the same theme (more choices favored by the majority will

530US2 Unit: $U80 [10-22-01 18:08:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
produce more voters), and suffers from the same defect. Asfor the protection of privacy: The specific privacy interest at

issue is not the confidentiality of medical records or personalfinances, but confidentiality of one's party affiliation. Even
if (as seems unlikely) a scheme for administering a closedprimary could not be devised in which the voter's declaration
of party affiliation would not be public information, we do
not think that the State's interest in assuring the privacyof this piece of information in all cases can conceivably be

considered a "compelling" one. If such information weregenerally so sacrosanct, federal statutes would not require
a declaration of party affiliation as a condition of appointment to certain offices. See, e. g., 47 U. S. C. $ 154(b)(5)
("[M]aximum number of commissioners [of the Federal Communications Commission] who may be members of the same
political party shall be a number equal to the least number
of commissioners which constitutes a majority of the full
membership of the Commission"); 47 U. S. C. $ 396(c)(1) (1994
ed., Supp. III) (no more than five members of Board of Directors of Corporation for Public Broadcasting may be of same
party); 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-4(a) (no more than three members
of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may be of
same party).

Finally, we may observe that even if all these state interests were compelling ones, Proposition 198 is not a narrowly
tailored means of furthering them. Respondents could protect them all by resorting to a nonpartisan blanket primary.
Generally speaking, under such a system, the State determines what qualifications it requires for a candidate to have
a place on the primary ballot--which may include nomination by established parties and voter-petition requirements
for independent candidates. Each voter, regardless of party
affiliation, may then vote for any candidate, and the top two
vote getters (or however many the State prescribes) then
move on to the general election. This system has all the
characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the

constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters are not choosinga party's nominee. Under a nonpartisan blanket primary,

a State may ensure more choice, greater participation, in-creased "privacy," and a sense of "fairness"--all without severely burdening a political party's First Amendment rightof association.

* * *Respondents' legitimate state interests and petitioners'
First Amendment rights are not inherently incompatible.To the extent they are in this case, the State of California
has made them so by forcing political parties to associatewith those who do not share their beliefs. And it has done
this at the "crucial juncture" at which party members tradi-tionally find their collective voice and select their spokesman. Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 216. The burden Proposition198 places on petitioners' rights of political association is
both severe and unnecessary. The judgment for the Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
Proposition 198, the product of a statewide popular ini-tiative, is a strong and recent expression of the will of California's electorate. It is designed, in part, to further theobject of widening the base of voter participation in California elections. Until a few weeks or even days before anelection, many voters pay little attention to campaigns and
even less to the details of party politics. Fewer still partici-pate in the direction and control of party affairs, for most
voters consider the internal dynamics of party organizationremote, partisan, and of slight interest. Under these conditions voters tend to become disinterested, and so they refrainfrom voting altogether. To correct this, California seeks to
make primary voting more responsive to the views and pref-erences of the electorate as a whole. The results of California's blanket primary system may demonstrate the efficacy

Kennedy, J., concurring
of its solution, for there appears to have been a substantialincrease in voter interest and voter participation. See Brief

for Respondents 45-46.Encouraging citizens to vote is a legitimate, indeed essential, state objective; for the constitutional order must bepreserved by a strong, participatory democratic process. In
short, there is much to be said in favor of California's law;
and I might find this to be a close case if it were simply away to make elections more fair and open or addressed matters purely of party structure.The true purpose of this law, however, is to force a political
party to accept a candidate it may not want and, by so doing,
to change the party's doctrinal position on major issues.
Ante, at 581-582. From the outset the State has been fair
and candid to admit that doctrinal change is the intended
operation and effect of its law. See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 40, 46. It may be that organized parties, controlled--
in fact or perception--by activists seeking to promote their
self-interest rather than enhance the party's long-term support, are shortsighted and insensitive to the views of even
their own members. A political party might be better
served by allowing blanket primaries as a means of nominating candidates with broader appeal. Under the First
Amendment's guarantee of speech through free association,
however, this is an issue for the party to resolve, not for the
State. Political parties advance a shared political belief, but
to do so they often must speak through their candidates.
When the State seeks to direct changes in a political party's
philosophy by forcing upon it unwanted candidates and
wresting the choice between moderation and partisanship
away from the party itself, the State's incursion on the party's associational freedom is subject to careful scrutiny under
the First Amendment. For these reasons I agree with the
Court's opinion.

I add this separate concurrence to say that Proposition 198
is doubtful for a further reason. In justification of its stat530US2 Unit: $U80 [10-22-01 18:08:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN
588 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Kennedy, J., concurring
ute California tells us a political party has the means at handto protect its associational freedoms. The party, California

contends, can simply use its funds and resources to supportthe candidate of its choice, thus defending its doctrinal positions by advising the voters of its own preference. To beginwith, this does not meet the parties' First Amendment objection, as the Court well explains. Ante, at 580-581. The
important additional point, however, is that, by reason of theCourt's denial of First Amendment protections to a political

party's spending of its own funds and resources in coopera-tion with its preferred candidate, see

Colorado Republican
Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518U. S. 604 (1996), the Federal Government or the State has

the power to prevent the party from using the very remedyCalifornia now offers up to defend its law.

Federal campaign finance laws place strict limits on themanner and amount of speech parties may undertake in
aid of candidates. Of particular relevance are limits on co-ordinated party expenditures, which the Federal Election
Campaign Act of 1971 deems to be contributions subject to
specific monetary restrictions. See 90 Stat. 488, 2 U. S. C.$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i) ("[E]xpenditures made by any person in

cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request
or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents, shall be considered to be a contribution to such candidate"). Though we invalidated limits on
independent party expenditures in Colorado Republican,
the principal opinion did not question federal limits placed
on coordinated expenditures. See 518 U. S., at 624-625
(opinion of Breyer, J.). Two Justices in dissent said that
"all money spent by a political party to secure the election
of its candidate" would constitute coordinated expenditures
and would have upheld the statute as applied in that case.
See id., at 648 (opinion of Stevens, J.). Thus, five Justices
of the Court subscribe to the position that Congress or a
State may limit the amount a political party spends in direct
collaboration with its preferred candidate for elected office.

589Cite as: 530 U. S. 567 (2000)
Kennedy, J., concurring
In my view, as stated in both Colorado Republican, supra,at 626 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in

part), and in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,528 U. S. 377, 405-406 (2000) (dissenting opinion), these recent cases deprive political parties of their First Amendmentrights. Our constitutional tradition is one in which political
parties and their candidates make common cause in the exercise of political speech, which is subject to First Amend-ment protection. There is a practical identity of interests

between parties and their candidates during an election.Our unfortunate decisions remit the political party to use of
indirect or covert speech to support its preferred candidate,hardly a result consistent with free thought and expression.
It is a perversion of the First Amendment to force a politicalparty to warp honest, straightforward speech, exemplified
by its vigorous and open support of its favored candidate,into the covert speech of soft money and issue advocacy so
that it may escape burdensome spending restrictions. In aregime where campaign spending cannot otherwise be limited--the structure this Court created on its own in Buckley
v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam)--restricting theamounts a political party may spend in collaboration with

its own candidate is a violation of the political party's First
Amendment rights.

Were the views of those who would uphold both California's blanket primary system and limitations on coordinated party expenditures to become prevailing law, the
State could control political parties at two vital points in
the election process. First, it could mandate a blanket primary to weaken the party's ability to defend and maintain
its doctrinal positions by allowing nonparty members to
vote in the primary. Second, it could impose severe restrictions on the amount of funds and resources the party could
spend in efforts to counteract the State's doctrinal intervention. In other words, the First Amendment injury done by
the Court's ruling in Colorado Republican would be compounded were California to prevail in the instant case.

590 CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY v. JONES

Stevens, J., dissenting
When the State seeks to regulate a political party's nomi-nation process as a means to shape and control political doctrine and the scope of political choice, the First Amendmentgives substantial protection to the party from the manipulation. In a free society the State is directed by politicaldoctrine, not the other way around. With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joinsas to Part I, dissenting.

Today the Court construes the First Amendment as a limi-tation on a State's power to broaden voter participation in
elections conducted by the State. The Court's holding isnovel and, in my judgment, plainly wrong. I am convinced
that California's adoption of a blanket primary pursuant toProposition 198 does not violate the First Amendment, and
that its use in primary elections for state offices is there-fore valid. The application of Proposition 198 to elections
for United States Senators and Representatives, however,raises a more difficult question under the Elections Clause
of the United States Constitution, Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1. I shallfirst explain my disagreement with the Court's resolution of
the First Amendment issue and then comment on the Elec-tions Clause issue.

I
A State's power to determine how its officials are tobe elected is a quintessential attribute of sovereignty. This

case is about the State of California's power to decide whomay vote in an election conducted, and paid for, by the
State.1 The United States Constitution imposes constraints

1 See Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 217 (1986)
(observing that the United States Constitution grants States a broad
power to prescribe the manner of elections for certain federal offices,
which power is matched by state control over the election process for
state offices). In California, the Secretary of State administers the pro530US2 Unit: $U80 [10-22-01 18:08:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
on the States' power to limit access to the polls, but we havenever before held or suggested that it imposes any constraints on States' power to authorize additional citizens toparticipate in any state election for a state office. In my
view, principles of federalism require us to respect the policy
choice made by the State's voters in approving Proposition
198.

The blanket primary system instituted by Proposition 198
does not abridge "the ability of citizens to band together in
promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse
their political views." Ante, at 574.2 The Court's contrary
conclusion rests on the premise that a political party's freedom of expressive association includes a "right not to associate," which in turn includes a right to exclude voters unaffiliated with the party from participating in the selection
of that party's nominee in a primary election. Ante, at 574-
575. In drawing this conclusion, however, the Court blurs
two distinctions that are critical: (1) the distinction between

visions of the State Elections Code and has some supervisory authority
over county election officers. Cal. Govt. Code Ann. $ 12172.5 (West 1992
and Supp. 2000). Primary and other elections are administered and paid
for primarily by county governments. Cal. Elec. Code Ann. $$ 13000-
13001 (West 1996 and Supp. 2000). Anecdotal evidence suggests that each
statewide election in California (whether primary or general) costs governmental units between $45 million and $50 million.

2 Prominent members of the founding generation would have disagreed

with the Court's suggestion that representative democracy is "unimaginable" without political parties, ante, at 574, though their antiparty thought
ultimately proved to be inconsistent with their partisan actions. See,
e. g., R. Hofstadter, The Idea of a Party System 2-3 (1969) (noting that
"the creators of the first American party system on both sides, Federalists
and Republicans, were men who looked upon parties as sores on the body
politic"). At best, some members of that generation viewed parties as an
unavoidable product of a free state that were an evil to be endured, though
most viewed them as an evil to be abolished or suppressed. Id., at 16-17,
24. Indeed, parties ranked high on the list of evils that the Constitution
was designed to check. Id., at 53; see The Federalist No. 10 (J. Madison).

a private organization's right to define itself and its mes-sages, on the one hand, and the State's right to define the

obligations of citizens and organizations performing publicfunctions, on the other; and (2) the distinction between laws
that abridge participation in the political process and thosethat encourage such participation.

When a political party defines the organization and compo-sition of its governing units, when it decides what candidates
to endorse, and when it decides whether and how to commu-nicate those endorsements to the public, it is engaged in the
kind of private expressive associational activity that theFirst Amendment protects.

specious. Ante, at 576-577, n. 7 (claiming that state-imposed burden actually at issue in La Follette was intrusion of those with adverse political
principles into party's primary). A more accurate characterization of the
nature of La Follette's reasoning is provided by Justice Powell: "In analyzing the burden imposed on associational freedoms in this case, the
Court treats the Wisconsin law as the equivalent of one regulating delegate selection, and, relying on Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U. S. 477 (1975),
concludes that any interference with the National Party's accepted
delegate-selection procedures impinges on constitutionally protected
rights." Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Fol530US2 Unit: $U80 [10-22-01 18:08:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

party could, if a majority of its members chose to do so, adopta platform advocating white supremacy and opposing the

election of any non-Caucasians. Indeed, it could decide touse its funds and oratorical skills to support only those candidates who were loyal to its racist views. Moreover, if aState permitted its political parties to select their candidates
through conventions or caucuses, a racist party would alsobe free to select only candidates who would adhere to the
party line.As District Judge Levi correctly observed in an opinion
adopted by the Ninth Circuit, however, the associationalrights of political parties are neither absolute nor as comprehensive as the rights enjoyed by wholly private associations.169 F. 3d 646, 654-655 (1999); cf.

Timmons, 520 U. S., at 360(concluding that while regulation of endorsements implicates

political parties' internal affairs and core associational aclette, 450 U. S. 107, 128 (1981) (dissenting opinion). Indeed, the La Follette Court went out of its way to characterize the Wisconsin law in this
manner in order to avoid casting doubt on the constitutionality of open
primaries. Id., at 121 (majority opinion) (noting that the issue was not
whether an open primary was constitutional but "whether the State may
compel the National Party to seat a delegation chosen in a way that violates the rules of the Party"). The fact that the La Follette Court also
characterizes the Wisconsin law at one point as a law "impos[ing] . . .
voting requirements" on delegates, id., at 125, does not alter the conclusion that La Follette is a case about state regulation of internal party
processes, not about regulation of primary elections. State-mandated intrusion upon either delegate selection or delegate voting would surely implicate the affected party's First Amendment right to define the organization and composition of its governing units, but it is clear that California
intrudes upon neither in this case. Ante, at 570-571, n. 2.

La Follette and Cousins also stand for the proposition that a State's
interest in regulating at the national level the types of party activities
mentioned in the text is outweighed by the burden that state regulation
would impose on the parties' associational rights. See Bellotti v. Connolly, 460 U. S. 1057, 1062-1063, and n. 3 (1983) (Stevens, J., dissenting)
(quoted in part ante, at 577, n. 7). In this case, however, California does
not seek to regulate such activities at all, much less to do so at the national level.

I think it clear--though the point has never been decidedby this Court--"that a State may require parties to use the

primary format for selecting their nominees." Ante, at 572.The reason a State may impose this significant restriction
on a party's associational freedoms is that both the generalelection and the primary are quintessential forms of state
action.4 It is because the primary is state action that anorganization--whether it calls itself a political party or just
a "Jaybird" association--may not deny non-Caucasians theright to participate in the selection of its nominees.

v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S.

those cases "do not stand for the proposition that party affairs are [wholly] public affairs, free of First Amendment
protections." Ante, at 573. They do, however, stand for
the proposition that primary elections, unlike most "party
affairs," are state action.5 The protections that the First

5 Contrary to what the Court seems to think, I do not rely on Terry and

Allwright as the basis for an argument that state accommodation of the
parties' desire to exclude nonmembers from primaries would necessarily
violate an independent constitutional proscription such as the Equal Protection Clause (though I do not rule that out). Cf. ante, at 573-574, n. 5.
Rather, I cite them because our recognition that constitutional proscriptions apply to primaries illustrates that primaries--as integral parts

ibid., do not encompass a right to exclude nonmembers
from voting in a state-required, state-financed primaryelection.

The so-called "right not to associate" that the Court reliesupon, then, is simply inapplicable to participation in a state
election. A political party, like any other association, may
refuse to allow nonmembers to participate in the party's de-cisions when it is conducting its own affairs;

6 California's

blanket primary system does not infringe this principle.
Ante, at 570-571, n. 2. But an election, unlike a convention
or caucus, is a public affair. Although it is true that we haveextended First Amendment protection to a party's right to

invite independents to participate in its primaries, Tashjianv.

Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208 (1986), neither
that case nor any other has held or suggested that the "rightnot to associate" imposes a limit on the State's power to open

up its primary elections to all voters eligible to vote in a
general election. In my view, while state rules abridging
participation in its elections should be closely scrutinized,7
the First Amendment does not inhibit the State from acting
to broaden voter access to state-run, state-financed elections.
When a State acts not to limit democratic participation but
to expand the ability of individuals to participate in the demof the election process by which the people select their government--are
state affairs, not internal party affairs.

6 "The State asserts a compelling interest in preserving the overall integrity of the electoral process, providing secrecy of the ballot, increasing
voter participation in primaries, and preventing harassment of voters.
But all those interests go to the conduct of the Presidential preference
primary--not to the imposition of voting requirements upon those who, in
a separate process, are eventually selected as delegates." La Follette,

ocratic process, it is acting not as a foe of the First Amend-ment but as a friend and ally.

Although I would not endorse it, I could at least under-stand a constitutional rule that protected a party's associational rights by allowing it to refuse to select its candidatesthrough state-regulated primary elections. See

Marchioro
v. Chaney, 442 U. S. 191, 199 (1979) ("There can be no complaint that [a] party's [First Amendment] right to govern it-self has been substantially burdened by [state regulation]

when the source of the complaint is the party's own decisionto confer critical authority on the [party governing unit
being regulated]"); cf. Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 237 (Scalia, J.,
dissenting) ("It is beyond my understanding why the Republican Party's delegation of its democratic choice [of candidates] to a Republican Convention [rather than a primary]
can be proscribed [by the State], but its delegation of that
choice to nonmembers of the Party cannot"). A meaningful
"right not to associate," if there is such a right in the context
of limiting an electorate, ought to enable a party to insist
on choosing its nominees at a convention or caucus where
nonmembers could be excluded. In the real world, however,
anyone can "join" a political party merely by asking for the
appropriate ballot at the appropriate time or (at most) by
registering within a state-defined reasonable period of time
before an election; neither past voting history nor the voter's
race, religion, or gender can provide a basis for the party's
refusal to "associate" with an unwelcome new member. See
169 F. 3d, at 655, and n. 20. There is an obvious mismatch
between a supposed constitutional right "not to associate"
and a rule that turns on nothing more than the state-defined
timing of the new associate's application for membership.
See La Follette, 450 U. S., at 133 (Powell, J., dissenting) ("As
Party affiliation becomes . . . easy for a voter to change
[shortly before a particular primary election] in order to participate in [that] election, the difference between open and
closed primaries loses its practical significance").

Stevens, J., dissenting
The Court's reliance on a political party's "right not to as-sociate" as a basis for limiting a State's power to conduct

primary elections will inevitably require it either to drawunprincipled distinctions among various primary configurations or to alter voting practices throughout the Nation infundamental ways. Assuming that a registered Democrat
or independent who wants to vote in the Republican gubernatorial primary can do so merely by asking for a Republicanballot, the Republican Party's constitutional right "not to associate" is pretty feeble if the only cost it imposes on thatDemocrat or independent is a loss of his right to vote for
non-Republican candidates for other offices. Cf. ante, at577-578, n. 8. Subtle distinctions of this minor import are
grist for state legislatures, but they demean the process ofconstitutional adjudication. Or, as

Justice Scalia put the
matter in his dissenting opinion in Tashjian:

"The . . . voter who, while steadfastly refusing to register as a Republican, casts a vote in [a nonclosed] Re-publican primary, forms no more meaningful an `association' with the Party than does the independent or theregistered Democrat who responds to questions by a
Republican Party pollster. If the concept of freedom ofassociation is extended to such casual contacts, it ceases
to be of any analytic use." 479 U. S., at 235.
It is noteworthy that the bylaws of each of the political
parties that are petitioners in this case unequivocally statethat participation in partisan primary elections is to be limited to registered members of the party only. App. 7, 15,16, 18. Under the Court's reasoning, it would seem to follow
that conducting anything but a closed partisan primary in
the face of such bylaws would necessarily burden the parties'
" `freedom to identify the people who constitute the association.' " Ante, at 574. Given that open primaries are supported by essentially the same state interests that the Court
disparages today and are not as "narrow" as nonpartisan pri530US2 Unit: $U80 [10-22-01 18:08:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

maries, ante, at 582-586, there is surely a danger that openprimaries will fare no better against a First Amendment

challenge than blanket primaries have.By the District Court's count, 3 States presently have
blanket primaries, while an additional 21 States have openprimaries and 8 States have semiclosed primaries in which
independents may participate. 169 F. 3d, at 650. ThisCourt's willingness to invalidate the primary schemes of 3
States and cast serious constitutional doubt on the schemesof 29 others at the parties' behest is, as the District Court
rightly observed, "an extraordinary intrusion into the com-plex and changing election laws of the States [that] . . . remove[s] from the American political system a method for can-didate selection that many States consider beneficial and
which in the uncertain future could take on new appeal andimportance."

Id., at 654.8In my view, the First Amendment does not mandate that

a putatively private association be granted the power todictate the organizational structure of state-run, statefinanced primary elections. It is not this Court's constitu-tional function to choose between the competing visions of
what makes democracy work--party autonomy and disci-pline versus progressive inclusion of the entire electorate in

8 When coupled with our decision in Tashjian that a party may require
a State to open up a closed primary, this intrusion has even broader implications. It is arguable that, under the Court's reasoning combined
with Tashjian, the only nominating options open for the States to choose
without party consent are: (1) not to have primary elections, or (2) to
have what the Court calls a "nonpartisan primary"--a system presently
used in Louisiana--in which candidates previously nominated by the various political parties and independent candidates compete. Ante, at 585.
These two options are the same in practice because the latter is not actually a "primary" in the common, partisan sense of that term at all.
Rather, it is a general election with a runoff that has few of the benefits
of democratizing the party nominating process that led the Court to declare the State's ability to require nomination by primary " `too plain for
argument.' " Ante, at 572; see Lightfoot v. Eu, 964 F. 2d 865, 872-873
(CA9 1992) (explaining state interest in requiring direct partisan primary).

belongs to the people. U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,514 U. S. 779, 795 (1995).

Even if the "right not to associate" did authorize the Court
to review the State's policy choice, its evaluation of the com-peting interests at stake is seriously flawed. For example,

the Court's conclusion that a blanket primary severely bur-dens the parties' associational interests in selecting their
standard-bearers does not appear to be borne out by experience with blanket primaries in Alaska and Washington.
See, e. g., 169 F. 3d, at 656-659, and n. 23. Moreover, that
conclusion rests substantially upon the Court's claim that
"[t]he evidence [before the District Court]" disclosed a "clear
and present danger" that a party's nominee may be determined by adherents of an opposing party. Ante, at 578.
This hyperbole is based upon the Court's liberal view of its
appellate role, not upon the record and the District Court's
factual findings. Following a bench trial and the receipt of
expert witness reports, the District Court found that "there
is little evidence that raiding [by members of an opposing
party] will be a factor under the blanket primary. On this
point there is almost unanimity among the political scientists who were called as experts by the plaintiffs and defendants." 169 F. 3d, at 656. While the Court is entitled
to test this finding by making an independent examination
of the record, the evidence it cites--including the results of
the June 1998 primaries, ante, at 578, which should not be
considered because they are not in the record--does not
come close to demonstrating that the District Court's factual finding is clearly erroneous. Bose Corp. v. Consumers
Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 498-501 (1984).

As to the Court's concern that benevolent crossover voting
impinges on party associational interests, ante, at 579, the

Stevens, J., dissenting
District Court found that experience with a blanket primaryin Washington and other evidence "suggest[ed] that there

will be particular elections in which there will be a substan-tial amount of cross-over voting . . . although the cross-over
vote will rarely change the outcome of any election and inthe typical contest will not be at significantly higher levels
than in open primary states." 169 F. 3d, at 657. In myview, an empirically debatable assumption about the relative
number and effect of likely crossover voters in a blanket pri-mary, as opposed to an open primary or a nominally closed
primary with only a brief preregistration requirement, is toothin a reed to support a credible First Amendment distinction. See Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 219 (rejecting State's inter-est in keeping primary closed to curtail benevolent crossover
voting by independents given that independents could easilycross over even under closed primary by simply registering
as party members).On the other side of the balance, I would rank as "substantial, indeed compelling," just as the District Court did,California's interest in fostering democratic government by
"[i]ncreasing the representativeness of elected officials, giv-ing voters greater choice, and increasing voter turnout and
participation in [electoral processes]." 169 F. 3d, at 662; 9cf. Timmons, 520 U. S., at 364 ("[W]e [do not] require elaborate, empirical verification of the weightiness of the State'sasserted justifications"). The Court's glib rejection of the

valid interest in changing party doctrine through an open primary, and
suggests that the State's assertion of this interest somehow irrevocably
taints its blanket primary system. Ante, at 587. The Timmons balancing test relied upon by the Court, ante, at 582, however, does not support
that analysis. Timmons and our myriad other constitutional cases that
weigh burdens against state interests merely ask whether a state interest
justifies the burden that the State is imposing on a constitutional right;
the fact that one of the asserted state interests may not be valid or compelling under the circumstances does not end the analysis.

State's interest in increasing voter participation, ante, at584-585, is particularly regrettable. In an era of dramatically declining voter participation, States should be free toexperiment with reforms designed to make the democratic
process more robust by involving the entire electorate in theprocess of selecting those who will serve as government officials. Opening the nominating process to all and encouraging voters to participate in any election that draws theirinterest is one obvious means of achieving this goal. See

Brief for Respondents 46 (noting that study presented toDistrict Court showed higher voter turnout levels in blanket
primary States than in open or closed primary States); ante,at 586-587 (K

ennedy, J., concurring). I would also give
some weight to the First Amendment associational interestsof nonmembers of a party seeking to participate in the primary process,10 to the fundamental right of such nonmem-bers to cast a meaningful vote for the candidate of their
choice, Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 445 (1992) (Ken-
nedy, J., dissenting), and to the preference of almost 60% of
California voters--including a majority of registered Democrats and Republicans--for a blanket primary. 169 F. 3d, at649; see

Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 236 (Scalia, J., dissenting)
(preferring information on whether majority of rank-and-file party members support a particular proposition than

whether state party convention does so). In my view, aState is unquestionably entitled to rely on this combination
of interests in deciding who may vote in a primary election
conducted by the State. It is indeed strange to find that the
First Amendment forecloses this decision.

II
The Elections Clause of the United States Constitution,Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, provides that "[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,shall be prescribed in each State by the

Legislature thereof."(Emphasis added.) This broad constitutional grant of power

to state legislatures is "matched by state control over theelection process for state offices." Tashjian, 479 U. S., at
217. For the reasons given in Part I, supra, I believe itwould be a proper exercise of these powers and would not
violate the First Amendment for the California Legislatureto adopt a blanket primary system. This particular blanket
primary system, however, was adopted by popular initiative.Although this distinction is not relevant with respect to
elections for state offices, it is unclear whether a state elec-tion system not adopted by the legislature is constitutional
insofar as it applies to the manner of electing United StatesSenators and Representatives.

The California Constitution empowers the voters of theState to propose statutes and to adopt or reject them.
Art. 2, $ 8. If approved by a majority vote, such "initia-tive statutes" generally take effect immediately and may
not be amended or repealed by the California Legislatureunless the voters consent. Art. 2, $ 10. The amendments
to the California Election Code that changed the state pri-mary from a closed system to the blanket system presently
at issue were the result of the voters' March 1996 adoptionof Proposition 198, an initiative statute.

The text of the Elections Clause suggests that such aninitiative system, in which popular choices regarding the
manner of state elections are unreviewable by independ-ent legislative action, may not be a valid method of exercising the power that the Clause vests in state "Legislature[s]."It could be argued that this reasoning does not apply in California, as the California Constitution further provides that"[t]he legislative power of this State is vested in the Cali530US2 Unit: $U80 [10-22-01 18:08:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fornia Legislature . . . , but the people reserve to them-selves the powers of initiative and referendum." Art. 4, $ 1.

The vicissitudes of state nomenclature, however, do notnecessarily control the meaning of the Federal Constitution.
Moreover, the United States House of Representatives hasdetermined in an analogous context that the Elections
Clause's specific reference to "the Legislature" is not sobroad as to encompass the general "legislative power of
this State." 11 Under that view, California's classification ofvoter-approved initiatives as an exercise of legislative power
would not render such initiatives the act of the CaliforniaLegislature within the meaning of the Elections Clause.
Arguably, therefore, California's blanket primary system forelecting United States Senators and Representatives is invalid. Because the point was neither raised by the partiesnor discussed by the courts below, I reserve judgment on it.
I believe, however, that the importance of the point meritsfurther attention.

MOBIL OIL EXPLORATION & PRODUCINGSOUTHEAST, INC.

v. UNITED STATES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 99-244. Argued March 22, 2000--Decided June 26, 2000*
Two oil companies, petitioners here, paid the Government $156 million in

return for lease contracts giving them the rights to explore for and
develop oil off the North Carolina coast, provided that the companies
received exploration and development permission in accordance with
procedures set out in, inter alia, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
Act (OCSLA), the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), and
regulations promulgated pursuant to those Acts. OCSLA, among other
things, requires the Department of the Interior to approve a company's
Plan of Exploration (Plan) within 30 days of its submission if the Plan
meets certain criteria. A company must also obtain an exploratory
well drilling permit after certifying under CZMA that its Plan is consistent with each affected State's coastal zone management program.
If a State objects, the Secretary of Commerce must override the objection or the certification fails. Interior may grant the permit if Commerce rules against the State. While the companies' Plan was pending
before Interior, the Outer Banks Protection Act (OBPA) became law.
OBPA prohibited the Interior Secretary from approving any Plan until,
inter alia, an OBPA-created Environmental Sciences Review Panel
(Panel) reported to the Secretary and the Secretary certified to Congress that he had sufficient information to make OCSLA-required approval decisions. In no event could he approve any Plan for 13 months.
Interior told Mobil the Plan met OCSLA requirements but that it would
not approve the Plan until the OBPA requirements were met. It also
suspended all North Carolina offshore leases. After the Panel made its
report, the Interior Secretary made the requisite certification to Congress but stated that he would not consider the Plan until he received
further studies recommended by the Panel. North Carolina objected to
the CZMA certification, and the Commerce Secretary rejected Mobil's
override request. Before the Commerce Secretary issued his rejection,
the companies joined a breach of contract lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims. That court granted them summary judgment, finding that

the Government had broken its contractual promise to follow OCSLA,
that the Government thereby repudiated the contracts, and that that
repudiation entitled the companies to restitution of their payments. In
reversing, the Federal Circuit held that the Government's refusal to
consider Mobil's Plan was not the operative cause of any failure to carry
out the contracts' terms because the State's objection to the CZMA
certification would have prevented the exploration.

Held: The Government broke its promise, repudiated the contracts, and

must give the companies their money back. Pp. 614-624.

(a) A contracting party is entitled to restitution if the other party
"substantially" breached a contract or communicated its intent to do so.
Here, the Government breached the contracts and communicated such
intent. None of the provisions incorporated into the contracts granted
Interior the legal authority to refuse to approve the companies' Plan,
while suspending the lease instead. First, such authority does not arise
from the OCSLA provision, 43 U. S. C. $ 1334(a)(1)(A), that permits the
Secretary to promulgate regulations providing for suspension of an operation or activity only upon "the request of a lessee." Second, the
contracts say that they are subject to then-existing regulations and future regulations issued under OCSLA and certain Department of Energy Organization Act provisions. This explicit reference to future regulations makes it clear that the contracts' catchall provisions referencing
"all other applicable . . . regulations" must include only statutes and
regulations already existing at the time of the contracts. Thus, the
contracts are not subject to future regulations promulgated under other
statutes, such as OBPA. Third, an OCSLA provision authorizing suspensions in light of a threat of serious harm to the human environment
did not authorize the delay, for Interior explained that the Plan fully
complied with current legal requirements and cited OBPA to explain
the delay. Insofar as the Government means to suggest that OBPA
changed the relevant OCSLA standard, it must mean that OBPA in
effect created a new requirement. Such a requirement would not be
incorporated into the contracts. Finally, when imposing the delay, Interior did not rely upon any of the regulations to which the Government
now refers. OBPA required Interior to impose the contract-violating
delay and changed pre-existing contract-incorporated requirements
in several ways. By communicating its intent to follow OBPA, the
Government was communicating its intent to violate the contracts.

(b) The Government's contract breach was substantial, for it deprived
the companies of the benefit of their bargain. Under the contracts,
the incorporated procedures and standards amounted to a gateway to

Syllabus

the companies' enjoyment of their rights to explore and develop oil.
Timely and fair consideration of a submitted Plan was a material condition of the contracts, yet the Government announced an OBPA-required
delay of 13 months minimum, and the delay turned out to be at least
four years. This modification of the procedures was not technical
or insubstantial, and it amounted to a repudiation of the contracts.
Pp. 620-621.

(c) Although acceptance of a once-repudiated contract can constitute
a waiver of the restitution right that repudiation would otherwise create, none of the events that the Government points to--that the companies submitted the Plan to Interior two days after OBPA became law,
that the companies subsequently asked the Commerce Secretary to
override North Carolina's objection to the CZMA certification, and that
the companies received suspensions of their leases pending OBPAmandated approval delays--amounts to significant postrepudiation performance. Pp. 621-623.

(d) Finally, the Government's argument that OBPA caused the companies no injury because they could not have met the CZMA consistency
requirements misses the point: The companies seek not damages for
breach of contract but restitution of their initial payments. Because
the Government repudiated the contracts, the law entitles the companies to that restitution whether the contracts would, or would not, ultimately have produced a financial gain or led them to obtain a definite
right to explore. Pp. 623-624.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
Two oil companies, petitioners here, seek restitution of$156 million they paid the Government in return for lease

contracts giving them rights to explore for and develop oiloff the North Carolina coast. The rights were not absolute,
but were conditioned on the companies' obtaining a set offurther governmental permissions. The companies claim
that the Government repudiated the contracts when it de-nied them certain elements of the permission-seeking opportunities that the contracts had promised. We agree that theGovernment broke its promise; it repudiated the contracts;
and it must give the companies their money back.

SOUTHEAST, INC. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

895 (1996) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omit-ted). The Restatement of Contracts reflects many of the

principles of contract law that are applicable to this action.As set forth in the Restatement of Contracts, the relevant
principles specify that, when one party to a contract repudi-ates that contract, the other party "is entitled to restitution
for any benefit that he has conferred on" the repudiatingparty "by way of part performance or reliance." Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 373 (1979) (hereinafter Restate-ment). The Restatement explains that "repudiation" is a
"statement by the obligor to the obligee indicating that theobligor will commit a breach that would of itself give the
obligee a claim for damages for total breach." Id., $ 250.And "total breach" is a breach that "so substantially impairs
the value of the contract to the injured party at the time ofthe breach that it is just in the circumstances to allow him
to recover damages based on all his remaining rights to per-formance."

Id., $ 243.As applied to this action, these principles amount to the

following: If the Government said it would break, or didbreak, an important contractual promise, thereby "substantially impair[ing] the value of the contract[s]" to the compa-nies,

ibid., then (unless the companies waived their rights torestitution) the Government must give the companies their

money back. And it must do so whether the contractswould, or would not, ultimately have proved financially beneficial to the companies. The Restatement illustrates thispoint as follows:

"A contracts to sell a tract of land to B for $100,000.After B has made a part payment of $20,000, A wrongfully refuses to transfer title. B can recover the $20,000in restitution. The result is the same even if the market price of the land is only $70,000, so that performancewould have been disadvantageous to B."

Opinion of the Court

B
In 1981, in return for up-front "bonus" payments to the
United States of about $156 million (plus annual rental
payments), the companies received 10-year renewable lease
contracts with the United States. In these contracts, the
United States promised the companies, among other things,
that they could explore for oil off the North Carolina coast
and develop any oil that they found (subject to further royalty payments) provided that the companies received exploration and development permissions in accordance with various statutes and regulations to which the lease contracts
were made "subject." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253,
pp. 174a-185a.

The statutes and regulations, the terms of which in effect
were incorporated into the contracts, made clear that obtaining the necessary permissions might not be an easy matter.
In particular, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
(OCSLA), 67 Stat. 462, as amended, 43 U. S. C. $ 1331 et seq.
(1994 ed. and Supp. III), and the Coastal Zone Management
Act of 1972 (CZMA), 86 Stat. 1280, 16 U. S. C. $ 1451 et
seq., specify that leaseholding companies wishing to explore
and drill must successfully complete the following four
procedures.

First, a company must prepare and obtain Department of
the Interior approval for a Plan of Exploration (Exploration
Plan or Plan). 43 U. S. C. $ 1340(c). Interior must approve
a submitted Exploration Plan unless it finds, after "consider[ing] available relevant environmental information,"

$ 1346(d), that the proposed exploration

"would probably cause serious harm or damage to life
(including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to
any mineral . . . , to the national security or defense,
or to the marine, coastal, or human environment."

$ 1334(a)(2)(A)(i).

610 MOBIL OIL EXPLORATION & PRODUCING

SOUTHEAST, INC. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

Where approval is warranted, Interior must act quickly--
within "thirty days" of the company's submission of a proposed Plan. $ 1340(c)(1).

Second, the company must obtain an exploratory well drilling permit. To do so, it must certify (under CZMA) that
its Exploration Plan is consistent with the coastal zone
management program of each affected State. 16 U. S. C.

$ 1456(c)(3). If a State objects, the certification fails, unless
the Secretary of Commerce overrides the State's objection.
If Commerce rules against the State, then Interior may
grant the permit. $ 1456(c)(3)(A).

Third, where waste discharge into ocean waters is at issue,
the company must obtain a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit from the Environmental Protection Agency. 33 U. S. C. $$ 1311(a), 1342(a). It can obtain
this permit only if affected States agree that its Exploration
Plan is consistent with the state coastal zone management
programs or (as just explained) the Secretary of Commerce
overrides the state objections. 16 U. S. C. $ 1456.

Fourth, if exploration is successful, the company must prepare, and obtain Interior approval for, a Development and
Production Plan--a Plan that describes the proposed drilling
and related environmental safeguards. 43 U. S. C. $ 1351.
Again, Interior's approval is conditioned upon certification
that the Plan is consistent with state coastal zone management plans--a certification to which States can object, subject to Commerce Department override. $ 1351(a)(3).

C
The events at issue here concern the first two steps of the
process just described--Interior's consideration of a submitted Exploration Plan and the companies' submission of the
CZMA "consistency certification" necessary to obtain an exploratory well drilling permit. The relevant circumstances
are the following:

Opinion of the Court
1. In 1981, the companies and the Government enteredinto the lease contracts. The companies paid the Government $156 million in up-front cash "bonus" payments.2. In 1989, the companies, Interior, and North Carolina
entered into a memorandum of understanding. In thatmemorandum, the companies promised that they would submit an initial draft Exploration Plan to North Carolina before they submitted their final Exploration Plan to Interior.Interior promised that it would prepare an environmental

report on the initial draft. It also agreed to suspend thecompanies' annual lease payments (about $250,000 per year)
while the companies prepared the initial draft and while any
state objections to the companies' CZMA consistency certifications were being worked out, with the life of each lease
being extended accordingly.

3. In September 1989, the companies submitted their
initial draft Exploration Plan to North Carolina. Ten
months later, Interior issued the promised ("informal" presubmission) environmental report, after a review which all
parties concede was "extensive and intensive." App. 179
(deposition of David Courtland O'Neal, former Assistant Secretary of the Interior) (agreeing that the review was "the
most extensive and intensive" ever "afforded an exploration
well in the outer continental shelf (OCS) program"). Interior concluded that the proposed exploration would not "significantly affec[t]" the marine environment or "the quality
of the human environment." Id., at 138-140 (U. S. Dept. of
Interior Minerals Management Service, Environmental Assessment of Exploration Plan for Manteo Area Block 467
(Sept. 1990)).

4. On August 20, 1990, the companies submitted both their
final Exploration Plan and their CZMA "consistency certification" to Interior.

5. Just two days earlier, on August 18, 1990, a new law,
the Outer Banks Protection Act (OBPA), $ 6003, 104 Stat.
555, had come into effect. That law prohibited the Secre530US2 Unit: $U81 [10-22-01 18:10:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

tary of the Interior from approving any Exploration Plan orDevelopment and Production Plan or to award any drilling

permit until (a) a new OBPA-created Environmental Sci-ences Review Panel had reported to the Secretary, (b) the
Secretary had certified to Congress that he had sufficientinformation to make these OCSLA-required approval decisions, and (c) Congress had been in session an additional 45
days, but (d) in no event could he issue an approval or permitfor the next 13 months (until October 1991). $ 6003(c)(3).

OBPA also required the Secretary, in his certification, to ex-plain and justify in detail any differences between his own
certified conclusions and the new Panel's recommendations.$ 6003(c)(3)(A)(ii)(II).

6. About five weeks later, and in light of the new statute,Interior wrote a letter to the Governor of North Carolina
with a copy to petitioner Mobil. It said that the final sub-mitted Exploration Plan "is deemed to be approvable in all
respects." It added:

"[W]e are required to approve an Exploration Plan unless it is inconsistent with applicable law or because it
would result in serious harm to the environment. Because we have found that Mobil's Plan fully complies
with the law and will have only negligible effect on the
environment, we are not authorized to disapprove the
Plan or require its modification." App. to Pet. for Cert.
in No. 99-253, p. 194a (letter from Regional Director
Bruce Weetman to the Honorable James G. Martin, Governor of North Carolina, dated Sept. 28, 1996).

But, it noted, the new law, the "Outer Banks Protection Act
(OBPA) of 1990 . . . prohibits the approval of any Exploration
Plan at this time." It concluded, "because we are currently
prohibited from approving it, the Plan will remain on file
until the requirements of the OBPA are met." In the meantime a "suspension has been granted to all leases offshore

the State of North Carolina." Ibid. See also App. 129-131(letter from Lawrence H. Ake, Minerals Management Service, to William C. Whittemore, Mobil Exploration & Produc-ing U. S. Inc., dated Sept. 21, 1990 (notice of suspension of
leases, citing 30 CFR $ 250.10(b)(7) (1990) as the basis forthe suspensions)).

About 18 months later, the Secretary of the Interior, afterreceiving the new Panel's report, certified to Congress that
he had enough information to consider the companies' Explo-ration Plan. He added, however, that he would not consider
the Plan until he received certain further studies that thenew Panel had recommended.

7. In November 1990, North Carolina objected to the com-panies' CZMA consistency certification on the ground that
Mobil had not provided sufficient information about possibleenvironmental impact. A month later, the companies asked
the Secretary of Commerce to override North Carolina'sobjection.

8. In 1994, the Secretary of Commerce rejected the com-panies' override request, relying in large part on the fact
that the new Panel had found a lack of adequate informationin respect to certain environmental issues.

9. In 1996, Congress repealed OBPA. $ 109, 110 Stat.1321-177.

D
In October 1992, after all but the two last-mentioned
events had taken place, petitioners joined a breach-of-contract lawsuit brought in the Court of Federal Claims.

On motions for summary judgment, the court found that theUnited States had broken its contractual promise to follow
OCSLA's provisions, in particular the provision requiring In-terior to approve an Exploration Plan that satisfied OCSLA's
requirements within 30 days of its submission to Interior.The United States thereby repudiated the contracts. And
that repudiation entitled the companies to restitution of the

up-front cash "bonus" payments they had made. ConocoInc. v. United States, 35 Fed. Cl. 309 (1996).

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitreversed, one judge dissenting. The panel held that the
Government's refusal to consider the companies' final Explo-ration Plan was not the "operative cause" of any failure to
carry out the contracts' terms because the State's objectionto the companies' CZMA "consistency statement" would
have prevented the companies from exploring regardless.177 F. 3d 1331 (1999).

We granted certiorari to review the Federal Circuit'sdecision.

II
The record makes clear (1) that OCSLA required Interiorto approve "within thirty days" a submitted Exploration

Plan that satisfies OCSLA's requirements, (2) that Interiortold Mobil the companies' submitted Plan met those requirements, (3) that Interior told Mobil it would not approve thecompanies' submitted Plan for at least 13 months, and likely
longer, and (4) that Interior did not approve (or disapprove)the Plan, ever. The Government does not deny that the contracts, made "pursuant to" and "subject to" OCSLA, incorpo-rated OCSLA provisions as promises. The Government further concedes, as it must, that relevant contract law entitlesa contracting party to restitution if the other party "substantially" breached a contract or communicated its intent to doso. See Restatement $ 373(1); 11 W. Jaeger, Williston on
Contracts $ 1312, p. 109 (3d ed. 1968) (hereinafter Williston);5 A. Corbin, Contracts $ 1104, p. 560 (1964); see also

Ankenyv. Clark, 148 U. S. 345, 353 (1893). Yet the Government denies that it must refund the companies' money.This is because, in the Government's view, it did not
breach the contracts or communicate its intent to do so; anybreach was not "substantial"; and the companies waived
their rights to restitution regardless. We shall considereach of these arguments in turn.

615Cite as: 530 U. S. 604 (2000)
Opinion of the Court

A
The Government's "no breach" arguments depend uponthe contract provisions that "subject" the contracts to various statutes and regulations. Those provisions state thatthe contracts are "subject to" (1) OCSLA, (2) "Sections 302
and 303 of the Department of Energy Organization Act," (3)"all regulations issued pursuant to such statutes and in existence upon the effective date of " the contracts, (4) "all regula-tions issued pursuant to such statutes in the future which
provide for the prevention of waste and the conservation" ofOuter Continental Shelf resources, and (5) "all other applicable statutes and regulations." App. to Pet. for Cert. inNo. 99-253, at 175a. The Government says that these provisions incorporate into the contracts, not only the OCSLAprovisions we have mentioned, but also certain other statutory provisions and regulations that, in the Government'sview, granted Interior the legal authority to refuse to approve the submitted Exploration Plan, while suspending theleases instead.

First, the Government refers to 43 U. S. C. $ 1334(a)(1)(A),an OCSLA provision that authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations providing for "the suspension . . . of anyoperation or activity . . . at the request of a lessee, in the
national interest, to facilitate proper development of a lease."(Emphasis added.) This provision, as the emphasized terms
show, requires "the request of a lessee," i. e., the companies.The Government does not explain how this requirement was
satisfied here. Hence, the Government cannot rely uponthe provision.

Second, the Government refers to 30 CFR $ 250.110(b)(4)(1999), formerly codified at 30 CFR $ 250.10(b)(4) (1997), a
regulation stating that "[t]he Regional Supervisor may . . .direct . . . a suspension of any operation or activity . . . [when
the] suspension is necessary for the implementation of therequirements of the National Environmental Policy Act or to
conduct an environmental analysis." The Government says

530US2 Unit: $U81 [10-22-01 18:10:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
616 MOBIL OIL EXPLORATION & PRODUCING

SOUTHEAST, INC. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

that this regulation permitted the Secretary of the Interiorto suspend the companies' leases because that suspension

was "necessary . . . to conduct an environmental analysis,"namely, the analysis demanded by the new statute, OBPA.

The "environmental analysis" referred to, however, is ananalysis the need for which was created by OBPA, a later
enacted statute. The lease contracts say that they are subject to then-existing regulations and to certain future regu-lations, those issued pursuant to OCSLA and $$ 302 and 303

of the Department of Energy Organization Act. This ex-plicit reference to future regulations makes it clear that the
catchall provision that references "all other applicable . . .
regulations," supra, at 615, must include only statutes and
regulations already existing at the time of the contract, see
35 Fed. Cl., at 322-323, a conclusion not questioned here by
the Government. Hence, these provisions mean that the
contracts are not subject to future regulations promulgated
under other statutes, such as new statutes like OBPA.
Without some such contractual provision limiting the Government's power to impose new and different requirements,
the companies would have spent $156 million to buy next to
nothing. In any event, the Court of Claims so interpreted
the lease; the Federal Circuit did not disagree with that interpretation; nor does the Government here dispute it.

Instead, the Government points out that the regulation in
question--the regulation authorizing a governmental suspension in order to conduct "an environmental analysis"--
was not itself a future regulation. Rather, a similar regulation existed at the time the parties signed the contracts, 30
CFR $ 250.12(a)(iv) (1981), and, in any event, it was promulgated under OCSLA, a statute exempted from the contracts'
temporal restriction. But that fact, while true, is not sufficient to produce the incorporation of future statutory requirements, which is what the Government needs to prevail.
If the pre-existing regulation's words, "an environmental
analysis," were to apply to analyses mandated by future

530US2 Unit: $U81 [10-22-01 18:10:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

617Cite as: 530 U. S. 604 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
statutes, then they would make the companies subject to thesame unknown future requirements that the contracts' specific temporal restrictions were intended to avoid. Conse-quently, whatever the regulation's words might mean in
other contexts, we believe the contracts before us must beinterpreted as excluding the words "environmental analysis"
insofar as those words would incorporate the requirements
of future statutes and future regulations excluded by thecontracts' provisions. Hence, they would not incorporate

into the contracts requirements imposed by a new statutesuch as OBPA.

Third, the Government refers to OCSLA, 43 U. S. C.$ 1334(a)(1), which, after granting Interior rulemaking authority, says that Interior's

"regulations . . . shall include . . . provisions . . . for the
suspension . . . of any operation . . . pursuant to anylease . . .

if there is a threat of serious, irreparable, or
immediate harm or damage to life . . . , to property, toany mineral deposits . . . , or to the marine, coastal, or

human environment." (Emphasis added.)
The Government points to the OBPA Conference Report,
which says that any OBPA-caused delay is "related to . . .environmental protection" and to the need "for the collection

and analysis of crucial oceanographic, ecological, and socio-economic data," to "prevent a public harm." H. R. Conf.
Rep. No. 101-653, p. 163 (1990); see also Brief for UnitedStates 32. At oral argument, the Government noted that
the OBPA mentions "tourism" in North Carolina as a "majorindustry . . . which is subject to potentially significant disruption by offshore oil or gas development." $ 6003(b)(3).
From this, the Government infers that the pre-existing
OCSLA provision authorized the suspension in light of a
"threat of . . . serious harm" to a "human environment."

The fatal flaw in this argument, however, arises out of the
Interior Department's own statement--a statement made

530US2 Unit: $U81 [10-22-01 18:10:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
618 MOBIL OIL EXPLORATION & PRODUCING

SOUTHEAST, INC. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

when citing OBPA to explain its approval delay. Interior
then said that the Exploration Plan "fully complies" with current legal requirements. And the OCSLA statutory provision quoted above was the most pertinent of those current
requirements. Supra, at 609. The Government did not
deny the accuracy of Interior's statement, either in its brief
filed here or its brief filed in the Court of Appeals. Insofar
as the Government means to suggest that the new statute,
OBPA, changed the relevant OCSLA standard (or that
OBPA language and history somehow constitute findings Interior must incorporate by reference), it must mean that
OBPA in effect created a new requirement. For the reasons
set out supra, at 616, however, any such new requirement
would not be incorporated into the contracts.

Finally, we note that Interior itself, when imposing the
lengthy approval delay, did not rely upon any of the regulations to which the Government now refers. Rather, it relied
upon, and cited, a different regulation, 30 CFR $ 250.110(b)(7)
(1999), which gives Interior the power to suspend leases
when "necessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting
production or any other operation or activity." The Government concedes that no judicial decree was involved in this
action and does not rely upon this regulation here.

We conclude, for these reasons, that the Government violated the contracts. Indeed, as Interior pointed out in its
letter to North Carolina, the new statute, OBPA, required
Interior to impose the contract-violating delay. See App.
129 ("The [OBPA] contains provisions that specifically prohibit the Minerals Management Service from approving any
Exploration Plan, approving any Application for Permit to
Drill, or permitting any drilling offshore the State of North
Carolina until at least October 1, 1991"). It therefore made
clear to Interior and to the companies that the United States
had to violate the contracts' terms and would continue to
do so.

530US2 Unit: $U81 [10-22-01 18:10:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

619Cite as: 530 U. S. 604 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
Moreover, OBPA changed pre-existing contractincorporated requirements in several ways. It delayed approval, not only of an Exploration Plan but also of Development and Production Plans; and it delayed the issuance of
drilling permits as well. It created a new type of Interior
Department environmental review that had not previously
existed, conducted by the newly created Environmental Sciences Review Panel; and, by insisting that the Secretary explain in detail any differences between the Secretary's findings and those of the Panel, it created a kind of presumption
in favor of the new Panel's findings.

The dissent argues that only the statements contained in
the letter from Interior to the companies may constitute a
repudiation because "the enactment of legislation is not typically conceived of as a `statement' of anything to any one
party in particular," and a repudiation requires a "statement
by the obligor to the obligee indicating that the obligor will
commit a breach." Post, at 630-631, n. 4 (opinion of Ste-
vens, J.) (quoting Restatement $ 250). But if legislation
passed by Congress and signed by the President is not a
"statement by the obligor," it is difficult to imagine what
would constitute such a statement. In this action, it was
the United States who was the "obligor" to the contract.
See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253, at 174a (lease, identifying "the United States of America" as the "Lessor").
Although the dissent points out that legislation is "addressed
to the public at large," post, at 631, n. 4, that "public" includes those to whom the United States had contractual obligations. If the dissent means to invoke a special exception
such as the "sovereign acts" doctrine, which treats certain
laws as if they simply created conditions of impossibility,
see Winstar, 518 U. S., at 891-899 (principal opinion of
Souter, J.); id., at 923-924 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), it cannot do so here. The Court of Federal Claims
rejected the application of that doctrine to this action, see

Opinion of the Court

35 Fed. Cl., at 334-336, and the Government has not con-tested that determination here. Hence, under these circumstances, the fact that Interior's repudiation rested upon theenactment of a new statute makes no significant difference.

We do not say that the changes made by the statute wereunjustified. We say only that they were changes of a kind
that the contracts did not foresee. They were changes inthose approval procedures and standards that the contracts
had incorporated through cross-reference. The Governmenthas not convinced us that Interior's actions were authorized by any other contractually cross-referenced provision.Hence, in communicating to the companies its intent to follow
OBPA, the United States was communicating its intent toviolate the contracts.

B
The Government next argues that any violation of the con-tracts' terms was not significant; hence there was no "substantial" or "material" breach that could have amounted to a"repudiation." In particular, it says that OCSLA's 30-day
approval period "does not function as the `essence' of theseagreements." Brief for United States 37. The Court of
Claims concluded, however, that timely and fair consider-ation of a submitted Exploration Plan was a "necessary reciprocal obligation," indeed, that any "contrary interpreta-tion would render the bargain illusory." 35 Fed. Cl., at 327.
We agree.We recognize that the lease contracts gave the companies
more than rights to obtain approvals. They also gave thecompanies rights to explore for, and to develop, oil. But the
need to obtain Government approvals so qualified the likelyfuture enjoyment of the exploration and development rights
that the contract, in practice, amounted primarily to an opportunity to try to obtain exploration and developmentrights in accordance with the procedures and under the

standards specified in the cross-referenced statutes and reg-ulations. Under these circumstances, if the companies did

Opinion of the Court
not at least buy a promise that the Government would notdeviate significantly from those procedures and standards,

then what did they buy? Cf. id., at 324 (the companiesbought exclusive rights to explore and develop oil "if they
met" OCSLA requirements (emphasis added)).The Government's modification of the contractincorporated processes was not technical or insubstantial.It did not announce an (OBPA-required) approval delay of a
few days or weeks, but of 13 months minimum, and likelymuch longer. The delay turned out to be at least four years.
And lengthy delays matter, particularly where several suc-cessive agency approvals are at stake. Whether an applicant approaches Commerce with an Interior Department ap-proval already in hand can make a difference (as can failure
to have obtained that earlier approval). Moreover, as wehave pointed out, OBPA changed the contract-referenced
procedures in several other ways as well. Supra, at 619.The upshot is that, under the contracts, the incorporated
procedures and standards amounted to a gateway to thecompanies' enjoyment of all other rights. To significantly
narrow that gateway violated material conditions in the con-tracts. The breach was "substantia[l]," depriving the companies of the benefit of their bargain. Restatement $ 243.And the Government's communication of its intent to commit
that breach amounted to a repudiation of the contracts.

C
The Government argues that the companies waived theirrights to restitution. It does not deny that the United

States repudiated the contracts if (as we have found) OBPA'schanges amounted to a substantial breach. The Government does not claim that the United States retracted its re-pudiation. Cf.

id., $ 256 (retraction will nullify the effectsof repudiation if done before the other party either changes

position in reliance on the retraction or communicates thatit considers the repudiation to be final). It cannot claim that

Opinion of the Court

the companies waived their rights simply by urging perform-ance.

Id., $ 257 (the injured party "does not change the effect of a repudiation by urging the repudiator to perform inspite of his repudiation"); see also 11 Williston $ 1334, at 177-

178. Nor has the Government convinced us that the com-panies' continued actions under the contracts amount to
anything more than this urging of performance. See 2
E. Farnsworth, Contracts $ 8.22, p. 544 (2d ed. 1998) (citing
United Cal. Bank v. Prudential Ins. Co., 140 Ariz. 238, 282-
283, 681 P. 2d 390, 433-434 (App. 1983) (urging performanceand making "efforts of its own to fulfill the conditions" of the

contract come to the same thing)); cf. 11 Williston $ 1337, at
186-187. Consequently the Government's waiver claim
must come down to a claim that the companies received at
least partial performance. Indeed, acceptance of performance under a once-repudiated contract can constitute a
waiver of the right to restitution that repudiation would otherwise create. Restatement $ 373, Comment a; cf. Restatement of Restitution $ 68, Comment b (1936).

The United States points to three events that, in its view,
amount to continued performance of the contracts. But it
does not persuade us. First, the oil companies submitted
their Exploration Plan to Interior two days after OBPA became law. Supra, at 611. The performance question, however, is not just about what the oil companies did or requested, but also about what they actually received from the
Government. And, in respect to the Exploration Plan, the
companies received nothing.

Second, the companies subsequently asked the Secretary
of Commerce to overturn North Carolina's objection to the
companies' CZMA consistency certification. And, although
the Secretary's eventual response was negative, the companies did at least receive that reply. Supra, at 613. The
Secretary did not base his reply, however, upon application
of the contracts' standards, but instead relied in large part
on the findings of the new, OBPA-created, Environmental

Opinion of the Court
Sciences Review Panel. See App. 224, 227, n. 35, 232-233,239, 244 (citing the Panel's report). Consequently, we cannot say that the companies received from Commerce the kindof consideration for which their contracts called.

Third, the oil companies received suspensions of theirleases (suspending annual rents and extending lease terms)
pending the OBPA-mandated approval delays. Supra, at612-613. However, a separate contract--the 1989 memorandum of understanding--entitled the companies to receivethese suspensions. See App. to Brief for United States 2a
(letter from Toni D. Hennike, Counsel, Mobil Exploration &Producing U. S. Inc., to Ralph Melancon, Regional Supervisor, U. S. Dept. of Interior Minerals Management Service,dated Feb. 21, 1995 (quoting the memorandum as a basis for
the requested suspensions)). And the Government has pro-vided no convincing reason why we should consider the suspensions to amount to significant performance of the leasecontracts in question.

We conclude that the companies did not receive significantpostrepudiation performance. We consequently find that
they did not waive their right to restitution.

D
Finally, the Government argues that repudiation could nothave hurt the companies. Since the companies could not

have met the CZMA consistency requirements, they couldnot have explored (or ultimately drilled) for oil in any event.
Hence, OBPA caused them no damage. As the Governmentputs it, the companies have already received "such damages
as were actually caused by the [Exploration Plan approval]delay," namely, none. Brief for United States 43-44; see
also 177 F. 3d, at 1340. This argument, however, misses thebasic legal point. The oil companies do not seek damages
for breach of contract. They seek restitution of their initialpayments. Because the Government repudiated the lease
contracts, the law entitles the companies to that restitution

whether the contracts would, or would not, ultimately haveproduced a financial gain or led them to obtain a definite

right to explore. See supra, at 608. If a lottery operatorfails to deliver a purchased ticket, the purchaser can get his
money back--whether or not he eventually would have wonthe lottery. And if one party to a contract, whether oil company or ordinary citizen, advances the other party money,principles of restitution normally require the latter, upon repudiation, to refund that money. Restatement $ 373.

III
Contract law expresses no view about the wisdom ofOBPA. We have examined only that statute's consistency

with the promises that the earlier contracts contained. Wefind that the oil companies gave the United States $156 million in return for a contractual promise to follow the termsof pre-existing statutes and regulations. The new statute
prevented the Government from keeping that promise. Thebreach "substantially impair[ed] the value of the contract[s]."
Id., $ 243. And therefore the Government must give thecompanies their money back.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Federal Circuitis reversed. We remand the cases for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Since the 1953 passage of the Outer Continental ShelfLands Act (OCSLA), 43 U. S. C. $ 1331

et seq., the UnitedStates Government has conducted more than a hundred lease

sales of the type at stake today, and bidders have paid theUnited States more than $55 billion for the opportunity to
develop the mineral resources made available under thoseleases.

sees, clearly had a mutual interest in the successful explora-tion, development, and production of oil in the Manteo Unit

pursuant to the leases executed in 1981. If production wereachieved, the United States would benefit both from the substantial royalties it would receive and from the significantaddition to the Nation's energy supply. Self-interest, as
well as its duties under the leases, thus led the Government
to expend substantial resources over the course of 19 years
in the hope of seeing this project realized.

From the outset, however, it was apparent that the Outer
Banks project might not succeed for a variety of reasons.
Among those was the risk that the State of North Carolina
would exercise its right to object to the completion of the
project. That was a risk that the parties knowingly assumed. They did not, however, assume the risk that Congress would enact additional legislation that would delay the
completion of what would obviously be a lengthy project in
any event. I therefore agree with the Court that the Government did breach its contract with petitioners in failing to
approve, within 30 days of its receipt, the plan of exploration
petitioners submitted. As the Court describes, ante, at 609-

610, the leases incorporate the provisions of the OCSLA into
their terms, and the OCSLA, correspondingly, sets down this
30-day requirement in plain language. 43 U. S. C. $ 1340(c).

I do not, however, believe that the appropriate remedy for
the Government's breach is for petitioners to recover their
full initial investment. When the entire relationship between the parties is considered, with particular reference to
the impact of North Carolina's foreseeable exercise of its
right to object to the project, it is clear that the remedy
ordered by the Court is excessive. I would hold that petitioners are entitled at best to damages resulting from the
delay caused by the Government's failure to approve the plan
within the requisite time.

(reporting more than $64 billion in royalties from federal offshore mineral
leases from 1953-1999).

I
To understand the nature of the breach, and the appro-priate remedy for it, it is necessary to supplement the

Court's chronological account. From the time petitionersbegan discussing their interest in drilling an exploratory well
45 miles off the coast from Cape Hatteras in the fall of 1988,until (and even after) the enactment of the Outer Banks Protection Act (OBPA), $ 6003, on August 18, 1990, their explora-tion proposal was fraught with problems. It was clear to
petitioners as early as October 6, 1988 (and almost certainlybefore), that the State of North Carolina, whose approval
petitioners knew they had to have under their lease termsin order to obtain the requisite permits from the Department
of the Interior (DOI), was not going to go along readily.App. 61-63 (letter from North Carolina Governor James G.
Martin to Ralph Ainger, Acting Regional Manager, MineralsManagement Service (MMS) (a division of the DOI)). As
the Court explains, ante, at 610, without the State's approvalpursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16
U. S. C. $ 1451 et seq., incorporated into the OCSLA by multi-ple references, no DOI licensing, permitting, or lessee exploration of any kind could ensue, 43 U. S. C. $ 1340(c).That is why petitioners pursued multiparty negotiations
with the Federal Government and the State to help facilitatethe eventual approval of their proposal. As part of these
negotiations, petitioners entered into a memorandum of un-derstanding with North Carolina and the Federal Government, and, according to the terms of that agreement, submit-ted a draft plan of exploration (POE) to DOI and to the State.
App. 79-85. The Government also agreed to prepare draftand final environmental impact reports on petitioners' draft
POE and to participate in public meetings and hearings re-garding the draft POE and the Government's findings about
its environmental impact. Id., at 81-82. Among otherthings, this agreement resulted in the Government's preparation in 1990 of a three-volume, 2,000-page special environ530US2 Unit: $U81 [10-22-01 18:10:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mental report on the proposed project, released on June 1 ofthat year.

Although the State thereafter continued to express its dis-satisfaction with the prospect of exploration and development, voicing its displeasure with the Government's draftenvironmental findings, id., at 86-95, and rejecting petitioners' application for a separate required permit, id., at 96-97,2petitioners nonetheless submitted a final POE to DOI on August 20, 1990, pursuant to the lease contract terms. Thisfinal plan, it must be noted, was submitted by petitioners
two days after the enactment of the OBPA--the event peti-tioners claim amounted to (either) an anticipatory repudiation of the lease contracts, or a total breach, Brief for Peti-tioner in No. 99-244, p. 19 ("[I]n enacting the OBPA, the
Government anticipatorily repudiated its obligations underthe leases . . ."); Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-253, p. 21
("The enactment of the OBPA placed the United States intotal breach of the petitioners' leases").

Following petitioners' submission of the final POE, DOIthen had a duty, under the terms of the OCSLA as incorporated into the lease contract, to approve that plan "withinthirty days of its submission." 43 U. S. C. $ 1340(c)(1). In
other words, DOI had until September 19, 1990, to considerthe submitted plan and, provided that the plan was complete
and otherwise satisfied the OCSLA criteria, to issue itsstatement of approval. (Issuing its "approval," of course, is
different from granting petitioners any "license or permit for

$ 1340(c)(2); actual permission to proceed had to wait for theState's CZMA certification.) Despite this hard deadline,
September 19 came and went without DOI's issuance ofapproval.

DOI's explanation came two days later, on September 21,
1990, in a letter to Mobil Oil from the MMS's Acting RegionalSupervisor for Field Operations, Lawrence Ake. Without

commenting on DOI's substantive assessment of the POE,the Ake letter stated that the OBPA "specifically prohibit[s]"
the MMS from approving any POE "until at least October 1,
1991." App. 129. "Consequently," Mr. Ake explained, the
MMS was suspending operation on the Manteo Unit leases
"in accordance with 30 CFR $ 250.10(b)(7)," ibid., a regulation issued pursuant to the OCSLA and, of course, incorporated thereby into the parties' lease agreement. One week
after that, on September 28, 1990, the MMS's Regional Director, Bruce Weetman, sent a letter to Governor Martin of
North Carolina, elaborating on MMS's actions upon receipt
of the August 20 POE. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253,
pp. 193a-195a. According to Weetman, the POE "was
deemed complete on August 30, and transmitted to other
Federal Agencies and the State of North Carolina on that
date. Timely comments were received from the State of
North Carolina and the U. S. Coast Guard. An analysis of
the potential environmental [e]ffects associated with the Plan
was conducted, an Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared, and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was
made." Id., at 193a. Based on these steps taken by the
MMS, it concluded that the POE was "approvable" but that
the MMS was "currently prohibited from approving it."
Thus, the letter concluded, the POE would "remain on file"
pending the resolution of the OBPA requirements, and the
lease suspensions would continue in force in the interim.
Id., at 194a.

II
In my judgment, the Government's failure to meet the re-quired 30-day deadline on September 19, 1990, despite the

fact that the POE was in a form that merited approval, wasa breach of its contractual obligation to the contrary.

3 After

this, its statement in the September 21 Ake letter that theOBPA prohibited approval until at least October 1991 must

also be seen as a signal of its intent to remain in breach ofthe 30-day deadline requirement for the coming year. The
question with which the Court is faced, however, is notwhether the United States was in breach, but whether, in
light of the Government's actions, petitioners are entitled torestitution rather than damages, the usual remedy for a
breach of contract.As the Court explains, ante, at 608, an injured party may
seek restitution as an alternative remedy only "on a breachby non-performance that gives rise to a claim for damages
for total breach or on a repudiation." Restatement (Second)of Contracts $ 373 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement (Second)).
Whether one describes the suspect action as "repudiation"(which itself is defined in terms of total breach, see ante, at
608) or simply "total breach," the injured party may obtainrestitution only if the action "so substantially impairs the
value of the contract to the injured party . . . that it is justin the circumstances to allow him to recover damages based
on all his remaining rights to performance." Restatement(Second) $ 243. Although the language varies to some small
degree, every major statement of contract law includes thesame admonition. See,

e. g., 5 A. Corbin, Contracts $ 1104,pp. 558, 562 (1964) ("Restitution is an available remedy only

3 It is incorrect, in my view, to assert that the Government failed to give
the proposal "timely and fair consideration," ante, at 620, because, as the
Weetman letter establishes, the Government did engage in such an evaluation process even after the enactment of the OBPA. It was in failing to
issue the approval on the heels of that evaluation that the Government
ran afoul of its obligations.

when the breach is of vital importance. . . . In the case of a
breach by non-performance, . . . [t]he injured party, however,
can not maintain an action for restitution of what he has
given the defendant unless the defendant's non-performance
is so material that it is held to go to the `essence'; it must be
such a breach as would discharge the injured party from any
further contractual duty on his own part"). In short, there
is only repudiation if there is an action that would amount
to a total breach, and there is only such a breach if the suspect action destroys the essential object of the contract. It
is thus necessary to assess the significance or "materiality"
of the Government's breach.

Beyond this, it is important to underscore as well that restitution is appropriate only when it is "just in the circumstances." Restatement (Second) $ 243. This requires us to
look not only to the circumstances of the breach itself, but to
the equities of the situation as a whole. Finally, even if a
defendant's actions do not satisfy the foregoing requirements, an injured party presumably still has available the
standard contract remedy for breach--the damages petitioners suffered as a result.

III

Given these requirements, I am not persuaded that the
actions by the Government amounted either to a repudiation
of the contracts altogether, or to a total breach by way of its
neglect of an "essential" contractual provision.

I would, at the outset, reject the suggestion that there was
a repudiation here, anticipatory or otherwise, for two reasons. First, and most basic, the Government continued to
perform under the contractual terms as best it could even
after the OBPA's passage.4 Second, the breach-by-delay

4 My rejection of the repudiation theory, of course, encompasses a rejection of the notion that the very enactment of the OBPA itself constituted
an anticipatory repudiation of the parties' contract. Brief for Petitioner
in No. 99-244, p. 19. Repudiation, as the Court explains, is in the first
instance a " `statement by the obligor to the obligee indicating that the

forecast in the Ake letter was not "of sufficient gravity that,if the breach actually occurred, it would of itself give the

obligee a claim for damages for total breach." Restatement(Second) $ 250, and Comment d; see also 11 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts $ 1312 (3d ed. 1968).While acknowledging the OBPA's temporary moratorium
on plan approvals, the Ake letter to petitioner Mobil statesthat the Government is imposing a lease

suspension--ratherthan a cancellation or recision--and even references an existing OCSLA regulatory obligation pursuant to which it is at-tempting to act. The Weetman letter explains in detail the
actions the MMS took in carefully considering petitioners'POE submission; it evaluated the plan for its compliance
with the OCSLA's provisions, transmitted it to other agen-cies and the State for their consideration, took the comments
of those entities into account, conducted the requisite analy-ses, and prepared the requisite findings--all subsequent to
the OBPA's enactment. It cannot be doubted that the Gov-ernment intended to continue performing the contract to the
extent it thought legally permissible post-OBPA.Indeed, petitioners' own conduct is inconsistent with the
contention that the Government had, as of August 18, 1990,
obligor will commit a breach.' " Ante, at 608 (quoting Restatement (Second) $ 250). Except in some abstract sense, the enactment of legislation
is not typically conceived of as a "statement" of anything to any one party
in particular, for it is, by its nature, addressed to the public at large. To
the extent this legislation was directed to anyone in particular, it was to
the Secretary of the Interior, directing him to take or not take certain
actions, not to particular lessees. Finally, while it surely imposed upon
the Secretary obligations inconsistent with the Secretary's existing duties under the leases, the OBPA itself contemplated that the parties to
the lease contracts would continue, after a delay, to operate under the
OCSLA-based contractual scheme. The Secretary was, within the confines of the newly enacted requirements, to continue to take steps to
"carry out his responsibilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
Act with respect to authorizing the activities described in subsection (c)(1)
[(i. e., approve exploration, development and production plans for lessees,
or grant an application for permit to drill; permit drilling)]." $ 6003(d),

or indeed as of September 19, 1990, fully repudiated its obli-gations under the parties' contracts. As I have mentioned,

it was after the enactment of the OBPA that petitioners sub-mitted their final plan to the DOI--just as if they understood
there still to be an existing set of contractual conditions to befulfilled and expected to fulfill them. Petitioners, moreover,
accepted the Government's proffered lease suspensions, andindeed, themselves subsequently requested that the suspensions remain in effect "from June 8, 1992 forward" under 30CFR $ 250.10(b)(6) (1990), an OCSLA regulation providing
for continued lease suspension at the lessee's request "toallow for inordinate delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits or consents, including administra-tive or judicial challenges or appeals."

After the State of North Carolina filed its formal CZMAobjections on November 19, 1990 (indicating that the State

believed a contract still existed), petitioners promptly soughtin December 1990--again under statutory terms incorporated into the contracts--to have the Secretary of Commerceoverride the objections, 43 U. S. C. $ 1340(c)(1), to make it
possible for the exploration permits to issue. In a responseexplainable solely on the basis that the Government still believed itself to be performing contractually obligatory terms,the Secretary of Commerce undertook to evaluate petitioners' request that the Secretary override the State's CZMAobjections. This administrative review process has, I do not
doubt, required a substantial expenditure of the time andresources of the Departments of Commerce and Interior,
along with the 12 other administrative agencies whose com-ments the Secretary of Commerce solicited in evaluating the
request to override and in issuing, on September 2, 1994,

a lengthy "Decision and Findings" in which he declined todo so.

And petitioners were not finished with the leases yet.After petitioners received this adverse judgment from Commerce, they sought the additional lease suspensions de-scribed, see App. to Brief for United States 1a (letter from
Toni Hennike, Counsel, Mobil Oil, to Ralph Melancon, Regional Supervisor, MMS, Feb. 21, 1995), insisting that "thetime period to seek judicial review of the Secretary's decisions had not expired when the MMS terminated the [pre-existing] suspensions," and that "[s]ince the Secretary's decision is being challenged, it is not a final decision and will not
be until it is upheld by a final nonappealable judgment issued
from a court with competent jurisdiction," id., at 2a. Indeed, petitioners have pending in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia at this very moment their
appeal from the Secretary of Commerce's denial of petitioners' override request of North Carolina's CZMA objections.
Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v.
Daley, No. 95-93 SSH (filed Mar. 8, 2000).

Absent, then, any repudiation, we are left with the possibility that the nature of the Government's breach was so "essential" or "total" in the scope of the parties' contractual
relationship as to justify the remedy of restitution. As
above, I would reject the suggestion that the OBPA somehow acted ex proprio vigore to render a total breach of the
parties' contracts. See ante, at 621 ("OBPA changed the
contract-referenced procedures in several other ways as
well"); Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-253, at 21. The OBPA
was not passed as an amendment to statutes that the leases
by their terms incorporated, nor did the OBPA state that its
terms were to be considered incorporated into then-existing
leases; it was, rather, an action external to the contract, capable of affecting the parties' actions but not of itself changing the contract terms. The OBPA did, of course, impose a
legal duty upon the Secretary of the Interior to take actions

Government's existing legal obligations to the lessees. Had
the Secretary chosen, despite the OBPA, to issue the required approval, he presumably could have been haled into
court and compelled to rescind the approval in compliance
with the OBPA requirement.6 But that this possibility remained after the passage of the OBPA reinforces the conclusion that it was not until the Secretary actually took action
inconsistent with his contractual obligations that the Government came into breach.

In rejecting the Government's argument that the breach
was insufficiently material, the Court's reliance on the danger of rendering the parties' bargain illusory, see ante, at
620, is simply misplaced. I do not contest that the Government was contractually obliged to give petitioners' POE
prompt consideration and to approve the POE if, after that
consideration, it satisfied existing OCSLA demands; nor
would I suggest that petitioners did not receive as part of
their bargain a promise that the Government would comply
with the procedural mechanisms established at the time of
contracting. But that is all quite beside the point; the question is not whether this approval requirement was part of
the bargain but whether it was so "essential" to the bargain
in the scope of this continuing contract as to constitute a
total breach.

6 The result of such a proceeding may well have been the issuance of a
judicial decree enjoining the Secretary's actions. Ironically, the Secretary would then have been authorized under the regulatory provisions
expressly incorporated into the parties' contracts to suspend the leases.
30 CFR $ 250.10(b)(7) (1990) ("The Regional Supervisor may also direct . . .
suspension of any operation or activity, including production, because . . .
(7) [t]he suspension is necessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting production or any other operation or activity, or the permitting of
those activities . . ."). Indeed, this was the very provision the DOI
relied on in explaining why it was suspending petitioners' leases. App.
129-130.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Whether the breach was sufficiently "substantial" or mate-rial to justify restitution depends on what impact, if any, the

breach had at the time the breach occurred on the successfulcompletion of the project. See E. Farnsworth, Contracts

$ 8.16 (3d ed. 1999) ("The time for determining materiality isthe time of the breach and not the time that the contract was
made. . . . Most significant is the extent to which the breach
will deprive the injured party of the benefit that it justifiablyexpected"). In this action the answer must be close to none.

Sixty days after the Government entered into breach--fromSeptember 19, 1990, to November 19, 1990--the State of
North Carolina filed its formal objection to CZMA certification with the United States. App. 141-148. As the OCSLA
makes clear, "The Secretary shall not grant any license or
permit for any activity described in detail in an exploration
plan and affecting any land use or water use in the coastal
zone of a State with a coastal zone management program . . .
unless the State concurs or is conclusively presumed to concur with the consistency certification accompanying such
plan . . . , or the Secretary of Commerce makes the finding
[overriding the State's objection]." 43 U. S. C. $ 1340(c)(2)
(emphasis added); see also $ 1351(d). While this objection
remained in effect, the project could not go forward unless
the objection was set aside by the Secretary of Commerce.
Thus, the Government's breach effectively delayed matters
during the period between September 19, 1990, and November 19, 1990. Thereafter, implementation was contractually
precluded by North Carolina.

This fact does not, of course, relieve the Government of
liability for breach. It does, however, make it inappropriate
to conclude that the Government's pre-November 19 actions
in breach were sufficiently "material" to the successful completion of the parties' project to justify giving petitioners all
of their money back. At the time of the Government's
breach, petitioners had no reasonable expectation under the
lease contract terms that the venture would come to fruition

in the near future. Petitioners had known since 1988 that
the State of North Carolina had substantial concerns about
petitioners' proposed exploration; North Carolina had already officially objected to petitioners' NPDES submission--
a required step itself dependent on the State's CZMA
approval. App. 106-111. At the same time, the Federal
Government's own substantial investments of time and
resources, as well as its extensive good-faith efforts both
before and after the OBPA was passed to preserve the arrangement, gave petitioners the reasonable expectation that
the Government would continue trying to make the contract
work. And indeed, both parties continued to behave consistently with that expectation.

While apparently recognizing that the substantiality of the
Government's breach is a relevant question, see ante, at 608,
the Court spends almost no time at all concluding that the
breach was substantial enough to award petitioners a $156
million refund, ante, at 620-621. In a single brief paragraph
of explanation, the Court first posits that the Government
"did not announce an . . . approval delay of a few days or
weeks, but of 13 months minimum and likely much longer."
Ante, at 621. The Court here is presumably referring to the
Ake letter to Mobil written a few days after the expiration
of the 30-day deadline. But the Government's "statement"
to this effect could matter only in the context of evaluating
an intended repudiation; because, as I have explained, that
"announcement" cannot be seen as a repudiation of the contract, I do not see how the statement itself exacerbates the
effect of the Government's breach. What matters in evaluating a breach, of course, is not what the Government said,
but what the Government did. And what the Government
did was, as I have explained, continue to perform in every
other way possible--evaluating the August 20 POE; suspending the leases, including suspensions in response to petitioners' express requests (suspensions that continue in effect

to this day); and responding over years to petitioners' appeal
from the State's CZMA objection.7

The Court also asserts, without support, that "[w]hether
an applicant approaches Commerce with an Interior Department approval already in hand can make a difference (as can
failure to have obtained that earlier approval)." Ibid. Although the Court thereby implies that the Secretary of Commerce's handling of petitioners' CZMA override request was
somehow tied to the DOI's failure to issue the required approval, there is record evidence that petitioners' CZMA appeals were not "suspended, impeded, or otherwise delayed
by enactment or implementation of the . . . OBPA . . . ."
App. 187 (declaration of Margo E. Jackson, Conoco Inc. v.
United States, No. 92-331-C (Fed. Cl., Apr. 6, 1994) (Commerce Department supervisor in charge of handling Mobil's
appeals)). Whether or not the Secretary's decision was in7 The Court's cursory efforts to discount this evidence of continued performance fall far short. In light of the Weetman letter's detailed description of the Government's efforts to evaluate the POE as submitted, the
Court's assertion that "in respect to the exploration plan, the companies
received nothing," ante, at 622, cannot be correct. The Court itself insists
on making an indispensable part of the parties' contract mutual promises
to follow certain procedures, ante, at 620; if that is the case, we must
credit the Government's efforts to follow those procedures as performance
of that promise, and that performance was "received" by petitioners.

The Court also suggests that the Government was obligated to extend
the lease suspensions to petitioners under the terms of the parties' separately adopted memorandum of understanding; the Government should
therefore, by the Court's logic, receive no credit under the lease contracts
for continuing to perform. Ante, at 623. Whether or not the Government was separately obligated to extend the suspensions it did (and of
course the memorandum agreement only exists because of and as part of
the parties' efforts to fulfill the lease contract terms), both the Government in extending the initial suspensions, and petitioners, in requesting
additional suspensions, expressly relied upon regulations incorporated into
the OCSLA lease contracts, see supra, at 631-632. The Court must
stretch to avoid crediting the Government's performance.

fluenced by OBPA-required findings is, of course, a questionof fact that, despite the Court's assertion,

ante, at 622-623,
none of the lower courts in this action decided. Regardless,there is certainly no

contractual basis for the proposition
that DOI's approval is a condition precedent or in any re-spect material to overcoming a state-filed CZMA objection.

That objection, petitioners most certainly knew, was coming
whether or not DOI approved the submitted POE.In the end, the Court's central reason for finding the

breach "not technical or insubstantial" is that "lengthy de-lays matter."

Ante, at 621. I certainly agree with that
statement as a general principle. But in this action, that
principle does not justify petitioners' request for restitution.
On its face, petitioners' contention that time was "of the essence" in this bargain is difficult to accept; petitioners themselves waited seven years into the renewable 10-year lease
term before even floating the Outer Banks proposal, and
waited another two years after the OBPA was passed before
filing this lawsuit. After then accepting a full 10 years of
the Government's above-and-beyond-the-call performance,
time is now suddenly of the essence? As with any venture
of this magnitude, this undertaking was rife with possibilities for "lengthy delays," indeed "inordinate delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits or
consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or
appeals," 30 CFR $ 250.10(b)(6) (1990). The OBPA was not,
to be sure, a cause for delay that petitioners may have anticipated in signing onto the lease. But the State's CZMA and
NPDES objections, and the subsequent "inordinate delays"
for appeals, certainly were. The Secretary's approval was
indeed "a gateway to the companies' enjoyment of all other
rights," but the critical word here is "a"; approval was only
one gateway of many that the petitioners knew they had to
get through in order to reap the benefit of the OCSLA leases,
and even that gate was not closed completely, but only "narrow[ed]," ante, at 621. Any long-term venture of this com530US2 Unit: $U81 [10-22-01 18:10:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

plexity and significance is bound to be a gamble. The factthat North Carolina was holding all the aces should not give

petitioners the right now to play with an entirely new deckof cards.

IV
The risk that North Carolina would frustrate performanceof the leases executed in 1981 was foreseeable from the date

the leases were signed. It seems clear to me that theState's objections, rather than the enactment of OBPA, is the
primary explanation for petitioners' decision to take steps toavoid suffering the consequences of the bargain they made.
As a result of the Court's action today, petitioners will enjoya windfall reprieve that Congress foolishly provided them in
its decision to pass legislation that, while validly respondingto a political constituency that opposed the development of
the Outer Banks, caused the Government to breach its owncontract. Viewed in the context of the entire transaction,
petitioners may well be entitled to a modest damages recov-ery for the two months of delay attributable to the Government's breach. But restitution is not a default remedy; it isavailable only when a court deems it, in all of the circumstances, just. A breach that itself caused at most a delay oftwo months in a protracted enterprise of this magnitude does
not justify the $156 million draconian remedy that theCourt delivers.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA et al. v. DALE
certiorari to the supreme court of new jersey

No. 99-699. Argued April 26, 2000--Decided June 28, 2000
Petitioners are the Boy Scouts of America and its Monmouth Council (collectively, Boy Scouts). The Boy Scouts is a private, not-for-profit organization engaged in instilling its system of values in young people. It
asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with those values. Respondent Dale is an adult whose position as assistant scoutmaster of a
New Jersey troop was revoked when the Boy Scouts learned that he is
an avowed homosexual and gay rights activist. He filed suit in the New
Jersey Superior Court, alleging, inter alia, that the Boy Scouts had
violated the state statute prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. That court's Chancery Division granted summary judgment for the Boy Scouts, but its
Appellate Division reversed in pertinent part and remanded. The
State Supreme Court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that the Boy Scouts
violated the State's public accommodations law by revoking Dale's membership based on his avowed homosexuality. Among other rulings, the
court held that application of that law did not violate the Boy Scouts'
First Amendment right of expressive association because Dale's inclusion would not significantly affect members' ability to carry out their
purposes; determined that New Jersey has a compelling interest in eliminating the destructive consequences of discrimination from society, and
that its public accommodations law abridges no more speech than is
necessary to accomplish its purpose; and distinguished Hurley v. IrishAmerican Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S.
557, on the ground that Dale's reinstatement did not compel the Boy
Scouts to express any message.

Held: Applying New Jersey's public accommodations law to require the

Boy Scouts to readmit Dale violates the Boy Scouts' First Amendment
right of expressive association. Government actions that unconstitutionally burden that right may take many forms, one of which is intrusion into a group's internal affairs by forcing it to accept a member it
does not desire. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623.
Such forced membership is unconstitutional if the person's presence affects in a significant way the group's ability to advocate public or private
viewpoints. New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487
U. S. 1, 13. However, the freedom of expressive association is not absolute; it can be overridden by regulations adopted to serve compelling

Syllabus
state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be
achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational
freedoms. Roberts, 468 U. S., at 623. To determine whether a group
is protected, this Court must determine whether the group engages in
"expressive association." The record clearly reveals that the Boy
Scouts does so when its adult leaders inculcate its youth members with
its value system. See id., at 636. Thus, the Court must determine
whether the forced inclusion of Dale would significantly affect the Boy
Scouts' ability to advocate public or private viewpoints. The Court
first must inquire, to a limited extent, into the nature of the Boy Scouts'
viewpoints. The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values embodied in the Scout Oath and Law, particularly those represented by the terms "morally straight" and "clean," and
that the organization does not want to promote homosexual conduct as
a legitimate form of behavior. The Court gives deference to the Boy
Scouts' assertions regarding the nature of its expression, see Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S.
107, 123-124. The Court then inquires whether Dale's presence as an
assistant scoutmaster would significantly burden the expression of those
viewpoints. Dale, by his own admission, is one of a group of gay Scouts
who have become community leaders and are open and honest about
their sexual orientation. His presence as an assistant scoutmaster
would interfere with the Scouts' choice not to propound a point of view
contrary to its beliefs. See Hurley, 515 U. S., at 576-577. This Court
disagrees with the New Jersey Supreme Court's determination that the
Boy Scouts' ability to disseminate its message would not be significantly
affected by the forced inclusion of Dale. First, contrary to the state
court's view, an association need not associate for the purpose of disseminating a certain message in order to be protected, but must merely
engage in expressive activity that could be impaired. Second, even if
the Boy Scouts discourages Scout leaders from disseminating views on
sexual issues, its method of expression is protected. Third, the First
Amendment does not require that every member of a group agree on
every issue in order for the group's policy to be "expressive association."
Given that the Boy Scouts' expression would be burdened, the Court
must inquire whether the application of New Jersey's public accommodations law here runs afoul of the Scouts' freedom of expressive association, and concludes that it does. Such a law is within a State's power
to enact when the legislature has reason to believe that a given group
is the target of discrimination and the law does not violate the First
Amendment. See, e. g., id., at 572. The Court rejects Dale's contention that the intermediate standard of review enunciated in United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, should be applied here to evaluate the

Syllabus
competing interests of the Boy Scouts and the State. Rather, the Court
applies an analysis similar to the traditional First Amendment analysis
it applied in Hurley. A state requirement that the Boy Scouts retain
Dale would significantly burden the organization's right to oppose or
disfavor homosexual conduct. The state interests embodied in New
Jersey's public accommodations law do not justify such a severe intrusion on the freedom of expressive association. In so ruling, the Court
is not guided by its view of whether the Boy Scouts' teachings with
respect to homosexual conduct are right or wrong; public or judicial
disapproval of an organization's expression does not justify the State's
effort to compel the organization to accept members in derogation of
the organization's expressive message. While the law may promote all
sorts of conduct in place of harmful behavior, it may not interfere with
speech for no better reason than promoting an approved message or
discouraging a disfavored one, however enlightened either purpose may
seem. Hurley, supra, at 579. Pp. 647-661.

Respondent is James Dale, a former Eagle Scout whose adultmembership in the Boy Scouts was revoked when the Boy
Scouts learned that he is an avowed homosexual and gayrights activist. The New Jersey Supreme Court held that

James Dale entered Scouting in 1978 at the age of eightby joining Monmouth Council's Cub Scout Pack 142. Dale

became a Boy Scout in 1981 and remained a Scout until heturned 18. By all accounts, Dale was an exemplary Scout.
In 1988, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, one of Scout-ing's highest honors.

Dale applied for adult membership in the Boy Scouts in1989. The Boy Scouts approved his application for the position of assistant scoutmaster of Troop 73. Around the sametime, Dale left home to attend Rutgers University. After

others that he is gay. He quickly became involved with, andeventually became the copresident of, the Rutgers University Lesbian/Gay Alliance. In 1990, Dale attended a semi-nar addressing the psychological and health needs of lesbian
and gay teenagers. A newspaper covering the event inter-viewed Dale about his advocacy of homosexual teenagers'
need for gay role models. In early July 1990, the newspaper published the interview and Dale's photograph over acaption identifying him as the copresident of the Lesbian/

Gay Alliance.Later that month, Dale received a letter from Monmouth
Council Executive James Kay revoking his adult membership. Dale wrote to Kay requesting the reason for Monmouth Council's decision. Kay responded by letter that the
Boy Scouts "specifically forbid membership to homosexuals." App. 137.

In 1992, Dale filed a complaint against the Boy Scouts
in the New Jersey Superior Court. The complaint alleged
that the Boy Scouts had violated New Jersey's public accommodations statute and its common law by revoking Dale's
membership based solely on his sexual orientation. New
Jersey's public accommodations statute prohibits, among
other things, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. N. J. Stat. Ann.

at 661-663.

The New Jersey Superior Court's Chancery Division
granted summary judgment in favor of the Boy Scouts. The
court held that New Jersey's public accommodations law was
inapplicable because the Boy Scouts was not a place of public
accommodation, and that, alternatively, the Boy Scouts is a
distinctly private group exempted from coverage under New
Jersey's law. The court rejected Dale's common-law claim,
holding that New Jersey's policy is embodied in the public
accommodations law. The court also concluded that the Boy
Scouts' position in respect of active homosexuality was clear

and held that the First Amendment freedom of expressiveassociation prevented the government from forcing the Boy

Scouts to accept Dale as an adult leader.The New Jersey Superior Court's Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of Dale's common-law claim, but other-wise reversed and remanded for further proceedings. 308
N. J. Super. 516, 706 A. 2d 270 (1998). It held that New
Jersey's public accommodations law applied to the BoyScouts and that the Boy Scouts violated it. The Appellate

Division rejected the Boy Scouts' federal constitutionalclaims.

The New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of
the Appellate Division. It held that the Boy Scouts was a
place of public accommodation subject to the public accommodations law, that the organization was not exempt from
the law under any of its express exceptions, and that the Boy
Scouts violated the law by revoking Dale's membership
based on his avowed homosexuality. After considering the
state-law issues, the court addressed the Boy Scouts' claims
that application of the public accommodations law in this case
violated its federal constitutional rights " `to enter into and
maintain . . . intimate or private relationships . . . [and] to
associate for the purpose of engaging in protected speech.' "
160 N. J. 562, 605, 734 A. 2d 1196, 1219 (1999) (quoting Board
of Directors of Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481
U. S. 537, 544 (1987)). With respect to the right to intimate
association, the court concluded that the Boy Scouts' "large
size, nonselectivity, inclusive rather than exclusive purpose,
and practice of inviting or allowing nonmembers to attend
meetings, establish that the organization is not `sufficiently
personal or private to warrant constitutional protection'
under the freedom of intimate association." 160 N. J., at
608-609, 734 A. 2d, at 1221 (quoting Duarte, supra, at 546).
With respect to the right of expressive association, the court

and uses its activities to encourage the moral development

of its members." 160 N. J., at 613, 734 A. 2d, at 1223. Butthe court concluded that it was "not persuaded . . . that a

shared goal of Boy Scout members is to associate in order topreserve the view that homosexuality is immoral." Ibid.,
734 A. 2d, at 1223-1224 (internal quotation marks omitted).Accordingly, the court held "that Dale's membership does
not violate the Boy Scouts' right of expressive associationbecause his inclusion would not `affect in any significant way
[the Boy Scouts'] existing members' ability to carry out theirvarious purposes.' "

Id., at 615, 734 A. 2d, at 1225 (quotingDuarte, supra, at 548). The court also determined that

New Jersey has a compelling interest in eliminating "the de-structive consequences of discrimination from our society,"
and that its public accommodations law abridges no morespeech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose. 160
N. J., at 619-620, 734 A. 2d, at 1227-1228. Finally, the courtaddressed the Boy Scouts' reliance on Hurley v. IrishAmerican Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,515 U. S. 557 (1995), in support of its claimed First Amendment right to exclude Dale. The court determined that
Hurley did not require deciding the case in favor of the BoyScouts because "the reinstatement of Dale does not compel

Boy Scouts to express any message." 160 N. J., at 624, 734A. 2d, at 1229.

We granted the Boy Scouts' petition for certiorari to de-termine whether the application of New Jersey's public accommodations law violated the First Amendment. 528 U. S.1109 (2000).

In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622(1984), we observed that "implicit in the right to engage in

activities protected by the First Amendment" is "a corre-sponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide
variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious,and cultural ends." This right is crucial in preventing the
majority from imposing its views on groups that would

Opinion of the Court
rather express other, perhaps unpopular, ideas. See ibid.(stating that protection of the right to expressive association

is "especially important in preserving political and culturaldiversity and in shielding dissident expression from suppression by the majority"). Government actions that may un-constitutionally burden this freedom may take many forms,
one of which is "intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an association" like a "regulation that forces thegroup to accept members it does not desire."

Id., at 623.
Forcing a group to accept certain members may impair theability of the group to express those views, and only those

views, that it intends to express. Thus, "[f]reedom of
association . . . plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate." Ibid.

The forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group
infringes the group's freedom of expressive association if
the presence of that person affects in a significant way
the group's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.
New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487
U. S. 1, 13 (1988). But the freedom of expressive association, like many freedoms, is not absolute. We have held that
the freedom could be overridden "by regulations adopted to
serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms." Roberts,
supra, at 623.

To determine whether a group is protected by the First
Amendment's expressive associational right, we must determine whether the group engages in "expressive association."
The First Amendment's protection of expressive association
is not reserved for advocacy groups. But to come within
its ambit, a group must engage in some form of expression,
whether it be public or private.

Because this is a First Amendment case where the ultimate conclusions of law are virtually inseparable from findings of fact, we are obligated to independently review the

Opinion of the Court
factual record to ensure that the state court's judgment doesnot unlawfully intrude on free expression. See Hurley,

supra, at 567-568. The record reveals the following. TheBoy Scouts is a private, nonprofit organization. According
to its mission statement:

"It is the mission of the Boy Scouts of America toserve others by helping to instill values in young people

and, in other ways, to prepare them to make ethicalchoices over their lifetime in achieving their full
potential."The values we strive to instill are based on those
found in the Scout Oath and Law:

"Scout Oath
"On my honor I will do my best"To do my duty to God and my country

"and to obey the Scout Law;"To help other people at all times;
"To keep myself physically strong,"mentally awake, and morally straight.

"Scout Law
"A Scout is:"Trustworthy Obedient

"Loyal Cheerful"Helpful Thrifty
"Friendly Brave"Courteous Clean
"Kind Reverent." App. 184.
Thus, the general mission of the Boy Scouts is clear: "[T]oinstill values in young people."

Ibid. The Boy Scoutsseeks to instill these values by having its adult leaders spend

time with the youth members, instructing and engagingthem in activities like camping, archery, and fishing. During
the time spent with the youth members, the scoutmastersand assistant scoutmasters inculcate them with the Boy

650 BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA v. DALE

Opinion of the Court
Scouts' values--both expressly and by example. It seemsindisputable that an association that seeks to transmit such

a system of values engages in expressive activity. See Roberts, supra, at 636 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("Even the
training of outdoor survival skills or participation in commu-nity service might become expressive when the activity is

intended to develop good morals, reverence, patriotism, and
a desire for self-improvement").Given that the Boy Scouts engages in expressive activity,

we must determine whether the forced inclusion of Dale asan assistant scoutmaster would significantly affect the Boy
Scouts' ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.
This inquiry necessarily requires us first to explore, to
a limited extent, the nature of the Boy Scouts' view of
homosexuality.

The values the Boy Scouts seeks to instill are "based on"
those listed in the Scout Oath and Law. App. 184. The Boy
Scouts explains that the Scout Oath and Law provide "a positive moral code for living; they are a list of `do's' rather than
`don'ts.' " Brief for Petitioners 3. The Boy Scouts asserts
that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values embodied in the Scout Oath and Law, particularly with the values represented by the terms "morally straight" and "clean."

Obviously, the Scout Oath and Law do not expressly mention sexuality or sexual orientation. See supra, at 649.
And the terms "morally straight" and "clean" are by no
means self-defining. Different people would attribute to
those terms very different meanings. For example, some
people may believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is
not at odds with being "morally straight" and "clean." And
others may believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is
contrary to being "morally straight" and "clean." The Boy
Scouts says it falls within the latter category.

The New Jersey Supreme Court analyzed the Boy Scouts'
beliefs and found that the "exclusion of members solely on
the basis of their sexual orientation is inconsistent with Boy

Opinion of the Court
Scouts' commitment to a diverse and `representative' membership . . . [and] contradicts Boy Scouts' overarching objective to reach `all eligible youth.' " 160 N. J., at 618, 734
A. 2d, at 1226. The court concluded that the exclusion of
members like Dale "appears antithetical to the organization's
goals and philosophy." Ibid. But our cases reject this sort
of inquiry; it is not the role of the courts to reject a group's
expressed values because they disagree with those values or
find them internally inconsistent. See Democratic Party of
United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107,
124 (1981) ("[A]s is true of all expressions of First Amendment freedoms, the courts may not interfere on the ground
that they view a particular expression as unwise or irrational"); see also Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 714 (1981) ("[R]eligious
beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment
protection").

The Boy Scouts asserts that it "teach[es] that homosexual
conduct is not morally straight," Brief for Petitioners 39, and
that it does "not want to promote homosexual conduct as a
legitimate form of behavior," Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.
We accept the Boy Scouts' assertion. We need not inquire
further to determine the nature of the Boy Scouts' expression with respect to homosexuality. But because the record
before us contains written evidence of the Boy Scouts' viewpoint, we look to it as instructive, if only on the question of
the sincerity of the professed beliefs.

A 1978 position statement to the Boy Scouts' Executive
Committee, signed by Downing B. Jenks, the President of
the Boy Scouts, and Harvey L. Price, the Chief Scout Executive, expresses the Boy Scouts' "official position" with regard
to "homosexuality and Scouting":

"Q. May an individual who openly declares himself to
be a homosexual be a volunteer Scout leader?

530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
652 BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA v. DALE

Opinion of the Court
"A. No. The Boy Scouts of America is a private,membership organization and leadership therein is a

privilege and not a right. We do not believe that homo-sexuality and leadership in Scouting are appropriate.
We will continue to select only those who in our judg-ment meet our standards and qualifications for leadership." App. 453-454.
Thus, at least as of 1978--the year James Dale enteredScouting--the official position of the Boy Scouts was that

avowed homosexuals were not to be Scout leaders.A position statement promulgated by the Boy Scouts in
1991 (after Dale's membership was revoked but before thislitigation was filed) also supports its current view:

"We believe that homosexual conduct is inconsistentwith the requirement in the Scout Oath that a Scout be
morally straight and in the Scout Law that a Scout beclean in word and deed, and that homosexuals do not
provide a desirable role model for Scouts." Id., at 457.
This position statement was redrafted numerous times butits core message remained consistent. For example, a 1993

position statement, the most recent in the record, reads, inpart:

"The Boy Scouts of America has always reflected theexpectations that Scouting families have had for the
organization. We do not believe that homosexuals pro-vide a role model consistent with these expectations.
Accordingly, we do not allow for the registration ofavowed homosexuals as members or as leaders of the
BSA." Id., at 461.
The Boy Scouts publicly expressed its views with respectto homosexual conduct by its assertions in prior litigation.

For example, throughout a California case with similar factsfiled in the early 1980's, the Boy Scouts consistently asserted
the same position with respect to homosexuality that it as-serts today. See

Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of Boy

Opinion of the Court
Scouts of America, No. C-365529 (Cal. Super. Ct., July 25,1991); 48 Cal. App. 4th 670, 29 Cal. Rptr. 2d 580 (1994); 17

Cal. 4th 670, 952 P. 2d 218 (1998). We cannot doubt that theBoy Scouts sincerely holds this view.

We must then determine whether Dale's presence as anassistant scoutmaster would significantly burden the Boy
Scouts' desire to not "promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior." Reply Brief for Petitioners 5. Aswe give deference to an association's assertions regarding

the nature of its expression, we must also give deference toan association's view of what would impair its expression.
See, e. g., La Follette, supra, at 123-124 (considering whether
a Wisconsin law burdened the National Party's associational
rights and stating that "a State, or a court, may not constitutionally substitute its own judgment for that of the Party").
That is not to say that an expressive association can erect a
shield against antidiscrimination laws simply by asserting
that mere acceptance of a member from a particular group
would impair its message. But here Dale, by his own admission, is one of a group of gay Scouts who have "become leaders in their community and are open and honest about their
sexual orientation." App. 11. Dale was the copresident of
a gay and lesbian organization at college and remains a gay
rights activist. Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would, at
the very least, force the organization to send a message, both
to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts
accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.

Hurley is illustrative on this point. There we considered
whether the application of Massachusetts' public accommodations law to require the organizers of a private St. Patrick's
Day parade to include among the marchers an IrishAmerican gay, lesbian, and bisexual group, GLIB, violated
the parade organizers' First Amendment rights. We noted
that the parade organizers did not wish to exclude the GLIB
members because of their sexual orientations, but because
they wanted to march behind a GLIB banner. We observed:

530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
654 BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA v. DALE

Opinion of the Court
"[A] contingent marching behind the organization's ban-ner would at least bear witness to the fact that some

Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the presence ofthe organized marchers would suggest their view that
people of their sexual orientations have as much claimto unqualified social acceptance as heterosexuals . . . .
The parade's organizers may not believe these facts
about Irish sexuality to be so, or they may object tounqualified social acceptance of gays and lesbians or

have some other reason for wishing to keep GLIB's mes-sage out of the parade. But whatever the reason, it
boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound aparticular point of view, and that choice is presumed to
lie beyond the government's power to control." 515U. S., at 574-575.

Here, we have found that the Boy Scouts believes that homo-sexual conduct is inconsistent with the values it seeks to
instill in its youth members; it will not "promote homosex-ual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior." Reply Brief
for Petitioners 5. As the presence of GLIB in Boston's
St. Patrick's Day parade would have interfered with the parade organizers' choice not to propound a particular point of
view, the presence of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would
just as surely interfere with the Boy Scout's choice not to
propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs.

The New Jersey Supreme Court determined that the Boy
Scouts' ability to disseminate its message was not significantly affected by the forced inclusion of Dale as an assistant
scoutmaster because of the following findings:

"Boy Scout members do not associate for the purpose of
disseminating the belief that homosexuality is immoral;
Boy Scouts discourages its leaders from disseminating
any views on sexual issues; and Boy Scouts includes
sponsors and members who subscribe to different views

530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
in respect of homosexuality." 160 N. J., at 612, 734A. 2d, at 1223.

We disagree with the New Jersey Supreme Court's conclu-sion drawn from these findings.

First, associations do not have to associate for the "pur-pose" of disseminating a certain message in order to be entitled to the protections of the First Amendment. An associa-tion must merely engage in expressive activity that could be
impaired in order to be entitled to protection. For example,the purpose of the St. Patrick's Day parade in Hurley was
not to espouse any views about sexual orientation, but weheld that the parade organizers had a right to exclude certain
participants nonetheless.Second, even if the Boy Scouts discourages Scout leaders
from disseminating views on sexual issues--a fact that theBoy Scouts disputes with contrary evidence--the First
Amendment protects the Boy Scouts' method of expression.If the Boy Scouts wishes Scout leaders to avoid questions of
sexuality and teach only by example, this fact does not ne-gate the sincerity of its belief discussed above.

Third, the First Amendment simply does not require thatevery member of a group agree on every issue in order for
the group's policy to be "expressive association." The BoyScouts takes an official position with respect to homosexual
conduct, and that is sufficient for First Amendment pur-poses. In this same vein, Dale makes much of the claim that
the Boy Scouts does not revoke the membership of hetero-sexual Scout leaders that openly disagree with the Boy
Scouts' policy on sexual orientation. But if this is true, it isirrelevant.

1 The presence of an avowed homosexual and gay

1 The record evidence sheds doubt on Dale's assertion. For example,
the National Director of the Boy Scouts certified that "any persons who
advocate to Scouting youth that homosexual conduct is" consistent with
Scouting values will not be registered as adult leaders. App. 746 (emphasis added). And the Monmouth Council Scout Executive testified that the

656 BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA v. DALE

Opinion of the Court
rights activist in an assistant scoutmaster's uniform sends adistinctly different message from the presence of a heterosexual assistant scoutmaster who is on record as disagreeingwith Boy Scouts policy. The Boy Scouts has a First Amendment right to choose to send one message but not the other.The fact that the organization does not trumpet its views
from the housetops, or that it tolerates dissent within its
ranks, does not mean that its views receive no First Amend-ment protection.

Having determined that the Boy Scouts is an expressiveassociation and that the forced inclusion of Dale would significantly affect its expression, we inquire whether the appli-cation of New Jersey's public accommodations law to require
that the Boy Scouts accept Dale as an assistant scoutmasterruns afoul of the Scouts' freedom of expressive association.
We conclude that it does.State public accommodations laws were originally enacted
to prevent discrimination in traditional places of public
accommodation--like inns and trains. See, e. g., Hurley,
supra, at 571-572 (explaining the history of Massachusetts'
public accommodations law); Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620,
627-629 (1996) (describing the evolution of public accommodations laws). Over time, the public accommodations laws
have expanded to cover more places.2 New Jersey's statuadvocacy of the morality of homosexuality to youth members by any adult
member is grounds for revocation of the adult's membership. Id., at 761.

2 Public accommodations laws have also broadened in scope to cover

more groups; they have expanded beyond those groups that have been
given heightened equal protection scrutiny under our cases. See Romer,
517 U. S., at 629. Some municipal ordinances have even expanded to
cover criteria such as prior criminal record, prior psychiatric treatment,
military status, personal appearance, source of income, place of residence,
and political ideology. See 1 Boston, Mass., Ordinance No. $ 12-9.7
(1999) (ex-offender, prior psychiatric treatment, and military status); D. C.
Code Ann. $ 1-2519 (1999) (personal appearance, source of income, place
of residence); Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code $ 14.08.090 (1999) (political
ideology).

Opinion of the Court
tory definition of " `[a] place of public accommodation' " is ex-tremely broad. The term is said to "include, but not be limited to," a list of over 50 types of places. N. J. Stat. Ann.$ 10:5-5(l) (West Supp. 2000); see Appendix, infra, at 661-
663. Many on the list are what one would expect to beplaces where the public is invited. For example, the statute
includes as places of public accommodation taverns, restau-rants, retail shops, and public libraries. But the statute also
includes places that often may not carry with them open invi-tations to the public, like summer camps and roof gardens.
In this case, the New Jersey Supreme Court went a stepfurther and applied its public accommodations law to a private entity without even attempting to tie the term "place"to a physical location.

3 As the definition of "public accommodation" has expanded from clearly commercial entities,such as restaurants, bars, and hotels, to membership organizations such as the Boy Scouts, the potential for conflictbetween state public accommodations laws and the First
Amendment rights of organizations has increased.We recognized in cases such as Roberts and Duarte that
States have a compelling interest in eliminating discrimina-tion against women in public accommodations. But in each
of these cases we went on to conclude that the enforcementof these statutes would not materially interfere with the
ideas that the organization sought to express. In Roberts,we said "[i]ndeed, the Jaycees has failed to demonstrate . . .

3 Four State Supreme Courts and one United States Court of Appeals
have ruled that the Boy Scouts is not a place of public accommodation.

U. S. 1012 (1993); Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of

appellate court or state supreme court--except the New Jersey Supreme
Court in this case--has reached a contrary result.

Opinion of the Court
any serious burdens on the male members' freedom of
expressive association." 468 U. S., at 626. In Duarte, we
said:

"[I]mpediments to the exercise of one's right to choose
one's associates can violate the right of association protected by the First Amendment. In this case, however,
the evidence fails to demonstrate that admitting women
to Rotary Clubs will affect in any significant way the
existing members' ability to carry out their various purposes." 481 U. S., at 548 (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted).

We thereupon concluded in each of these cases that the organizations' First Amendment rights were not violated by the
application of the States' public accommodations laws.

In Hurley, we said that public accommodations laws "are
well within the State's usual power to enact when a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the target of
discrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate
the First or Fourteenth Amendments." 515 U. S., at 572.
But we went on to note that in that case "the Massachusetts
[public accommodations] law has been applied in a peculiar
way" because "any contingent of protected individuals with
a message would have the right to participate in petitioners'
speech, so that the communication produced by the private
organizers would be shaped by all those protected by the law
who wished to join in with some expressive demonstration
of their own." Id., at 572-573. And in the associational
freedom cases such as Roberts, Duarte, and New York State
Club Assn., after finding a compelling state interest, the
Court went on to examine whether or not the application
of the state law would impose any "serious burden" on the
organization's rights of expressive association. So in these
cases, the associational interest in freedom of expression has

530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

659Cite as: 530 U. S. 640 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
been set on one side of the scale, and the State's interest on
the other.

Dale contends that we should apply the intermediate
standard of review enunciated in United States v. O'Brien,
391 U. S. 367 (1968), to evaluate the competing interests.
There the Court enunciated a four-part test for review of a
governmental regulation that has only an incidental effect
on protected speech--in that case the symbolic burning of a
draft card. A law prohibiting the destruction of draft cards
only incidentally affects the free speech rights of those who
happen to use a violation of that law as a symbol of protest.
But New Jersey's public accommodations law directly and
immediately affects associational rights, in this case associational rights that enjoy First Amendment protection. Thus,
O'Brien is inapplicable.

In Hurley, we applied traditional First Amendment analysis to hold that the application of the Massachusetts public
accommodations law to a parade violated the First Amendment rights of the parade organizers. Although we did not
explicitly deem the parade in Hurley an expressive association, the analysis we applied there is similar to the analysis
we apply here. We have already concluded that a state requirement that the Boy Scouts retain Dale as an assistant
scoutmaster would significantly burden the organization's
right to oppose or disfavor homosexual conduct. The state
interests embodied in New Jersey's public accommodations
law do not justify such a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts'
rights to freedom of expressive association. That being the
case, we hold that the First Amendment prohibits the State
from imposing such a requirement through the application of
its public accommodations law.4

4 We anticipated this result in Hurley when we illustrated the reasons
for our holding in that case by likening the parade to a private membership organization. 515 U. S., at 580. We stated: "Assuming the parade

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens' dissent makes much of its observationthat the public perception of homosexuality in this country

has changed. See post, at 699-700. Indeed, it appears thathomosexuality has gained greater societal acceptance. See
ibid. But this is scarcely an argument for denying FirstAmendment protection to those who refuse to accept these
views. The First Amendment protects expression, be it ofthe popular variety or not. See,

e. g., Texas v. Johnson, 491U. S. 397 (1989) (holding that Johnson's conviction for burning the American flag violates the First Amendment); Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969) (per curiam) (holding
that a Ku Klux Klan leader's conviction for advocating un-lawfulness as a means of political reform violates the First

Amendment). And the fact that an idea may be embracedand advocated by increasing numbers of people is all the
more reason to protect the First Amendment rights of thosewho wish to voice a different view.

Justice Stevens' extolling of Justice Brandeis' commentsin

New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932)
(dissenting opinion); see post, at 664, 700, confuses two entirely different principles. In New State Ice, the Courtstruck down an Oklahoma regulation prohibiting the manufacture, sale, and distribution of ice without a license. Jus-tice Brandeis, a champion of state experimentation in the
economic realm, dissented. But Justice Brandeis was nevera champion of state experimentation in the suppression of
free speech. To the contrary, his First Amendment com-mentary provides compelling support for the Court's opinion
in this case. In speaking of the Founders of this Nation,Justice Brandeis emphasized that they "believed that freeto be large enough and a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that
would generally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with its own
message just as readily as a private club could exclude an applicant whose
manifest views were at odds with a position taken by the club's existing
members." Id., at 580-581.

dom to think as you will and to speak as you think are meansindispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth."

Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927) (concurringopinion). He continued:

"Believing in the power of reason as applied throughpublic discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by
law--the argument of force in its worst form. Recog-nizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities,
they amended the Constitution so that free speech andassembly should be guaranteed." Id., at 375-376.

We are not, as we must not be, guided by our views ofwhether the Boy Scouts' teachings with respect to homosexual conduct are right or wrong; public or judicial disapprovalof a tenet of an organization's expression does not justify the
State's effort to compel the organization to accept memberswhere such acceptance would derogate from the organization's expressive message. "While the law is free to pro-mote all sorts of conduct in place of harmful behavior, it is
not free to interfere with speech for no better reason than
promoting an approved message or discouraging a disfavoredone, however enlightened either purpose may strike the government." Hurley, 515 U. S., at 579.The judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings notinconsistent with this opinion.

pansive construction trenches on the federal constitutionalrights of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).

Because every state law prohibiting discrimination is de-signed to replace prejudice with principle, Justice Brandeis'
comment on the States' right to experiment with "thingssocial" is directly applicable to this case.

"To stay experimentation in things social and economicis a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to theNation. It is one of the happy incidents of the federal
system that a single courageous State may, if its citizenschoose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and
economic experiments without risk to the rest of thecountry. This Court has the power to prevent an experiment. We may strike down the statute which embod-ies it on the ground that, in our opinion, the measure is
arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. We have powerto do this, because the due process clause has been held
by the Court applicable to matters of substantive law aswell as to matters of procedure. But in the exercise of
this high power, we must be ever on our guard, lest weerect our prejudices into legal principles. If we would

James Dale joined BSA as a Cub Scout in 1978, when hewas eight years old. Three years later he became a Boy

Scout, and he remained a member until his 18th birthday.Along the way, he earned 25 merit badges, was admitted into
the prestigious Order of the Arrow, and was awarded therank of Eagle Scout--an honor given to only three percent
of all Scouts. In 1989, BSA approved his application to bean Assistant Scoutmaster.

On July 19, 1990, after more than 12 years of active andhonored participation, the BSA sent Dale a letter advising
him of the revocation of his membership. The letter statedthat membership in BSA "is a privilege" that may be denied
"whenever there is a concern that an individual may notmeet the high standards of membership which the BSA
seeks to provide for American youth." App. 135. Express-ing surprise at his sudden expulsion, Dale sent a letter
requesting an explanation of the decision. Id., at 136. Inresponse, BSA sent him a second letter stating that the
grounds for the decision "are the standards for leadershipestablished by the Boy Scouts of America, which specifically
forbid membership to homosexuals." Id., at 137. At thattime, no such standard had been publicly expressed by BSA.

In this case, BSA contends that it teaches the young boyswho are Scouts that homosexuality is immoral. Consequently, it argues, it would violate its right to associate toforce it to admit homosexuals as members, as doing so would
be at odds with its own shared goals and values. This con-tention, quite plainly, requires us to look at what, exactly,
are the values that BSA actually teaches.

Stevens, J., dissenting
BSA's mission statement reads as follows: "It is the mission of the Boy Scouts of America to serve others by helping
to instill values in young people and, in other ways, to prepare them to make ethical choices over their lifetime in
achieving their full potential." Id., at 184. Its federal charter declares its purpose is "to promote, through organization,
and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do
things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft,
and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values, using the methods which were in common use
by Boy Scouts on June 15, 1916." 36 U. S. C. $ 23; see also
App. 315-316. BSA describes itself as having a "representative membership," which it defines as "boy membership
[that] reflects proportionately the characteristics of the boy
population of its service area." Id., at 65. In particular,
the group emphasizes that "[n]either the charter nor the bylaws of the Boy Scouts of America permits the exclusion of
any boy. . . . To meet these responsibilities we have made a
commitment that our membership shall be representative of
all the population in every community, district, and council."
Id., at 66-67 (emphasis in original).

To instill its shared values, BSA has adopted a "Scout
Oath" and a "Scout Law" setting forth its central tenets.
For example, the Scout Law requires a member to promise,
among other things, that he will be "obedient." Accompanying definitions for the terms found in the Oath and Law
are provided in the Boy Scout Handbook and the Scoutmaster Handbook. For instance, the Boy Scout Handbook defines "obedient" as follows:

"A Scout is OBEDIENT. A Scout follows the rules of
his family, school, and troop. He obeys the laws of his
community and country. If he thinks these rules and
laws are unfair, he tries to have them changed in an
orderly manner rather than disobey them." Id., at 188

Stevens, J., dissenting
To bolster its claim that its shared goals include teachingthat homosexuality is wrong, BSA directs our attention to

two terms appearing in the Scout Oath and Law. The firstis the phrase "morally straight," which appears in the Oath
("On my honor I will do my best . . . To keep myself . . .morally straight"); the second term is the word "clean,"
which appears in a list of 12 characteristics together consti-tuting the Scout Law.

The Boy Scout Handbook defines "morally straight," assuch:

"To be a person of strong character, guide your life withhonesty, purity, and justice. Respect and defend the
rights of all people. Your relationships with othersshould be honest and open. Be clean in your speech
and actions, and faithful in your religious beliefs. Thevalues you follow as a Scout will help you become virtuous and self-reliant." Id., at 218 (emphasis deleted).
The Scoutmaster Handbook emphasizes these points aboutbeing "morally straight":

"In any consideration of moral fitness, a key word hasto be `courage.' A boy's courage to do what his head
and his heart tell him is right. And the courage to re-fuse to do what his heart and his head say is wrong.
Moral fitness, like emotional fitness, will clearly presentopportunities for wise guidance by an alert Scoutmaster." Id., at 239-240.
As for the term "clean," the Boy Scout Handbook offers thefollowing:

"A Scout is CLEAN. A Scout keeps his body and mindfit and clean. He chooses the company of those who
live by these same ideals. He helps keep his home and
community clean.

"You never need to be ashamed of dirt that will washoff. If you play hard and work hard you can't help get530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
ting dirty. But when the game is over or the work is
done, that kind of dirt disappears with soap and water.

"There's another kind of dirt that won't come off by
washing. It is the kind that shows up in foul language
and harmful thoughts.

"Swear words, profanity, and dirty stories are weapons
that ridicule other people and hurt their feelings. The
same is true of racial slurs and jokes making fun of ethnic groups or people with physical or mental limitations.
A Scout knows there is no kindness or honor in such
mean-spirited behavior. He avoids it in his own words
and deeds. He defends those who are targets of insults." Id., at 225-226 (emphasis in original); see also
id., at 189.2

It is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles--"morally straight" and "clean"--says the slightest
thing about homosexuality. Indeed, neither term in the Boy

2 Scoutmasters are instructed to teach what it means to be "clean" using
the following lesson:
"(Hold up two cooking pots, one shiny bright on the inside but sooty outside, the other shiny outside but dirty inside.) Scouts, which of these pots
would you rather have your food cooked in? Did I hear somebody say,
`Neither one?'

"That's not a bad answer. We wouldn't have much confidence in a patrol
cook who didn't have his pots shiny both inside and out.

"But if we had to make a choice, we would tell the cook to use the pot
that's clean inside. The same idea applies to people.

"Most people keep themselves clean outside. But how about the inside?
Do we try to keep our minds and our language clean? I think that's even
more important than keeping the outside clean.

"A Scout, of course, should be clean inside and out. Water, soap, and a
toothbrush tak[e] care of the outside. Only your determination will keep
the inside clean. You can do it by following the Scout Law and the example of people you respect--your parents, your teachers, your clergyman,
or a good buddy who is trying to do the same thing." App. 289-290.

Scouts' Law and Oath expresses any position whatsoever onsexual matters.

BSA's published guidance on that topic underscores thispoint. Scouts, for example, are directed to receive their sex
education at home or in school, but not from the organization:"Your parents or guardian or a sex education teacher should
give you the facts about sex that you must know." BoyScout Handbook (1992) (reprinted in App. 211). To be sure,
Scouts are not forbidden from asking their Scoutmasterabout issues of a sexual nature, but Scoutmasters are, literally, the last person Scouts are encouraged to ask: "If youhave questions about growing up, about relationships,
sex, or making good decisions, ask. Talk with your parents,religious leaders, teachers, or Scoutmaster."

Ibid. More-over, Scoutmasters are specifically directed to steer curious

adolescents to other sources of information:

"If Scouts ask for information regarding . . . sexual activ-ity, answer honestly and factually, but stay within your

realm of expertise and comfort. If a Scout has seriousconcerns that you cannot answer, refer him to his family,
religious leader, doctor, or other professional." Scout-master Handbook (1990) (reprinted in App. 264).

More specifically, BSA has set forth a number of rules forScoutmasters when these types of issues come up:

"You may have boys asking you for information or ad-vice about sexual matters. . . .
"How should you handle such matters?
"Rule number 1: You do not undertake to instructScouts, in any formalized manner, in the subject of sex

and family life. The reasons are that it is not con-strued to be Scouting's proper area, and that you are
probably not well qualified to do this.
"Rule number 2: If Scouts come to you to ask questionsor to seek advice, you would give it within your compe530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tence. A boy who appears to be asking about sexualintercourse, however, may really only be worried about

his pimples, so it is well to find out just what informationis needed.
"Rule number 3: You should refer boys with sexual prob-lems to persons better qualified than you [are] to handle
them. If the boy has a spiritual leader or a doctor whocan deal with them, he should go there. If such persons
are not available, you may just have to do the best youcan. But don't try to play a highly professional role.
And at the other extreme, avoid passing the buck."Scoutmaster Handbook (1972) (reprinted in App. 546-
547) (emphasis added).
In light of BSA's self-proclaimed ecumenism, furthermore,it is even more difficult to discern any shared goals or common moral stance on homosexuality. Insofar as religiousmatters are concerned, BSA's bylaws state that it is "absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward . . . religious train-ing." Id., at 362. "The BSA does not define what constitutes duty to God or the practice of religion. This is theresponsibility of parents and religious leaders." Id., at 76.
In fact, many diverse religious organizations sponsor localBoy Scout troops. Brief for Petitioners 3. Because a
number of religious groups do not view homosexuality asimmoral or wrong and reject discrimination against homosexuals,3 it is exceedingly difficult to believe that BSA none3 See, e. g., Brief for Deans of Divinity Schools and Rabbinical Institutions as Amicus Curiae 8 ("The diverse religi[ous] traditions of this country present no coherent moral message that excludes gays and lesbians

theless adopts a single particular religious or moral philoso-phy when it comes to sexual orientation. This is especially

so in light of the fact that Scouts are advised to seek guid-ance on sexual matters from their religious leaders (and
Scoutmasters are told to refer Scouts to them); 4 BSA surelyis aware that some religions do not teach that homosexuality
is wrong. II

The Court seeks to fill the void by pointing to a statementof "policies and procedures relating to homosexuality and
Scouting," App. 453, signed by BSA's President and ChiefScout Executive in 1978 and addressed to the members of the
Executive Committee of the national organization. Ante, at651-652. The letter says that the BSA does "not believe
that homosexuality and leadership in Scouting are appropriate." App. 454. But when the entire 1978 letter is read,BSA's position is far more equivocal:

"4. Q. May an individual who openly declares himselfto be a homosexual be employed by the Boy Scouts of
America as a professional or non-professional?"A. Boy Scouts of America does not knowingly employ homosexuals as professionals or non-professionals.We are unaware of any present laws which would prohibit this policy.
Amicus Curiae 3 (describing views of the United Methodist Church, the
Episcopal Church, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the
United Church Board for Homeland Ministries, and the Unitarian Universalist Association, all of whom reject discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation).

activity . . . refer him to his . . . religious leader"); supra, at 670 ("You

Stevens, J., dissenting
"5. Q. Should a professional or non-professional indi-vidual who openly declares himself to be a homosexual

be terminated?"A. Yes, in the absence of any law to the contrary.
At the present time we are unaware of any statute orordinance in the United States which prohibits discrimination against individual's employment upon the basis ofhomosexuality.

In the event that such a law was appli-cable, it would be necessary for the Boy Scouts of

America to obey it, in this case as in Paragraph 4 above.It is our position, however, that homosexuality and professional or non-professional employment in Scoutingare not appropriate." Id., at 454-455 (emphasis added).

Four aspects of the 1978 policy statement are relevant tothe proper disposition of this case. First, at most this letter
simply adopts an exclusionary membership policy. But sim-ply adopting such a policy has never been considered sufficient, by itself, to prevail on a right to associate claim. Seeinfra, at 678-685.

Second, the 1978 policy was never publicly expressed--un-like, for example, the Scout's duty to be "obedient." It was
an internal memorandum, never circulated beyond the fewmembers of BSA's Executive Committee. It remained, in
effect, a secret Boy Scouts policy. Far from claiming anyintent to express an idea that would be burdened by the
presence of homosexuals, BSA's public posture--to theworld and to the Scouts themselves--remained what it had
always been: one of tolerance, welcoming all classes of boysand young men. In this respect, BSA's claim is even weaker
than those we have rejected in the past. See ibid.Third, it is apparent that the draftsmen of the policy statement foresaw the possibility that laws against discriminationmight one day be amended to protect homosexuals from employment discrimination. Their statement clearly providedthat, in the event such a law conflicted with their policy, a
Scout's duty to be "obedient" and "obe[y] the laws," even if"he thinks [the laws] are unfair," would prevail in such a

Stevens, J., dissenting
contingency. See supra, at 666. In 1978, however, BSA ap-parently did not consider it to be a serious possibility that a

State might one day characterize the Scouts as a "place ofpublic accommodation" with a duty to open its membership
to all qualified individuals. The portions of the statementdealing with membership simply assume that membership in
the Scouts is a "privilege" that BSA is free to grant or towithhold. The statement does not address the question
whether the publicly proclaimed duty to obey the law shouldprevail over the private discriminatory policy if, and when,
a conflict between the two should arise--as it now has inNew Jersey. At the very least, then, the statement reflects
no unequivocal view on homosexuality. Indeed, the state-ment suggests that an appropriate way for BSA to preserve
its unpublished exclusionary policy would include an openand forthright attempt to seek an amendment of New Jersey's statute. ("If he thinks these rules and laws are unfair,he tries to have them changed in an orderly manner rather
than disobey them.")Fourth, the 1978 statement simply says that homosexuality is not "appropriate." It makes no effort to connect thatstatement to a shared goal or expressive activity of the Boy
Scouts. Whatever values BSA seeks to instill in Scouts, theidea that homosexuality is not "appropriate" appears entirely
unconnected to, and is mentioned nowhere in, the myriad ofpublicly declared values and creeds of the BSA. That idea
does not appear to be among any of the principles actuallytaught to Scouts. Rather, the 1978 policy appears to be no
more than a private statement of a few BSA executives thatthe organization wishes to exclude gays--and that wish has
nothing to do with any expression BSA actually engages in.The majority also relies on four other policy statements
that were issued between 1991 and 1993.5 All of them were

5 The authorship and distribution of these statements remain obscure.
Unlike the 1978 policy--which clearly identifies the authors as the President and the Chief Scout Executive of BSA--these later policies are unsigned. Two of them are initialed (one is labeled "JCK"; the other says

written and issued after BSA revoked Dale's membership.Accordingly, they have little, if any, relevance to the legal

question before this Court.6 In any event, they do not bol-ster BSA's claim.

In 1991, BSA issued two statements both stating: "We be-lieve that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the requirement in the Scout Oath that a Scout be morally straightand in the Scout Law that a Scout be clean in word and deed,
and that homosexuals do not provide a desirable role modelfor Scouts." App. 457-458. A third statement issued in
1992 was substantially the same. Id., at 459. By 1993,however, the policy had changed:

"BSA Position
"The Boy Scouts of America has always reflected theexpectations that Scouting families have had for the

organization.
"We do not believe that homosexuals provide a rolemodel consistent with these expectations.

"Accordingly, we do not allow for the registration ofavowed homosexuals as members or as leaders of the
BSA." Id., at 461.
Aside from the fact that these statements were all issuedafter Dale's membership was revoked, there are four important points relevant to them. First, while the 1991 and 1992
"js"), but BSA never tells us to whom these initials belong. Nor do we
know how widely these statements were distributed. From the record
evidence we have, it appears that they were not as readily available as
the Boy Scout and Scoutmaster Handbooks; indeed, they appear to be
quite difficult to get a hold of. See App. 662, 668-669.

6 Dale's complaint requested three forms of relief: (1) a declaration that

his rights under the New Jersey statute had been violated when his membership was revoked; (2) an order reinstating his membership; and (3)
compensatory and punitive damages. Id., at 27. Nothing that BSA could
have done after the revocation of his membership could affect Dale's first
request for relief, though perhaps some possible postrevocation action
could have influenced the other two requests for relief.

statements tried to tie BSA's exclusionary policy to themeaning of the Scout Oath and Law, the 1993 statement

abandoned that effort. Rather, BSA's 1993 homosexual ex-clusion policy was based on its view that including gays
would be contrary to "the expectations that Scouting fami-lies have had for the organization." Ibid. Instead of linking its policy to its central tenets or shared goals--to teachcertain definitions of what it means to be "morally straight"
and "clean"--BSA chose instead to justify its policy on the"expectatio[n]" that its members preferred to exclude homosexuals. The 1993 policy statement, in other words, was notbased on any expressive activity or on any moral view about
homosexuality. It was simply an exclusionary membershippolicy, similar to those we have held insufficient in the past.
See infra, at 678-685.Second, even during the brief period in 1991 and 1992,
when BSA tried to connect its exclusion of homosexuals toits definition of terms found in the Oath and Law, there is no
evidence that Scouts were actually taught anything abouthomosexuality's alleged inconsistency with those principles.
Beyond the single sentence in these policy statements, thereis no indication of any shared goal of teaching that homosexuality is incompatible with being "morally straight" and"clean." Neither BSA's mission statement nor its official
membership policy was altered; no Boy Scout or ScoutmasterHandbook was amended to reflect the policy statement; no
lessons were imparted to Scouts; no change was made toBSA's policy on limiting discussion of sexual matters; and no
effort was made to restrict acceptable religious affiliationsto those that condemn homosexuality. In short, there is no
evidence that this view was part of any collective effort tofoster beliefs about homosexuality.

7 Indeed, the record evidence is to the contrary. See, e. g., App. 666-669

himself an assistant scoutmaster and Merit Badge counselor) ("I never

Third, BSA never took any clear and unequivocal positionon homosexuality. Though the 1991 and 1992 policies state

one interpretation of "morally straight" and "clean," thegroup's published definitions appearing in the Boy Scout and
Scoutmaster Handbooks take quite another view. AndBSA's broad religious tolerance combined with its declaration that sexual matters are not its "proper area" render itsviews on the issue equivocal at best and incoherent at worst.
We have never held, however, that a group can throw to-gether any mixture of contradictory positions and then invoke the right to associate to defend any one of those views.At a minimum, a group seeking to prevail over an antidiscrimination law must adhere to a clear and unequivocal view.Fourth, at most the 1991 and 1992 statements declare only
that BSA believed "homosexual conduct is inconsistent withthe requirement in the Scout Oath that a Scout be morally
straight and in the Scout Law that a Scout be clean in wordand deed." App. 457 (emphasis added). But New Jersey's
law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orienta-tion. And when Dale was expelled from the Boy Scouts,
BSA said it did so because of his sexual orientation, not be-cause of his sexual conduct.

8

It is clear, then, that nothing in these policy statementssupports BSA's claim. The only policy written before the

revocation of Dale's membership was an equivocal, undis-closed statement that evidences no connection between the
group's discriminatory intentions and its expressive inter-ests. The later policies demonstrate a brief--though ulticurred during any Scouting meeting or function . . . . Prior to September
1991, I never heard any mention whatsoever of homosexuality during any
Scouting function").

8 At oral argument, BSA's counsel was asked: "[W]hat if someone is homosexual in the sense of having a sexual orientation in that direction but
does not engage in any homosexual conduct?" Counsel answered: "[I]f
that person also were to take the view that the reason they didn't engage
in that conduct [was because] it would be morally wrong . . . that person
would not be excluded." Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.

mately abandoned--attempt to tie BSA's exclusion to itsexpression, but other than a single sentence, BSA fails to

show that it ever taught Scouts that homosexuality is not"morally straight" or "clean," or that such a view was part
of the group's collective efforts to foster a belief. Further-more, BSA's policy statements fail to establish any clear, consistent, and unequivocal position on homosexuality. Nor did
BSA have any reason to think Dale's sexual conduct, as op-posed to his orientation, was contrary to the group's values.

BSA's inability to make its position clear and its failure toconnect its alleged policy to its expressive activities is highly
significant. By the time Dale was expelled from the BoyScouts in 1990, BSA had already been engaged in several
suits under a variety of state antidiscrimination public ac-commodation laws challenging various aspects of its membership policy.9 Indeed, BSA had filed amicus briefs beforethis Court in two earlier right to associate cases (

Roberts v.
United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609 (1984), and Board of
Directors of Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U. S.
537 (1987)) pointing to these very cases; it was clearly on
notice by 1990 that it might well be subjected to state public
accommodation antidiscrimination laws, and that a court
might one day reject its claimed right to associate. Yet it
took no steps prior to Dale's expulsion to clarify how its
exclusivity was connected to its expression. It speaks
volumes about the credibility of BSA's claim to a shared
goal that homosexuality is incompatible with Scouting that
since at least 1984 it had been aware of this issue--indeed,
concerned enough to twice file amicus briefs before this

Court--yet it did nothing in the intervening six years (oreven in the years after Dale's explusion) to explain clearly

and openly why the presence of homosexuals would affect itsexpressive activities, or to make the view of "morally
straight" and "clean" taken in its 1991 and 1992 policies apart of the values actually instilled in Scouts through the

BSA's claim finds no support in our cases. We have rec-ognized "a right to associate for the purpose of engaging

in those activities protected by the First Amendment--speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances,
and the exercise of religion." Roberts, 468 U. S., at618. And we have acknowledged that "when the State
interferes with individuals' selection of those with whomthey wish to join in a common endeavor, freedom of
association . . . may be implicated." Ibid. But "[t]he rightto associate for expressive purposes is not . . . absolute"; rather, "the nature and degree of constitutional pro-tection afforded freedom of association may vary depending
on the extent to which . . . the constitutionally protectedliberty is at stake in a given case."

Id., at 623, 618. In-deed, the right to associate does not mean "that in every

setting in which individuals exercise some discrimination inchoosing associates, their selective process of inclusion and
exclusion is protected by the Constitution." New York State
Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U. S. 1, 13 (1988).For example, we have routinely and easily rejected assertions of this right by expressive organizations with discrimi-natory membership policies, such as private schools,

firms,11 and labor organizations.12 In fact, until today, wehave never once found a claimed right to associate in the

selection of members to prevail in the face of a State's anti-discrimination law. To the contrary, we have squarely held
that a State's antidiscrimination law does not violate agroup's right to associate simply because the law conflicts
with that group's exclusionary membership policy.

In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609 (1984),we addressed just such a conflict. The Jaycees was a nonprofit membership organization " `designed to inculcate inthe individual membership . . . a spirit of genuine Americanism and civic interest, and . . . to provide . . . an avenue forintelligent participation by young men in the affairs of their
community.' " Id., at 612-613. The organization was di-vided into local chapters, described as " `young men's organization[s],' " in which regular membership was restricted tomales between the ages of 18 and 35.

Id., at 613. But Minnesota's Human Rights Act, which applied to the Jaycees,
made it unlawful to " `deny any person the full and equal

tutions. But it does not follow that the practice of excluding racial minorities from such institutions is also protected by the same principle" (citation omitted)).

Id., at 615. The Jaycees, however, claimed
that applying the law to it violated its right to associate--inparticular its right to maintain its selective membership

policy.We rejected that claim. Cautioning that the right to associate is not "absolute," we held that "[i]nfringements on that
right may be justified by regulations adopted to serve com-pelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas,

that cannot be achieved through means significantly less re-strictive of associational freedoms."

Id., at 623. We found
the State's purpose of eliminating discrimination is a compelling state interest that is unrelated to the suppression of
ideas. Id., at 623-626. We also held that Minnesota's law is
the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. The
Jaycees had "failed to demonstrate that the Act imposes any
serious burdens on the male members' freedom of expressive
association." Id., at 626. Though the Jaycees had "taken
public positions on a number of diverse issues, [and] . . . regularly engage in a variety of . . . activities worthy of constitutional protection under the First Amendment," there was
"no basis in the record for concluding that admission of
women as full voting members will impede the organization's
ability to engage in these protected activities or to disseminate its preferred views." Id., at 626-627. "The Act," we
held, "requires no change in the Jaycees' creed of promoting
the interest of young men, and it imposes no restrictions on
the organization's ability to exclude individuals with ideologies or philosophies different from those of its existing members." Id., at 627.

We took a similar approach in Board of Directors of Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U. S. 537 (1987).
Rotary International, a nonprofit corporation, was founded
as " `an organization of business and professional men united
worldwide who provide humanitarian service, encourage
high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build good530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

at 540, but refused membership to women. "[T]he exclusionof women," explained the group's General Secretary, "results
in an `aspect of fellowship . . . that is enjoyed by the presentmale membership.' " Id., at 541. That policy also allowed
the organization "to operate effectively in foreign countrieswith varied cultures and social mores."

Ibid. Though Cal-ifornia's Civil Rights Act, which applied to Rotary International, prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex, id., at541-542, n. 2, the organization claimed a right to associate,
including the right to select its members.As in

Jaycees, we rejected the claim, holding that "the
evidence fails to demonstrate that admitting women to Ro-tary Clubs will affect in any significant way the existing

members' ability to carry out their various purposes." 481U. S., at 548. "To be sure," we continued, "Rotary Clubs
engage in a variety of commendable service activities thatare protected by the First Amendment. But [California's
Civil Rights Act] does not require the clubs to abandon or
alter any of these activities. It does not require them toabandon their basic goals of humanitarian service, high ethical standards in all vocations, good will, and peace. Nordoes it require them to abandon their classification system
or admit members who do not reflect a cross section of thecommunity."

Ibid. Finally, even if California's law worked
a "slight infringement on Rotary members' right of expres-sive association, that infringement is justified because it

serves the State's compelling interest in eliminating discrim-ination against women."

Id., at 549.13

Several principles are made perfectly clear by Jaycees andRotary Club. First, to prevail on a claim of expressive association in the face of a State's antidiscrimination law, it is notenough simply to engage in some kind of expressive activity.
Both the Jaycees and the Rotary Club engaged in expressiveactivity protected by the First Amendment,

14 yet that fact

was not dispositive. Second, it is not enough to adopt anopenly avowed exclusionary membership policy. Both the

Jaycees and the Rotary Club did that as well.15 Third, it isnot sufficient merely to articulate

some connection betweenthe group's expressive activities and its exclusionary policy.

The Rotary Club, for example, justified its male-only mem-bership policy by pointing to the " `aspect of fellowship . . .
that is enjoyed by the [exclusively] male membership' " andby claiming that only with an exclusively male membership

vation that BSA ignores the exemption contained in New Jersey's law
for " `any place of public accommodation which is in its nature reasonably
restricted exclusively to one sex,' " including, but not limited to, " `any
summer camp, day camp, or resort camp, bathhouse, dressing room, swimming pool, gymnasium, comfort station, dispensary, clinic or hospital, or
school or educational institution which is restricted exclusively to individuals of one sex.' " See Brief for State of New Jersey as Amicus Curiae
12-13, n. 2 (citing N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 10:5-12(f) (West 1993)).

15 The Jaycees openly stated that it was an organization designed to

serve the interests of "young men"; its local chapters were described as
" `young men's organization[s]' "; and its membership policy contained an
express provision reserving regular membership to young men. Jaycees,
468 U. S., at 612-613. Likewise, Rotary International expressed its preference for male-only membership: It proclaimed that it was " `an organization of business and professional men' " and its membership policy expressly excluded women. Rotary Club, 481 U. S., at 539, 541 (emphasis
added).

could it "operate effectively" in foreign countries. Rotary
Club, 481 U. S., at 541.

Rather, in Jaycees, we asked whether Minnesota's HumanRights Law requiring the admission of women "impose[d]

any serious burdens" on the group's "collective effort on be-half of [its]

shared goals." 468 U. S., at 622, 626-627 (emphases added). Notwithstanding the group's obvious publicly
stated exclusionary policy, we did not view the inclusion ofwomen as a "serious burden" on the Jaycees' ability to engage in the protected speech of its choice. Similarly, in Rotary Club, we asked whether California's law would "affect
in any significant way the existing members' ability" to engage in their protected speech, or whether the law would
require the clubs "to abandon their basic goals." 481 U. S.,
at 548 (emphases added); see also Hurley v. Irish-American
Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S.

Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 462-463 (1958) (asking whether law
"entail[ed] the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the
exercise by petitioner's members of their right to freedom of

the ability of petitioner and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs"). The relevant question is
whether the mere inclusion of the person at issue would "impose any serious burden," "affect in any significant way," or
be "a substantial restraint upon" the organization's "shared
goals," "basic goals," or "collective effort to foster beliefs."
Accordingly, it is necessary to examine what, exactly, are

Stevens, J., dissenting
BSA's shared goals and the degree to which its expressiveactivities would be burdened, affected, or restrained by including homosexuals.The evidence before this Court makes it exceptionally
clear that BSA has, at most, simply adopted an exclusionarymembership policy and has no shared goal of disapproving
of homosexuality. BSA's mission statement and federal
charter say nothing on the matter; its official membershippolicy is silent; its Scout Oath and Law--and accompanying

definitions--are devoid of any view on the topic; its guidancefor Scouts and Scoutmasters on sexuality declare that such
matters are "not construed to be Scouting's proper area,"
but are the province of a Scout's parents and pastor; and
BSA's posture respecting religion tolerates a wide variety of
views on the issue of homosexuality. Moreover, there is
simply no evidence that BSA otherwise teaches anything in
this area, or that it instructs Scouts on matters involving
homosexuality in ways not conveyed in the Boy Scout or
Scoutmaster Handbooks. In short, Boy Scouts of America
is simply silent on homosexuality. There is no shared goal
or collective effort to foster a belief about homosexuality at
all--let alone one that is significantly burdened by admitting homosexuals.

As in Jaycees, there is "no basis in the record for concluding that admission of [homosexuals] will impede the [Boy
Scouts'] ability to engage in [its] protected activities or to
disseminate its preferred views" and New Jersey's law "requires no change in [BSA's] creed." 468 U. S., at 626-627.
And like Rotary Club, New Jersey's law "does not require
[BSA] to abandon or alter any of " its activities. 481 U. S.,
at 548. The evidence relied on by the Court is not to the
contrary. The undisclosed 1978 policy certainly adds nothing to the actual views disseminated to the Scouts. It simply says that homosexuality is not "appropriate." There is
no reason to give that policy statement more weight than
Rotary International's assertion that all-male membership

Stevens, J., dissenting
fosters the group's "fellowship" and was the only way it could"operate effectively." As for BSA's postrevocation statements, at most they simply adopt a policy of discrimination,which is no more dispositive than the openly discriminatory
policies held insufficient in Jaycees and Rotary Club; thereis no evidence here that BSA's policy was necessary to--
or even a part of--BSA's expressive activities or was evertaught to Scouts.

Equally important is BSA's failure to adopt any clear posi-tion on homosexuality. BSA's temporary, though ultimately
abandoned, view that homosexuality is incompatible withbeing "morally straight" and "clean" is a far cry from the
clear, unequivocal statement necessary to prevail on itsclaim. Despite the solitary sentences in the 1991 and 1992
policies, the group continued to disclaim any single religiousor moral position as a general matter and actively eschewed
teaching any lesson on sexuality. It also continued to define"morally straight" and "clean" in the Boy Scout and Scoutmaster Handbooks without any reference to homosexuality.As noted earlier, nothing in our cases suggests that a group
can prevail on a right to expressive association if it, effec-tively, speaks out of both sides of its mouth. A State's antidiscrimination law does not impose a "serious burden" or a"substantial restraint" upon the group's "shared goals" if the
group itself is unable to identify its own stance with anyclarity.

IV
The majority pretermits this entire analysis. It finds thatBSA in fact " `teach[es] that homosexual conduct is not morally straight.' " Ante, at 651. This conclusion, remarkably,rests entirely on statements in BSA's briefs. See

ibid. (cit-ing Brief for Petitioners 39; Reply Brief for Petitioners 5).

Moreover, the majority insists that we must "give deferenceto an association's assertions regarding the nature of its expression" and "we must also give deference to an associa-tion's view of what would impair its expression."

Ante, at

Stevens, J., dissenting
653. So long as the record "contains written evidence" tosupport a group's bare assertion, "[w]e need not inquire further." Ante, at 651. Once the organization "asserts" thatit engages in particular expression,

ibid., "[w]e cannot doubt"
the truth of that assertion, ante, at 653.This is an astounding view of the law. I am unaware of

any previous instance in which our analysis of the scope of a
constitutional right was determined by looking at what a liti-gant asserts in his or her brief and inquiring no further. It

is even more astonishing in the First Amendment area, be-cause, as the majority itself acknowledges, "we are obligated
to independently review the factual record." Ante, at 648-
649. It is an odd form of independent review that consists
of deferring entirely to whatever a litigant claims. But the
majority insists that our inquiry must be "limited," ante, at
650, because "it is not the role of the courts to reject a
group's expressed values because they disagree with those
values or find them internally inconsistent," ante, at 651.
See also Brief for Petitioners 25 ("[T]he Constitution protects [BSA's] ability to control its own message").

But nothing in our cases calls for this Court to do any such
thing. An organization can adopt the message of its choice,
and it is not this Court's place to disagree with it. But we
must inquire whether the group is, in fact, expressing a message (whatever it may be) and whether that message (if one
is expressed) is significantly affected by a State's antidiscrimination law. More critically, that inquiry requires our
independent analysis, rather than deference to a group's litigating posture. Reflection on the subject dictates that such
an inquiry is required.

Surely there are instances in which an organization that
truly aims to foster a belief at odds with the purposes of a
State's antidiscrimination laws will have a First Amendment
right to association that precludes forced compliance with
those laws. But that right is not a freedom to discriminate
at will, nor is it a right to maintain an exclusionary member530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
ship policy simply out of fear of what the public reactionwould be if the group's membership were opened up. It is

an implicit right designed to protect the enumerated rightsof the First Amendment, not a license to act on any discriminatory impulse. To prevail in asserting a right of expres-sive association as a defense to a charge of violating an antidiscrimination law, the organization must at least show it hasadopted and advocated an unequivocal position inconsistent
with a position advocated or epitomized by the person whomthe organization seeks to exclude. If this Court were to
defer to whatever position an organization is prepared to as-sert in its briefs, there would be no way to mark the proper
boundary between genuine exercises of the right to associ-ate, on the one hand, and sham claims that are simply attempts to insulate nonexpressive private discrimination, onthe other hand. Shielding a litigant's claim from judicial
scrutiny would, in turn, render civil rights legislation a nul-lity, and turn this important constitutional right into a farce.
Accordingly, the Court's prescription of total deference willnot do. In this respect, Justice Frankfurter's words seem
particularly apt:

"Elaborately to argue against this contention is todignify a claim devoid of constitutional substance. Of

course a State may leave abstention from such discrimi-nations to the conscience of individuals. On the other
hand, a State may choose to put its authority behind oneof the cherished aims of American feeling by forbidding
indulgence in racial or religious prejudice to another'shurt. To use the Fourteenth Amendment as a sword
against such State power would stultify that Amend-ment. Certainly the insistence by individuals on their
private prejudices as to race, color or creed, in relationslike those now before us, ought not to have a higher
constitutional sanction than the determination of aState to extend the area of nondiscrimination beyond
that which the Constitution itself exacts." Railway

Mail Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U. S. 88, 98 (1945) (concurringopinion).

There is, of course, a valid concern that a court's independ-ent review may run the risk of paying too little heed to an
organization's sincerely held views. But unless one is pre-pared to turn the right to associate into a free pass out of
antidiscrimination laws, an independent inquiry is a neces-sity. Though the group must show that its expressive activities will be substantially burdened by the State's law, if thatlaw truly has a significant effect on a group's speech, even
the subtle speaker will be able to identify that impact.In this case, no such concern is warranted. It is entirely
clear that BSA in fact expresses no clear, unequivocal mes-sage burdened by New Jersey's law.

V
Even if BSA's right to associate argument fails, it nonethe-less might have a First Amendment right to refrain from

including debate and dialogue about homosexuality as partof its mission to instill values in Scouts. It can, for example,
advise Scouts who are entering adulthood and have ques-tions about sex to talk "with your parents, religious leaders,
teachers, or Scoutmaster," and, in turn, it can direct Scout-masters who are asked such questions "not undertake to instruct Scouts, in any formalized manner, in the subject ofsex and family life" because "it is not construed to be Scouting's proper area." See supra, at 669-670. Dale's right toadvocate certain beliefs in a public forum or in a private
debate does not include a right to advocate these ideas whenhe is working as a Scoutmaster. And BSA cannot be compelled to include a message about homosexuality among thevalues it actually chooses to teach its Scouts, if it would prefer to remain silent on that subject.In West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624
(1943), we recognized that the government may not "re-quir[e] affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind," nor

"force an American citizen publicly to profess any statementof belief," even if doing so does not require the person to

"forego any contrary convictions of their own." Id., at 633-634. "[O]ne important manifestation of the principle of free
speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide`what not to say.' " Hurley, 515 U. S., at 573. Though the
majority mistakenly treats this statement as going to theright to associate, it actually refers to a free speech claim.
See id., at 564-565, 580-581 (noting distinction between freespeech and right to associate claims). As with the right to
associate claim, though, the court is obligated to engage inan independent inquiry into whether the mere inclusion of
homosexuals would actually force BSA to proclaim a mes-sage it does not want to send.

Id., at 567.In its briefs, BSA implies, even if it does not directly

argue, that Dale would use his Scoutmaster position as a"bully pulpit" to convey immoral messages to his troop, and
therefore his inclusion in the group would compel BSA toinclude a message it does not want to impart. Brief for Petitioners 21-22. Even though the majority does not endorsethat argument, I think it is important to explain why it lacks
merit, before considering the argument the majority doesaccept.

BSA has not contended, nor does the record support, thatDale had ever advocated a view on homosexuality to his
troop before his membership was revoked. Accordingly,BSA's revocation could only have been based on an assumption that he would do so in the future. But the only informa-tion BSA had at the time it revoked Dale's membership was
a newspaper article describing a seminar at Rutgers Univer-sity on the topic of homosexual teenagers that Dale attended.
The relevant passage reads:

"James Dale, 19, co-president of the Rutgers UniversityLesbian Gay Alliance with Sharice Richardson, also 19,

said he lived a double life while in high school, pretend-ing to be straight while attending a military academy.

690 BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA v. DALE

Stevens, J., dissenting
"He remembers dating girls and even laughing at homophobic jokes while at school, only admitting his homosexuality during his second year at Rutgers.

" `I was looking for a role model, someone who was gay
and accepting of me,' Dale said, adding he wasn't just
seeking sexual experiences, but a community that would
take him in and provide him with a support network and
friends." App. 517.

Nothing in that article, however, even remotely suggests
that Dale would advocate any views on homosexuality to his
troop. The Scoutmaster Handbook instructs Dale, like all
Scoutmasters, that sexual issues are not their "proper area,"
and there is no evidence that Dale had any intention of violating this rule. Indeed, from all accounts Dale was a model
Boy Scout and Assistant Scoutmaster up until the day his
membership was revoked, and there is no reason to believe
that he would suddenly disobey the directives of BSA because of anything he said in the newspaper article.

To be sure, the article did say that Dale was co-president
of the Lesbian/Gay Alliance at Rutgers University, and that
group presumably engages in advocacy regarding homosexual issues. But surely many members of BSA engage in expressive activities outside of their troop, and surely BSA
does not want all of that expression to be carried on inside
the troop. For example, a Scoutmaster may be a member
of a religious group that encourages its followers to convert
others to its faith. Or a Scoutmaster may belong to a political party that encourages its members to advance its views
among family and friends.16 Yet BSA does not think it is
appropriate for Scoutmasters to proselytize a particular faith
to unwilling Scouts or to attempt to convert them from one

From all accounts, then, BSA does not discourage or forbidoutside expressive activity, but relies on compliance with its

policies and trusts Scouts and Scoutmasters alike not tobring unwanted views into the organization. Of course, a
disobedient member who flouts BSA's policy may be expelled. But there is no basis for BSA to presume that ahomosexual will be unable to comply with BSA's policy not

to discuss sexual matters any more than it would presumethat politically or religiously active members could not resist
the urge to proselytize or politicize during troop meetings.19As BSA itself puts it, its rights are "not implicated

prospective leader presents himself as a role model incon17 Bylaws of the Boy Scouts of America, Art. IX, $ 1, cl. 3 (reprinted in

19 Consider, in this regard, that a heterosexual, as well as a homosexual,

could advocate to the Scouts the view that homosexuality is not immoral.
BSA acknowledges as much by stating that a heterosexual who advocates
that view to Scouts would be expelled as well. Id., at 746 ("[A]ny persons
who advocate to Scouting youth that homosexual conduct is `morally
straight' under the Scout Oath, or `clean' under the Scout Law will not be
registered as adult leaders" (emphasis added)) (certification of BSA's National Director of Program). But BSA does not expel heterosexual members who take that view outside of their participation in Scouting, as long
as they do not advocate that position to the Scouts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.
And if there is no reason to presume that such a heterosexual will openly
violate BSA's desire to express no view on the subject, what reason--
other than blatant stereotyping--could justify a contrary presumption
for homosexuals?

The majority, though, does not rest its conclusion onthe claim that Dale will use his position as a bully pulpit.

Rather, it contends that Dale's mere presence among the BoyScouts will itself force the group to convey a message about
homosexuality--even if Dale has no intention of doing so.The majority holds that "[t]he presence of an avowed homosexual and gay rights activist in an assistant scoutmaster'suniform sends a distinc[t] . . . message," and, accordingly,
BSA is entitled to exclude that message. Ante, at 655-656.In particular, "Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would, at
the very least, force the organization to send a message, bothto the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts
accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of be20 BSA cites three media interviews and Dale's affidavit to argue that he
will openly advance a pro-gay agenda while being a Scoutmaster. None of
those statements even remotely supports that conclusion. And all of
them were made after Dale's membership was revoked and after this litigation commenced; therefore, they could not have affected BSA's revocation decision.

In a New York Times interview, Dale said " `I owe it to the organization
to point out to them how bad and wrong this policy is.' " App. 513 (emphases added). This statement merely demonstrates that Dale wants to use
this litigation--not his Assistant Scoutmaster position--to make a point,
and that he wants to make the point to the BSA organization, not to the
boys in his troop. At oral argument, BSA conceded that would not be
grounds for membership revocation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. In a Seattle
Times interview, Dale said Scouting is " `about giving adolescent boys a
role model.' " App. 549. He did not say it was about giving them a role
model who advocated a position on homosexuality. In a television interview, Dale also said "I am gay, and I'm very proud of who I am . . . . I
stand up for what I believe in . . . . I'm not hiding anything." Id., at 470.
Nothing in that statement says anything about an intention to stand up
for homosexual rights in any context other than in this litigation. Lastly,
Dale said in his affidavit that he is "open and honest about [his] sexual
orientation." Id., at 133. Once again, like someone who is open and honest about his political affiliation, there is no evidence in that statement
that Dale will not comply with BSA's policy when acting as a Scoutmaster.

havior." Ante, at 653; see also Brief for Petitioners 24 ("Bydonning the uniform of an adult leader in Scouting, he would

`celebrate [his] identity' as an openly gay Scout leader").The majority's argument relies exclusively on

Hurley v.
Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995). In that case, petitioners John
Hurley and the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council
ran a privately operated St. Patrick's Day parade. Re-spondent, an organization known as "GLIB," represented a

contingent of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals who sought tomarch in the petitioners' parade "as a way to express pride
in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual
individuals." Id., at 561. When the parade organizers refused GLIB's admission, GLIB brought suit under Massachusetts' antidiscrimination law. That statute, like New Jersey's law, prohibited discrimination on account of sexual
orientation in any place of public accommodation, which the
state courts interpreted to include the parade. Petitioners
argued that forcing them to include GLIB in their parade
would violate their free speech rights.

We agreed. We first pointed out that the St. Patrick's Day
parade--like most every parade--is an inherently expressive
undertaking. Id., at 568-570. Next, we reaffirmed that
the government may not compel anyone to proclaim a belief
with which he or she disagrees. Id., at 573-574. We then
found that GLIB's marching in the parade would be an expressive act suggesting the view "that people of their sexual
orientations have as much claim to unqualified social acceptance as heterosexuals." Id., at 574. Finally, we held that
GLIB's participation in the parade "would likely be perceived" as the parade organizers' own speech--or at least as
a view which they approved--because of a parade organizer's
customary control over who marches in the parade. Id., at
575. Though Hurley has a superficial similarity to the present case, a close inspection reveals a wide gulf between that
case and the one before us today.

Stevens, J., dissenting
First, it was critical to our analysis that GLIB was actuallyconveying a message by participating in the parade--otherwise, the parade organizers could hardly claim that theywere being forced to include any unwanted message at all.
Our conclusion that GLIB was conveying a message was in-extricably tied to the fact that GLIB wanted to march in a
parade, as well as the manner in which it intended to march.
We noted the "inherent expressiveness of marching [in a pa-rade] to make a point,"

id., at 568, and in particular that
GLIB was formed for the purpose of making a particularpoint about gay pride,

id., at 561, 570. More specifically,
GLIB "distributed a fact sheet describing the members' intentions" and, in a previous parade, had "marched behind a
shamrock-strewn banner with the simple inscription `Irish
American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston.' "
Id., at 570. "[A] contingent marching behind the organization's banner," we said, would clearly convey a message.
Id., at 574. Indeed, we expressly distinguished between the
members of GLIB, who marched as a unit to express their
views about their own sexual orientation, on the one hand,
and homosexuals who might participate as individuals in the
parade without intending to express anything about their
sexuality by doing so. Id., at 572-573.

Second, we found it relevant that GLIB's message "would
likely be perceived" as the parade organizers' own speech.
Id., at 575. That was so because "[p]arades and demonstrations . . . are not understood to be so neutrally presented or
selectively viewed" as, say, a broadcast by a cable operator,
who is usually considered to be "merely `a conduit' for the
speech" produced by others. Id., at 575-576. Rather, parade organizers are usually understood to make the "customary determination about a unit admitted to the parade."
Id., at 575.

Dale's inclusion in the Boy Scouts is nothing like the case
in Hurley. His participation sends no cognizable message
to the Scouts or to the world. Unlike GLIB, Dale did not

carry a banner or a sign; he did not distribute any factsheet;
and he expressed no intent to send any message. If there
is any kind of message being sent, then, it is by the mere act
of joining the Boy Scouts. Such an act does not constitute
an instance of symbolic speech under the First Amendment.21

It is true, of course, that some acts are so imbued with
symbolic meaning that they qualify as "speech" under the
First Amendment. See United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S.
367, 376 (1968). At the same time, however, "[w]e cannot
accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled `speech' whenever the person engaging
in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea." Ibid.
Though participating in the Scouts could itself conceivably
send a message on some level, it is not the kind of act that
we have recognized as speech. See Dallas v. Stanglin, 490
U. S. 19, 24-25 (1989).22 Indeed, if merely joining a group
did constitute symbolic speech; and such speech were attributable to the group being joined; and that group has the right
to exclude that speech (and hence, the right to exclude that
person from joining), then the right of free speech effectively
becomes a limitless right to exclude for every organization,
whether or not it engages in any expressive activities. That
cannot be, and never has been, the law.

21 The majority might have argued (but it did not) that Dale had become
so publicly and pervasively identified with a position advocating the moral
legitimacy of homosexuality (as opposed to just being an individual who
openly stated he is gay) that his leadership position in BSA would necessarily amount to using the organization as a conduit for publicizing his
position. But as already noted, when BSA expelled Dale, it had nothing
to go on beyond the one newspaper article quoted above, and one newspaper article does not convert Dale into a public symbol for a message. BSA
simply has not provided a record that establishes the factual premise for
this argument.

22 This is not to say that Scouts do not engage in expressive activity. It

is only to say that the simple act of joining the Scouts--unlike joining a
parade--is not inherently expressive.

696 BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA v. DALE

Stevens, J., dissenting
The only apparent explanation for the majority's holding,
then, is that homosexuals are simply so different from the
rest of society that their presence alone--unlike any other
individual's--should be singled out for special First Amendment treatment. Under the majority's reasoning, an openly
gay male is irreversibly affixed with the label "homosexual."
That label, even though unseen, communicates a message
that permits his exclusion wherever he goes. His openness
is the sole and sufficient justification for his ostracism.
Though unintended, reliance on such a justification is tantamount to a constitutionally prescribed symbol of inferiority.23
As counsel for BSA remarked, Dale "put a banner around
his neck when he . . . got himself into the newspaper. . . . He
created a reputation. . . . He can't take that banner off. He
put it on himself and, indeed, he has continued to put it on
himself." See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.

Another difference between this case and Hurley lies in
the fact that Hurley involved the parade organizers' claim to
determine the content of the message they wish to give at a
particular time and place. The standards governing such a
claim are simply different from the standards that govern
BSA's claim of a right of expressive association. Generally,
a private person or a private organization has a right to refuse to broadcast a message with which it disagrees, and a
right to refuse to contradict or garble its own specific statement at any given place or time by including the messages of
others. An expressive association claim, however, normally
involves the avowal and advocacy of a consistent position on
some issue over time. This is why a different kind of scrutiny must be given to an expressive association claim, lest
the right of expressive association simply turn into a right
to discriminate whenever some group can think of an expressive object that would seem to be inconsistent with the ad23 See Yoshino, Suspect Symbols: The Literary Argument for Heightened Scrutiny for Gays, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 1753, 1781-1783 (1996).

mission of some person as a member or at odds with theappointment of a person to a leadership position in the group.

Furthermore, it is not likely that BSA would be under-stood to send any message, either to Scouts or to the world,
simply by admitting someone as a member. Over the years,BSA has generously welcomed over 87 million young Americans into its ranks. In 1992 over one million adults wereactive BSA members. 160 N. J. 562, 571, 734 A. 2d 1196,
1200 (1999). The notion that an organization of that size andenormous prestige implicitly endorses the views that each of
those adults may express in a non-Scouting context is simplymind boggling. Indeed, in this case there is no evidence
that the young Scouts in Dale's troop, or members of theirfamilies, were even aware of his sexual orientation, either
before or after his public statements at Rutgers University.24It is equally farfetched to assert that Dale's open declaration
of his homosexuality, reported in a local newspaper, will ef-fectively force BSA to send a message to anyone simply because it allows Dale to be an Assistant Scoutmaster. For anOlympic gold medal winner or a Wimbledon tennis champion,
being "openly gay" perhaps communicates a message--forexample, that openness about one's sexual orientation is
more virtuous than concealment; that a homosexual personcan be a capable and virtuous person who should be judged
like anyone else; and that homosexuality is not immoral--but it certainly does not follow that they necessarily send a
message on behalf of the organizations that sponsor the ac-tivities in which they excel. The fact that such persons participate in these organizations is not usually construed toconvey a message on behalf of those organizations any more
than does the inclusion of women, African-Americans, reli24 For John Doe to make a public statement of his sexual orientation to
the newspapers may, of course, be a matter of great importance to John

gious minorities, or any other discrete group.25 Surely theorganizations are not forced by antidiscrimination laws to

take any position on the legitimacy of any individual's pri-vate beliefs or private conduct.

The State of New Jersey has decided that people who areopen and frank about their sexual orientation are entitled to
equal access to employment as schoolteachers, police officers,librarians, athletic coaches, and a host of other jobs filled by
citizens who serve as role models for children and adultsalike. Dozens of Scout units throughout the State are sponsored by public agencies, such as schools and fire depart-ments, that employ such role models. BSA's affiliation with
numerous public agencies that comply with New Jersey's lawagainst discrimination cannot be understood to convey any
particular message endorsing or condoning the activities ofall these people.

26

25 The majority simply announces, without analysis, that Dale's participation alone would "force the organization to send a message." Ante, at
653. "But . . . these are merely conclusory words, barren of analysis. . . .
For First Amendment principles to be implicated, the State must place
the citizen in the position of either apparently or actually `asserting as
true' the message." Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 721 (1977) (Rehn-
quist, J., dissenting).

26 BSA also argues that New Jersey's law violates its right to "intimate

association." Brief for Petitioners 39-47. Our cases recognize a substantive due process right "to enter into and carry on certain intimate or
private relationships." Rotary Club, 481 U. S., at 545. As with the First
Amendment right to associate, the State may not interfere with the selection of individuals in such relationships. Jaycees, 468 U. S., at 618.
Though the precise scope of the right to intimate association is unclear,
"we consider factors such as size, purpose, selectivity, and whether others
are excluded from critical aspects of the relationship" to determine
whether a group is sufficiently personal to warrant this type of constitutional protection. Rotary Club, 481 U. S., at 546. Considering BSA's
size, see supra, at 697, its broad purposes, and its nonselectivity, see
supra, at 666, it is impossible to conclude that being a member of the Boy
Scouts ranks among those intimate relationships falling within this right,
such as marriage, bearing children, rearing children, and cohabitation with
relatives. Rotary Club, 481 U. S., at 545.

Unfavorable opinions about homosexuals "have ancientroots."

Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186, 192 (1986).Like equally atavistic opinions about certain racial groups,

those roots have been nourished by sectarian doctrine. Id.,at 196-197 (Burger, C. J., concurring); Loving v. Virginia,

between male and female, alien and citizen, legitimate andillegitimate; for too much of our history there was the same
inertia in distinguishing between black and white"). Overthe years, however, interaction with real people, rather than
mere adherence to traditional ways of thinking about mem-bers of unfamiliar classes, have modified those opinions. A
few examples: The American Psychiatric Association's andthe American Psychological Association's removal of "homosexuality" from their lists of mental disorders; 28 a movetoward greater understanding within some religious communities; 29 Justice Blackmun's classic opinion in Bowers; 30

27 In Loving, the trial judge gave this explanation of the rationale for
Virginia's antimiscegenation statute: " `Almighty God created the races
white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would
be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races
shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.' " 388 U. S., at 3.

28 Brief for American Psychological Association as Amicus Curiae 8.

29 See n. 3, supra.
30 The significance of that opinion is magnified by comparing it with Justice Blackmun's vote 10 years earlier in Doe v. Commonwealth's Attorney
for City of Richmond, 425 U. S. 901 (1976). In that case, six Justices--
including Justice Blackmun--voted to summarily affirm the District
Court's rejection of the same due process argument that was later rejected in Bowers. Two years later, furthermore, Justice Blackmun joined
in a dissent in University of Missouri v. Gay Lib, 434 U. S. 1080 (1978).
In that case, the university had denied recognition to a student gay rights
organization. The student group argued that in doing so, the university
had violated its free speech and free association rights. The Court of

Georgia's invalidation of the statute upheld in Bowers; 31 andNew Jersey's enactment of the provision at issue in this case.

Indeed, the past month alone has witnessed some remark-able changes in attitudes about homosexuals.

32

That such prejudices are still prevalent and that they havecaused serious and tangible harm to countless members of

the class New Jersey seeks to protect are established matters of fact that neither the Boy Scouts nor the Court dis-putes. That harm can only be aggravated by the creation

of a constitutional shield for a policy that is itself the productof a habitual way of thinking about strangers. As Justice
Brandeis so wisely advised, "we must be ever on our guard,lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles."

If we would guide by the light of reason, we must let ourminds be bold. I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

I join Justice Stevens's dissent but add this further
word on the significance of Part VI of his opinion. There,
Justice Stevens describes the changing attitudes toward
gay people and notes a parallel with the decline of stereotypical thinking about race and gender. The legitimacy of New

Appeals agreed with that argument. A dissent from denial of certiorari,
citing the university's argument, suggested that the proper analysis might
well be as follows:

"[T]he question is more akin to whether those suffering from measles have
a constitutional right, in violation of quarantine regulations, to associate
together and with others who do not presently have measles, in order to
urge repeal of a state law providing that measle sufferers be quarantined."

Jersey's interest in forbidding discrimination on all thesebases by those furnishing public accommodations is, as

Justice Stevens indicates, acknowledged by many to bebeyond question. The fact that we are cognizant of this
laudable decline in stereotypical thinking on homosexualityshould not, however, be taken to control the resolution of
this case.

Boy Scouts of America (BSA) is entitled, consistently withits own tenets and the open doors of American courts, to

raise a federal constitutional basis for resisting the applica-tion of New Jersey's law. BSA has done that and has chosen
to defend against enforcement of the state public accommodations law on the ground that the First Amendment protects expressive association: individuals have a right to join
together to advocate opinions free from government interference. See Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609,
622 (1984). BSA has disclaimed any argument that Dale's
past or future actions, as distinct from his unapologetic declaration of sexual orientation, would justify his exclusion from
BSA. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13.

The right of expressive association does not, of course,
turn on the popularity of the views advanced by a group that
claims protection. Whether the group appears to this Court
to be in the vanguard or rearguard of social thinking is irrelevant to the group's rights. I conclude that BSA has not
made out an expressive association claim, therefore, not because of what BSA may espouse, but because of its failure
to make sexual orientation the subject of any unequivocal
advocacy, using the channels it customarily employs to state
its message. As Justice Stevens explains, no group can
claim a right of expressive association without identifying a
clear position to be advocated over time in an unequivocal
way. To require less, and to allow exemption from a public
accommodations statute based on any individual's difference
from an alleged group ideal, however expressed and however
inconsistently claimed, would convert the right of expres530US2 Unit: $U82 [11-08-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sive association into an easy trump of any antidiscrimina-tion law.*

If, on the other hand, an expressive association claim hasmet the conditions

Justice Stevens describes as necessary,there may well be circumstances in which the antidiscrimination law must yield, as he says. It is certainly possible foran individual to become so identified with a position as to
epitomize it publicly. When that position is at odds witha group's advocated position, applying an antidiscrimination
statute to require the group's acceptance of the individual ina position of group leadership could so modify or muddle or
frustrate the group's advocacy as to violate the expressiveassociational right. While it is not our business here to rule
on any such hypothetical, it is at least clear that our estimateof the progressive character of the group's position will be
irrelevant to the First Amendment analysis if such a casecomes to us for decision.

*An expressive association claim is in this respect unlike a basic free
speech claim, as Justice Stevens points out; the latter claim, i. e., the
right to convey an individual's or group's position, if bona fide, may be
taken at face value in applying the First Amendment. This case is thus
unlike Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of
Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995).

HILL et al. v. COLORADO et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of colorado
No. 98-1856. Argued January 19, 2000--Decided June 28, 2000
Colorado Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(3) makes it unlawful for any person within

100 feet of a health care facility's entrance to "knowingly approach"
within 8 feet of another person, without that person's consent, in order
to pass "a leaflet or handbill to, displa[y] a sign to, or engag[e] in oral
protest, education, or counseling with [that] person . . . ." Claiming
that the statute was facially invalid, petitioners sought to enjoin its enforcement in state court. In dismissing the complaint, the District
Judge held that the statute imposed content-neutral time, place, and
manner restrictions narrowly tailored to serve a significant government
interest under Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, in that
Colorado had not "adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys," id., at 791. The State Court of
Appeals affirmed, and the State Supreme Court denied review. This
Court vacated that judgment in light of its holding in Schenck v. ProChoice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, that an injunctive provision creating a speech-free floating buffer zone with a 15-foot radius
violated the First Amendment. On remand, the Court of Appeals reinstated its judgment, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, distinguishing Schenck, concluding that the statute was narrowly drawn to further
a significant government interest, rejecting petitioners' overbreadth
challenge, and concluding that ample alternative channels of communication remained open to petitioners.

Held: Section 18-9-122(3)'s restrictions on speech-related conduct are

constitutional. Pp. 714-735.

(a) Each side has legitimate and important concerns. Petitioners'
First Amendment interests are clear and undisputed. On the other
hand, the State's police powers allow it to protect its citizens' health and
safety, and may justify a special focus on access to health care facilities
and the avoidance of potential trauma to patients associated with confrontational protests. Moreover, rules providing specific guidance to
enforcement authorities serve the interest in evenhanded application of
the law. Also, the statute deals not with restricting a speaker's right to
address a willing audience, but with protecting listeners from unwanted
communication. Pp. 714-718.

(b) Section 18-9-122(3) passes the Ward content-neutrality test for
three independent reasons. First, it is a regulation of places where

some speech may occur, not a "regulation of speech." Second, it was
not adopted because of disagreement with the message of any speech.
Most importantly, the State Supreme Court unequivocally held that the
restrictions apply to all demonstrators, regardless of viewpoint, and the
statute makes no reference to the content of speech. Third, the State's
interests are unrelated to the content of the demonstrators' speech.
Petitioners contend that insofar as the statute applies to persons who
"knowingly approach" within eight feet of another to engage in "oral
protest, education, or counseling," it is "content-based" under Carey v.
Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 462, because it requires examination of the content
of a speaker's comments. This Court, however, has never held that it
is improper to look at a statement's content in order to determine
whether a rule of law applies to a course of conduct. Here, it is unlikely
that there would often be any need to know exactly what words were
spoken in order to determine whether sidewalk counselors are engaging
in oral protest, education, or counseling rather than social or random
conversation. The statute is easily distinguishable from the one in
Carey, which prohibited all picketing except for picketing of a place of
employment in a labor dispute, thereby according preferential treatment
to expression concerning one particular subject. In contrast, $ 18-9-
122(3) merely places a minor place restriction on an extremely broad
category of communications with unwilling listeners. Pp. 719-725.

(c) Section 18-9-122(3) is also a valid time, place, and manner regulation under Ward, for it is "narrowly tailored" to serve the State's significant and legitimate governmental interests and it leaves open ample
alternative communication channels. When a content-neutral regulation does not entirely foreclose any means of communication, it may
satisfy the tailoring requirement even though it is not the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving the statutory goal. The 8-foot
zone should not have any adverse impact on the readers' ability to read
demonstrators' signs. That distance can make it more difficult for a
speaker to be heard, but there is no limit on the number of speakers or
the noise level. Nor does the statute suffer from the failings of the
"floating buffer zone" rejected in Schenck. The zone here allows the
speaker to communicate at a "normal conversational distance," 519
U. S., at 377, and to remain in one place while other individuals pass
within eight feet. And the "knowing" requirement protects speakers
who thought they were at the proscribed distance from inadvertently
violating the statute. Whether the 8-foot interval is the best possible
accommodation of the competing interests, deference must be accorded
to the Colorado Legislature's judgment. The burden on the distribution of handbills is more serious, but the statute does not prevent a
leafletter from simply standing near the path of oncoming pedestrians
and proffering the material, which pedestrians can accept or decline.

U. S. 640. Pp. 725-730.

(d) Section 18-9-122(3) is not overbroad. First, the argument that
coverage is broader than the specific concern that led to the statute's
enactment does not identify a constitutional defect. It is precisely because the state legislature made a general policy choice that the statute
is assessed under Ward rather than a stricter standard. Second, the
argument that the statute bans virtually the universe of protected expression is based on a misreading of the statute and an incorrect understanding of the overbreadth doctrine. The statute does not ban any
forms of communication, but regulates the places where communications
may occur; and petitioners have not, as the doctrine requires, persuaded
the Court that the statute's impact on the conduct of other speakers will
differ from its impact on their own sidewalk counseling, see Broadrick v.
Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612, 615. Pp. 730-732.

(e) Nor is $ 18-9-122(3) unconstitutionally vague, either because it
fails to provide people with ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what it says or because it authorizes or encourages
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S.
41, 56-57. The first concern is ameliorated by $ 18-9-122(3)'s scienter
requirement. It is unlikely that anyone would not understand the common words used in the statute, and hypothetical situations not before
the Court will not support a facial attack on a statute that is surely
valid in the vast majority of its intended applications. The Court is
likewise unpersuaded that inadequate direction is given to law enforcement authorities. Indeed, one of $ 18-9-122(3)'s virtues is the specificity of the definitions of the zones. Pp. 732-733.

(f) Finally, $ 18-9-122(3)'s consent requirement does not impose a
prior restraint on speech. This argument was rejected in both Schenck
and Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753. Furthermore, "prior restraint" concerns relate to restrictions imposed by official
censorship, but the regulations here only apply if the pedestrian does
not consent to the approach. Pp. 733-735.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
At issue is the constitutionality of a 1993 Colorado statute
that regulates speech-related conduct within 100 feet of theentrance to any health care facility. The specific section of

the statute that is challenged, Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(3)(1999), makes it unlawful within the regulated areas for any
person to "knowingly approach" within eight feet of another
person, without that person's consent, "for the purpose of
passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with such other
person . . . ." 1 Although the statute prohibits speakers from

1 The entire $ 18-9-122 reads as follows:
"(1) The general assembly recognizes that access to health care facilities
for the purpose of obtaining medical counseling and treatment is imperative for the citizens of this state; that the exercise of a person's right to
protest or counsel against certain medical procedures must be balanced
against another person's right to obtain medical counseling and treatment
in an unobstructed manner; and that preventing the willful obstruction of
a person's access to medical counseling and treatment at a health care
facility is a matter of statewide concern. The general assembly therefore
declares that it is appropriate to enact legislation that prohibits a person
from knowingly obstructing another person's entry to or exit from a health
care facility.

"(2) A person commits a class 3 misdemeanor if such person knowingly
obstructs, detains, hinders, impedes, or blocks another person's entry to
or exit from a health care facility.

"(3) No person shall knowingly approach another person within eight
feet of such person, unless such other person consents, for the purpose of
passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral
protest, education, or counseling with such other person in the public way
or sidewalk area within a radius of one hundred feet from any entrance
door to a health care facility. Any person who violates this subsection (3)
commits a class 3 misdemeanor.

"(4) For the purposes of this section, `health care facility' means any
entity that is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by
law to administer medical treatment in this state.

"(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a statutory
or home rule city or county or city and county from adopting a law for the

Opinion of the Court
approaching unwilling listeners, it does not require a standing speaker to move away from anyone passing by. Nor
does it place any restriction on the content of any message
that anyone may wish to communicate to anyone else, either
inside or outside the regulated areas. It does, however,
make it more difficult to give unwanted advice, particularly
in the form of a handbill or leaflet, to persons entering or
leaving medical facilities.

The question is whether the First Amendment rights of
the speaker are abridged by the protection the statute provides for the unwilling listener.

I
Five months after the statute was enacted, petitioners
filed a complaint in the District Court for Jefferson County,
Colorado, praying for a declaration that $ 18-9-122(3) was
facially invalid and seeking an injunction against its enforcement. They stated that prior to the enactment of the statute, they had engaged in "sidewalk counseling" on the public
ways and sidewalks within 100 feet of the entrances to facilities where human abortion is practiced or where medical
personnel refer women to other facilities for abortions.
"Sidewalk counseling" consists of efforts "to educate, counsel, persuade, or inform passersby about abortion and abortion alternatives by means of verbal or written speech,
including conversation and/or display of signs and/or distribution of literature." 2 They further alleged that such activities frequently entail being within eight feet of other persons and that their fear of prosecution under the new statute

control of access to health care facilities that is no less restrictive than the
provisions of this section.

"(6) In addition to, and not in lieu of, the penalties set forth in this
section, a person who violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to civil liability, as provided in section 13-21-106.7, C. R. S."

caused them "to be chilled in the exercise of fundamentalconstitutional rights."

3

Count 5 of the complaint claimed violations of the right tofree speech protected by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and Count 6 alleged that the impairmentof the right to distribute written materials was a violation
of the right to a free press.4 The complaint also argued thatthe statutory consent requirement was invalid as a prior restraint tantamount to a licensing requirement, that the stat-ute was vague and overbroad, and that it was a contentbased restriction that was not justified by a compelling stateinterest. Finally, petitioners contended that $ 18-9-122(3)
was content based for two reasons: The content of the speechmust be examined to determine whether it "constitutes oral
protest, counseling and education"; and that it is "viewpoint-based" because the statute "makes it likely that prosecution
will occur based on displeasure with the position taken bythe speaker."

5

In their answers to the complaint, respondents admittedvirtually all of the factual allegations. They filed a motion

for summary judgment supported by affidavits, which in-cluded a transcript of the hearings that preceded the enactment of the statute. It is apparent from the testimony ofboth supporters and opponents of the statute that demonstrations in front of abortion clinics impeded access to thoseclinics and were often confrontational.

6 Indeed, it was a

common practice to provide escorts for persons entering andleaving the clinics both to ensure their access and to provide

Opinion of the Court
protection from aggressive counselors who sometimes used
strong and abusive language in face-to-face encounters.7
There was also evidence that emotional confrontations may
adversely affect a patient's medical care.8 There was no evidence, however, that the "sidewalk counseling" conducted by
petitioners in this case was ever abusive or confrontational.

The District Judge granted respondents' motion and dismissed the complaint. Because the statute had not actually
been enforced against petitioners, he found that they only
raised a facial challenge.9 He agreed with petitioners that
their sidewalk counseling was conducted in a "quintessential" public forum, but held that the statute permissibly imposed content-neutral "time, place, and manner restrictions"
that were narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and left open ample alternative channels of
communication.10 Relying on Ward v. Rock Against Rac7 A nurse practitioner testified that some antiabortion protesters " `yell,
thrust signs in faces, and generally try to upset the patient as much as
possible, which makes it much more difficult for us to provide care in a
scary situation anyway.' " Hill v. Thomas, 973 P. 2d 1246, 1250 (Colo.
1999). A volunteer who escorts patients into and out of clinics testified
that the protesters " `are flashing their bloody fetus signs. They are yelling, "you are killing your baby." [T]hey are talking about fetuses and
babies being dismembered, arms and legs torn off . . . a mother and her
daughter . . . were immediately surrounded and yelled at and screamed
at . . . .' " Id., at 1250-1251.

8 A witness representing the Colorado Coalition of Persons with Disabilities, who had had 35 separate surgeries in the preceding eight years,
testified: "Each and every one is tough. And the night before and the
morning of any medical procedure that's invasive is the toughest part of
all. You don't need additional stressors [sic] placed on you while you're
trying to do it. . . . We all know about our own personal faith. You don't
need somebody standing in your face screaming at you when you are going
in for what may be one of the most traumatic experiences of your life
anyway. Why make it more traumatic?" App. 108.

ism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989), he noted that " `[t]he principalinquiry in determining content neutrality . . . is whether the

government has adopted a regulation of speech because ofdisagreement with the message it conveys.' " He found that
the text of the statute "applies to all viewpoints, rather[than] only certain viewpoints," and that the legislative history made it clear that the State had not favored one view-point over another.

11 He concluded that the "free zone" created by the statute was narrowly tailored under the testannounced in

Ward, and that it left open ample alternativemeans of communication because signs and leaflets may be

seen, and speech may be heard, at a distance of eight feet.Noting that petitioners had stated in their affidavits that
they intended to "continue with their protected FirstAmendment activities," he rejected their overbreadth challenge because he believed "the statute will do little to deterprotected speech."

12 Finally, he concluded that the statute

was not vague and that the prior restraint doctrine was inap-plicable because the "statute requires no license or permit

scheme prior to speaking." 13

The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed for reasons simi-lar to those given by the District Judge. It noted that even

though only seven percent of the patients receiving servicesat one of the clinics were there to obtain abortion services,
all 60,000 of that clinic's patients "were subjected to the sametreatment by the protesters."

14 It also reviewed our thenrecent decision in Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc.,512 U. S. 753 (1994), and concluded that

Madsen's reasoning supported the conclusion that the statute was content

712 HILL v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
In 1996, the Supreme Court of Colorado denied review,16and petitioners sought a writ of certiorari from our Court.

While their petition was pending, we decided Schenck v.Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357 (1997).
Because we held in that case that an injunctive provisioncreating a speech-free "floating buffer zone" with a 15-foot
radius violates the First Amendment, we granted certiorari,vacated the judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals, and
remanded the case to that court for further consideration inlight of

Schenck. 519 U. S. 1145 (1997).On remand the Court of Appeals reinstated its judgment

upholding the statute. It noted that in Schenck we had"expressly declined to hold that a valid governmental interest in ensuring ingress and egress to a medical clinic maynever be sufficient to justify a zone of separation between
individuals entering and leaving the premises and protest-ers" and that our opinion in Ward provided the standard for
assessing the validity of a content-neutral, generally applica-ble statute. Under that standard, even though a 15-foot
floating buffer might preclude protesters from expressingtheir views from a normal conversational distance, a lesser
distance of eight feet was sufficient to protect such speechon a public sidewalk.

17

The Colorado Supreme Court granted certiorari and af-firmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. In a thorough

opinion, the court began by commenting on certain mattersthat were not in dispute. It reviewed the history of the
statute in detail and concluded that it was intended to pro-tect both the "citizen's `right to protest' or counsel against
certain medical procedures" and also to ensure "that govern-ment protects a `person's right to obtain medical counseling
and treatment.' " 18 It noted that both the trial court andthe Court of Appeals had concluded that the statute was con16 App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.

Opinion of the Court
tent neutral, that petitioners no longer contended otherwise,and that they agreed that the question for decision was

whether the statute was a valid time, place, and manner re-striction under the test announced in Ward.

19

The court identified two important distinctions betweenthis case and Schenck. First, Schenck involved a judicial

decree and therefore, as explained in Madsen, posed "greaterrisks of censorship and discriminatory application than do
general ordinances." 20 Second, unlike the floating bufferzone in

Schenck, which would require a protester either tostop talking or to get off the sidewalk whenever a patient

came within 15 feet, the "knowingly approaches" require-ment in the Colorado statute allows a protester to stand still
while a person moving toward or away from a health carefacility walks past her.

21 Applying the test in Ward, the

court concluded that the statute was narrowly drawn to fur-ther a significant government interest. It rejected petitioners' contention that it was not narrow enough because it ap-plied to all health care facilities in the State. In the court's
view, the comprehensive coverage of the statute was a factorthat supported its content neutrality. Moreover, the fact
that the statute was enacted, in part, because the General

19 "[P]etitioners concede that the test for a time, place, and manner restriction is the appropriate measure of this statute's constitutionality. See
Tape Recording of Oral Argument, Oct. 19, 1998, statement of James M.
Henderson, Esq. Petitioners argue that pursuant to the test announced
in Ward, the `floating buffer zone' created by section 18-9-122(3) is not
narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and that section 18-9-122(3) does not provide for ample alternative channels of communication. We disagree." Id., at 1251.

"We note that both the trial court and the court of appeals found that
section 18-9-122(3) is content-neutral, and that petitioners do not contend
otherwise in this appeal." Id., at 1256.

Opinion of the Court
Assembly "was concerned with the safety of individualsseeking wide-ranging health care services, not merely abortion counseling and procedures," added to the substantialityof the government interest that it served.

22 Finally, it concluded that ample alternative channels remain open becausepetitioners, and

"indeed, everyone, are still able to protest, counsel,shout, implore, dissuade, persuade, educate, inform, and
distribute literature regarding abortion. They just can-not knowingly approach within eight feet of an individual who is within 100 feet of a health care facility en-trance without that individual's consent. As articulated
so well . . . in Ward, [`the fact that $ 18-9-122(3)] mayreduce to some degree the potential audience for [petitioners'] speech is of no consequence, for there has beenno showing that the remaining avenues of communication are inadequate.' " 23
Because of the importance of the case, we granted certio-rari. 527 U. S. 1068 (1999). We now affirm.

II
Before confronting the question whether the Coloradostatute reflects an acceptable balance between the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding speakers and the in-terests of unwilling listeners, it is appropriate to examine
the competing interests at stake. A brief review of bothsides of the dispute reveals that each has legitimate and important concerns.The First Amendment interests of petitioners are clear
and undisputed. As a preface to their legal challenge, peti-tioners emphasize three propositions. First, they accu22 Id., at 1258.

Opinion of the Court
rately explain that the areas protected by the statute encompass all the public ways within 100 feet of every entrance to
every health care facility everywhere in the State of Colorado. There is no disagreement on this point, even though
the legislative history makes it clear that its enactment was
primarily motivated by activities in the vicinity of abortion
clinics. Second, they correctly state that their leafletting,
sign displays, and oral communications are protected by the
First Amendment. The fact that the messages conveyed by
those communications may be offensive to their recipients
does not deprive them of constitutional protection. Third,
the public sidewalks, streets, and ways affected by the statute are "quintessential" public forums for free speech. Finally, although there is debate about the magnitude of the
statutory impediment to their ability to communicate effectively with persons in the regulated zones, that ability, particularly the ability to distribute leaflets, is unquestionably
lessened by this statute.

On the other hand, petitioners do not challenge the legitimacy of the state interests that the statute is intended to
serve. It is a traditional exercise of the States' "police powers to protect the health and safety of their citizens." Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996). That interest
may justify a special focus on unimpeded access to health
care facilities and the avoidance of potential trauma to patients associated with confrontational protests. See Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753 (1994);
NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., 442 U. S. 773 (1979). Moreover, as with every exercise of a State's police powers, rules
that provide specific guidance to enforcement authorities
serve the interest in evenhanded application of the law.
Whether or not those interests justify the particular regulation at issue, they are unquestionably legitimate.

It is also important when conducting this interest analysis
to recognize the significant difference between state restric530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
716 HILL v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
tions on a speaker's right to address a willing audience andthose that protect listeners from unwanted communication.

This statute deals only with the latter.The right to free speech, of course, includes the right to
attempt to persuade others to change their views, and maynot be curtailed simply because the speaker's message may
be offensive to his audience. But the protection afforded
to offensive messages does not always embrace offensivespeech that is so intrusive that the unwilling audience cannot

avoid it. Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 487 (1988). In-deed, "[i]t may not be the content of the speech, as much as
the deliberate `verbal or visual assault,' that justifies proscription." Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 210-
211, n. 6 (1975) (citation and brackets omitted). Even in a
public forum, one of the reasons we tolerate a protester's
right to wear a jacket expressing his opposition to government policy in vulgar language is because offended viewers
can "effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes." Cohen v. California,
403 U. S. 15, 21 (1971).

The recognizable privacy interest in avoiding unwanted
communication varies widely in different settings. It is far
less important when "strolling through Central Park" than
when "in the confines of one's own home," or when persons
are "powerless to avoid" it. Id., at 21-22. But even the
interest in preserving tranquility in "the Sheep Meadow"
portion of Central Park may at times justify official restraints on offensive musical expression. Ward, 491 U. S.,
at 784, 792. More specific to the facts of this case, we have
recognized that "[t]he First Amendment does not demand
that patients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the cacophony of political protests." Madsen, 512 U. S., at 772-773.

The unwilling listener's interest in avoiding unwanted
communication has been repeatedly identified in our cases.
It is an aspect of the broader "right to be let alone" that one

of our wisest Justices characterized as "the most comprehen-sive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men."

Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 478 (1928)(Brandeis, J., dissenting).

24 The right to avoid unwelcome

speech has special force in the privacy of the home, Rowan v.Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 738 (1970), and its immediate

surroundings, Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S., at 485, but canalso be protected in confrontational settings. Thus, this
comment on the right to free passage in going to and fromwork applies equally--or perhaps with greater force--to access to a medical facility:

"How far may men go in persuasion and communica-tion and still not violate the right of those whom they

would influence? In going to and from work, men havea right to as free a passage without obstruction as the
streets afford, consistent with the right of others toenjoy the same privilege. We are a social people and
the accosting by one of another in an inoffensive wayand an offer by one to communicate and discuss information with a view to influencing the other's action arenot regarded as aggression or a violation of that other's
rights. If, however, the offer is declined, as it mayrightfully be, then persistence, importunity, following
and dogging become unjustifiable annoyance and ob-struction which is likely soon to savor of intimidation.
From all of this the person sought to be influenced hasa right to be free, and his employer has a right to have
him free." American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184, 204 (1921).

We have since recognized that the "right to persuade" dis-cussed in that case is protected by the First Amendment,

Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88 (1940), as well as by fed24 This common-law "right" is more accurately characterized as an "interest" that States can choose to protect in certain situations. See Katz

eral statutes. Yet we have continued to maintain that "noone has a right to press even `good' ideas on an unwilling

recipient." Rowan, 397 U. S., at 738. None of our decisionshas minimized the enduring importance of "a right to be
free" from persistent "importunity, following and dogging"after an offer to communicate has been declined. While the
freedom to communicate is substantial, "the right of everyperson `to be let alone' must be placed in the scales with the
right of others to communicate." Id., at 736. It is thatright, as well as the right of "passage without obstruction,"
that the Colorado statute legitimately seeks to protect. Therestrictions imposed by the Colorado statute only apply to
communications that interfere with these rights rather thanthose that involve willing listeners.

The dissenters argue that we depart from precedent byrecognizing a "right to avoid unpopular speech in a public
forum," post, at 771 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also post,at 749-754 (opinion of

Scalia, J.). We, of course, are not ad-dressing whether there is such a "right." Rather, we are

merely noting that our cases have repeatedly recognized theinterests of unwilling listeners in situations where "the degree
of captivity makes it impractical for the unwilling viewer orauditor to avoid exposure. See

Lehman v. [Shaker Heights,418 U. S. 298 (1974)]." Erznoznik, 422 U. S., at 209. We

explained in Erznoznik that "[t]his Court has consideredanalogous issues--pitting the First Amendment rights of
speakers against the privacy rights of those who may be un-willing viewers or auditors--in a variety of contexts. Such
cases demand delicate balancing." Id., at 208 (citationsomitted). The dissenters, however, appear to consider recognizing any of the interests of unwilling listeners--let alonebalancing those interests against the rights of speakers--to
be unconstitutional. Our cases do not support this view.25

25 Furthermore, whether there is a "right" to avoid unwelcome expression is not before us in this case. The purpose of the Colorado statute is
not to protect a potential listener from hearing a particular message. It

Opinion of the Court

III
All four of the state court opinions upholding the validityof this statute concluded that it is a content-neutral time,

place, and manner regulation. Moreover, they all found sup-port for their analysis in

Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491U. S. 781 (1989).
26 It is therefore appropriate to comment

on the "content neutrality" of the statute. As we explainedin Ward:

"The principal inquiry in determining content neutral-ity, in speech cases generally and in time, place, or manner cases in particular, is whether the government hasadopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement
with the message it conveys." Id., at 791.
The Colorado statute passes that test for three independentreasons. First, it is not a "regulation of speech." Rather,

it is a regulation of the places where some speech may occur.Second, it was not adopted "because of disagreement with
the message it conveys." This conclusion is supported notjust by the Colorado courts' interpretation of legislative history, but more importantly by the State Supreme Court'sunequivocal holding that the statute's "restrictions apply
equally to all demonstrators, regardless of viewpoint, andthe statutory language makes no reference to the content
of the speech." 27 Third, the State's interests in protecting
is to protect those who seek medical treatment from the potential physical
and emotional harm suffered when an unwelcome individual delivers a
message (whatever its content) by physically approaching an individual at
close range, i. e., within eight feet. In offering protection from that harm,
while maintaining free access to health clinics, the State pursues interests
constitutionally distinct from the freedom from unpopular speech to which
Justice Kennedy refers.

Opinion of the Court
access and privacy, and providing the police with clear guidelines, are unrelated to the content of the demonstrators'
speech. As we have repeatedly explained, government regulation of expressive activity is "content neutral" if it is justified without reference to the content of regulated speech.
See ibid. and cases cited.

Petitioners nevertheless argue that the statute is not content neutral insofar as it applies to some oral communication.
The statute applies to all persons who "knowingly approach"
within eight feet of another for the purpose of leafletting or
displaying signs; for such persons, the content of their oral
statements is irrelevant. With respect to persons who are
neither leafletters nor sign carriers, however, the statute
does not apply unless their approach is "for the purpose
of . . . engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling."
Petitioners contend that an individual near a health care facility who knowingly approaches a pedestrian to say "good
morning" or to randomly recite lines from a novel would not
be subject to the statute's restrictions.28 Because the content of the oral statements made by an approaching speaker
must sometimes be examined to determine whether the
knowing approach is covered by the statute, petitioners
argue that the law is "content-based" under our reasoning in
Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 462 (1980).

Although this theory was identified in the complaint, it is
not mentioned in any of the four Colorado opinions, all of
which concluded that the statute was content neutral. For
that reason, it is likely that the argument has been waived.
Additionally, the Colorado attorney general argues that we
should assume that the state courts tacitly construed the
terms "protest, education, or counseling" to encompass "all

none of the restrictions imposed by the court were directed at the contents
of petitioner's message." 512 U. S., at 762-763.

communication." 29 Instead of relying on those arguments,however, we shall explain why petitioners' contention is

without merit and why their reliance on Carey v. Brown ismisplaced.

It is common in the law to examine the content of a com-munication to determine the speaker's purpose. Whether
a particular statement constitutes a threat, blackmail, anagreement to fix prices, a copyright violation, a public offering of securities, or an offer to sell goods often depends onthe precise content of the statement. We have never held,
or suggested, that it is improper to look at the content of anoral or written statement in order to determine whether a
rule of law applies to a course of conduct. With respect tothe conduct that is the focus of the Colorado statute, it is
unlikely that there would often be any need to know exactlywhat words were spoken in order to determine whether
"sidewalk counselors" are engaging in "oral protest, edu-cation, or counseling" rather than pure social or random
conversation.Theoretically, of course, cases may arise in which it is necessary to review the content of the statements made by aperson approaching within eight feet of an unwilling listener
to determine whether the approach is covered by the statute.But that review need be no more extensive than a determination whether a general prohibition of "picketing" or "dem-onstrating" applies to innocuous speech. The regulation of
such expressive activities, by definition, does not cover so-cial, random, or other everyday communications. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 600, 1710 (1993)(defining "demonstrate" as "to make a public display of sentiment for or against a person or cause" and "picket" as an

effort "to persuade or otherwise influence"). Nevertheless,
we have never suggested that the kind of cursory examination that might be required to exclude casual conversation
from the coverage of a regulation of picketing would be
problematic.30

In Carey v. Brown we examined a general prohibition of
peaceful picketing that contained an exemption for picketing
a place of employment involved in a labor dispute. We concluded that this statute violated the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it discriminated
between lawful and unlawful conduct based on the content
of the picketers' messages. That discrimination was impermissible because it accorded preferential treatment to
expression concerning one particular subject matter--labor
disputes--while prohibiting discussion of all other issues.
Although our opinion stressed that "it is the content of the
speech that determines whether it is within or without the
statute's blunt prohibition," 447 U. S., at 462, we appended a
footnote to that sentence explaining that it was the fact that
the statute placed a prohibition on discussion of particular
topics, while others were allowed, that was constitutionally

30 In United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171 (1983), after examining a federal statute that was "[i]nterpreted and applied" as "prohibit[ing] picketing and leafletting, but not other expressive conduct" within the Supreme
Court building and grounds, we concluded that "it is clear that the prohibition is facially content-neutral." Id., at 181, n. 10. Similarly, we have
recognized that statutes can equally restrict all "picketing." See, e. g.,
Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 98 (1972) ("This is not
to say that all picketing must always be allowed. We have continually
recognized that reasonable `time, place and manner' regulations of picketing may be necessary to further significant governmental interests"), and
cases cited. See also Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988) (upholding a
general ban on residential picketing). And our decisions in Schenck and
Madsen both upheld injunctions that also prohibited "demonstrating."

repugnant.31 Regulation of the subject matter of messages,though not as obnoxious as viewpoint-based regulation, is

also an objectionable form of content-based regulation.
Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 538 (1980).

The Colorado statute's regulation of the location of protests, education, and counseling is easily distinguishable from
Carey. It places no restrictions on--and clearly does not
prohibit--either a particular viewpoint or any subject matter that may be discussed by a speaker. Rather, it simply
establishes a minor place restriction on an extremely broad
category of communications with unwilling listeners. Instead of drawing distinctions based on the subject that the
approaching speaker may wish to address, the statute applies equally to used car salesmen, animal rights activists,
fundraisers, environmentalists, and missionaries. Each can
attempt to educate unwilling listeners on any subject, but
without consent may not approach within eight feet to do so.

The dissenters, nonetheless, contend that the statute is not
"content neutral." As Justice Scalia points out, the vice
of content-based legislation in this context is that "it lends
itself " to being " `used for invidious thought-control purposes.' " Post, at 743. But a statute that restricts certain
categories of speech only lends itself to invidious use if there
is a significant number of communications, raising the same
problem that the statute was enacted to solve, that fall outside the statute's scope, while others fall inside. E. g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972). Here,

31 "It is, of course, no answer to assert that the Illinois statute does not
discriminate on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint, but only on the basis
of the subject matter of his message. `The First Amendment's hostility
to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular
viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.' "
Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 462, n. 6 (1980) (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 537 (1980)).

724 HILL v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
the statute's restriction seeks to protect those who enter
a health care facility from the harassment, the nuisance,
the persistent importuning, the following, the dogging, and
the implied threat of physical touching that can accompany
an unwelcome approach within eight feet of a patient by
a person wishing to argue vociferously face-to-face and
perhaps thrust an undesired handbill upon her. The statutory phrases, "oral protest, education, or counseling," distinguish speech activities likely to have those consequences
from speech activities (such as Justice Scalia's "happy
speech," post, at 743) that are most unlikely to have those
consequences. The statute does not distinguish among
speech instances that are similarly likely to raise the legitimate concerns to which it responds. Hence, the statute cannot be struck down for failure to maintain "content neutrality," or for "underbreadth."

Also flawed is Justice Kennedy's theory that a statute
restricting speech becomes unconstitutionally content based
because of its application "to the specific locations where
[that] discourse occurs," post, at 767. A statute prohibiting
solicitation in airports that was motivated by the aggressive
approaches of Hare Krishnas does not become content based
solely because its application is confined to airports--"the
specific locations where [that] discourse occurs." A statute
making it a misdemeanor to sit at a lunch counter for an hour
without ordering any food would also not be "content based"
even if it were enacted by a racist legislature that hated civil
rights protesters (although it might raise separate questions
about the State's legitimate interest at issue). See ibid.

Similarly, the contention that a statute is "viewpoint
based" simply because its enactment was motivated by the
conduct of the partisans on one side of a debate is without
support. Post, at 768-769 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The
antipicketing ordinance upheld in Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S.
474 (1988), a decision in which both of today's dissenters

Opinion of the Court
joined, was obviously enacted in response to the activities ofantiabortion protesters who wanted to protest at the home

of a particular doctor to persuade him and others that theyviewed his practice of performing abortions to be murder.
We nonetheless summarily concluded that the statute wascontent neutral. Id., at 482.

Justice Kennedy further suggests that a speaker whoapproaches a patient and "chants in praise of the Supreme
Court and its abortion decisions," or hands out a simpleleaflet saying, " `We are for abortion rights,' " would not be
subject to the statute. Post, at 769. But what reason isthere to believe the statute would not apply to that individual? She would be engaged in "oral protest" and "educa-tion," just as the abortion opponent who expresses her view
that the Supreme Court decisions were incorrect would be"protest[ing]" the decisions and "educat[ing]" the patient on
the issue. The close approach of the latter, more hostile,demonstrator may be more likely to risk being perceived
as a form of physical harassment; but the relevant FirstAmendment point is that the statute would prevent both
speakers, unless welcome, from entering the 8-foot zone.The statute is not limited to those who oppose abortion.
It applies to the demonstrator in Justice Kennedy's ex-ample. It applies to all "protest," to all "counseling," and
to all demonstrators whether or not the demonstration con-cerns abortion, and whether they oppose or support the
woman who has made an abortion decision. That is the levelof neutrality that the Constitution demands.

The Colorado courts correctly concluded that $ 18-9-122(3) is content neutral.

IV
We also agree with the state courts' conclusion that $ 18-9-122(3) is a valid time, place, and manner regulation under

the test applied in Ward because it is "narrowly tailored."We already have noted that the statute serves governmental

interests that are significant and legitimate and that the re530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
726 HILL v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
strictions are content neutral. We are likewise persuadedthat the statute is "narrowly tailored" to serve those interests and that it leaves open ample alternative channels forcommunication. As we have emphasized on more than one
occasion, when a content-neutral regulation does not entirelyforeclose any means of communication, it may satisfy the tailoring requirement even though it is not the least restrictiveor least intrusive means of serving the statutory goal.

32

The three types of communication regulated by $ 18-9-122(3) are the display of signs, leafletting, and oral speech.

The 8-foot separation between the speaker and the audienceshould not have any adverse impact on the readers' ability
to read signs displayed by demonstrators. In fact, the sepa-ration might actually aid the pedestrians' ability to see the
signs by preventing others from surrounding them and im-peding their view. Furthermore, the statute places no limitations on the number, size, text, or images of the placards.And, as with all of the restrictions, the 8-foot zone does not
affect demonstrators with signs who remain in place.With respect to oral statements, the distance certainly can
make it more difficult for a speaker to be heard, particularlyif the level of background noise is high and other speakers
are competing for the pedestrian's attention. Notably, thestatute places no limitation on the number of speakers or
the noise level, including the use of amplification equipment,although we have upheld such restrictions in past cases.
See, e. g., Madsen, 512 U. S., at 772-773. More significantly,this statute does not suffer from the failings that compelled
us to reject the "floating buffer zone" in Schenck, 519 U. S.,at 377. Unlike the 15-foot zone in Schenck, this 8-foot zone
allows the speaker to communicate at a "normal conversa32 "Lest any confusion on the point remain, we reaffirm today that a
regulation of the time, place, or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government's legitimate, content-neutral interests but that it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means
of doing so." Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S., at 798.

Opinion of the Court
tional distance." Ibid. Additionally, the statute allows thespeaker to remain in one place, and other individuals can

pass within eight feet of the protester without causing theprotester to violate the statute. Finally, here there is a
"knowing" requirement that protects speakers "who thoughtthey were keeping pace with the targeted individual" at the
proscribed distance from inadvertently violating the statute.
Id., at 378, n. 9.It is also not clear that the statute's restrictions will necessarily impede, rather than assist, the speakers' efforts tocommunicate their messages. The statute might encourage
the most aggressive and vociferous protesters to moderatetheir confrontational and harassing conduct, and thereby
make it easier for thoughtful and law-abiding sidewalk coun-selors like petitioners to make themselves heard. But
whether or not the 8-foot interval is the best possible accom-modation of the competing interests at stake, we must accord
a measure of deference to the judgment of the Colorado Leg-islature. See

Madsen, 512 U. S., at 769-770. Once again, it
is worth reiterating that only attempts to address unwilling
listeners are affected.The burden on the ability to distribute handbills is more

serious because it seems possible that an 8-foot intervalcould hinder the ability of a leafletter to deliver handbills to
some unwilling recipients. The statute does not, however,prevent a leafletter from simply standing near the path of
oncoming pedestrians and proffering his or her material,which the pedestrians can easily accept.

33 And, as in all

leafletting situations, pedestrians continue to be free todecline the tender. In

Heffron v. International Soc. for

33 Justice Kennedy states that the statute "forecloses peaceful leafletting," post, at 780. This is not correct. All of the cases he cites in
support of his argument involve a total ban on a medium of expression to
both willing and unwilling recipients, see post, at 780-787. Nothing in
this statute, however, prevents persons from proffering their literature;
they simply cannot approach within eight feet of an unwilling recipient.

728 HILL v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640 (1981), we upheld
a state fair regulation that required a religious organization
desiring to distribute literature to conduct that activity only
at an assigned location--in that case booths. As in this case,
the regulation primarily burdened the distributors' ability
to communicate with unwilling readers. We concluded our
opinion by emphasizing that the First Amendment protects
the right of every citizen to " `reach the minds of willing listeners and to do so there must be opportunity to win their
attention.' Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 87 (1949)." Id.,
at 655. The Colorado statute adequately protects those
rights.

Finally, in determining whether a statute is narrowly tailored, we have noted that "[w]e must, of course, take account
of the place to which the regulations apply in determining
whether these restrictions burden more speech than necessary." Madsen, 512 U. S., at 772. States and municipalities
plainly have a substantial interest in controlling the activity
around certain public and private places. For example, we
have recognized the special governmental interests surrounding schools,34 courthouses,35 polling places,36 and private homes.37 Additionally, we previously have noted the
unique concerns that surround health care facilities:

" `Hospitals, after all, are not factories or mines or assembly plants. They are hospitals, where human ailments are treated, where patients and relatives alike
often are under emotional strain and worry, where
pleasing and comforting patients are principal facets of
the day's activity, and where the patient and [her]
family . . . need a restful, uncluttered, relaxing, and

helpful atmosphere.' " Ibid. (quoting NLRB v. BaptistHospital, Inc., 442 U. S., at 783-784, n. 12).

Persons who are attempting to enter health care facili-ties--for any purpose--are often in particularly vulnerable
physical and emotional conditions. The State of Coloradohas responded to its substantial and legitimate interest in
protecting these persons from unwanted encounters, con-frontations, and even assaults by enacting an exceedingly
modest restriction on the speakers' ability to approach.

Justice Kennedy, however, argues that the statuteleaves petitioners without adequate means of communication. Post, at 780. This is a considerable overstatement.The statute seeks to protect those who wish to enter health
care facilities, many of whom may be under special physicalor emotional stress, from close physical approaches by demonstrators. In doing so, the statute takes a prophylacticapproach; it forbids all unwelcome demonstrators to come
closer than eight feet. We recognize that by doing so, it willsometimes inhibit a demonstrator whose approach in fact
would have proved harmless. But the statute's prophylacticaspect is justified by the great difficulty of protecting, say, a
pregnant woman from physical harassment with legal rulesthat focus exclusively on the individual impact of each instance of behavior, demanding in each case an accurate char-acterization (as harassing or not harassing) of each individual
movement within the 8-foot boundary. Such individualizedcharacterization of each individual movement is often difficult to make accurately. A bright-line prophylactic rulemay be the best way to provide protection, and, at the same
time, by offering clear guidance and avoiding subjectivity, toprotect speech itself.

As we explained above, the 8-foot restriction on an un-wanted physical approach leaves ample room to communicate
a message through speech. Signs, pictures, and voice itselfcan cross an 8-foot gap with ease. If the clinics in Colorado
resemble those in Schenck, demonstrators with leaflets

730 HILL v. COLORADO

Opinion of the Court
might easily stand on the sidewalk at entrances (withoutblocking the entrance) and, without physically approaching

those who are entering the clinic, peacefully hand themleaflets as they pass by.

Finally, the 8-foot restriction occurs only within 100 feetof a health care facility--the place where the restriction is
most needed. The restriction interferes far less with aspeaker's ability to communicate than did the total ban on
picketing on the sidewalk outside a residence (upheld in
Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988)), the restriction ofleafletting at a fairground to a booth (upheld in Heffron v.

International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452U. S. 640 (1981)), or the "silence" often required outside a
hospital. Special problems that may arise where clinicshave particularly wide entrances or are situated within
multipurpose office buildings may be worked out as the stat-ute is applied.

This restriction is thus reasonable and narrowly tailored.

V
Petitioners argue that $ 18-9-122(3) is invalid because it is"overbroad." There are two parts to petitioners' "overbreadth" argument. On the one hand, they argue that thestatute is too broad because it protects too many people in
too many places, rather than just the patients at the facilitieswhere confrontational speech had occurred. Similarly, it
burdens all speakers, rather than just persons with a historyof bad conduct.

38 On the other hand, petitioners also

contend that the statute is overbroad because it "bans vir-tually the universe of protected expression, including displays of signs, distribution of literature, and mere verbalstatements."

39

The first part of the argument does not identify a constitu-tional defect. The fact that the coverage of a statute is

Opinion of the Court
broader than the specific concern that led to its enactment isof no constitutional significance. What is important is that

all persons entering or leaving health care facilities sharethe interests served by the statute. It is precisely because
the Colorado Legislature made a general policy choice thatthe statute is assessed under the constitutional standard set
forth in Ward, 491 U. S., at 791, rather than a more strict
standard. See Madsen, 512 U. S., at 764. The cases citedby petitioners are distinguishable from this statute. In

those cases, the government attempted to regulate nonpro-tected activity, yet because the statute was overbroad, protected speech was also implicated. See Houston v. Hill, 482
U. S. 451 (1987); Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947 (1984). In this case, it is not disputed
that the regulation affects protected speech activity; the
question is thus whether it is a "reasonable restrictio[n] on
the time, place, or manner of protected speech." Ward, 491
U. S., at 791. Here, the comprehensiveness of the statute
is a virtue, not a vice, because it is evidence against there
being a discriminatory governmental motive. As Justice
Jackson observed, "there is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to
require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally." Railway
Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U. S. 106, 112 (1949)
(concurring opinion).

The second part of the argument is based on a misreading
of the statute and an incorrect understanding of the overbreadth doctrine. As we have already noted, $ 18-9-122(3)
simply does not "ban" any messages, and likewise it does not
"ban" any signs, literature, or oral statements. It merely
regulates the places where communications may occur. As
we explained in Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612
(1973), the overbreadth doctrine enables litigants "to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or

Opinion of the Court
assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally
protected speech or expression." Moreover, "particularly
where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe
that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but
substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly
legitimate sweep." Id., at 615. Petitioners have not persuaded us that the impact of the statute on the conduct of
other speakers will differ from its impact on their own sidewalk counseling. Cf. Members of City Council of Los
Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 801 (1984).
Like petitioners' own activities, the conduct of other protesters and counselors at all health care facilities are encompassed within the statute's "legitimate sweep." Therefore,
the statute is not overly broad.

VI
Petitioners also claim that $ 18-9-122(3) is unconstitutionally vague. They find a lack of clarity in three parts of the
section: the meaning of "protest, education, or counseling";
the "consent" requirement; and the determination whether
one is "approaching" within eight feet of another.

A statute can be impermissibly vague for either of two
independent reasons. First, if it fails to provide people of
ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand
what conduct it prohibits. Second, if it authorizes or even
encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 56-57 (1999).

In this case, the first concern is ameliorated by the fact
that $ 18-9-122(3) contains a scienter requirement. The
statute only applies to a person who "knowingly" approaches
within eight feet of another, without that person's consent,
for the purpose of engaging in oral protest, education, or
counseling. The likelihood that anyone would not understand any of those common words seems quite remote.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners proffer hypertechnical theories as to what thestatute covers, such as whether an outstretched arm constitutes "approaching." 40 And while "[t]here is little doubtthat imagination can conjure up hypothetical cases in which
the meaning of these terms will be in nice question," Ameri-can Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 412
(1950), because we are "[c]ondemned to the use of words, wecan never expect mathematical certainty from our language," Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 110(1972). For these reasons, we rejected similar vagueness
challenges to the injunctions at issue in Schenck, 519 U. S.,at 383, and

Madsen, 512 U. S., at 775-776. We thus concludethat "it is clear what the ordinance as a whole prohibits."

Grayned, 408 U. S., at 110. More importantly, speculationabout possible vagueness in hypothetical situations not before the Court will not support a facial attack on a statutewhen it is surely valid "in the vast majority of its intended
applications," United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 23 (1960).For the same reason, we are similarly unpersuaded by the
suggestion that $ 18-9-122(3) fails to give adequate guidanceto law enforcement authorities. Indeed, it seems to us that
one of the section's virtues is the specificity of the definitionsof the zones described in the statute. "As always, enforcement requires the exercise of some degree of police judg-ment,"

Grayned, 408 U. S., at 114, and the degree of judg-ment involved here is acceptable.

VII
Finally, petitioners argue that $ 18-9-122(3)'s consent re-quirement is invalid because it imposes an unconstitutional

"prior restraint" on speech. We rejected this argumentpreviously in Schenck, 519 U. S., at 374, n. 6, and Madsen,
512 U. S., at 764, n. 2. Moreover, the restrictions in this caseraise an even lesser prior restraint concern than those at

Opinion of the Court
issue in Schenck and Madsen where particular speakers
were at times completely banned within certain zones.
Under this statute, absolutely no channel of communication
is foreclosed. No speaker is silenced. And no message is
prohibited. Petitioners are simply wrong when they assert
that "[t]he statute compels speakers to obtain consent to
speak and it authorizes private citizens to deny petitioners'
requests to engage in expressive activities." 41 To the contrary, this statute does not provide for a "heckler's veto" but
rather allows every speaker to engage freely in any expressive activity communicating all messages and viewpoints
subject only to the narrow place requirement imbedded
within the "approach" restriction.

Furthermore, our concerns about "prior restraints" relate
to restrictions imposed by official censorship.42 The regulations in this case, however, only apply if the pedestrian does
not consent to the approach.43 Private citizens have always
retained the power to decide for themselves what they wish
to read, and within limits, what oral messages they want
to consider. This statute simply empowers private citizens
entering a health care facility with the ability to prevent a
speaker, who is within eight feet and advancing, from communicating a message they do not wish to hear. Further,

41 Id., at 29.
42 See Ward, 491 U. S., at 795, n. 5 ("[T]he regulations we have found

invalid as prior restraints have `had this in common: they gave public
officials the power to deny use of a forum in advance of actual expression' " (quoting Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546,
553 (1975) (emphasis added))).

43 While we have in prior cases found governmental grants of power to

private actors constitutionally problematic, those cases are distinguishable. In those cases, the regulations allowed a single, private actor to
unilaterally silence a speaker even as to willing listeners. See, e. g., Reno
v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 880 (1997) ("It would
confer broad powers of censorship, in the form of a `heckler's veto,' upon
any opponent of indecent speech . . ."). The Colorado statute at issue
here confers no such censorial power on the pedestrian.

the statute does not authorize the pedestrian to affect anyother activity at any other location or relating to any other

person. These restrictions thus do not constitute an unlaw-ful prior restraint.

The judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice O'Connor, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court and add this further word.The key to determining whether Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-

122(3) (1999) makes a content-based distinction between va-rieties of speech lies in understanding that content-based discriminations are subject to strict scrutiny because they placethe weight of government behind the disparagement or suppression of some messages, whether or not with the effect ofapproving or promoting others. United States v. Playboy
Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 812 (2000); R. A. V.v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); cf. Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95-96 (1972). Thus the government is held to a very exacting and rarely satisfied standardwhen it disfavors the discussion of particular subjects,

Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 116 (1991), or particular viewpoints within a given subject matter, Carey v. Brown, 447U. S. 455, 461-463 (1980) (citing

Chicago, supra, at 95-96);
cf. National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569,601-602 (1998) (

Souter, J., dissenting).
Concern about employing the power of the State to sup-press discussion of a subject or a point of view is not, however, raised in the same way when a law addresses not thecontent of speech but the circumstances of its delivery. The
right to express unpopular views does not necessarily immunize a speaker from liability for resorting to otherwise im530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

permissible behavior meant to shock members of the speak-er's audience, see

United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376
(1968) (burning draft card), or to guarantee their attention,see

Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 86-88 (1949) (sound
trucks); Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 484-485 (1988) (resi-dential picketing);

Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna
Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 647-648 (1981) (soliciting).
Unless regulation limited to the details of a speaker's deliv-ery results in removing a subject or viewpoint from effective

discourse (or otherwise fails to advance a significant publicinterest in a way narrowly fitted to that objective), a reasonable restriction intended to affect only the time, place, or
manner of speaking is perfectly valid. See Ward v. Rock
Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) ("Our cases make
clear . . . that even in a public forum the government may
impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner
of protected speech, provided the restrictions `are justified
without reference to the content of the regulated speech,
that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative
channels for communication of the information' " (quoting
Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.
288, 293 (1984))); 491 U. S., at 797 ("[O]ur cases quite clearly
hold that restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech are not invalid `simply because there is some
imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on
speech' " (quoting United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675,
689 (1985))).

It is important to recognize that the validity of punishing
some expressive conduct, and the permissibility of a time,
place, or manner restriction, does not depend on showing that the particular behavior or mode of delivery has no
association with a particular subject or opinion. Draft
card burners disapprove of the draft, see United States v.
O'Brien, supra, at 370, and abortion protesters believe abortion is morally wrong, Madsen v. Women's Health Center,

Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 758 (1994). There is always a correlationwith subject and viewpoint when the law regulates conduct

that has become the signature of one side of a controversy.But that does not mean that every regulation of such distinctive behavior is content based as First Amendment doctrineemploys that term. The correct rule, rather, is captured in
the formulation that a restriction is content based only if it
is imposed because of the content of the speech, see Ward,
supra, at 791 ("The principal inquiry in determining content
neutrality, in speech cases generally and in time, place, ormanner cases in particular, is whether the government has

adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with
the message it conveys"), and not because of offensive behavior identified with its delivery.

Since this point is as elementary as anything in traditional
speech doctrine, it would only be natural to suppose that
today's disagreement between the Court and the dissenting
Justices must turn on unusual difficulty in evaluating the
facts of this case. But it does not. The facts overwhelmingly demonstrate the validity of subsection (3) as a contentneutral regulation imposed solely to regulate the manner in
which speakers may conduct themselves within 100 feet of
the entrance of a health care facility.

No one disputes the substantiality of the government's
interest in protecting people already tense or distressed
in anticipation of medical attention (whether an abortion
or some other procedure) from the unwanted intrusion of
close personal importunity by strangers. The issues dividing the Court, then, go to the content neutrality of the regulation, its fit with the interest to be served by it, and the
availability of other means of expressing the desired message (however offensive it may be even without physically
close communication).

Each of these issues is addressed principally by the fact
that subsection (3) simply does not forbid the statement of
any position on any subject. It does not declare any view

738 HILL v. COLORADO

Souter, J., concurring
as unfit for expression within the 100-foot zone or beyond it.What it forbids, and all it forbids, is approaching another

person closer than eight feet (absent permission) to deliverthe message. Anyone (let him be called protester, counselor, or educator) may take a stationary position within theregulated area and address any message to any person
within sight or hearing. The stationary protester may be
quiet and ingratiating, or loud and offensive; the law does nottouch him, even though in some ways it could. See

Madsen,
supra, at 768-771 (injunction may bar protesters from 36-foot zone around entrances to clinic and parking lot).

This is not to say that enforcement of the approach restriction will have no effect on speech; of course it will make some
difference. The effect of speech is a product of ideas and
circumstances, and time, place, and manner are circumstances. The question is simply whether the ostensible reason for regulating the circumstances is really something
about the ideas. Here, the evidence indicates that the ostensible reason is the true reason. The fact that speech by a
stationary speaker is untouched by this statute shows that
the reason for its restriction on approaches goes to the approaches, not to the content of the speech of those approaching. What is prohibited is a close encounter when the person addressed does not want to get close. So, the intended
recipient can stay far enough away to prevent the whispered
argument, mitigate some of the physical shock of the shouted
denunciation, and avoid the unwanted handbill. But the
content of the message will survive on any sign readable at
eight feet and in any statement audible from that slight distance. Hence the implausibility of any claim that an antiabortion message, not the behavior of protesters, is what is
being singled out.

The matter of proper tailoring to limit no more speech
than necessary to vindicate the public interest deserves a
few specific comments, some on matters raised by Justice
Kennedy's dissent. Subsection (3) could possibly be ap530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

plied to speakers unlike the present petitioners, who mightnot know that the entrance to the facility was within 100

feet, or who might try to engage people within 100 feet of ahealth facility other than a physician's office or hospital, or
people having no business with the facility. These objec-tions do not, however, weigh very heavily on a facial challenge like this. The specter of liability on the part of those
who importune while oblivious of the facility is laid to restby the requirement that a defendant act "knowingly." See

Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-1-503(4) (1999) (culpable mental staterequirement deemed to apply to each element of offense, absent clear contrary intent). While it is true that subsection
(3) was not enacted to protect dental patients, I cannot say
it goes beyond the State's interest to do so; someone facing
an hour with a drill in his tooth may reasonably be protected
from the intrusive behavior of strangers who are otherwise
free to speak. While some mere passersby may be protected needlessly, I am skeptical about the number of health
care facilities with substantial pedestrian traffic within 100
feet of their doors but unrelated to the business conducted
inside. Hence, I fail to see danger of the substantial overbreadth required to be shown before a statute is struck down
out of concern for the speech rights of those not before the
Court. Cf. Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson
Co., 467 U. S. 947, 964-965 (1984); Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S.
451, 458 (1987).

As for the claim of vagueness, at first blush there is something objectionable. Those who do not choose to remain stationary may not approach within eight feet with a purpose,
among others, of "engaging in oral protest, education, or
counseling." Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(3) (1999). While
that formula excludes liability for enquiring about the time
or the bus schedule within eight feet, "education" does not
convey much else by way of limitation. But that is not fatal
here. What is significant is not that the word fails to limit
clearly, but that it pretty clearly fails to limit very much at

all. It succeeds in naturally covering any likely address by
one person approaching another on a street or parking lot
outside a building entrance (aside from common social greetings, protests, or requests for assistance). Someone planning to spread a message by accosting strangers is likely to
understand the statute's application to "education." And
just because the coverage is so obviously broad, the discretion given to the police in deciding whether to charge an
offense seems no greater than the prosecutorial discretion
inherent in any generally applicable criminal statute. Cf.
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108 (1972) (noting
that "[v]ague laws may trap the innocent by not providing
fair warning" and that "if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit
standards for those who apply them"); Coates v. Cincinnati,
402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971). "[P]erfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity." Ward, 491 U. S., at 794.

Although petitioners have not argued that the "floating
bubble" feature of the 8-foot zone around a pedestrian is itself a failure of narrow tailoring, I would note the contrast
between the operation of subsection (3) and that of the comparable portion of the injunction struck down in Schenck v.
Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 377-379
(1997), where we observed that the difficulty of administering a floating bubble zone threatened to burden more speech
than necessary. In Schenck, the floating bubble was larger
(15 feet) and was associated with near-absolute prohibitions
on speech. Ibid. Since subsection (3) prohibits only 8-foot
approaches, however, with the stationary speaker free to
speak, the risk is less. Whether floating bubble zones are
so inherently difficult to administer that only fixed, no-speech
zones (or prohibitions on ambulatory counseling within a
fixed zone) should pass muster is an issue neither before
us nor well suited to consideration on a facial challenge,
cf. Ward, supra, at 794 ("Since respondent does not claim

that city officials enjoy unguided discretion to deny the rightto speak altogether, it is open to question whether respondent's claim falls within the narrow class of permissible facialchallenges to allegedly unconstrained grants of regulatory
authority").

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

The Court today concludes that a regulation requiring
speakers on the public thoroughfares bordering medical facil-ities to speak from a distance of eight feet is "not a `regulation of speech,' " but "a regulation of the places where somespeech may occur,"

ante, at 719; and that a regulation directed to only certain categories of speech (protest, educa-tion, and counseling) is not "content-based." For these reasons, it says, the regulation is immune from the exactingscrutiny we apply to content-based suppression of speech in
the public forum. The Court then determines that the regu-lation survives the less rigorous scrutiny afforded contentneutral time, place, and manner restrictions because it is narrowly tailored to serve a government interest--protectionof citizens' "right to be let alone"--that has explicitly been

disclaimed by the State, probably for the reason that, asa basis for suppressing peaceful private expression, it is
patently incompatible with the guarantees of the FirstAmendment.

None of these remarkable conclusions should come as a
surprise. What is before us, after all, is a speech regulation
directed against the opponents of abortion, and it therefore
enjoys the benefit of the "ad hoc nullification machine" that
the Court has set in motion to push aside whatever doctrines
of constitutional law stand in the way of that highly favored
practice. Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S.

and dissenting in part). Having deprived abortion opponents of the political right to persuade the electorate that

ues and expands its assault upon their individual right topersuade women contemplating abortion that what they are

doing is wrong. Because, like the rest of our abortion juris-prudence, today's decision is in stark contradiction of the
constitutional principles we apply in all other contexts,I dissent.

I
Colorado's statute makes it a criminal act knowingly toapproach within 8 feet of another person on the public way

or sidewalk area within 100 feet of the entrance door of ahealth care facility for the purpose of passing a leaflet to,
displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education,or counseling with such person. Whatever may be said
about the restrictions on the other types of expressive activ-ity, the regulation as it applies to oral communications is obviously and undeniably content based. A speaker wishingto approach another for the purpose of communicating any
message except one of protest, education, or counseling maydo so without first securing the other's consent. Whether a
speaker must obtain permission before approaching withineight feet--and whether he will be sent to prison for failing
to do so--depends entirely on what he intends to say whenhe gets there. I have no doubt that this regulation would
be deemed content based in an instant if the case before usinvolved antiwar protesters, or union members seeking to
"educate" the public about the reasons for their strike. "[I]tis," we would say, "the content of the speech that determines
whether it is within or without the statute's blunt prohibi-tion,"

Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 462 (1980). But thejurisprudence of this Court has a way of changing when

abortion is involved.The Court asserts that this statute is not content based
for purposes of our First Amendment analysis because it nei-ther (1) discriminates among viewpoints nor (2) places restrictions on "any subject matter that may be discussed bya speaker."

Ante, at 723. But we have never held that the

Scalia, J., dissenting
universe of content-based regulations is limited to those twocategories, and such a holding would be absurd. Imagine,

for instance, special place-and-manner restrictions on allspeech except that which "conveys a sense of contentment
or happiness." This "happy speech" limitation would not be"viewpoint based"--citizens would be able to express their
joy in equal measure at either the rise or fall of the
NASDAQ, at either the success or the failure of the Republi-can Party--and would not discriminate on the basis of subject matter, since gratification could be expressed about any-thing at all. Or consider a law restricting the writing or
recitation of poetry--neither viewpoint based nor limited toany particular subject matter. Surely this Court would consider such regulations to be "content based" and deservingof the most exacting scrutiny.

1

"The vice of content-based legislation--what renders it de-serving of the high standard of strict scrutiny--is not that it

is always used for invidious, thought-control purposes, but
that it lends itself to use for those purposes." Madsen,

1 The Court responds that statutes which restrict categories of speech--
as opposed to subject matter or viewpoint--are constitutionally worrisome only if a "significant number of communications, raising the same
problem that the statute was enacted to solve, . . . fall outside the statute's
scope, while others fall inside." Ante, at 723. I am not sure that is
correct, but let us assume, for the sake of argument, that it is. The Court
then proceeds to assert that "[t]he statutory phrases, `oral protest, education, or counseling,' distinguish speech activities likely to" present the
problem of "harassment, . . . nuisance, . . . persistent importuning, . . .
following, . . . dogging, and . . . implied threat of physical touching," from
"speech activities [such as my example of `happy speech'] that are most
unlikely to have those consequences," ante, at 724. Well. That may
work for "oral protest"; but it is beyond imagining why "education" and
"counseling" are especially likely, rather than especially unlikely, to involve such conduct. (Socrates was something of a noodge, but even he
did not go that far.) Unless, of course, "education" and "counseling" are
code words for efforts to dissuade women from abortion--in which event
the statute would not be viewpoint neutral, which the Court concedes
makes it invalid.

744 HILL v. COLORADO

Scalia, J., dissenting
supra, at 794 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (emphasis deleted). Arestriction that operates only on speech that communicates

a message of protest, education, or counseling presents ex-actly this risk. When applied, as it is here, at the entrance
to medical facilities, it is a means of impeding speech againstabortion. The Court's confident assurance that the statute
poses no special threat to First Amendment freedoms because it applies alike to "used car salesmen, animal rightsactivists, fundraisers, environmentalists, and missionaries,"

ante, at 723, is a wonderful replication (except for its lack ofsarcasm) of Anatole France's observation that "[t]he law, in
its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to
sleep under bridges . . . ." J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations
550 (16th ed. 1992). This Colorado law is no more targeted
at used car salesmen, animal rights activists, fundraisers, environmentalists, and missionaries than French vagrancy law
was targeted at the rich. We know what the Colorado legislators, by their careful selection of content ("protest, education, and counseling"), were taking aim at, for they set it
forth in the statute itself: the "right to protest or counsel
against certain medical procedures" on the sidewalks and
streets surrounding health care facilities. Colo. Rev. Stat.

$ 18-9-122(1) (1999) (emphasis added).

The Court is unpersuasive in its attempt to equate the
present restriction with content-neutral regulation of demonstrations and picketing--as one may immediately suspect
from the opinion's wildly expansive definitions of demonstrations as " `public display[s] of sentiment for or against a person or cause,' " and of picketing as an effort " `to persuade or
otherwise influence.' " Ante, at 721-722, quoting Webster's
Third New International Dictionary 600, 1710 (1993). (On
these terms, Nathan Hale was a demonstrator and Patrick
Henry a picket.) When the government regulates "picketing," or "demonstrating," it restricts a particular manner
of expression that is, as the author of today's opinion has
several times explained, " `a mixture of conduct and commu530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nication.' " Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 497 (1988) (Ste-
vens, J., dissenting), quoting NLRB v. Retail Store Employees, 447 U. S. 607, 618-619 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring inpart and concurring in result). The latter opinion quoted

approvingly Justice Douglas's statement:

"Picketing by an organized group is more than free
speech, since it involves patrol of a particular localityand since the very presence of a picket line may induce

action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of thenature of the ideas which are being disseminated.
Hence those aspects of picketing make it the subject ofrestrictive regulation."

Bakery Drivers v. Wohl, 315
U. S. 769, 776-777 (1942) (concurring opinion).

As Justice Stevens went on to explain, "no doubt the
principal reason why handbills containing the same messageare so much less effective than labor picketing is that the

former depend entirely on the persuasive force of the idea."
Retail Store Employees, supra, at 619. Today, of course,
Justice Stevens gives us an opinion restricting not onlyhandbilling but even one-on-one conversation of a particular

content. There comes a point--and the Court's opinion
today passes it--at which the regulation of action intimatelyand unavoidably connected with traditional speech is a regulation of speech itself. The strictures of the First Amend-ment cannot be avoided by regulating the act of moving one's
lips; and they cannot be avoided by regulating the act ofextending one's arm to deliver a handbill, or peacefully approaching in order to speak. All of these acts can be regu-lated, to be sure; but not, on the basis of content, without
satisfying the requirements of our strict-scrutiny First
Amendment jurisprudence.

Even with regard to picketing, of course, we have applied
strict scrutiny to content-based restrictions. See Carey, 447
U. S., at 461 (applying strict scrutiny to, and invalidating,
an Illinois statute that made "permissibility of residential

Scalia, J., dissenting
picketing . . . dependent solely on the nature of the messagebeing conveyed"). As discussed above, the prohibition here

is content based: Those who wish to speak for purposes otherthan protest, counsel, or education may do so at close range
without the listener's consent, while those who wish to speakfor other purposes may not. This bears no resemblance to
a blanket prohibition of picketing--unless, of course, one uses
the fanciful definition of picketing ("an effort to persuade orotherwise influence") newly discovered by today's opinion.

As for the Court's appeal to the fact that we often "examinethe content of a communication" to determine whether it
"constitutes a threat, blackmail, an agreement to fix prices,
a copyright violation, a public offering of securities, or an
offer to sell goods," ante, at 721, the distinction is almost
too obvious to bear mention: Speech of a certain content is
constitutionally proscribable. The Court has not yet taken
the step of consigning "protest, education, and counseling"
to that category.

Finally, the Court is not correct in its assertion that the
restriction here is content neutral because it is "justified
without reference to the content of regulated speech," in the
sense that "the State's interests in protecting access and
privacy, and providing the police with clear guidelines, are
unrelated to the content of the demonstrators' speech."
Ante, at 719-720 (emphasis added). That is not an accurate
statement of our law. The Court makes too much of the
statement in Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781
(1989), that "[t]he principal inquiry in determining content
neutrality . . . is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message
it conveys." Id., at 791, quoted ante, at 719. That is indeed
"the principal inquiry"--suppression of uncongenial ideas is
the worst offense against the First Amendment--but it is
not the only inquiry. Even a law that has as its purpose
something unrelated to the suppression of particular content
cannot irrationally single out that content for its prohibition.

An ordinance directed at the suppression of noise (and there-fore "justified without reference to the content of regulated

speech") cannot be applied only to sound trucks deliveringmessages of "protest." Our very first use of the "justified
by reference to content" language made clear that it is aprohibition

in addition to, rather than in place of, the prohibition of facially content-based restrictions. "Selective exclusions from a public forum," we said, "may not be based oncontent alone,

and may not be justified by reference to content alone." Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92,96 (1972) (emphasis added).

But in any event, if one accepts the Court's description of
the interest served by this regulation, it is clear that the
regulation is both based on content and justified by reference
to content. Constitutionally proscribable "secondary effects" of speech are directly addressed in subsection (2) of
the statute, which makes it unlawful to obstruct, hinder, impede, or block access to a health care facility--a prohibition
broad enough to include all physical threats and all physically threatening approaches. The purpose of subsection
(3), however (according to the Court), is to protect "[t]he unwilling listener's interest in avoiding unwanted communication," ante, at 716. On this analysis, Colorado has restricted
certain categories of speech--protest, counseling, and education--out of an apparent belief that only speech with this
content is sufficiently likely to be annoying or upsetting as
to require consent before it may be engaged in at close range.
It is reasonable enough to conclude that even the most gentle
and peaceful close approach by a so-called "sidewalk counselor"--who wishes to "educate" the woman entering an
abortion clinic about the nature of the procedure, to "counsel" against it and in favor of other alternatives, and perhaps
even (though less likely if the approach is to be successful)
to "protest" her taking of a human life--will often, indeed
usually, have what might be termed the "secondary effect"
of annoying or deeply upsetting the woman who is planning

Scalia, J., dissenting
the abortion. But that is not an effect which occurs "with-out reference to the content" of the speech. This singling

out of presumptively "unwelcome" communications fits pre-cisely the description of prohibited regulation set forth in
Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988): It "targets the directimpact of a particular category of speech, not a secondary
feature that happens to be associated with that type ofspeech." (Emphasis added.

2)

In sum, it blinks reality to regard this statute, in its appli-cation to oral communications, as anything other than a

content-based restriction upon speech in the public forum.As such, it must survive that stringent mode of constitutional analysis our cases refer to as "strict scrutiny," whichrequires that the restriction be narrowly tailored to serve
a compelling state interest. See United States v. Playboy
Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000); PerryEd. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45

(1983). Since the Court does not even attempt to supportthe regulation under this standard, I shall discuss it only
briefly. Suffice it to say that if protecting people from un2 The Court's contention that the statute is content neutral because it is
not a " `regulation of speech' " but a "regulation of the places where some
speech may occur," ante, at 719 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989)), is simply baffling. First, because the proposition that a restriction upon the places where speech may occur is not a
restriction upon speech is both absurd and contradicted by innumerable
cases. See, e. g., Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753
(1994); Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992); Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U. S. 474 (1988); Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312 (1988); Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640 (1981); Carey v.
Brown, 447 U. S. 455 (1980); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104
(1972); Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972). And second, because the fact that a restriction is framed as a "regulation of the
places where some speech may occur" has nothing whatever to do with
whether the restriction is content neutral--which is why Boos held to be
content based the ban on displaying, within 500 feet of foreign embassies,

welcome communications (the governmental interest theCourt posits) is a compelling state interest, the First Amendment is a dead letter. And if (as I shall discuss at greaterlength below) forbidding peaceful, nonthreatening, but uninvited speech from a distance closer than eight feet is a "nar-rowly tailored" means of preventing the obstruction of entrance to medical facilities (the governmental interest theState asserts), narrow tailoring must refer not to the standards of Versace, but to those of Omar the tentmaker. In thelast analysis all of this does not matter, however, since as I
proceed to discuss neither the restrictions upon oral commu-nications nor those upon handbilling can withstand a proper
application of even the less demanding scrutiny we apply totruly content-neutral regulations of speech in a traditional
public forum. II

As the Court explains, under our precedents even acontent-neutral, time, place, and manner restriction must be
narrowly tailored to advance a significant state interest, andmust leave open ample alternative means of communication.
Ward, 491 U. S., at 802. It cannot be sustained if it "bur-den[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to further
the government's legitimate interests." Id., at 799.This requires us to determine, first, what

is the significantinterest the State seeks to advance? Here there appears to

be a bit of a disagreement between the State of Colorado(which should know) and the Court (which is eager to speculate). Colorado has identified in the text of the statute itselfthe interest it sought to advance: to ensure that the State's
citizens may "obtain medical counseling and treatment in anunobstructed manner" by "preventing the willful obstruction
of a person's access to medical counseling and treatment ata health care facility." Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(1) (1999).
In its brief here, the State repeatedly confirms the interestsquarely identified in the statute under review. See,

e. g.,Brief for Respondents 15 ("Each provision of the statute was

530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

chosen to precisely address crowding and physical intimi-dation: conduct shown to impede access, endanger safety

and health, and strangle effective law enforcement"); id., at14 ("[T]his provision narrowly addresses the conduct shown
to interfere with access through crowding and physicalthreats"). The Court nevertheless concludes that the Colorado provision is narrowly tailored to serve . . . the State's
interest in protecting its citizens' rights to be let alone fromunwanted speech.

Indeed, the situation is even more bizarre than that. Theinterest that the Court makes the linchpin of its analysis was
not only unasserted by the State; it is not only completelydifferent from the interest that the statute specifically sets
forth; it was explicitly disclaimed by the State in its briefbefore this Court, and characterized as a "straw interest"
petitioners served up in the hope of discrediting the State'scase. Id., at 25, n. 19. We may thus add to the lengthening
list of "firsts" generated by this Court's relentlessly proabor-tion jurisprudence, the first case in which, in order to sustain
a statute, the Court has relied upon a governmental interestnot only unasserted by the State, but positively repudiated.

I shall discuss below the obvious invalidity of this statuteassuming, first (in Part A), the fictitious state interest that
the Court has invented, and then (in Part B), the interestactually recited in the statute and asserted by counsel for
Colorado. A

It is not without reason that Colorado claimed that, in at-tributing to this statute the false purpose of protecting citizens' right to be let alone, petitioners were seeking to dis-credit it. Just three Terms ago, in upholding an injunction
against antiabortion activities, the Court refused to rely onany supposed " `right of the people approaching and entering
the facilities to be left alone.' " Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 383 (1997). It ex-pressed "doubt" that this " `right' . . . accurately reflects our

530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
First Amendment jurisprudence." Ibid. Finding itself insomething of a jam (the State here has passed a regulation

that is obviously not narrowly tailored to advance any otherinterest), the Court today neatly repackages the repudiated
"right" as an "interest" the State may decide to protect,
ante, at 717, n. 24, and then places it onto the scales opposite
the right to free speech in a traditional public forum.

To support the legitimacy of its self-invented state inter-est, the Court relies upon a

bon mot in a 1928 dissent (which
we evidently overlooked in Schenck). It characterizes the"unwilling listener's interest in avoiding unwanted communication" as an "aspect of the broader `right to be let alone' "
Justice Brandeis coined in his dissent in Olmstead v. United
States, 277 U. S. 438, 478. The amusing feature is that even
this slim reed contradicts rather than supports the Court's
position. The right to be let alone that Justice Brandeis
identified was a right the Constitution "conferred, as against
the government"; it was that right, not some generalized
"common-law right" or "interest" to be free from hearing the
unwanted opinions of one's fellow citizens, which he called
the "most comprehensive" and "most valued by civilized
men." Ibid. (emphasis added). To the extent that there
can be gleaned from our cases a "right to be let alone" in the
sense that Justice Brandeis intended, it is the right of the
speaker in the public forum to be free from government interference of the sort Colorado has imposed here.

In any event, the Court's attempt to disguise the "right to
be let alone" as a "governmental interest in protecting the
right to be let alone" is unavailing for the simple reason that
this is not an interest that may be legitimately weighed
against the speakers' First Amendment rights (which the
Court demotes to the status of First Amendment "interests,"
ante, at 714). We have consistently held that "the Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of
otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer." Erz530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

noznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 210 (1975) (emphasisadded). And as recently as in

Schenck, the Court reiterated
that "[a]s a general matter, we have indicated that in publicdebate our own citizens must tolerate insulting, and even

outrageous, speech in order to provide adequate breathingspace to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment."
519 U. S., at 383 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Court nonetheless purports to derive from our casesa principle limiting the protection the Constitution affords

the speaker's right to direct "offensive messages" at "unwill-ing" audiences in the public forum.

Ante, at 716. There is
no such principle. We have upheld limitations on a speaker's exercise of his right to speak on the public streets when
that speech intrudes into the privacy of the home. Frisby,
487 U. S., at 483, upheld a content-neutral municipal ordinance prohibiting picketing outside a residence or dwelling.
The ordinance, we concluded, was justified by, and narrowly
tailored to advance, the government's interest in the "protection of residential privacy." Id., at 484. Our opinion rested
upon the "unique nature of the home"; "the home," we said,
"is different." Ibid. The reasoning of the case plainly assumed the nonexistence of the right--common law or otherwise--that the Court relies on today, the right to be free
from unwanted speech when on the public streets and sidewalks. The home, we noted, was " `the one retreat to which
men and women can repair to escape from the tribulations
of their daily pursuits.' " Ibid. (quoting Carey, 447 U. S.,
at 471). The limitation on a speaker's right to bombard
the home with unwanted messages which we approved in
Frisby--and in Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728
(1970), upon which the Court also relies--was predicated on
the fact that " `we are often `captives' outside the sanctuary
of the home and subject to objectionable speech.' " Frisby,
supra, at 484 (quoting Rowan, supra, at 738) (emphasis
added). As the universally understood state of First
Amendment law is described in a leading treatise: "Outside

the home, the burden is generally on the observer or listenerto avert his eyes or plug his ears against the verbal assaults,

lurid advertisements, tawdry books and magazines, andother `offensive' intrusions which increasingly attend urban
life." L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law $ 12-19, p. 948(2d ed. 1988). The Court today elevates the abortion clinic
to the status of the home.3There is apparently no end to the distortion of our First
Amendment law that the Court is willing to endure in orderto sustain this restriction upon the free speech of abortion
opponents. The labor movement, in particular, has goodcause for alarm in the Court's extensive reliance upon

Amer-ican Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council,

257 U. S. 184 (1921), an opinion in which the Court held thatthe Clayton Act's prohibition of injunctions against lawful
and peaceful labor picketing did not forbid the injunction inthat particular case. The First Amendment was not at
issue, and was not so much as mentioned in the opinion, so
the case is scant authority for the point the Court wishes tomake. The case is also irrelevant because it was "clear from

the evidence that from the outset, violent methods were pur-sued from time to time in such a way as to characterize the
attitude of the picketers as continuously threatening." Id.,at 200. No such finding was made, or could be made, here.
More importantly, however, as far as our future labor cases

3 I do not disagree with the Court that "our cases have repeatedly recognized the interests of unwilling listeners" in locations, such as public conveyances, where " `the degree of captivity makes it impractical for the
unwilling viewer or auditor to avoid exposure,' " ante, at 718 (quoting Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 (1975)). But we have never
made the absurd suggestion that a pedestrian is a "captive" of the speaker
who seeks to address him on the public sidewalks, where he may simply
walk quickly by. Erznoznik itself, of course, invalidated a prohibition on
the showing of films containing nudity on screens visible from the street,
noting that "the burden normally falls upon the viewer to `avoid further
bombardment of [his] sensibilities simply by averting [his] eyes.' " Id., at
210-211 (quoting Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21 (1971).

are concerned: If a "right to be free" from "persistence, im-portunity, following and dogging," id., at 204, short of actual

intimidation, was part of our infant First Amendment law in1921, I am shocked to think that it is there today. The
Court's assertion that "[n]one of our decisions has minimizedthe enduring importance of `a right to be free' from persistent `importunity, following and dogging' after an offer tocommunicate has been declined,"

ante, at 718, is belied bythe fact that this passage from American Steel Foundries

has never--not once--found its way into any of the manyFirst Amendment cases this Court has decided since 1921.
We will have cause to regret today's injection of this irrele-vant anachronism into the mainstream of our First Amendment jurisprudence.Of course even if one accepted the American Steel Foundries dictum as an accurate expression of First Amendmentlaw, the statute here is plainly not narrowly tailored to protect the interest that dictum describes. Preserving the"right to be free" from "persisten[t] importunity, following
and dogging" does not remotely require imposing upon allspeakers who wish to protest, educate, or counsel a duty to
request permission to approach closer than eight feet. Theonly way the narrow-tailoring objection can be eliminated is
to posit a state-created, First-Amendment-trumping "rightto be let alone" as broad and undefined as Brandeis's

Olm-stead dictum, which may well (why not, if the Court wishes

it?) embrace a right not to be spoken to without permissionfrom a distance closer than eight feet. Nothing stands in
the way of that solution to the narrow-tailoring problem--except, of course, its utter absurdity, which is no obstacle in
abortion cases. B

I turn now to the real state interest at issue here--the oneset forth in the statute and asserted in Colorado's brief: the
preservation of unimpeded access to health care facilities.We need look no further than subsection (2) of the statute to

530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

755Cite as: 530 U. S. 703 (2000)
Scalia, J., dissenting
see what a provision would look like that is narrowly tailoredto serve

that interest. Under the terms of that subsection,
any person who "knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, im-pedes, or blocks another person's entry to or exit from a

health care facility" is subject to criminal and civil liability.It is possible, I suppose, that subsection (2) of the Colorado
statute will leave unrestricted some expressive activity that,
if engaged in from within eight feet, may be sufficiently har-assing as to have the effect of impeding access to health care

facilities. In subsection (3), however, the State of Coloradohas prohibited a vast amount of speech that cannot possibly
be thought to correspond to that evil.

To begin with, the 8-foot buffer zone attaches to every person on the public way or sidewalk within 100 feet of the
entrance of a medical facility, regardless of whether that person is seeking to enter or exit the facility. In fact, the State
acknowledged at oral argument that the buffer zone would
attach to any person within 100 feet of the entrance door of
a skyscraper in which a single doctor occupied an office on
the 18th floor. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. And even with respect
to those who are seeking to enter or exit the facilities, the
statute does not protect them only from speech that is so
intimidating or threatening as to impede access. Rather, it
covers all unconsented-to approaches for the purpose of oral
protest, education, or counseling (including those made for
the purpose of the most peaceful appeals) and, perhaps even
more significantly, every approach made for the purposes of
leafletting or handbilling, which we have never considered,
standing alone, obstructive or unduly intrusive. The sweep
of this prohibition is breathtaking.

The Court makes no attempt to justify on the facts this
blatant violation of the narrow-tailoring principle. Instead,
it flirts with the creation of yet a new constitutional "first"
designed for abortion cases: "[W]hen," it says, "a contentneutral regulation does not entirely foreclose any means of
communication, it may satisfy the tailoring requirement even

530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
756 HILL v. COLORADO

Scalia, J., dissenting
though it is not the least restrictive or least intrusive meansof serving the statutory goal."

Ante, at 726. The implication is that the availability of alternative means of communi-cation permits the imposition of the speech restriction upon

more individuals, or more types of communication, than nar-row tailoring would otherwise demand. The Court assures
us that "we have emphasized" this proposition "on more than
one occasion," ibid. The only citation the Court provides,however, says no such thing.

Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S., at 798, quoted ante, at 726, n. 32, says onlythat narrow tailoring is not synonymous with "least restrictive" alternative. It does not at all suggest--and to my
knowledge no other case does either--that narrow tailoring
can be relaxed when there are other speech alternatives.

The burdens this law imposes upon the right to speak are
substantial, despite an attempt to minimize them that is not
even embarrassed to make the suggestion that they might
actually "assist . . . the speakers' efforts to communicate
their messages," ante, at 727. (Compare this with the
Court's statement in a nonabortion case, joined by the author
of today's opinion: "The First Amendment mandates that we
presume that speakers, not the government, know best both
what they want to say and how to say it." Riley v. National
Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 790-791
(1988).) The Court displays a willful ignorance of the type
and nature of communication affected by the statute's restrictions. It seriously asserts, for example, that the 8-foot
zone allows a speaker to communicate at a "normal conversational distance," ante, at 726-727. I have certainly held conversations at a distance of eight feet seated in the quiet of
my chambers, but I have never walked along the public sidewalk--and have not seen others do so--"conversing" at an
8-foot remove. The suggestion is absurd. So is the suggestion that the opponents of abortion can take comfort in the
fact that the statute "places no limitation on the number of
speakers or the noise level, including the use of amplification

Scalia, J., dissenting
equipment," ante, at 726. That is good enough, I suppose,for "protesting"; but the Court must know that most of the

"counseling" and "educating" likely to take place outside ahealth care facility cannot be done at a distance and at a
high-decibel level. The availability of a powerful amplifica-tion system will be of little help to the woman who hopes to
forge, in the last moments before another of her sex is to
have an abortion, a bond of concern and intimacy that mightenable her to persuade the woman to change her mind and

heart. The counselor may wish to walk alongside and tosay, sympathetically and as softly as the circumstances allow,
something like: "My dear, I know what you are going
through. I've been through it myself. You're not alone and
you do not have to do this. There are other alternatives.
Will you let me help you? May I show you a picture of what
your child looks like at this stage of her human development?" The Court would have us believe that this can be
done effectively--yea, perhaps even more effectively--by
shouting through a bullhorn at a distance of eight feet.

The Court seems prepared, if only for a moment, see ante,
at 727-728, to take seriously the magnitude of the burden the
statute imposes on simple handbilling and leafletting. That
concern is fleeting, however, since it is promptly assuaged by
the realization that a leafletter may, without violating the
statute, stand "near the path" of oncoming pedestrians and
make his "proffe[r] . . . , which the pedestrians can easily
accept," ante, at 727. It does not take a veteran labor organizer to recognize--although surely any would, see Brief for
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations as Amicus Curiae 7-8--that leafletting will
be rendered utterly ineffectual by a requirement that the
leafletter obtain from each subject permission to approach,
or else man a stationary post (one that does not obstruct
access to the facility, lest he violate subsection (2) of statute)
and wait for passersby voluntarily to approach an outstretched hand. That simply is not how it is done, and the

Scalia, J., dissenting
Court knows it--or should. A leafletter, whether he isworking on behalf of Operation Rescue, Local 109, or Bubba's

Bar-B-Que, stakes out the best piece of real estate he can,and then walks a few steps toward individuals passing in his
vicinity, extending his arm and making it as easy as possiblefor the passerby, whose natural inclination is generally not
to seek out such distributions, to simply accept the offering.
Few pedestrians are likely to give their "consent" to the ap-proach of a handbiller (indeed, by the time he requested it

they would likely have passed by), and even fewer are likelyto walk over in order to pick up a leaflet. In the abortion
context, therefore, ordinary handbilling, which we have in
other contexts recognized to be a "classic for[m] of speech
that lie[s] at the heart of the First Amendment," Schenck,
519 U. S., at 377, will in its most effective locations be rendered futile, the Court's implausible assertions to the contrary notwithstanding.

The Colorado provision differs in one fundamental respect
from the "content-neutral" time, place, and manner restrictions the Court has previously upheld. Each of them rested
upon a necessary connection between the regulated expression and the evil the challenged regulation sought to eliminate. So, for instance, in Ward v. Rock Against Racism, the
Court approved the city's control over sound amplification
because every occasion of amplified sound presented the evil
of excessive noise and distortion disturbing the areas surrounding the public forum. The regulation we upheld in
Ward, rather than "ban[ning] all concerts, or even all rock
concerts, . . . instead focus[ed] on the source of the evils the
city seeks to eliminate . . . and eliminates them without at
the same time banning or significantly restricting a substantial quantity of speech that does not create the same evils."
491 U. S., at 799, n. 7. In Members of City Council of Los
Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 808 (1984),
the Court approved a prohibition on signs attached to utility
poles which "did no more than eliminate the exact source of

the evil it sought to remedy." In Heffron v. InternationalSoc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 652

(1981), the Court upheld a regulation prohibiting the saleor distribution on the state fairgrounds of any merchandise,
including printed or written material, except from a fixedlocation, because that precisely served the State's interest in
"avoiding congestion and maintaining the orderly movementof fair patrons on the fairgrounds."

In contrast to the laws approved in those cases, the lawbefore us here enacts a broad prophylactic restriction which
does not "respon[d] precisely to the substantive problemwhich legitimately concern[ed]" the State,

Vincent, supra, at810--namely (the only problem asserted by Colorado), the

obstruction of access to health facilities. Such prophylacticrestrictions in the First Amendment context--even when
they are content neutral--are not permissible. "Broad pro-phylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect. . . .
Precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area soclosely touching our most precious freedoms."

NAACP v.Button, 371 U. S. 415, 438 (1963). In United States v. Grace,

461 U. S. 171 (1983), we declined to uphold a ban on certainexpressive activity on the sidewalks surrounding the Supreme Court. The purpose of the restriction was the per-fectly valid interest in security, just as the purpose of the
restriction here is the perfectly valid interest in unob-structed access; and there, as here, the restriction furthered
that interest--but it furthered it with insufficient precisionand hence at excessive cost to the freedom of speech. There
was, we said, "an insufficient nexus" between security andall the expressive activity that was banned, id., at 181--just
as here there is an insufficient nexus between the assuranceof access and forbidding unconsented communications within
eight feet.4

the Colorado ban are unobjectionable because they "interfer[e] far less

760 HILL v. COLORADO

Scalia, J., dissenting
Compare with these venerable and consistent descriptionsof our First Amendment law the defenses that the Court

makes to the contention that the present statute is over-broad. (To be sure, the Court is assuming its own invented
state interest--protection of the "right to be let alone"--rather than the interest that the statute describes, but even
so the statements are extraordinary.) "The fact," the Courtsays, "that the coverage of a statute is broader than the specific concern that led to its enactment is of no constitutionalsignificance."

Ante, at 730-731. That is true enough ordi-narily, but it is not true with respect to restraints upon

speech, which is what the doctrine of overbreadth is allabout. (Of course it is also not true, thanks to one of the
other proabortion "firsts" announced by the current Court,with respect to restrictions upon abortion, which--as our decision in Stenberg v. Carhart, post, p. 914, exemplifies--hasbeen raised to First Amendment status, even as speech opposing abortion has been demoted from First Amendmentstatus.) Again, the Court says that the overbreadth doctrine is not applicable because this law simply "does not `ban'any signs, literature, or oral statements," but "merely regulates the places where communications may occur." Ante,at 731. I know of no precedent for the proposition that time,
place, and manner restrictions are not subject to the doctrineof overbreadth. Our decision in

Grace, supra, demonstratesthe contrary: Restriction of speech on the sidewalks around

in Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988), and Heffron, and in cases requiring "silence" outside of a hospital (by which I presume the Court means
Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753 (1994)), misses the
point of narrow-tailoring analysis. We do not compare restrictions on
speech to some Platonic ideal of speech restrictiveness, or to each other.
Rather, our First Amendment doctrine requires us to consider whether
the regulation in question burdens substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the particular interest the government has identified and
asserted. Ward, 491 U. S., at 799. In each of the instances the Court
cites, we concluded that the challenged regulation contained the precision
that our cases require and that Colorado's statute (which the Court itself
calls "prophylactic," ante, at 729) manifestly lacks.

the Supreme Court was invalidated because it went further
than the needs of security justified. Surely New York City
cannot require a parade permit and a security bond for any
individual who carries a sign on the sidewalks of Fifth
Avenue.

The Court can derive no support for its approval of Colorado's overbroad prophylactic measure from our decision in
Schenck. To be sure, there we rejected the argument that
the court injunction on demonstrating within a fixed buffer
zone around clinic entrances was unconstitutional because it
banned even " `peaceful, nonobstructive demonstrations.' "
519 U. S., at 381. The Court upheld the injunction, however,
only because the "District Court was entitled to conclude,"
"[b]ased on defendants' past conduct" and "the record in
[that] case," that the specific defendants involved would, if
permitted within the buffer zone, "continue to do what they
had done before: aggressively follow and crowd individuals
right up to the clinic door and then refuse to move, or purposefully mill around parking lot entrances in an effort to
impede or block the progress of cars." Id., at 381-382. It
is one thing to assume, as in Schenck, that a prophylactic
injunction is necessary when the specific targets of that
measure have demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to
engage in protected speech activity without also engaging in
conduct that the Constitution clearly does not protect. It is
something else to assume that all those who wish to speak
outside health care facilities across the State will similarly
abuse their rights if permitted to exercise them. The First
Amendment stands as a bar to exactly this type of prophylactic legislation. I cannot improve upon the Court's conclusion in Madsen that "it is difficult, indeed, to justify a prohibition on all uninvited approaches of persons seeking the
services of the clinic, regardless of how peaceful the contact
may be, without burdening more speech than necessary to
prevent intimidation and to ensure access to the clinic. Absent evidence that the protesters' speech is independently

proscribable (i. e., `fighting words' or threats), or is so infusedwith violence as to be indistinguishable from a threat of

physical harm, this provision cannot stand." 512 U. S., at774 (citation omitted).

The foregoing discussion of overbreadth was written be-fore the Court, in responding to

Justice Kennedy, aban-doned any pretense at compliance with that doctrine, and

acknowledged--indeed, boasted--that the statute it ap-proves "takes a prophylactic approach," ante, at 729, and
adopts "[a] bright-line prophylactic rule," ibid.5 I scarcelyknow how to respond to such an unabashed repudiation of
our First Amendment doctrine. Prophylaxis is the antithe-sis of narrow tailoring, as the previously quoted passage
from Button makes clear ("Broad prophylactic rules in thearea of free expression are suspect. . . . Precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touchingour most precious freedoms." 371 U. S., at 438). If the
Court were going to make this concession, it could simplyhave dispensed with its earlier (unpersuasive) attempt to
show that the statute was narrowly tailored. So one canadd to the casualties of our whatever-it-takes proabortion
jurisprudence the First Amendment doctrine of narrow tai-loring and overbreadth. R. I. P.

Before it effectively threw in the towel on the narrow-tailoring point, the Court asserted the importance of taking

5 Of course the Court greatly understates the scope of the prophylaxis,
saying that "the statute's prophylactic aspect is justified by the great difficulty of protecting, say, a pregnant woman from physical harassment
with legal rules that focus exclusively on the individual impact of each
instance of behavior," ante, at 729. But the statute prevents the "physically harassing" act of (shudder!) approaching within closer than eight
feet not only when it is directed against pregnant women, but also (just
to be safe) when it is directed against 300-pound, male, and unpregnant
truck drivers--surely a distinction that is not "difficult to make accurately," ibid.

into account " `the place to which the regulations apply indetermining whether these restrictions burden more speech

than necessary.' " Ante, at 728 (quoting Madsen, supra, at772). A proper regard for the "place" involved in this case
should result in, if anything, a commitment by this Courtto adhere to and rigorously enforce our speech-protective
standards. The public forum involved here--the public
spaces outside of health care facilities--has become, by ne-cessity and by virtue of this Court's decisions, a forum of

last resort for those who oppose abortion. The possibilityof limiting abortion by legislative means--even abortion of
a live-and-kicking child that is almost entirely out of the
womb--has been rendered impossible by our decisions from
Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), to Stenberg v. Carhart,
post, p. 914. For those who share an abiding moral or religious conviction (or, for that matter, simply a biological appreciation) that abortion is the taking of a human life, there
is no option but to persuade women, one by one, not to make
that choice. And as a general matter, the most effective
place, if not the only place, where that persuasion can occur
is outside the entrances to abortion facilities. By upholding
these restrictions on speech in this place the Court ratifies
the State's attempt to make even that task an impossible one.

Those whose concern is for the physical safety and security
of clinic patients, workers, and doctors should take no comfort from today's decision. Individuals or groups intent on
bullying or frightening women out of an abortion, or doctors
out of performing that procedure, will not be deterred by
Colorado's statute; bullhorns and screaming from eight feet
away will serve their purposes well. But those who would
accomplish their moral and religious objectives by peaceful
and civil means, by trying to persuade individual women of
the rightness of their cause, will be deterred; and that is not
a good thing in a democracy. This Court once recognized,
as the Framers surely did, that the freedom to speak and
persuade is inseparable from, and antecedent to, the survival

of self-government. The Court today rotates that essentialsafety valve on our democracy one-half turn to the right, and

no one who seeks safe access to health care facilities in Colo-rado or elsewhere should feel that her security has by this
decision been enhanced.It is interesting to compare the present decision, which
upholds an utterly bizarre proabortion "request to approach" provision of Colorado law, with Stenberg, post, p. 914,also announced today, which

strikes down a live-birth abortion prohibition adopted by 30 States and twice passed byboth Houses of Congress (though vetoed both times by the

President). The present case disregards the State's own assertion of the purpose of its proabortion law, and posits instead a purpose that the Court believes will be more likely to
render the law constitutional. Stenberg rejects the State's
assertion of the very meaning of its antiabortion law, and
declares instead a meaning that will render the law unconstitutional. The present case rejects overbreadth challenges
to a proabortion law that regulates speech, on grounds that
have no support in our prior jurisprudence and that instead
amount to a total repudiation of the doctrine of overbreadth.
Stenberg applies overbreadth analysis to an antiabortion law
that has nothing to do with speech, even though until eight
years ago overbreadth was unquestionably the exclusive preserve of the First Amendment. See Janklow v. Planned
Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic, 517 U. S. 1174, 1177-1181
(1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Ada
v. Guam Soc. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 506 U. S.
1011, 1013 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of
certiorari).

Does the deck seem stacked? You bet. As I have suggested throughout this opinion, today's decision is not an isolated distortion of our traditional constitutional principles,
but is one of many aggressively proabortion novelties announced by the Court in recent years. See, e. g., Madsen v.
Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753 (1994); Schenck

Amendment that have been in dissent since the 1930's sud-denly find themselves in the majority. "Uninhibited, robust,
and wide open" debate is replaced by the power of the Stateto protect an unheard-of "right to be let alone" on the public
streets. I dissent.

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
The Court's holding contradicts more than a half centuryof well-established First Amendment principles. For the

first time, the Court approves a law which bars a privatecitizen from passing a message, in a peaceful manner and on
a profound moral issue, to a fellow citizen on a public side-walk. If from this time forward the Court repeats its grave
errors of analysis, we shall have no longer the proud tradi-tion of free and open discourse in a public forum. In my
view, Justice Scalia's First Amendment analysis is correctand mandates outright reversal. In addition to undermining established First Amendment principles, the Court'sdecision conflicts with the essence of the joint opinion in
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.833 (1992). It seems appropriate in these circumstances to
reinforce Justice Scalia's correct First Amendment conclu-sions and to set forth my own views.

I
The Court uses the framework of Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989), for resolution of the case. TheCourt wields the categories of Ward so that what once were

rules to protect speech now become rules to restrict it.This is twice unfortunate. The rules of Ward are diminished in value for later cases; and the Ward analysis oughtnot have been undertaken at all. To employ

Ward's com530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
766 HILL v. COLORADO

Kennedy, J., dissenting
plete framework is a mistake at the outset, for Ward appliesonly if a statute is content neutral. Colorado's statute is a

textbook example of a law which is content based.

A
The statute makes it a criminal offense to "knowingly ap-proach another person within eight feet of such person, unless such other person consents, for the purpose of passinga leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in
oral protest, education, or counseling with such other personin the public way or sidewalk area within a radius of one
hundred feet from any entrance door to a health care facil-ity." Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(3) (1999). The law imposes content-based restrictions on speech by reason of theterms it uses, the categories it employs, and the conditions
for its enforcement. It is content based, too, by its predict-able and intended operation. Whether particular messages
violate the statute is determined by their substance. Thelaw is a prime example of a statute inviting screening and
censoring of individual speech; and it is serious error tohold otherwise.

The Court errs in asserting the Colorado statute is no dif-ferent from laws sustained as content neutral in earlier
cases. The prohibitions against "picketing" and/or "leaflet-ing" upheld in

Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988), UnitedStates v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171 (1983), and Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972), the Court says, see ante,at 722, and n. 30, are no different from the restrictions on
"protest, education, or counseling" imposed by the Coloradostatute. The parallel the Court sees does not exist. No examination of the content of a speaker's message is requiredto determine whether an individual is picketing, or distributing a leaflet, or impeding free access to a building. Underthe Colorado enactment, however, the State must review
content to determine whether a person has engaged in crimi-nal "protest, education, or counseling." When a citizen

Kennedy, J., dissenting
approaches another on the sidewalk in a disfavored-speechzone, an officer of the State must listen to what the speaker

says. If, in the officer's judgment, the speaker's words straytoo far toward "protest, education, or counseling"--the
boundaries of which are far from clear--the officer may de-cide the speech has moved from the permissible to the criminal. The First Amendment does not give the government
such power.The statute is content based for an additional reason: It

restricts speech on particular topics. Of course, the enact-ment restricts "oral protest, education, or counseling" on any
subject; but a statute of broad application is not content neutral if its terms control the substance of a speaker's message.
If oral protest, education, or counseling on every subject
within an 8-foot zone present a danger to the public, the statute should apply to every building entrance in the State. It
does not. It applies only to a special class of locations: entrances to buildings with health care facilities. We would
close our eyes to reality were we to deny that "oral protest,
education, or counseling" outside the entrances to medical
facilities concern a narrow range of topics--indeed, one topic
in particular. By confining the law's application to the specific locations where the prohibited discourse occurs, the
State has made a content-based determination. The Court
ought to so acknowledge. Clever content-based restrictions
are no less offensive than censoring on the basis of content.
See, e. g., United States v. Eichman, 496 U. S. 310 (1990). If,
just a few decades ago, a State with a history of enforcing
racial discrimination had enacted a statute like this one, regulating "oral protest, education, or counseling" within 100
feet of the entrance to any lunch counter, our predecessors
would not have hesitated to hold it was content based or
viewpoint based. It should be a profound disappointment to
defenders of the First Amendment that the Court today refuses to apply the same structural analysis when the speech
involved is less palatable to it.

768 HILL v. COLORADO

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The Court, in error and irony, validates the Colorado stat-ute because it purports to restrict all of the proscribed

expressive activity regardless of the subject. The even-handedness the Court finds so satisfying, however, is but
a disguise for a glaring First Amendment violation. TheCourt, by citing the breadth of the statute, cannot escape the
conclusion that its categories are nonetheless content based.
The liberty of a society is measured in part by what itscitizens are free to discuss among themselves. Colorado's

scheme of disfavored-speech zones on public streets and side-walks, and the Court's opinion validating them, are antithetical to our entire First Amendment tradition. To say that
one citizen can approach another to ask the time or the
weather forecast or the directions to Main Street but not
to initiate discussion on one of the most basic moral and
political issues in all of contemporary discourse, a question
touching profound ideas in philosophy and theology, is an astonishing view of the First Amendment. For the majority
to examine the statute under rules applicable to contentneutral regulati ons is an affront to First Amendment
teachings.

After the Court errs in finding the statute content neutral,
it compounds the mistake by finding the law viewpoint neutral. Viewpoint-based rules are invidious speech restrictions, yet the Court approves this one. The purpose and
design of the statute--as everyone ought to know and as its
own defenders urge in attempted justification--are to restrict speakers on one side of the debate: those who protest
abortions. The statute applies only to medical facilities, a
convenient yet obvious mask for the legislature's true purpose and for the prohibition's true effect. One need read no
further than the statute's preamble to remove any doubt
about the question. The Colorado Legislature sought to restrict "a person's right to protest or counsel against certain
medical procedures." Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(1) (1999).
The word "against" reveals the legislature's desire to restrict

Kennedy, J., dissenting
discourse on one side of the issue regarding "certain medicalprocedures." The testimony to the Colorado Legislature

consisted, almost in its entirety, of debates and controversieswith respect to abortion, a point the majority acknowledges.
Ante, at 715. The legislature's purpose to restrict unpopu-lar speech should be beyond dispute.

The statute's operation reflects its objective. Under the
most reasonable interpretation of Colorado's law, if a speakerapproaches a fellow citizen within any one of Colorado's thousands of disfavored-speech zones and chants in praise of theSupreme Court and its abortion decisions, I should think
there is neither protest, nor education, nor counseling. If
the opposite message is communicated, however, a prosecution to punish protest is warranted. The antispeech distinction also pertains if a citizen approaches a public official
visiting a health care facility to make a point in favor of abortion rights. If she says, "Good job, Governor," there is no
violation; if she says, "Shame on you, Governor," there is.
Furthermore, if the speaker addresses a woman who is considering an abortion and says, "Please take just a moment to
read these brochures and call our support line to talk with
women who have been in your situation," the speaker would
face criminal penalties for counseling. Yet if the speaker
simply says, "We are for abortion rights," I should think this
is neither education nor counseling. Thus does the Court
today ensure its own decisions can be praised but not condemned. Thus does it restrict speech designed to teach that
the exercise of a constitutional right is not necessarily concomitant with making a sound moral choice. Nothing in our
law or our enviable free speech tradition sustains this selfserving rule. Colorado is now allowed to punish speech because of its content and viewpoint.

The Court time and again has held content-based or
viewpoint-based regulations to be presumptively invalid.

down in Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312 (1998), this prohibition
seeks to eliminate public discourse on an entire subject and
topic. The Court can cite not a single case where we sustained a law aimed at a broad class of topics on grounds
that it is both content and viewpoint neutral. Cf. McIntyre
v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, supra, at 345 ("[E]ven though
this provision applies evenhandedly to advocates of differing viewpoints, it is a direct regulation of the content of

its burden of proving that its statute is content and viewpoint neutral. See United States v. Playboy Entertainment
Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 816 (2000) ("When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of

time, place, and manner analysis is simply inapplicable to this
law. I would hold the statute invalid from the very start.

In a further glaring departure from precedent we learntoday that citizens have a right to avoid unpopular speech

in a public forum. Ante, at 716-717. For reasons JusticeS

calia explains in convincing fashion, neither Justice Bran-deis' dissenting opinion in Olmstead v. United States, 277

U. S. 438, 478 (1928), nor the Court's opinion in AmericanSteel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257
U. S. 184 (1921), establishes a right to be free from unwel-come expression aired by a fellow citizen in a traditional public forum: "The Fourteenth Amendment does not permit aState to make criminal the peaceful expression of unpopular
views." Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U. S. 229, 237(1963).

The Court's reliance on Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397U. S. 728 (1970), and

Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205(1975), is inapt. Rowan involved a federal statute allowing

individuals to remove their names from commercial mailinglists. Businesses contended the statute infringed upon their
First Amendment right to communicate with private citi-zens. The Court rejected the challenge, reasoning that the
First Amendment affords individuals some control overwhat, and how often, unwelcome commercial messages enter
their private residences. 397 U. S., at 736, 738. Rowan didnot hold, contrary to statements in today's opinion, see

ante,at 718, that the First Amendment permits the government

to restrict private speech in a public forum. Indeed, theCourt in Rowan recognized what everyone, before today, understood to be true: "[W]e are often `captives' outside thesanctuary of the home and subject to objectionable speech
and other sound . . . ." 397 U.

broad and too narrow to serve the interests asserted by themunicipality. 422 U. S., at 211-215. The law, moreover,

was not analogous to the rare, "selective restrictions" onspeech previously upheld to protect individual privacy. Id.,
at 208-209 (citing and discussing Rowan, supra, and Lehmanv. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 (1974)). The Court did not,
contrary to the majority's assertions, suggest that govern-ment is free to enact categorical measures restricting traditional, peaceful communications among citizens in a publicforum. Instead, the Court admonished that citizens usually
bear the burden of disregarding unwelcome messages. 422U. S., at 211 (citing

Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21(1971)).

Today's decision is an unprecedented departure from thisCourt's teachings respecting unpopular speech in public fora.

II
The Colorado statute offends settled First Amendmentprinciples in another fundamental respect. It violates the

constitutional prohibitions against vague or overly broadcriminal statutes regulating speech. The enactment's fatal
ambiguities are multiple and interact to create further im-precisions. The result is a law more vague and overly broad
than any criminal statute the Court has sustained as a per-missible regulation of speech. The statute's imprecisions
are so evident that this, too, ought to have ended the casewithout further discussion.

The law makes it a criminal offense to "knowingly ap-proach another person within eight feet of such person, unless such other person consents, for the purpose of passing aleaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral
protest, education, or counseling with such other person inthe public way or sidewalk area within a radius of one hundred feet from any entrance door to a health care facility."Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(3) (1999). The operative terms

to us from the state court system; and as the Colorado courtsdid not give the statute a sufficient narrowing construction,

questions of vagueness and overbreadth should be addressedby this Court in the first instance. See

Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 613-614 (1971).In the context of a law imposing criminal penalties for

pure speech, "protest" is an imprecise word; "counseling" is
an imprecise word; "education" is an imprecise word. Nocustom, tradition, or legal authority gives these terms the

specificity required to sustain a criminal prohibition onspeech. I simply disagree with the majority's estimation
that it is "quite remote" that "anyone would not understand
any of those common words." Ante, at 732. The criminal
statute is subject to manipulation by police, prosecutors, and
juries. Its substantial imprecisions will chill speech, so the
statute violates the First Amendment. Cf. Kolender v.
Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 358, 360 (1983); Herndon v. Lowry,
301 U. S. 242, 263-264 (1937).

In operation the statute's inevitable arbitrary effects
create vagueness problems of their own. The 8-foot noapproach zone is so unworkable it will chill speech. Assume
persons are about to enter a building from different points
and a protester is walking back and forth with a sign or
attempting to hand out leaflets. If she stops to create the
8-foot zone for one pedestrian, she cannot reach other persons with her message; yet if she moves to maintain the 8-
foot zone while trying to talk to one patron she may move
knowingly closer to a patron attempting to enter the facility
from a different direction. In addition, the statute requires
a citizen to give affirmative consent before the exhibitor of
a sign or the bearer of a leaflet can approach. When dealing
with strangers walking fast toward a building's entrance,
there is a middle ground of ambiguous answers and mixed
signals in which misinterpretation can subject a good-faith
speaker to criminal liability. The mere failure to give a reaction, for instance, is a failure to give consent. These ele530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ments of ambiguity compound the others. Finally, as we all
know, the identity or enterprise of the occupants of a building which fronts on a public street is not always known to
the public. Health care providers may occupy but a single
office in a large building. The Colorado citizen may walk
from a disfavored-speech zone to a free zone with little or no
ability to discern when one ends and the other begins. The
statute's vagueness thus becomes as well one source of its
overbreadth. The only sure way to avoid violating the law
is to refrain from picketing, leafletting, or oral advocacy altogether. Scienter cannot save so vague a statute as this.

A statute is vague when the conduct it forbids is not ascertainable. See Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 56 (1999).
"[People] of common intelligence cannot be required to guess
at the meaning of the enactment." Winters v. New York,
333 U. S. 507, 515 (1948). The terms "oral protest, education, or counseling" are at least as imprecise as criminal prohibitions on speech the Court has declared void for vagueness in past decades. In Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611
(1971), the Court encountered little difficulty in striking
down a municipal ordinance making it a criminal offense for
"three or more persons to assemble . . . on any of the
sidewalks . . . and there conduct themselves in a manner
annoying to persons passing by . . . ." Ibid. The Court
held the ordinance to be unconstitutionally vague because
"it subject[ed] the exercise of the right of assembly to an
unascertainable standard, and [was] unconstitutionally broad
because it authorize[d] the punishment of constitutionally
protected conduct." Id., at 614. Vagueness led to overbreadth as well in Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S. 451 (1987),
where the Court invalidated an ordinance making it " `unlawful for any person to . . . in any manner oppose . . . or
interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty.' "
Id., at 455. The "sweeping" restriction, the Court reasoned, placed citizens at risk of arrest for exercising their

Kennedy, J., dissenting
"freedom . . . to oppose or challenge police action," a right
"by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state."
Id., at 462-463.

The requirement of specificity for statutes that impose
criminal sanctions on public expression was established well
before Coates and Hill, of course. In Carlson v. California,
310 U. S. 106 (1940), a unanimous Court invalidated an ordinance prohibiting individuals from carrying or displaying
any sign or banner or from picketing near a place of business
"for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to
induce or influence, any person to refrain from entering any
such works, or factory, or place of business, or employment."
Id., at 109. The statute employed imprecise language, providing citizens with no guidance as to whether particular expressive activities fell within its reach. The Court found
that the "sweeping and inexact terms of the ordinance disclose the threat to freedom of speech inherent in its existence," a result at odds with the guarantees of the First
Amendment. Id., at 112.

Rather than adhere to this rule, the Court turns it on its
head, stating the statute's overbreadth is "a virtue, not a
vice." Ante, at 731. The Court goes even further, praising
the statute's "prophylactic approach; it forbids all unwelcome
demonstrators to come closer than eight feet." Ante, at 729.
Indeed, in the Court's view, "bright-line prophylactic rule[s]
may be the best way to provide protection" to those individuals unwilling to hear a fellow citizen's message in a public
forum. Ibid. The Court is quite wrong. Overbreadth is a
constitutional flaw, not a saving feature. Sweeping within
its ambit even more protected speech does not save a criminal statute invalid in its essential reach and design. The
Court, moreover, cannot meet the concern that the statute
is vague; for neither the Colorado courts nor established
legal principles offer satisfactory guidance in interpreting
the statute's imprecisions.

776 HILL v. COLORADO

Kennedy, J., dissenting

III
Even aside from the erroneous, most disturbing assumptions that the statute is content neutral, viewpoint neutral,
and neither vague nor overbroad, the Court falls into further
serious error when it turns to the time, place, and manner
rules set forth in Ward.

An essential requirement under Ward is that the regulation in question not "burden substantially more speech than
is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests." 491 U. S., at 799. As we have seen, however, Colorado and the Court attempt to justify the law on just the
opposite assumption.

I have explained already how the statute is a failed attempt to make the enactment appear content neutral, a disguise for the real concern of the legislation. The legislature
may as well have enacted a statute subjecting "oral protest,
education, or counseling near abortion clinics" to criminal
penalty. Both the State and the Court attempt to sidestep
the enactment's obvious content-based restriction by praising the statute's breadth, by telling us all topics of conversation, not just discourse on abortion, are banned within the
statutory proscription. The saving feature the Court tries
to grasp simply creates additional free speech infirmity.
Our precedents do not permit content censoring to be cured
by taking even more protected speech within a statute's
reach. The statute before us, as construed by the majority,
would do just that. If it indeed proscribes "oral protest,
education, or counseling" on all subjects across the board, it
by definition becomes "substantially broader than necessary
to achieve the government's interest." Id., at 800.

The whimsical, arbitrary nature of the statute's operation
is further demonstration of a restriction upon more speech
than necessary. The happenstance of a dental office being
located in a building brings the restricted-speech zone into
play. If the same building also houses an organization dedi530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

777Cite as: 530 U. S. 703 (2000)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
cated, say, to environmental issues, a protest against thegroup's policies would be barred. Yet if, on the next block

there were a public interest enterprise in a building with nohealth care facility, the speech would be unrestricted. The
statute is a classic example of a proscription not narrowlytailored and resulting in restrictions of far more speech than
necessary to achieve the legislature's object. The first time,
place, and manner requirement of Ward cannot be satisfied.Assuming Colorado enacted the statute to respond to incidents of disorderly and unlawful conduct near abortion clin-ics, there were alternatives to restricting speech. It is beyond dispute that pinching or shoving or hitting is a battery
actionable under the criminal law and punishable as a crime.
State courts have also found an actionable tort when there is
a touching, done in an offensive manner, of an object closely
identified with the body, even if it is not clothing or the body
itself. See, e. g., Fisher v. Carrousel Motor Hotel, Inc., 424
S. W. 2d 627, 630 (Tex. 1967) ("Personal indignity is the essence of an action for battery; and consequently the defendant is liable not only for contacts which do actual physical
harm, but also for those which are offensive and insulting"
(citing Prosser, Insult & Outrage, 44 Calif. L. Rev. 40 (1956))).
The very statute before us, in its other parts, includes a provision aimed at ensuring access to health care facilities.
The law imposes criminal sanctions upon any person who
"knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, impedes, or blocks
another person's entry to or exit from a health care facility."
Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-9-122(2) (1999). With these means
available to ensure access, the statute's overreaching in the
regulation of speech becomes again apparent.

The majority insists the statute aims to protect distraught
women who are embarrassed, vexed, or harassed as they attempt to enter abortion clinics. If these are punishable acts,
they should be prohibited in those terms. In the course of
praising Colorado's approach, the majority does not pause to
tell us why, in its view, substantially less restrictive means

778 HILL v. COLORADO

Kennedy, J., dissenting
cannot be employed to ensure citizens access to health carefacilities or to prevent physical contact between citizens.

The Court's approach is at odds with the rigor demanded by
Ward. See 491 U. S., at 799 ("Government may not regulate
expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of theburden on speech does not serve to advance its goals").

There are further errors in the Court's novel, prophylactic
analysis. The prophylactic theory seems to be based on asupposition that most citizens approaching a health care facility are unwilling to listen to a fellow citizen's message andthat face-to-face communications will lead to lawless behavior within the power of the State to punish. These premises
have no support in law or in fact. And even when there is
authority to adopt preventive measures, of course, the First
Amendment does not allow a speech prohibition in an imprecise or overly broad statute. Cf. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310
U. S. 88, 105 (1940) ("The power and the duty of the State to
take adequate steps to preserve the peace and to protect the
privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be
doubted. But no clear and present danger of destruction of
life or property, or invasion of the right of privacy, or breach
of the peace can be thought to be inherent in the activities
of every person who approaches the premises of an employer
and publicizes the facts of a labor dispute involving the latter"). The Court places our free speech traditions in grave
jeopardy by licensing legislatures to adopt "bright-line prophylactic rule[s] . . . to provide protection" to unwilling
listeners in a quintessential public forum. Ante, at 729.

The Court's lack of concern with the statute's flaws is explained in part by its disregard of the importance of free
discourse and the exchange of ideas in a traditional public
forum. Our precedents have considered the level of protection afforded speech in specific locations, but the rules formulated in those decisions are not followed today. "To
ascertain what limits, if any, may be placed on protected
speech," our precedents instruct "we have often focused on

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the `place' of that speech, considering the nature of the forumthe speaker seeks to employ. . . . [T]he standards by which

limitations on speech must be evaluated `differ depending onthe character of the property at issue.' "

Frisby v. Schultz,
487 U. S., at 479 (quoting Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local
Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 44 (1983)). The quoted language was part of our holding in an important free speech
case; and it is a holding the majority disregards.

Frisby upheld a municipal ordinance restricting targeted
picketing in residential areas. The primary purpose of theordinance, and a reason the Court sustained it, was to protect and preserve the tranquility of private homes. The private location at which respondents sought to engage in their
expressive activities was stressed throughout the Court's
opinion. See 487 U. S., at 483 ("[W]e construe the ban to be
a limited one; only focused picketing taking place solely in
front of a particular residence is prohibited"). "Although in
many locations," the Court reasoned, "we expect individuals
simply to avoid speech they do not want to hear, the home
is different. `That we are often "captives" outside the sanctuary of the home and subject to objectionable speech . . .
does not mean we must be captives everywhere.' " Id., at
484 (quoting Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S., at 738).

The Colorado law does not seek to protect private residences. Nor does the enactment impose a place restriction
upon expressive activity undertaken on property, such as
fairgrounds, designated for limited, special purposes. See,
e. g., Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 655 (1981). The statute applies to
public streets and sidewalks, traditional public fora which
" `time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,
communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing
public questions.' " See Boos, 485 U. S., at 318 (quoting
Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S.
496, 515 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.)). Given our traditions
with respect to open discussion in public fora, this statute,

Kennedy, J., dissenting
which sweeps so largely on First Amendment freedoms, can-not be sustained.

The statute fails a further test under Ward, for it does not" `leave open ample alternative channels for communication
of the information.' " 491 U. S., at 791 (quoting Clark v.
Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293
(1984)). Frisby again instructs us. A second reason we
sustained the ordinance banning targeted residential picket-ing was because "ample alternativ[e]" avenues for communication remained open:

" `Protestors have not been barred from the residentialneighborhoods. They may enter such neighborhoods,

alone or in groups, even marching. . . . They may go
door-to-door to proselytize their views. They may dis-tribute literature in this manner . . . or through the

mails. They may contact residents by telephone, shortof harassment.' " 487 U. S., at 483-484 (quoting Brief
for Appellants in No. 87-168, O. T. 1987, pp. 41-42).
The residential picketing ordinance, the Court concluded,"permit[ted] the more general dissemination of a message"

to the targeted audience. 487 U. S., at 483.

The same conclusion cannot be reached here. Door-to-door distributions or mass mailing or telephone campaigns

are not effective alternative avenues of communication forpetitioners. They want to engage in peaceful face-to-face
communication with individuals the petitioners believe areabout to commit a profound moral wrong. Without the ability to interact in person, however momentarily, with a clinicpatron near the very place where a woman might elect to
receive an abortion, the statute strips petitioners of using
speech in the time, place, and manner most vital to the protected expression.

In addition to leaving petitioners without adequate means
of communication, the law forecloses peaceful leafletting, a
mode of speech with deep roots in our Nation's history and

530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
traditions. In an age when vast resources and talents arecommanded by a sophisticated media to shape opinions on

limitless subjects and ideas, the distribution of leaflets on asidewalk may seem a bit antiquated. This case proves the
necessity for the traditional mode of speech. It must be re-membered that the whole course of our free speech jurisprudence, sustaining the idea of open public discourse which is
the hallmark of the American constitutional system, rests toa significant extent on cases involving picketing and leafletting. Our foundational First Amendment cases are basedon the recognition that citizens, subject to rare exceptions,
must be able to discuss issues, great or small, through the
means of expression they deem best suited to their purpose.
It is for the speaker, not the government, to choose the best
means of expressing a message. "The First Amendment,"
our cases illustrate, "protects [citizens'] right not only to advocate their cause but also to select what they believe to be
the most effective means for so doing." Meyer v. Grant, 486
U. S. 414, 424 (1988). The Court's conclusion that Colorado's
8-foot no-approach zone protects citizens' ability to leaflet or
otherwise engage in peaceful protest is untenable.

Given the Court's holding, it is necessary to recall our
cases protecting the right to protest and hand out leaflets.
In Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938), the Court
invalidated an ordinance forbidding the distribution of literature of any kind without the written permission of a city
official. "The liberty of the press," the Court explained, "is
not confined to newspapers and periodicals." Id., at 452.
"It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. These indeed have been historic weapons in the defense of liberty, as
the pamphlets of Thomas Paine and others in our own history abundantly attest. The press in its historic connotation
comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion." Ibid.

In Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147
(1939), reinforcing Lovell, the Court struck down a series of

530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
782 HILL v. COLORADO

Kennedy, J., dissenting
municipal ordinances prohibiting the distribution of handbillson public streets on the rationale of preventing littering.

Schneider made clear that while citizens may not enjoy aright to force an unwilling person to accept a leaflet, they do
have a protected right to tender it. The Court stressed abasic First Amendment precept: "[T]he streets are natural
and proper places for the dissemination of information andopinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of
expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that itmay be exercised in some other place." 308 U. S., at 163.
The words of the Court more than a half century ago demon-strate the necessity to adhere to those principles today:

"Municipal authorities, as trustees for the public, havethe duty to keep their communities' streets open and
available for movement of people and property, the pri-mary purpose to which the streets are dedicated. So
long as legislation to this end does not abridge the con-stitutional liberty of one rightfully upon the street to
impart information through speech or the distribution ofliterature, it may lawfully regulate the conduct of those
using the streets. For example, a person could not ex-ercise this liberty by taking his stand in the middle of
a crowded street, contrary to traffic regulations, andmaintain his position to the stoppage of all traffic; a
group of distributors could not insist upon a constitu-tional right to form a cordon across the street and to
allow no pedestrian to pass who did not accept a ten-dered leaflet; nor does the guarantee of freedom of
speech or of the press deprive a municipality of powerto enact regulations against throwing literature broadcast in the streets. Prohibition of such conduct wouldnot abridge the constitutional liberty since such activity
bears no necessary relationship to the freedom to speak,write, print or distribute information or opinion.

"This court has characterized the freedom of speechand that of the press as fundamental personal rights and

530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
liberties. The phrase is not an empty one and was notlightly used. It reflects the belief of the framers of the

Constitution that exercise of the rights lies at the foun-dation of free government by free men. It stresses, as
do many opinions of this court, the importance of pre-venting the restriction of enjoyment of these liberties.

"In every case, therefore, where legislative abridgment of the rights is asserted, the courts should be as-tute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation.

Mere legislative preferences or beliefs respecting mat-ters of public convenience may well support regulation
directed at other personal activities, but be insufficientto justify such as diminishes the exercise of rights so
vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions.And so, as cases arise, the delicate and difficult task falls
upon the courts to weigh the circumstances and to ap-praise the substantiality of the reasons advanced in support of the regulation of the free enjoyment of therights."

Id., at 160-161 (footnote omitted).

After Lovell and Schneider the Court gave continued, ex-plicit definition to our custom and practice of free and open

discourse by picketing and leafletting. In Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88 (1940), the Court considered a First
Amendment challenge to a statute prohibiting " `[l]oiteringor picketing' " near " `the premises or place of business of

any . . . firm, corporation, or association of people, engagedin a lawful business.' "

Id., at 91. Petitioner was arrested,
charged, and convicted of violating the statute by engaging
in peaceful picketing in front of a manufacturing plant. Id.,
at 94-95. The Court invalidated the Alabama statute. The
breadth of Alabama's speech restriction was one reason for
ruling it invalid on its face, just as it should be for the statute
we consider today:

"[Alabama Code $ ] 3448 has been applied by the state
courts so as to prohibit a single individual from walking

Kennedy, J., dissenting
slowly and peacefully back and forth on the public side-walk in front of the premises of an employer, without

speaking to anyone, carrying a sign or placard on a staffabove his head stating only the fact that the employer
did not employ union men affiliated with the AmericanFederation of Labor; the purpose of the described activity was concededly to advise customers and prospective
customers of the relationship existing between the em-ployer and its employees and thereby to induce such customers not to patronize the employer." Id., at 98-99(footnote omitted).

The statute, in short, prohibited "whatever the means used
to publicize the facts of a labor dispute, whether by printedsign, by pamphlet, by word of mouth or otherwise . . . so

long as it occurs in the vicinity of the scene of the dispute."
Id., at 101.The Court followed these observations with an explication

of fundamental free speech principles I would have thoughtcontrolling in the present case:

"It does not follow that the State in dealing with the
evils arising from industrial disputes may impair the effective exercise of the right to discuss freely industrialrelations which are matters of public concern. A contrary conclusion could be used to support abridgment offreedom of speech and of the press concerning almost
every matter of importance to society."The range of activities proscribed by $ 3448, whether
characterized as picketing or loitering or otherwise,embraces nearly every practicable, effective means
whereby those interested--including the employees directly affected--may enlighten the public on the nature
and causes of a labor dispute. The safeguarding of
these means is essential to the securing of an informed
and educated public opinion with respect to a matter
which is of public concern. It may be that effective ex530US2 Unit: $U83 [11-21-01 16:28:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ercise of the means of advancing public knowledge maypersuade some of those reached to refrain from entering

into advantageous relations with the business establish-ment which is the scene of the dispute. Every expression of opinion on matters that are important has thepotentiality of inducing action in the interests of one
rather than another group in society. But the group in
power at any moment may not impose penal sanctionson peaceful and truthful discussion of matters of public

interest merely on a showing that others may therebybe persuaded to take action inconsistent with its interests." Id., at 104.
Carlson v. California, 310 U. S. 106 (1940), is in accord.In the course of reversing Carlson's conviction for engaging

in a peaceful protest near a construction project in Shasta
County, California, the Court declared that a citizen's rightto "publiciz[e] the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way

through appropriate means, whether by pamphlet, by wordof mouth or by banner, must now be regarded as within that
liberty of communication which is secured to every person by[the First Amendment through] the Fourteenth Amendment
against abridgment by a State." Id., at 113.The principles explained in

Thornhill and Carlson were
reaffirmed a few years later in the context of speech on reli-gious matters when an individual sought to advertise a meeting of the Jehovah's Witnesses by engaging in a door-to-doordistribution of leaflets.

Martin v. City of Struthers, 319
U. S. 141 (1943). The petitioner was convicted under a city
ordinance which prohibited individuals from "distributing
handbills, circulars or other advertisements" to private residences. Id., at 142. The Court invalidated the ordinance,
reinforcing the vital idea today's Court ignores:

"While door to door distributers of literature may be
either a nuisance or a blind for criminal activities, they
may also be useful members of society engaged in the

786 HILL v. COLORADO

Kennedy, J., dissenting
dissemination of ideas in accordance with the best tra-dition of free discussion. The widespread use of this

method of communication by many groups espousingvarious causes attests its major importance. `Pamphlets have proved most effective instruments in thedissemination of opinion. And perhaps the most effective way of bringing them to the notice of individuals istheir distribution at the homes of the people.' "

Id., at145 (quoting Schneider, 308 U. S., at 164).

The Court's more recent precedents honor the same princi-ples: Government cannot foreclose a traditional medium of
expression. In City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43 (1994),we considered a challenge to a municipal ordinance prohibiting, inter alia, "such absolutely pivotal speech as [the displayof] a sign protesting an imminent governmental decision to
go to war." Id., at 54. Respondent had placed a sign in awindow of her home calling "For Peace in the Gulf." Id.,
at 46. We invalidated the ordinance, finding that the localgovernment "ha[d] almost completely foreclosed a venerable
means of communication that is both unique and important."Id., at 54. The opinion, which drew upon Lovell, Martin,
and Schneider, was also careful to note the importance of therestriction on place imposed by the ordinance in question:
"Displaying a sign from one's own residence often carries amessage quite distinct from placing the same sign someplace
else, or conveying the same text or picture by other means."512 U. S., at 56. So, too, did we stress the importance of
preserving the means citizens use to express messages bear-ing on important public debates. See

id., at 57 ("Residentialsigns are an unusually cheap and convenient form of communication[,] [e]specially for persons of modest means or lim-ited mobility . . .").

A year later in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514U. S. 334 (1995), we once more confirmed the privileged status peaceful leafletting enjoys in our free speech tradition.Ohio prohibited anonymous leafletting in connection with

election campaigns. Invalidating the law, we observed asfollows: " `Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and

even books have played an important role in the progress ofmankind.' "

Id., at 341 (quoting Talley v. California, 362
U. S. 60, 64 (1960)). We rejected the State's claim that therestriction was needed to prevent fraud and libel in its election processes. Ohio had other laws in place to achieve
these objectives. 514 U. S., at 350. The case, we concluded,rested upon fundamental free speech principles:

"Indeed, the speech in which Mrs. McIntyre engaged--
handing out leaflets in the advocacy of a politically con-troversial viewpoint--is the essence of First Amendment expression. That this advocacy occurred in the
heat of a controversial referendum vote only strength-ens the protection afforded to Mrs. McIntyre's expression: Urgent, important, and effective speech can be noless protected than impotent speech, lest the right to
speak be relegated to those instances when it is leastneeded. No form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than Mrs. McIntyre's." Id., at 347(citations omitted).

Petitioners commenced the present suit to challenge astatute preventing them from expressing their views on
abortion through the same peaceful and vital methods ap-proved in

Lovell, Schneider, Thornhill, Carlson, and McIntyre. Laws punishing speech which protests the lawfulnessor morality of the government's own policy are the essence

of the tyrannical power the First Amendment guardsagainst. We must remember that, by decree of this Court
in discharging our duty to interpret the Constitution, any
plea to the government to outlaw some abortions will be to
no effect. See Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Absent the ability to ask the
government to intervene, citizens who oppose abortion must
seek to convince their fellow citizens of the moral imperative

of their cause. In a free society protest serves to produce
stability, not to undermine it. "The right to speak freely
and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is therefore
one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes." Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949).
As Justice Brandeis observed: "[The Framers] recognized
the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But
they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear
of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to
discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds
repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces
stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed
remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is
good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied
through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by
law--the argument of force in its worst form." Whitney
v California, 274 U. S. 357, 375-376 (1927) (concurring
opinion).

The means of expression at stake here are of controlling importance. Citizens desiring to impart messages to
women considering abortions likely do not have resources
to use the mainstream media for their message, much less
resources to locate women contemplating the option of abortion. Lacking the aid of the government or the media, they
seek to resort to the time honored method of leafletting and
the display of signs. Nowhere is the speech more important
than at the time and place where the act is about to occur.
As the named plaintiff, Leila Jeanne Hill, explained, "I engage in a variety of activities designed to impart information
to abortion-bound women and their friends and families. . . ."

seen a number of [these] women change their minds about
aborting their unborn children as a result of my sidewalk

When a person is walking at a hurried pace to enter a
building, a solicitor who must stand still eight feet away cannot know whether the person can be persuaded to accept the
leaflet or not. Merely viewing a picture or brief message on
the outside of the leaflet might be critical in the choice to
receive it. To solicit by pamphlet is to tender it to the person. The statute ignores this fact. What the statute restricts is one person trying to communicate to another, which
ought to be the heart of civilized discourse.

Colorado's excuse, and the Court's excuse, for the serious
burden imposed upon the right to leaflet or to discuss is that
it occurs at the wrong place. Again, Colorado and the Court
have it just backwards. For these protesters the 100-foot
zone in which young women enter a building is not just the
last place where the message can be communicated. It
likely is the only place. It is the location where the Court
should expend its utmost effort to vindicate free speech, not
to burden or suppress it.

Perhaps the leaflet will contain a picture of an unborn
child, a picture the speaker thinks vital to the message.
One of the arguments by the proponents of abortion, I had
thought, was that a young woman might have been so uninformed that she did not know how to avoid pregnancy. The
speakers in this case seek to ask the same uninformed
woman, or indeed any woman who is considering an abortion,
to understand and to contemplate the nature of the life she
carries within her. To restrict the right of the speaker to
hand her a leaflet, to hold a sign, or to speak quietly is for
the Court to deny the neutrality that must be the first principle of the First Amendment. In this respect I am in full
agreement with Justice Scalia's explanation of the insult
the Court gives when it tells us these grave moral matters
can be discussed just as well through a bullhorn. It would
be remiss, moreover, not to observe the profound difference
a leaflet can have in a woman's decisionmaking process.

790 HILL v. COLORADO

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Consider the account of one young woman who testified be-fore the Colorado Senate:

"Abortion is a major decision. Unfortunately, mostwomen have to make this decision alone. I did and I
know that I'm not the only one. As soon as I said theword `pregnant,' he was history, never to be heard of,
from again. I was scared and all alone. I was too em-barrassed to ask for help. If this law had been in effect
then, I would not have got any information at all andgone through with my abortion because the only people
that were on my side were the people at the abortionclinic. They knew exactly how I was feeling and what
to say to make it all better. In my heart, I knew abortion was wrong, but it didn't matter. I had never takenresponsibility for my actions so why start then. One of

the major reasons I did not go through with my sched-uled abortion was a picture I was given while I was
pregnant. This was the first time I had ever seen theother side of the story. I think I speak for a lot of
women, myself included, when I say abortion is the onlyway out because of

[sic] it's all I knew. In Sex Education, I was not taught about adoption or the fetus oranything like that. All I learned about was venereal

diseases and abortion. The people supplying the pamphlet helped me make my choice. I got an informeddecision, I got information from both sides, and I made

an informed decision that my son and I could both livewith. Because of this picture I was given, right there,
this little boy got a chance at life that he would never
have had." Id., at 167-168.

There are, no doubt, women who would testify that abortion
was necessary and unregretted. The point here is simply
that speech makes a difference, as it must when acts of lasting significance and profound moral consequence are being
contemplated. The majority reaches a contrary conclusion

only by disregarding settled free speech principles. In
doing so it delivers a grave wound to the First Amendment
as well as to the essential reasoning in the joint opinion in
Casey, a concern to which I now turn.

IV
In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, the
Court reaffirmed its prior holding that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early
stages. The majority opinion in Casey considered the woman's liberty interest and principles of stare decisis, but took
care to recognize the gravity of the personal decision:
"[Abortion] is an act fraught with consequences for others:
for the woman who must live with the implications of her
decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse, family, and society which must confront
the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some
deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent
human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or
potential life that is aborted." 505 U. S., at 852.

The Court now strikes at the heart of the reasoned, careful
balance I had believed was the basis for the opinion in Casey.
The vital principle of the opinion was that in defined instances the woman's decision whether to abort her child was
in its essence a moral one, a choice the State could not dictate. Foreclosed from using the machinery of government
to ban abortions in early term, those who oppose it are remitted to debate the issue in its moral dimensions. In a
cruel way, the Court today turns its back on that balance.
It in effect tells us the moral debate is not so important after
all and can be conducted just as well through a bullhorn from
an 8-foot distance as it can through a peaceful, face-to-face
exchange of a leaflet. The lack of care with which the Court
sustains the Colorado statute reflects a most troubling abdication of our responsibility to enforce the First Amendment.

There runs through our First Amendment theory a con-cept of immediacy, the idea that thoughts and pleas and petitions must not be lost with the passage of time. In a fleetingexistence we have but little time to find truth through discourse. No better illustration of the immediacy of speech,of the urgency of persuasion, of the preciousness of time, is
presented than in this case. Here the citizens who claimFirst Amendment protection seek it for speech which, if it is
to be effective, must take place at the very time and place agrievous moral wrong, in their view, is about to occur. The
Court tears away from the protesters the guarantees of theFirst Amendment when they most need it. So committed is
the Court to its course that it denies these protesters, in theface of what they consider to be one of life's gravest moral
crises, even the opportunity to try to offer a fellow citizen alittle pamphlet, a handheld paper seeking to reach a higher
law.I dissent.

MITCHELL et al. v. HELMS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 98-1648. Argued December 1, 1999--Decided June 28, 2000
Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981

channels federal funds via state educational agencies (SEA's) to local
educational agencies (LEA's), which in turn lend educational materials
and equipment, such as library and media materials and computer software and hardware, to public and private elementary and secondary
schools to implement "secular, neutral, and nonideological" programs.
The enrollment of each participating school determines the amount of
Chapter 2 aid that it receives. In an average year, about 30% of Chapter 2 funds spent in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, are allocated for private
schools, most of which are Catholic or otherwise religiously affiliated.
Respondents filed suit alleging, among other things, that Chapter 2, as
applied in the parish, violated the First Amendment's Establishment
Clause. Agreeing, the Chief Judge of the District Court held, under
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613, that Chapter 2 had the
primary effect of advancing religion because the materials and equipment loaned to the Catholic schools were direct aid and the schools were
pervasively sectarian. He relied primarily on Meek v. Pittenger, 421
U. S. 349, and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, in which programs providing many of the same sorts of materials and equipment as does Chapter 2 were struck down, even though programs providing for the loan
of public school textbooks to religious schools were upheld. After the
judge issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian
schools in the parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment, he retired. Another judge then reversed that order, upholding
Chapter 2 under, inter alia, Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,
509 U. S. 1, in which a public school district was allowed to provide a
sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school as
part of a federal program for the disabled. While respondents' appeal
was pending, this Court decided Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203,
approving a program under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965 that provided public employees to teach remedial
classes at religious and other private schools. Concluding that Agostini had neither directly overruled Meek and Wolman nor rejected their
distinction between textbooks and other in-kind aid, the Fifth Circuit
relied on those two cases to invalidate Chapter 2.

794 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Syllabus
Held: The judgment is reversed.
151 F. 3d 347, reversed.

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Kennedy, concluded that Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, is not a law respecting an establishment of religion simply
because many of the private schools receiving Chapter 2 aid in the parish are religiously affiliated. Pp. 807-836.

(a) In modifying the Lemon test--which asked whether a statute (1)
has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting
religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government
and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613--Agostini examined only the first
and second of those factors, see 521 U. S., at 222-223, recasting the entanglement inquiry as simply one criterion relevant to determining a
statute's effect, id., at 232-233. The Court also acknowledged that its
cases had pared somewhat the factors that could justify a finding of
excessive entanglement. Id., at 233-234. It then set out three primary criteria for determining a statute's effect: Government aid has the
effect of advancing religion if it (1) results in governmental indoctrination, (2) defines its recipients by reference to religion, or (3) creates an
excessive entanglement. Ibid. In this case, the inquiry under Agostini's purpose and effect test is a narrow one. Because the District
Court's holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose is not challenged,
only Chapter 2's effect need be considered. Further, in determining
that effect, only the first two Agostini criteria need be considered, because the District Court's holding that Chapter 2 does not create an
excessive entanglement is not challenged. Pp. 807-808.

(b) Whether governmental aid to religious schools results in religious
indoctrination ultimately depends on whether any indoctrination that
occurs could reasonably be attributed to governmental action. See,
e. g., Agostini, 521 U. S., at 226. Moreover, the answer to the indoctrination question will resolve the question whether an educational aid
program "subsidizes" religion. See id., at 230-231. In distinguishing
between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, the Court has consistently turned to the neutrality principle, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons
without regard to their religion. As a way of assuring neutrality, the
Court has repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid to a
religious institution results from the genuinely independent and private
choices of individual parents, e. g., id., at 226. Agostini's second primary criterion--whether an aid program defines its recipients by reference to religion, id., at 234--is closely related to the first. It looks to
the same facts as the neutrality inquiry, see id., at 225-226, but uses

795Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
Syllabus
those facts to answer a somewhat different question--whether the criteria for allocating the aid create a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination, id., at 231. Such an incentive is not present where
the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither
favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and
secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis. Ibid. Pp. 809-814.

(c) Two rules offered by respondents to govern the determination
whether Chapter 2 has the effect of advancing religion are rejected.
Pp. 814-825.

(i) Respondents' chief argument--that direct, nonincidental aid to
religious schools is always impermissible--is inconsistent with this
Court's more recent cases. The purpose of the direct/indirect distinction is to prevent "subsidization" of religion, and the Court's more recent
cases address this concern through the principle of private choice, as
incorporated in the first Agostini criterion (i. e., whether any indoctrination could be attributed to the government). If aid to schools, even
"direct aid," is neutrally available and, before reaching or benefiting any
religious school, first passes through the hands (literally or figuratively)
of numerous private citizens who are free to direct the aid elsewhere,
the government has not provided any "support of religion." Witters v.
Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 489. Although the
presence of private choice is easier to see when aid literally passes
through individuals' hands, there is no reason why the Establishment
Clause requires such a form. Indeed, Agostini expressly rejected respondents' absolute line. 521 U. S., at 225. To the extent respondents
intend their direct/indirect distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in schoolchildren's hands rather than given directly to their
schools, Meek and Wolman, the cases on which they rely, demonstrate
the irrelevance of such formalism. Further, respondents' formalistic
line breaks down in the application to real-world programs. Whether
a program is labeled "direct" or "indirect" is a rather arbitrary choice
that does not further the constitutional analysis. See Board of Ed. of
Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 243-245. Although
"special Establishment Clause dangers" may exist when money is given
directly to religious schools, see, e. g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 842, such direct payments are not at
issue here. Pp. 815-820.

(ii) Respondents' second argument--that provision to religious
schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is always impermissible--is also inconsistent with the Court's more recent cases, particularly
Zobrest, supra, at 18-23, and Witters, and is also unworkable. Meek
and Wolman, on which respondents appear to rely for their divertibility
rule, offer little, if any, support for their rule. The issue is not diverti530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
796 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Syllabus
bility but whether the aid itself has an impermissible content. Where
the aid would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable for
use in any private school. Similarly, the prohibition against the government providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment
Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious uses.
See, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 224-226. A concern for divertibility, as
opposed to improper content, is also misplaced because it is boundless--
enveloping all aid, no matter how trivial--and thus has only the most
attenuated (if any) link to any realistic concern for preventing an establishment of religion. Finally, any aid, with or without content, is
"divertible" in the sense that it allows schools to "divert" resources.
Yet the Court has not accepted the recurrent argument that all aid is
forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its
other resources on religious ends. E. g., Committee for Public Ed. and
Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646, 658. Pp. 820-825.

(d) Additional factors cited by the dissent--including the concern for
political divisiveness that post-Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402, cases
have disregarded, see, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 233-234, are rejected.
In particular, whether a recipient school is pervasively sectarian, a factor that has been disregarded in recent cases, e. g., Witters, supra, is not
relevant to the constitutionality of a school-aid program. Pp. 825-829.

(e) Applying the two relevant Agostini criteria reveals that there is
no basis for concluding that Jefferson Parish's Chapter 2 program has
the effect of advancing religion. First, Chapter 2 does not define its
recipients by reference to religion, since aid is allocated on the basis of
neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is
made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis. 521 U. S., at 231. There is no improper incentive
because, under the statute, aid is allocated based on school enrollment.
Second, Chapter 2 does not result in governmental indoctrination of
religion. It determines eligibility for aid neutrally, making a broad
array of schools eligible without regard to their religious affiliations or
lack thereof. See id., at 225-226. It also allocates aid based on the
private choices of students and their parents as to which schools to attend. See id., at 222. Thus, it is not problematic that Chapter 2 could
fairly be described as providing "direct" aid. Finally, the Chapter 2 aid
provided to religious schools does not have an impermissible content.
The statute explicitly requires that such aid be "secular, neutral, and
nonideological," and the record indicates that the Louisiana SEA and
the Jefferson Parish LEA have faithfully enforced this requirement insofar as relevant to this case. Although there is evidence that equipment has been, or at least easily could be, diverted for use in religious
classes, that evidence is not relevant to the constitutional analysis.

Scattered de minimis statutory violations of the restrictions on content,
discovered and remedied by the relevant authorities themselves before
this litigation began almost 15 years ago, should not be elevated to such
a level as to convert an otherwise unobjectionable parishwide program
into a law that has the effect of advancing religion. Pp. 829-835.

(f) To the extent that Meek and Wolman conflict with the foregoing
analysis, they are overruled. Pp. 835-836.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded that Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, controls the constitutional inquiry presented
here, and requires reversal of the Fifth Circuit's judgment that the
Chapter 2 program is unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish.
To the extent Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, and Wolman v. Walter,
433 U. S. 229, are inconsistent with the Court's judgment today, they
should be overruled. Pp. 836-867.

(a) The plurality announces a rule of unprecedented breadth for the
evaluation of Establishment Clause challenges to government school-aid
programs. That rule is particularly troubling because, first, its treatment of neutrality comes close to assigning that factor singular importance in the future adjudication of Establishment Clause challenges
to school-aid programs. Although neutrality is important, see, e. g.,
Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228, 231-232, the Court has never held that a
government-aid program passes constitutional muster solely because of
the neutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid. Rather,
neutrality has heretofore been only one of several factors the Court
considers. See, e. g., id., at 226-228. Second, the plurality's approval
of actual diversion of government aid to religious indoctrination is in
tension with this Court's precedents. See, e. g., id., at 226-227. Actual
diversion is constitutionally impermissible. E. g., Bowen v. Kendrick,
487 U. S. 589, 621-622, 624. The Court should not treat a per-capita-aid
program like Chapter 2 the same as the true private choice programs
approved in Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S.
481, and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1. Because Agostini represents the Court's most recent attempt to devise a
general framework for approaching questions concerning neutral
school-aid programs, and involved an Establishment Clause challenge to
a school-aid program closely related to the instant program, the Agostini criteria should control here. Pp. 837-844.

(b) Under Agostini, the Court asks whether the government acted
with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion and whether the
aid has the "effect" of doing so. 521 U. S., at 222-223. The specific
criteria used to determine an impermissible effect have changed in recent cases, see id., at 223, which disclose three primary criteria to guide
the determination: (1) whether the aid results in governmental indoctri530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
798 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Syllabus
nation, (2) whether the program defines its recipients by reference to
religion, and (3) whether the aid creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, id., at 234. Finally, the same criteria
can be reviewed to determine whether a program constitutes endorsement of religion. Id., at 235. Respondents neither question the Chapter 2 program's secular purpose nor contend that it creates an excessive
entanglement. Accordingly, the Court need ask only whether Chapter
2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, results in governmental indoctrination
or defines its recipients by reference to religion. It is clear that Chapter 2 does not so define aid recipients. Rather, it uses wholly neutral
and secular criteria to allocate aid to students enrolled in religious and
secular schools alike. As to the indoctrination inquiry, the Chapter 2
program bears the same hallmarks of the program upheld in Agostini:
Aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria; it is supplementary to, and does not supplant, nonfederal funds; no Chapter 2 funds
reach the coffers of religious schools; the aid is secular; evidence of
actual diversion is de minimis; and the program includes adequate
safeguards. Regardless of whether these factors are constitutional requirements, they are sufficient to find that the program at issue does
not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion. For the same
reasons, the Chapter 2 program cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion. Pp. 844-849.

(c) Respondents' contentions that Agostini is distinguishable and that
Meek and Wolman are controlling here must be rejected. Meek and
Wolman created an inexplicable rift within the Court's Establishment
Clause jurisprudence. Those decisions adhered to the prior holding in
Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, that
statutes authorizing the lending of textbooks to religious school students did not violate the Establishment Clause, see, e. g., Meek, 421
U. S., at 359-362 (plurality opinion), but invalidated the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools, e. g., id., at
362-366, on the ground that any assistance in support of the pervasively
sectarian schools' educational missions would inevitably have the impermissible effect of advancing religion, see, e. g., id., at 365-366. The irrationality of this distinction is patent. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S.
38, 110. Respondents' assertion that materials and equipment, unlike
textbooks, are reasonably divertible to religious uses is rejected because
it does not provide a logical distinction: An educator can use virtually
any instructional tool, even a textbook, to teach a religious message.
Pp. 849-857.

(d) The Court should follow the rule applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid actually is, or has been, used for religious

Syllabus
purposes. See, e. g., Allen, supra, at 248. Agostini and the cases on
which it relied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek and
Wolman. Agostini's definitive rejection of the presumption that
public-school employees teaching in religious schools would inevitably
inculcate religion also stood for--or at least strongly pointed to--the
broader proposition that such presumptions of religious indoctrination
are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school-aid programs under the Establishment Clause. Respondents' contentions that
Agostini should be limited to its facts, and that a presumption of religious inculcation for instructional materials and equipment should be
retained, must be rejected. The assumption that religious-school instructors can abide by restrictions on the use of government-provided
textbooks, see Meek, supra, at 384, should extend to instructional materials and equipment. School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S.
373, 399-400 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), distinguished. Pp. 857-860.

(e) Respondents' contention that the actual administration of Chapter
2 in Jefferson Parish violated the Establishment Clause is rejected.
The limited evidence amassed by respondents during 4 years of discovery (which began approximately 15 years ago) is at best de minimis and
therefore insufficient to affect the constitutional inquiry. Their assertion that the government must have a failsafe mechanism capable of
detecting any instance of diversion was rejected in Agostini, supra, at
234. Because the presumption adopted in Meek and Wolman respecting the use of instructional materials and equipment by religious-school
teachers should be abandoned, there is no constitutional need for pervasive monitoring under the Chapter 2 program. Moreover, a review of
the specific safeguards employed under Chapter 2 at the federal, state,
and local levels demonstrates that they are constitutionally sufficient.
Respondents' evidence does not demonstrate any actual diversion, but,
at most, proves the possibility of diversion in two isolated instances.
The evidence of violations of Chapter 2's supplantation and secularcontent restrictions is equally insignificant and, therefore, should be
treated the same. This Court has never declared an entire aid program
unconstitutional on Establishment Clause grounds solely because of violations on the minuscule scale of those at issue here. The presence of
so few examples tends to show not that the "no-diversion" rules have
failed, but that they have worked. Pp. 860-867.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join.

As part of a longstanding school-aid program known asChapter 2, the Federal Government distributes funds to

state and local governmental agencies, which in turn lendeducational materials and equipment to public and private
schools, with the enrollment of each participating school de-termining the amount of aid that it receives. The question
is whether Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisi-ana, is a law respecting an establishment of religion, because
many of the private schools receiving Chapter 2 aid in thatparish are religiously affiliated. We hold that Chapter 2 is
not such a law. I

where it was codified by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994,
Pub. L. 103-382, 108 Stat. 3707. For convenience, we will use the term
"Chapter 2," as the lower courts did. Prior to 1994, Chapter 2 was codified at 20 U. S. C. $$ 2911-2976 (1988 ed.).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
that we recently considered in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S.203 (1997). Like the provision at issue in

Agostini, Chapter 2 channels federal funds to local educational agencies(LEA's), which are usually public school districts, via state

educational agencies (SEA's), to implement programs to as-sist children in elementary and secondary schools. Among
other things, Chapter 2 provides aid

"for the acquisition and use of instructional and educational materials, including library services and materials(including media materials), assessments, reference materials, computer software and hardware for instruc-tional use, and other curricular materials." 20 U. S. C.

$ 7351(b)(2).
LEA's and SEA's must offer assistance to both public and
private schools (although any private school must be non-profit). $$ 7312(a), 7372(a)(1). Participating private schools

receive Chapter 2 aid based on the number of childrenenrolled in each school, see $ 7372(a)(1), and allocations of
Chapter 2 funds for those schools must generally be "equal(consistent with the number of children to be served) to
expenditures for programs . . . for children enrolled in the
public schools of the [LEA]," $ 7372(b). LEA's must in allcases "assure equitable participation" of the children of private schools "in the purposes and benefits" of Chapter 2.$ 7372(a)(1); see $ 7372(b). Further, Chapter 2 funds may
only "supplement and, to the extent practical, increase thelevel of funds that would . . . be made available from nonFederal sources." $ 7371(b). LEA's and SEA's may notoperate their programs "so as to supplant funds from nonFederal sources." Ibid.

Several restrictions apply to aid to private schools. Most
significantly, the "services, materials, and equipment" provided to private schools must be "secular, neutral, and nonideological." $ 7372(a)(1). In addition, private schools may
not acquire control of Chapter 2 funds or title to Chapter 2

materials, equipment, or property. $ 7372(c)(1). A privateschool receives the materials and equipment listed in

$ 7351(b)(2) by submitting to the LEA an application detail-ing which items the school seeks and how it will use them;
the LEA, if it approves the application, purchases thoseitems from the school's allocation of funds, and then lends
them to that school.In Jefferson Parish (the Louisiana governmental unit at
issue in this case), as in Louisiana as a whole, private schoolshave primarily used their allocations for nonrecurring expenses, usually materials and equipment. In the 1986-1987fiscal year, for example, 44% of the money budgeted for

private schools in Jefferson Parish was spent by LEA's foracquiring library and media materials, and 48% for instructional equipment. Among the materials and equipment pro-vided have been library books, computers, and computer
software, and also slide and movie projectors, overhead pro-jectors, television sets, tape recorders, VCR's, projection
screens, laboratory equipment, maps, globes, filmstrips,slides, and cassette recordings.

2

It appears that, in an average year, about 30% of Chapter2 funds spent in Jefferson Parish are allocated for private

schools. For the 1985-1986 fiscal year, 41 private schoolsparticipated in Chapter 2. For the following year, 46 participated, and the participation level has remained relativelyconstant since then. See App. 132a. Of these 46, 34 were
Roman Catholic; 7 were otherwise religiously affiliated; and5 were not religiously affiliated.

B
Respondents filed suit in December 1985, alleging, amongother things, that Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish,

2 Congress in 1988 amended the section governing the sorts of materials and equipment available under Chapter 2. Compare 20 U. S. C.

$ 3832(1)(B) (1982 ed.) with $ 7351(b)(2) (1994 ed.). The record in this case
closed in 1989, and the effect of the amendment is not at issue.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendmentof the Federal Constitution. The case's tortuous history

over the next 15 years indicates well the degree to whichour Establishment Clause jurisprudence has shifted in recent times, while nevertheless retaining anomalies withwhich the lower courts have had to struggle.

In 1990, after extended discovery, Chief Judge Heebe of
the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisianagranted summary judgment in favor of respondents.

Helms
v. Cody, Civ. A. No. 85-5533, 1990 WL 36124 (Mar. 27), App.to Pet. for Cert. 137a. He held that Chapter 2 violated the

Establishment Clause because, under the second part of our
three-part test in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613
(1971), the program had the primary effect of advancing religion. Chapter 2 had such effect, in his view, because the
materials and equipment loaned to the Catholic schools were
direct aid to those schools and because the Catholic schools
were, he concluded after detailed inquiry into their doctrine
and curriculum, "pervasively sectarian." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 151a. Chief Judge Heebe relied primarily on Meek v.
Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433
U. S. 229 (1977), in which we held unconstitutional programs
that provided many of the same sorts of materials and equipment as does Chapter 2. In 1994, after having resolved the
numerous other issues in the case, he issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in Jefferson
Parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment.

Two years later, Chief Judge Heebe having retired, Judge
Livaudais received the case. Ruling in early 1997 on postjudgment motions, he reversed the decision of former Chief
Judge Heebe and upheld Chapter 2, pointing to several significant changes in the legal landscape over the previous
seven years. Helms v. Cody, 1997 WL 35283 (Jan. 28), App.
to Pet. for Cert. 79a. In particular, Judge Livaudais cited
our 1993 decision in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School
Dist., 509 U. S. 1, in which we held that a State could, as part

Opinion of Thomas, J.
of a federal program for the disabled, provide a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high

school.Judge Livaudais also relied heavily on a 1995 decision of
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Walker v. SanFrancisco Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449, upholding
Chapter 2 on facts that he found "virtually indistinguish-able." The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in

Walker, as JudgeHeebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that Meek

and Wolman appeared to erect a constitutional distinctionbetween providing textbooks (permissible) and providing
any other in-kind aid (impermissible). 46 F. 3d, at 1464-1465; see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,
392 U. S. 236 (1968) (upholding textbook program). TheCourt of Appeals viewed this distinction, however, as "thin"
and "unmoored from any Establishment Clause principles,"and, more importantly, as "rendered untenable" by subsequent cases, particularly Zobrest. 46 F. 3d, at 1465-1466.These cases, in the Ninth Circuit's view, revived the principle
of Allen and of Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,3 that"state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional." 46 F. 3d, at 1465. The Ninth Cir-cuit also relied,

id., at 1467, on our observation in Board ofEd. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S.

687 (1994), that "we have frequently relied explicitly on thegeneral availability of any benefit provided religious groups
or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause chal-lenges," id., at 704. The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish Meek and Wolman based on the percentage of schoolsreceiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those
cases and a moderate percentage in Walker), 46 F. 3d, at1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that Meek also upheld "the massive provision of text3 Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947) (upholding reimbursement to parents for costs of busing their children to public or
private school).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
books to parochial schools." 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16. Thus,although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that

Meek
and Wolman were no longer good law, its reasoning seemedto require that conclusion.

Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrestand the Ninth Circuit's decision in

Walker, Judge Livaudais
invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of
Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after
Walker, we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religiouspublication from assistance available to numerous other

student-run publications.

Following Judge Livaudais' ruling, respondents appealed
to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. While that
appeal was pending, we decided Agostini, in which we approved a program that, under Title I of the ESEA, provided
public employees to teach remedial classes at private schools,
including religious schools. In so holding, we overruled
Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), and partially overruled School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373
(1985), both of which had involved such a program.

The Fifth Circuit thus faced a dilemma between, on the
one hand, the Ninth Circuit's holding and analysis in Walker
and our subsequent decisions in Rosenberger and Agostini,
and, on the other hand, our holdings in Meek and Wolman.
To resolve the dilemma, the Fifth Circuit abandoned any effort to find coherence in our case law or to divine the future
course of our decisions and instead focused on our particular
holdings. Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 371 (1998). It
thought such an approach required not only by the lack of
coherence but also by Agostini's admonition to lower courts
to abide by any applicable holding of this Court even though
that holding might seem inconsistent with our subsequent
decisions, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 237. The Fifth Circuit
acknowledged that Agostini, by recognizing our rejection of
the rule that "all government aid that directly assists the

Opinion of Thomas, J.
educational function of religious schools is invalid," id., at225, had rejected a premise of Meek, but that court nevertheless concluded that Agostini had neither directly overruledMeek and Wolman nor rejected their distinction between
textbooks and other in-kind aid. The Fifth Circuit there-fore concluded that Meek and Wolman controlled, and thus
it held Chapter 2 unconstitutional. We granted certiorari.527 U. S. 1002 (1999).

II
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment dic-tates that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." In the over 50 years since Everson v.Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the contextof governmental aid to religious schools.

4 As we admitted

in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971), "candor com-pels the acknowledgment that we can only dimly perceive

the boundaries of permissible government activity in thissensitive area." Id., at 678 (plurality opinion); see Lemon,
403 U. S., at 671 (White, J., concurring in judgment).In Agostini, however, we brought some clarity to our
case law, by overruling two anomalous precedents (one inwhole, the other in part) and by consolidating some of our
previously disparate considerations under a revised test.Whereas in

Lemon we had considered whether a statute (1)has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing

or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entangle-ment between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at
612-613, in Agostini we modified Lemon for purposes ofevaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors, see 521 U. S., at 222-223. We acknowledged

4 Cases prior to Everson discussed the issue only indirectly, see, e. g.,
Vidal v. Philadelphia, 2 How. 127, 198-200 (1844); Quick Bear v. Leupp,
210 U. S. 50, 81 (1908), or evaluated aid to schools under other provisions
of the Constitution, see Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370,
374-375 (1930).

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
808 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Opinion of Thomas, J.
that our cases discussing excessive entanglement had appliedmany of the same considerations as had our cases discussing

primary effect, and we therefore recast Lemon's entangle-ment inquiry as simply one criterion relevant to determining
a statute's effect. Agostini, supra, at 232-233. We also ac-knowledged that our cases had pared somewhat the factors
that could justify a finding of excessive entanglement. 521
U. S., at 233-234. We then set out revised criteria for deter-mining the effect of a statute:

"To summarize, New York City's Title I program does
not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we cur-rently use to evaluate whether government aid has the

effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by referenceto religion; or create an excessive entanglement."

Id.,
at 234.

In this case, our inquiry under Agostini's purpose andeffect test is a narrow one. Because respondents do not

challenge the District Court's holding that Chapter 2 has asecular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not
question that holding, cf. 151 F. 3d, at 369, n. 17, we will
consider only Chapter 2's effect. Further, in determiningthat effect, we will consider only the first two

Agostini criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has ques-tioned the District Court's holding, App. to Pet. for Cert.

108a, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entangle-ment. Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent
case law, we conclude that it neither results in religiousindoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients
by reference to religion. We therefore hold that Chapter 2
is not a "law respecting an establishment of religion." In
so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth
Circuits saw was inescapable--Meek and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are
no longer good law.

Opinion of Thomas, J.

A
As we indicated in Agostini, and have indicated elsewhere,the question whether governmental aid to religious schools

results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a ques-tion whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in
those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmen-tal action. See

Agostini, supra, at 226 (presence of sign-language interpreter in Catholic school " `cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking' " (quoting Zobrest, 509 U. S., at10) (emphasis added in Agostini)); 521 U. S., at 230 (question
is whether "any use of [governmental] aid to indoctrinatereligion could be attributed to the State"); see also

Rosen-berger, 515 U. S., at 841-842; Witters v. Washington Dept. of

Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488-489 (1986); Mueller v.Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397 (1983); cf. Corporation of Presiding
Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v.Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 337 (1987) ("For a law to have forbidden
`effects' under Lemon, it must be fair to say that the govern-ment itself has advanced religion through its own activities
and influence"). We have also indicated that the answer tothe question of indoctrination will resolve the question
whether a program of educational aid "subsidizes" religion,as our religion cases use that term. See Agostini, 521 U. S.,
at 230-231; see also id., at 230.In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have con-sistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid
that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons withoutregard to their religion. If the religious, irreligious, and
areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no onewould conclude that any indoctrination that any particular
recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the govern-ment. For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question. If the government is offering assistance to recipientswho provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination,
the government itself is not thought responsible for any par530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
810 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Opinion of Thomas, J.
ticular indoctrination. To put the point differently, if thegovernment, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to reli-gion, to all who adequately further that purpose, see

Allen,
392 U. S., at 245-247 (discussing dual secular and religiouspurposes of religious schools), then it is fair to say that any

aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose. The government, in craftingsuch an aid program, has had to conclude that a given level

of aid is necessary to further that purpose among secularrecipients and has provided no more than that same level to
religious recipients.

As a way of assuring neutrality, we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so "only as a result of the genuinely
independent and private choices of individuals." Agostini,
supra, at 226 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have
viewed as significant whether the "private choices of individual parents," as opposed to the "unmediated" will of government, Ball, 473 U. S., at 395, n. 13 (internal quotation marks
omitted), determine what schools ultimately benefit from the
governmental aid, and how much. For if numerous private
choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility
criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily,
grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment. Private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by
mitigating the preference for pre-existing recipients that is
arguably inherent in any governmental aid program, see,
e. g., Gilder, The Revitalization of Everything: The Law of
the Microcosm, Harv. Bus. Rev. 49 (Mar. /Apr. 1988), and that
could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion
or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.

The principles of neutrality and private choice, and their
relationship to each other, were prominent not only in Agos530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

811Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
tini, supra, at 225-226, 228, 230-232, but also in Zobrest, Wit-ters, and Mueller.

5 The heart of our reasoning in Zobrest,

upholding governmental provision of a sign-language inter-preter to a deaf student at his Catholic high school, was as

follows:

"The service at issue in this case is part of a gen-eral government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as `disabled' under the[statute], without regard to the `sectarian-nonsectarian,
or public-nonpublic nature' of the school the child at-tends. By according parents freedom to select a school
of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school
only as a result of the private decision of individual par-ents. In other words, because the [statute] creates no
financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarianschool, an interpreter's presence there cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking." 509 U. S., at 10.
As this passage indicates, the private choices helped to en-sure neutrality, and neutrality and private choices together

eliminated any possible attribution to the government evenwhen the interpreter translated classes on Catholic doctrine.

Witters and Mueller employed similar reasoning. In Witters, we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar aState from including within a neutral program providing tuition payments for vocational rehabilitation a blind personstudying at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director. We explained:

"Any aid . . . that ultimately flows to religious institu-tions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients. Washington's
5 Justice O'Connor acknowledges that "neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs," one that our recent cases
have "emphasized . . . repeatedly." Post, at 838 (opinion concurring in
judgment).

program is made available generally without regard tothe sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature

of the institution benefited and . . . creates no financialincentive for students to undertake sectarian education. . . . [T]he fact that aid goes to individuals meansthat the decision to support religious education is made
by the individual, not by the State.. . . . .
"[I]t does not seem appropriate to view any aid ulti-mately flowing to the Inland Empire School of the Bible
as resulting from a state action sponsoring or subsidiz-ing religion." 474 U. S., at 487-488 (footnote, citations,
and internal quotation marks omitted).6
Further, five Members of this Court, in separate opinions,emphasized both the importance of neutrality and of private

choices, and the relationship between the two. See id., at

6 The majority opinion also noted that only a small portion of the overall
aid under the State's program would go to religious education, see Witters,
474 U. S., at 488, but it appears that five Members of the Court thought
this point irrelevant. See id., at 491, n. 3 (Powell, J., joined by Burger,
C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S.
388, 401 (1983), to assert that validity of program "does not depend on the
fact that petitioner appears to be the only handicapped student who has
sought to use his assistance to pursue religious training"); 474 U. S., at 490
(White, J., concurring) (agreeing with "most of Justice Powell's concurring
opinion with respect to the relevance of Mueller," but not specifying further); id., at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (agreeing with Justice Powell's reliance on Mueller and explaining
that the program did not have an impermissible effect, because it was
neutral and involved private choice, and thus "[n]o reasonable observer is
likely to draw from the facts before us an inference that the State itself is
endorsing a religious practice or belief"). More recently, in Agostini v.
Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), we held that the proportion of aid benefiting
students at religious schools pursuant to a neutral program involving private choices was irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry. Id., at 229 (refusing "to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends
on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the
otherwise neutral aid"); see also post, at 848 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment) (quoting this passage).

onnor, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment); see also

id., at 490 (White, J.,concurring).

The tax deduction for educational expenses that we upheldin Mueller was, in these respects, the same as the tuition
grant in Witters. We upheld it chiefly because it "neutrallyprovides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens,"
463 U. S., at 398-399, and because "numerous, private choicesof individual parents of school-age children,"

id., at 399, de-termined which schools would benefit from the deductions.

We explained that "[w]here, as here, aid to parochial schoolsis available only as a result of decisions of individual parents
no `imprimatur of state approval' can be deemed to havebeen conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally." Ibid. (citation omitted); see id., at 397 (neutralityindicates lack of state imprimatur).

Agostini's second primary criterion for determining theeffect of governmental aid is closely related to the first. The
second criterion requires a court to consider whether an aidprogram "define[s] its recipients by reference to religion."
521 U. S., at 234. As we briefly explained in Agostini, id.,at 230-231, this second criterion looks to the same set of
facts as does our focus, under the first criterion, on neutral-ity, see

id., at 225-226, but the second criterion uses thosefacts to answer a somewhat different question--whether the

criteria for allocating the aid "creat[e] a financial incentiveto undertake religious indoctrination," id., at 231. In Agostini we set out the following rule for answering thisquestion:

"This incentive is not present, however, where the aidis allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that
neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made availableto both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis. Under such circumstances, the aidis less likely to have the effect of advancing religion."

Opinion of Thomas, J.
The cases on which Agostini relied for this rule, and Agos-tini itself, make clear the close relationship between this

rule, incentives, and private choice. For to say that a pro-gram does not create an incentive to choose religious schools
is to say that the private choice is truly "independent," Wit-ters, 474 U. S., at 487. See Agostini, supra, at 232 (holding
that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, be-cause its services were "available to all children who meet
the Act's eligibility requirements, no matter what their reli-gious beliefs or where they go to school");

Zobrest, 509 U. S.,at 10 (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private

choice, and financial incentives, respectively); Witters, supra,at 488 (similar). When such an incentive does exist, there
is a greater risk that one could attribute to the governmentany indoctrination by the religious schools. See Zobrest,
supra, at 10.We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule
itself, that simply because an aid program offers privateschools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did
not previously receive does not mean that the program, byreducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates,
under Agostini's second criterion, an "incentive" for parentsto choose such an education for their children. For

any aidwill have some such effect. See Allen, 392 U. S., at 244;

Everson, 330 U. S., at 17; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399.

Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chap-ter 2 under the

Agostini test. Instead, dismissing Agostinias factually distinguishable, they offer two rules that they

contend should govern our determination of whether Chap-ter 2 has the effect of advancing religion. They argue first,
and chiefly, that "direct, nonincidental" aid to the primaryeducational mission of religious schools is always impermissible. Second, they argue that provision to religious schoolsof aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermis530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sible.7 Respondents' arguments are inconsistent with ourmore recent case law, in particular Agostini and Zobrest, and

we therefore reject them. 1

Although some of our earlier cases, particularly Ball, 473U. S., at 393-394, did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was

7 Respondents also contend that Chapter 2 aid supplants, rather than
supplements, the core educational function of parochial schools and therefore has the effect of furthering religion. Our case law does provide some
indication that this distinction may be relevant to determining whether aid
results in governmental indoctrination, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229;
Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 12 (1993); but see
School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 396 (1985), but we
have never delineated the distinction's contours or held that it is constitutionally required.

Nor, to the extent that the supplement/supplant line is separable from
respondents' direct/indirect and "no divertibility" arguments, do we need
to resolve the distinction's constitutional status today, for, as we have already noted, Chapter 2 itself requires that aid may only be supplemental.
20 U. S. C. $ 7371(b). See also post, at 867 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment) (declining to decide whether supplement/supplant distinction is
a constitutional requirement); but see post, at 852 (explaining that computers are "necessary" to "the educational process"). We presume that
whether a parish has complied with that statutory requirement would be,
at the very least, relevant to whether a violation of any constitutional
supplement/supplant requirement has occurred, yet we have no reason to
believe that there has been any material statutory violation. A statewide
review by the Louisiana SEA indicated that $ 7371(b) receives nearly universal compliance. App. 112a. More importantly, neither the District
Court nor the Fifth Circuit even hinted that Jefferson Parish had violated

$ 7371(b), and respondents barely mention the statute in their brief to this
Court, offering only the slimmest evidence of any possible violation, see
id., at 63a. Respondents argue that any Chapter 2 aid that a school uses
to comply with state requirements (such as those relating to computers
and libraries) necessarily violates whatever supplement/supplant line may
exist in the Constitution, but our decision in Committee for Public Ed.
and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), upholding reimbursement to parochial schools of costs relating to state-mandated testing,
rejects any such blanket rule.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
merely to prevent "subsidization" of religion, see id., at 394.As even the dissent all but admits, see

post, at 889 (opinion of Souter, J.), our more recent cases address this pur-pose not through the direct/indirect distinction but rather

through the principle of private choice, as incorporated inthe first

Agostini criterion (i. e., whether any indoctrination
could be attributed to the government). If aid to schools,
even "direct aid," is neutrally available and, before reachingor benefiting any religious school, first passes through the

hands (literally or figuratively) of numerous private citizenswho are free to direct the aid elsewhere, the government has
not provided any "support of religion," Witters, supra, at
489. See supra, at 810. Although the presence of private
choice is easier to see when aid literally passes through the
hands of individuals--which is why we have mentioned directness in the same breath with private choice, see, e. g.,
Agostini, 521 U. S., at 226; Witters, supra, at 487; Mueller,
supra, at 399--there is no reason why the Establishment
Clause requires such a form.

Indeed, Agostini expressly rejected the absolute line that
respondents would have us draw. We there explained that
"we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all
government aid that directly assists the educational function
of religious schools is invalid." 521 U. S., at 225. Agostini
relied primarily on Witters for this conclusion and made clear
that private choice and neutrality would resolve the concerns
formerly addressed by the rule in Ball. It was undeniable
in Witters that the aid (tuition) would ultimately go to the
Inland Empire School of the Bible and would support religious education. We viewed this arrangement, however, as
no different from a government issuing a paycheck to one of
its employees knowing that the employee would direct the
funds to a religious institution. Both arrangements would
be valid, for the same reason: "[A]ny money that ultimately
went to religious institutions did so `only as a result of the
genuinely independent and private choices of ' individuals."

Agostini, supra, at 226 (quoting Witters, 474 U. S., at 487).In addition, the program in

Witters was neutral. 521 U. S.,
at 225 (quoting Witters, supra, at 487).As

Agostini explained, the same reasoning was at work in
Zobrest, where we allowed the government-funded inter-preter to provide assistance at a Catholic school, "even

though she would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction,"
because the interpreter was provided according to neutraleligibility criteria and private choice. 521 U. S., at 226.

Therefore, the religious messages interpreted by the inter-preter could not be attributed to the government, see

ibid.
(We saw no difference in Zobrest between the government
hiring the interpreter directly and the government providing
funds to the parents who then would hire the interpreter.
509 U. S., at 13, n. 11.) We rejected the dissent's objection
that we had never before allowed "a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination." See id., at 18
(opinion of Blackmun, J.). Finally, in Agostini itself, we
used the reasoning of Witters and Zobrest to conclude that
remedial classes provided under Title I of the ESEA by public employees did not impermissibly finance religious indoctrination. 521 U. S., at 228; see id., at 230-232. We found
it insignificant that students did not have to directly apply
for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to
students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools. Id.,
at 226-229.

To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indirect
distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the
hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the
school for teaching those same children, the very cases on
which respondents most rely, Meek and Wolman, demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism. In Meek, we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out
that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was "direct

Opinion of Thomas, J.
aid." 421 U. S., at 362-363. The materials-and-equipmentprogram in

Wolman was essentially identical, except that
the State, in an effort to comply with Meek, see Wolman,433 U. S., at 233, 250, loaned the aid to the students. (The

revised program operated much like the one we upheld in
Allen. Compare Wolman, supra, at 248, with Allen, 392
U. S., at 243-245.) Yet we dismissed as "technical" the difference between the two programs: "[I]t would exalt formover substance if this distinction were found to justify a result different from that in Meek." 433 U. S., at 250. Wolman thus, although purporting to reaffirm Meek, actually
undermined that decision, as is evident from the similarity
between the reasoning of Wolman and that of the Meek
dissent. Compare Wolman, supra, at 250 (The "technical
change in legal bailee" was irrelevant), with Meek, supra,
at 391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part) ("Nor can the fact that the school is
the bailee be regarded as constitutionally determinative").
That Meek and Wolman reached the same result, on programs that were indistinguishable but for the direct/indirect
distinction, shows that that distinction played no part in
Meek.

Further, respondents' formalistic line breaks down in the
application to real-world programs. In Allen, for example,
although we did recognize that students themselves received
and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books
provided were those that the private schools required for
courses, that the schools could collect students' requests for
books and submit them to the board of education, that the
schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks
were essential to the schools' teaching of secular subjects.
See 392 U. S., at 243-245. Whether one chooses to label this
program "direct" or "indirect" is a rather arbitrary choice,
one that does not further the constitutional analysis.

Of course, we have seen "special Establishment Clause
dangers," Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842, when money is

given to religious schools or entities directly rather than,
as in Witters and Mueller, indirectly. See 515 U. S., at 842
(collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O'Connor, J., concurring);
see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988);
compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v.
Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for
Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).8 But

8 The reason for such concern is not that the form per se is bad, but that
such a form creates special risks that governmental aid will have the effect
of advancing religion (or, even more, a purpose of doing so). An indirect
form of payment reduces these risks. See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 (neutral tax deduction, because of its indirect form, allowed economic benefit
to religious schools only as result of private choice and thus did not suggest state sanction of schools' religious messages). It is arguable, however, at least after Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474
U. S. 481 (1986), that the principles of neutrality and private choice would
be adequate to address those special risks, for it is hard to see the basis
for deciding Witters differently simply if the State had sent the tuition
check directly to whichever school Witters chose to attend. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 848 (1995)
(O'Connor, J., concurring) (explaining Witters as reconciling principle of
neutrality with principle against public funding of religious messages by
relying on principle of private choice). Similarly, we doubt it would be
unconstitutional if, to modify Witters' hypothetical, see 474 U. S., at 486-
487; supra, at 816, a government employer directly sent a portion of an
employee's paycheck to a religious institution designated by that employee
pursuant to a neutral charitable program. We approved a similar arrangement in Quick Bear, 210 U. S., at 77-82, and the Federal Government
appears to have long had such a program, see 1999 Catalog of Caring:
Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area 44, 45, 59, 74-75
(listing numerous religious organizations, many of which engage in religious education or in proselytizing, to which federal employees may contribute via payroll deductions); see generally Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985) (discussing Combined Federal Campaign). Finally, at least some of our prior cases striking down
direct payments involved serious concerns about whether the payments
were truly neutral. See, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 762-764, 768, 774-780 (1973) (striking down,
by 8-to-1 vote, program providing direct grants for maintenance and repair
of school facilities, where payments were allocated per-pupil but were only

Opinion of Thomas, J.
direct payments of money are not at issue in this case, andwe refuse to allow a "special" case to create a rule for all

cases. 2

Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clauserequires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly
religious in nature or be divertible to religious use. Weagree with the first part of this argument but not the second.
Respondents' "no divertibility" rule is inconsistent with ourmore recent case law and is unworkable. So long as the governmental aid is not itself "unsuitable for use in the publicschools because of religious content,"

Allen, supra, at 245,and eligibility for aid is determined in a constitutionally permissible manner, any use of that aid to indoctrinate cannotbe attributed to the government and is thus not of constitutional concern. And, of course, the use to which the aid isput does not affect the criteria governing the aid's allocation
and thus does not create any impermissible incentive underAgostini's second criterion.

Our recent precedents, particularly Zobrest, require us toreject respondents' argument. For Zobrest gave no consideration to divertibility or even to actual diversion. Hadsuch things mattered to the Court in Zobrest, we would have
found the case to be quite easy--for striking down ratherthan, as we did, upholding the program--which is just how
the dissent saw the case. See, e. g., 509 U. S., at 18 (Black-mun, J., dissenting) ("Until now, the Court never has authorized a public employee to participate directly in religiousindoctrination");

id., at 22 ("[G]overnment crosses the boun-dary when it furnishes the medium for communication of

a religious message. . . . [A] state-employed sign-languageinterpreter would serve as the conduit for James' religious
education, thereby assisting Salpointe [High School] in itsmission of religious indoctrination"); id., at 23 (interpreter

Opinion of Thomas, J.
"is likely to place the imprimatur of governmental approval
upon the favored religion"); see generally id., at 18-23.
Quite clearly, then, we did not, as respondents do, think that
the use of governmental aid to further religious indoctrination was synonymous with religious indoctrination by the
government or that such use of aid created any improper
incentives.

Similarly, had we, in Witters, been concerned with divertibility or diversion, we would have unhesitatingly, perhaps
summarily, struck down the tuition-reimbursement program,
because it was certain that Witters sought to participate in it
to acquire an education in a religious career from a sectarian
institution. Diversion was guaranteed. Mueller took the
same view as Zobrest and Witters, for we did not in Mueller
require the State to show that the tax deductions were only
for the costs of education in secular subjects. We declined
to impose any such segregation requirement for either the
tuition-expense deductions or the deductions for items strikingly similar to those at issue in Meek and Wolman, and
here. See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 391, n. 2; see also id., at 414
(Marshall, J., dissenting) ("The instructional materials which
are subsidized by the Minnesota tax deduction plainly may
be used to inculcate religious values and belief ").

Justice O'Connor acknowledges that the Court in Zobrest and Witters approved programs that involved actual
diversion. See post, at 841 (opinion concurring in judgment). The dissent likewise does not deny that Witters involved actual diversion. See post, at 895-896, n. 16. The
dissent does claim that the aid in Zobrest "was not considered divertible," post, at 895, n. 16, but the dissent in
Zobrest, which the author of today's dissent joined, understood the case otherwise. See supra, at 820. As that dissent made clear, diversion is the use of government aid to
further a religious message. See Zobrest, supra, at 21-22
(Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also post, at 842, 857 (O'Con-
nor, J., concurring in judgment). By that definition, the

Opinion of Thomas, J.
government-provided interpreter in Zobrest was not only divertible, but actually diverted.

Respondents appear to rely on Meek and Wolman to establish their rule against "divertible" aid. But those cases
offer little, if any, support for respondents. Meek mentioned
divertibility only briefly in a concluding footnote, see 421
U. S., at 366, n. 16, and that mention was, at most, peripheral
to the Court's reasoning in striking down the lending of instructional materials and equipment. The aid program in
Wolman explicitly barred divertible aid, 433 U. S., at 248-
249, so a concern for divertibility could not have been part
of our reason for finding that program invalid.

The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the
aid itself has an impermissible content. Where the aid
would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable
for use in any private school. Similarly, the prohibition
against the government providing impermissible content
resolves the Establishment Clause concerns that exist if aid
is actually diverted to religious uses.9 In Agostini, we
explained Zobrest by making just this distinction between
the content of aid and the use of that aid: "Because the only
government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government
indoctrination took place." 521 U. S., at 224 (second emphasis added). Agostini also acknowledged that what the dissenters in Zobrest had charged was essentially true: Zobrest
did effect a "shift . . . in our Establishment Clause law."

purchased religious film, even though a public school that possessed the
same kind of projector would likely be constitutionally barred from refusing to allow a student bible club to use that projector in a classroom to
show the very same film, where the classrooms and projectors were generally available to student groups. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches

fulfilled her assigned duties, see id., at 224-225, had "no in-herent religious significance," Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (discussing bus rides in Everson), and so it did not matter (giventhe neutrality and private choice involved in the program)
that she "would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction,"Agostini, supra, at 226 (discussing Zobrest). And just as a
government interpreter does not herself inculcate a religiousmessage--even when she is conveying one--so also a government computer or overhead projector does not itself in-culcate a religious message, even when it is conveying one.

In Agostini itself, we approved the provision of public em-ployees to teach secular remedial classes in private schools
partly because we concluded that there was no reason to sus-pect that indoctrinating content would be part of such governmental aid. See 521 U. S., at 223-225, 226-227, 234-235.Relying on

Zobrest, we refused to presume that the publicteachers would " `inject religious content' " into their classes,

521 U. S., at 225, especially given certain safeguards thatexisted; we also saw no evidence that they had done so,
id., at 226-227.In

Allen we similarly focused on content, emphasizing thatthe textbooks were preapproved by public school authorities

and were not "unsuitable for use in the public schools be-cause of religious content." 392 U. S., at 245. See Lemon,
403 U. S., at 617 ("We note that the dissenters in Allenseemed chiefly concerned with the pragmatic difficulties involved in ensuring the truly secular content of the text-books" (emphasis added)). Although it might appear that a
book, because it has a pre-existing content, is not divertible,and thus that lack of divertibility motivated our holding in
Allen, it is hard to imagine any book that could not, in evenmoderately skilled hands, serve to illustrate a religious message.10 Post, at 855 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)

(agreeing with this point). Indeed, the plaintiffs in Walkeressentially conceded as much. 46 F. 3d, at 1469, n. 17. A

teacher could, for example, easily use Shakespeare's KingLear, even though set in pagan times, to illustrate the Fourth
Commandment. See Exodus 20:12 ("Honor your father andyour mother"). Thus, it is a non sequitur for the dissent to
contend that the textbooks in Allen were "not readily divert-ible to religious teaching purposes" because they "had a
known and fixed secular content." Post, at 893-894.A concern for divertibility, as opposed to improper content, is misplaced not only because it fails to explain whythe sort of aid that we have allowed is permissible, but also
because it is boundless--enveloping all aid, no matter howtrivial--and thus has only the most attenuated (if any) link
to any realistic concern for preventing an "establishment ofreligion." Presumably, for example, government-provided
lecterns, chalk, crayons, pens, paper, and paintbrushes wouldhave to be excluded from religious schools under respondents' proposed rule. But we fail to see how indoctrinationby means of (i. e., diversion of) such aid could be attributed
to the government. In fact, the risk of improper attributionis less when the aid lacks content, for there is no risk (as
there is with books) of the government inadvertently provid-ing improper content. See Allen, supra, at 255-262 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Finally, any aid, with or without con-tent, is "divertible" in the sense that it allows schools to
"divert" resources. Yet we have " `not accepted the recur-rent argument that all aid is forbidden because aid to one
aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resourceson religious ends.' " Regan, 444 U. S., at 658 (quoting Hunt
v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743 (1973)).
books to somehow further religious instruction, see id., at 248, we had no
occasion to say what the consequence would be were such use occurring
and, more importantly, we think that this brief concluding comment cannot
be read, especially after Zobrest (not to mention Witters, Mueller, and
Agostini) as essential to the reasoning of Allen.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
It is perhaps conceivable that courts could take upon them-selves the task of distinguishing among the myriad kinds of

possible aid based on the ease of diverting each kind. Butit escapes us how a court might coherently draw any such
line. It not only is far more workable, but also is actuallyrelated to real concerns about preventing advancement of
religion by government, simply to require, as did Zobrest,
Agostini, and Allen, that a program of aid to schools notprovide improper content and that it determine eligibility

and allocate the aid on a permissible basis.11

C
The dissent serves up a smorgasbord of 11 factors that,depending on the facts of each case "in all its particularity,"

post, at 877, could be relevant to the constitutionality ofa school-aid program. And those 11 are a bare minimum.
We are reassured that there are likely more.12 See post, at885, 888. Presumably they will be revealed in future cases,
as needed, but at least one additional factor is evidentfrom the dissent itself: The dissent resurrects the concern
for political divisiveness that once occupied the Court butthat post-Aguilar cases have rightly disregarded. Compare
post, at 868, 872, 901, 902, 909, n. 27, with Agostini, 521 U. S.,at 233-234; Bowen, 487 U. S., at 617, n. 14; Amos, 483 U. S.,
at 339-340, n. 17. As Justice O'Connor explained in dis-sent in Aguilar: "It is curious indeed to base our interpretation of the Constitution on speculation as to the likelihoodof a phenomenon which the parties may create merely by

11 Justice O'Connor agrees that the Constitution does not bar divertible aid. See post, at 857 (opinion concurring in judgment). She also
finds actual diversion unproblematic if "true private-choice" directs the
aid. See post, at 842. And even when there is not such private choice,
she thinks that some amount of actual diversion is tolerable and that safeguards for preventing and detecting actual diversion may be minimal, as
we explain further, infra, at 832-834.

12 It is thus surprising for the dissent to accuse us of following a rule of

"breathtaking . . . manipulability." Post, at 901, n. 19.

prosecuting a lawsuit." 473 U. S., at 429. While the dis-sent delights in the perverse chaos that all these factors

produce, post, at 899; see also post, at 869, 885, the Constitu-tion becomes unnecessarily clouded, and legislators, litigants,
and lower courts groan, as the history of this case amplydemonstrates. See Part I-B,

supra.
One of the dissent's factors deserves special mention:
whether a school that receives aid (or whose students receiveaid) is pervasively sectarian. The dissent is correct that

there was a period when this factor mattered, particularly ifthe pervasively sectarian school was a primary or secondary
school. Post, at 885-887, 894, 898, 902-906. But that period is one that the Court should regret, and it is thankfully
long past.

There are numerous reasons to formally dispense with this
factor. First, its relevance in our precedents is in sharp decline. Although our case law has consistently mentioned it
even in recent years, we have not struck down an aid program in reliance on this factor since 1985, in Aguilar and
Ball. Agostini of course overruled Aguilar in full and Ball
in part, and today Justice O'Connor distances herself from
the part of Ball with which she previously agreed, by rejecting the distinction between public and private employees
that was so prominent in Agostini. Compare post, at 858-
860, 863-864 (opinion concurring in judgment), with Agostini, supra, at 223-225, 234-235. In Witters, a year after
Aguilar and Ball, we did not ask whether the Inland Empire
School of the Bible was pervasively sectarian. In Bowen, a
1988 decision, we refused to find facially invalid an aid program (although one not involving schools) whose recipients
had, the District Court found, included pervasively sectarian
institutions. See 487 U. S., at 636, 647, 648 (Blackmun, J.,
dissenting). Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to
emphasize the narrowness of the "pervasively sectarian" category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Members of the majority questioned whether this category
was "well-founded," id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by
Scalia, J., concurring). Then, in Zobrest and Agostini, we
upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that
were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary
and secondary. Zobrest, in turning away a challenge based
on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic
High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and
the absence of government-provided sectarian content. 509
U. S., at 13. Agostini, in explaining why the aid program
was constitutional, did not bother to mention that pervasively sectarian schools were at issue,13 see 521 U. S., at 226-
235, a fact that was not lost on the dissent, see id., at 249
(opinion of Souter, J.). In disregarding the nature of the
school, Zobrest and Agostini were merely returning to the
approach of Everson and Allen, in which the Court upheld
aid programs to students at pervasively sectarian schools.
See post, at 875, 885-886 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting
this fact regarding Everson); Allen, 392 U. S., at 251-252
(Black, J., dissenting); id., at 262-264, 269-270, n. (Douglas,
J., dissenting).

Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient
adequately furthers the government's secular purpose. See
supra, at 810. If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious,
and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the
government has established, and thus a mystery what the
constitutional violation would be. The pervasively sectarian
recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most
bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does,
reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole

13 Nor does Justice O'Connor do so today in her analysis of Jefferson
Parish's Chapter 2 program.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective intransmitting their views to children.

Third, the inquiry into the recipient's religious views re-quired by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive. It is wellestablished, in numerous other contexts, that courts should
refrain from trolling through a person's or institution's religious beliefs. See Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 887 (1990) (collecting
cases). Yet that is just what this factor requires, as wasevident before the District Court. Although the dissent

welcomes such probing, see post, at 904-906, we find it profoundly troubling. In addition, and related, the application
of the "pervasively sectarian" factor collides with our decisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating
in the distribution of public benefits based upon religious status or sincerity. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of
Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995); Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993);
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981).

Finally, hostility to aid to pervasively sectarian schools has
a shameful pedigree that we do not hesitate to disavow. Cf.
Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 53-54, n. 20 (1999) (plurality
opinion). Although the dissent professes concern for "the
implied exclusion of the less favored," post, at 868, the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from government-aid
programs is just that, particularly given the history of such
exclusion. Opposition to aid to "sectarian" schools acquired
prominence in the 1870's with Congress' consideration (and
near passage) of the Blaine Amendment, which would have
amended the Constitution to bar any aid to sectarian institutions. Consideration of the amendment arose at a time
of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that "sectarian"
was code for "Catholic." See generally Green, The Blaine
Amendment Reconsidered, 36 Am. J. Legal Hist. 38 (1992).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Notwithstanding its history, of course, "sectarian" could, onits face, describe the school of any religious sect, but the

Court eliminated this possibility of confusion when, in Huntv. McNair, 413 U. S., at 743, it coined the term "pervasively
sectarian"--a term which, at that time, could be applied al-most exclusively to Catholic parochial schools and which
even today's dissent exemplifies chiefly by reference to suchschools. See

post, at 886, 904-906 (opinion of Souter, J.).In short, nothing in the Establishment Clause requires the

exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from otherwisepermissible aid programs, and other doctrines of this Court
bar it. This doctrine, born of bigotry, should be buried now.

III
Applying the two relevant Agostini criteria, we see nobasis for concluding that Jefferson Parish's Chapter 2

program "has the effect of advancing religion." Agostini,
supra, at 234. Chapter 2 does not result in governmentalindoctrination, because it determines eligibility for aid neutrally, allocates that aid based on the private choices of theparents of schoolchildren, and does not provide aid that has
an impermissible content. Nor does Chapter 2 define itsrecipients by reference to religion.

Taking the second criterion first, it is clear that Chapter 2aid "is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that
neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available toboth religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis." Agostini, 521 U. S., at 231. Aid is allocatedbased on enrollment: "Private schools receive Chapter 2 materials and equipment based on the per capita number of stu-dents at each school,"

Walker, 46 F. 3d, at 1464, and alloca-tions to private schools must "be equal (consistent with the

number of children to be served) to expenditures for pro-grams under this subchapter for children enrolled in the public schools of the [LEA]," 20 U. S. C. $ 7372(b). LEA's mustprovide Chapter 2 materials and equipment for the benefit

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
830 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Opinion of Thomas, J.
of children in private schools "[t]o the extent consistent withthe number of children in the school district of [an LEA] . . .

who are enrolled in private nonprofit elementary and second-ary schools." $ 7372(a)(1). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a
(District Court, recounting testimony of head of Louisiana'sChapter 2 program that LEA's are told that " `for every dollar you spend for the public school student, you spend the
same dollar for the non-public school student' "); $$ 7372(a)(1)and (b) (children in private schools must receive "equitable

participation"). The allocation criteria therefore create noimproper incentive. Chapter 2 does, by statute, deviate
from a pure per capita basis for allocating aid to LEA's,
increasing the per-pupil allocation based on the number of
children within an LEA who are from poor families, reside
in poor areas, or reside in rural areas. $$ 7312(a)-(b). But
respondents have not contended, nor do we have any reason
to think, that this deviation in the allocation to the LEA's
leads to deviation in the allocation among schools within
each LEA, see $$ 7372(a)-(b), and, even if it did, we would
not presume that such a deviation created any incentive one
way or the other with regard to religion.

Chapter 2 also satisfies the first Agostini criterion. The
program makes a broad array of schools eligible for aid without regard to their religious affiliations or lack thereof.

$ 7372; see $ 7353(a)(3). We therefore have no difficulty concluding that Chapter 2 is neutral with regard to religion.
See Agostini, supra, at 225-226. Chapter 2 aid also, like the
aid in Agostini, Zobrest, and Witters, reaches participating
schools only "as a consequence of private decisionmaking."
Agostini, supra, at 222. Private decisionmaking controls
because of the per capita allocation scheme, and those decisions are independent because of the program's neutrality.
See 521 U. S., at 226. It is the students and their parents--
not the government--who, through their choice of school, determine who receives Chapter 2 funds. The aid follows the
child.

831Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to privatechoices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe

Chapter 2 as providing "direct" aid. The materials andequipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used
from time to time by entire classes rather than by individualstudents (although individual students are likely the chief
consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and
computer software), and students themselves do not need toapply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive

it, but, as we explained in Agostini, these traits are not con-stitutionally significant or meaningful. See

id., at 228-229.
Nor, for reasons we have already explained, is it of constitutional significance that the schools themselves, rather than
the students, are the bailees of the Chapter 2 aid. The ultimate beneficiaries of Chapter 2 aid are the students who attend the schools that receive that aid, and this is so regardless of whether individual students lug computers to school
each day or, as Jefferson Parish has more sensibly provided,
the schools receive the computers. Like the Ninth Circuit,
and unlike the dissent, post, at 888, we "see little difference
in loaning science kits to students who then bring the kits to
school as opposed to loaning science kits to the school directly." Walker, supra, at 1468, n. 16; see Allen, 392 U. S.,
at 244, n. 6.

Finally, Chapter 2 satisfies the first Agostini criterion because it does not provide to religious schools aid that has an
impermissible content. The statute explicitly bars anything
of the sort, providing that all Chapter 2 aid for the benefit
of children in private schools shall be "secular, neutral, and
nonideological," $ 7372(a)(1), and the record indicates that the
Louisiana SEA and the Jefferson Parish LEA have faithfully
enforced this requirement insofar as relevant to this case.
The chief aid at issue is computers, computer software, and
library books. The computers presumably have no preexisting content, or at least none that would be impermissible for use in public schools. Respondents do not contend

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN
832 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Opinion of Thomas, J.
otherwise. Respondents also offer no evidence that reli-gious schools have received software from the government

that has an impermissible content.There is evidence that equipment has been, or at least easily could be, diverted for use in religious classes. See, e. g.,App. 108a, 118a, 205a-207a.

Justice O'Connor, however,finds the safeguards against diversion adequate to prevent

and detect actual diversion. Post, at 861, 867 (opinion con-curring in judgment). The safeguards on which she relies
reduce to three: (1) signed assurances that Chapter 2 aid willbe used only for secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes, (2) monitoring visits, and (3) the requirement thatequipment be labeled as belonging to Chapter 2.

14 As to the

first, Justice O'Connor rightly places little reliance on it.Post, at 862. As to the second, monitoring by SEA and

LEA officials is highly unlikely to prevent or catch diver-sion.

15 As to the third, compliance with the labeling re14 Many of the other safeguards on which Justice O'Connor relies are
safeguards against improper content, not against diversion. See post, at
862, 863 (opinion concurring in judgment). Content is a different matter
from diversion and is much easier to police than is the mutable use of
materials and equipment (which is one reason that we find the safeguards
against improper content adequate, infra, at 834-835). Similarly, the
statutory provisions against supplanting nonfederal funds and against paying federal funds for religious worship or instruction, on which Justice
O'Connor also relies, post, at 861, are of little, if any, relevance to diversion--the former because diversion need not supplant, and the latter because religious schools receive no funds, 20 U. S. C. $ 7372(c)(1).

15 The SEA director acknowledged as much when he said that the SEA

enforces the rule against diversion "as best we can," only visits "[o]ne or
two" of the private schools whenever it reviews an LEA, and reviews each
LEA only once every three years. App. 94a-95a. When asked whether
there was "any way" for SEA officials to know of diversion of a Chapter
2 computer, he responded, "No, there is no way." Id., at 118a.

Monitoring by the Jefferson Parish LEA is similarly ineffective. The
LEA visits each private school only once a year, for less than an hour and a
half, and alerts the school to the visit in advance. Id., at 142a, 151a-152a,
182a-183a. The monitoring visits consist of reviewing records of equipment use and of speaking to a single contact person. Self-reporting is the
sole source for the records of use. Id., at 140a. In the case of overhead

833Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
quirement is haphazard, see App. 113a, and, even if the requirement were followed, we fail to see how a label prevents
diversion.16 In addition, we agree with the dissent that
there is evidence of actual diversion and that, were the safeguards anything other than anemic, there would almost
certainly be more such evidence. See post, at 903, 906-

910.17 In any event, for reasons we discussed in Part II-B-2,

projectors, the record appears to be just a sign-out sheet, and the LEA
official simply checks whether "the recordation of use is attempted." Id.,
at 143a. The contact person is not a teacher; monitoring does not include
speaking with teachers; and the LEA makes no effort to inform teachers
of the restrictions on use of Chapter 2 equipment. Id., at 154a-155a.
The contact person also is usually not involved with the computers. Id.,
at 163a. Thus, the contact person is uninvolved in the actual use of the
divertible equipment and, therefore, in no position to know whether diversion has occurred. See id., at 154a. Unsurprisingly, then, no contact person has ever reported diversion. Id., at 147a. (In Agostini, by contrast,
monitors visited each classroom--unannounced--once a month, and the
teachers received specific training in what activities were permitted. 521
U. S., at 211-212, 234.) The head of the Jefferson Parish LEA admitted
that she had, and could have, no idea whether Chapter 2 equipment was
being diverted:

"Q: Would there be any way to ascertain, from this on-site visit, whether
the material or equipment purchased are used not only in accordance with
Chapter 2 plan submitted, but for other purposes, also?

"A: No.
"Q: Now, would it be your view that a church-affiliated school that would
teach the creation concept of the origin of man, that if they used [a Chapter 2] overhead projector, that would be a violation . . . ?

"A: Yes.
"Q: Now, is there any way, do you ever ask that question of a churchaffiliated school, as to whether they use it for that purpose?

"A: No." App. 144a, 150a-151a.
See id., at 139a, 145a, 146a-147a (similar).

16 In fact, a label, by associating the government with any religious use

of the equipment, exacerbates any Establishment Clause problem that
might exist when diversion occurs.

17 Justice O'Connor dismisses as de minimis the evidence of actual

diversion. Post, at 864-865 (opinion concurring in judgment). That may
be, but it is good to realize just what she considers de minimis. There is

Opinion of Thomas, J.
supra, the evidence of actual diversion and the weakness of
the safeguards against actual diversion are not relevant to
the constitutional inquiry, whatever relevance they may have
under the statute and regulations.

Respondents do, however, point to some religious books
that the LEA improperly allowed to be loaned to several
religious schools, and they contend that the monitoring programs of the SEA and the Jefferson Parish LEA are insufficient to prevent such errors. The evidence, however, establishes just the opposite, for the improper lending of library
books occurred--and was discovered and remedied--before
this litigation began almost 15 years ago.18 In other words,
the monitoring system worked. See post, at 866 (O'Con-
nor, J., concurring in judgment). Further, the violation by
the LEA and the private schools was minor and, in the view
of the SEA's coordinator, inadvertent. See App. 122a.
There were approximately 191 improper book requests over
three years (the 1982-1983 through 1984-1985 school years);
these requests came from fewer than half of the 40 private
schools then participating; and the cost of the 191 books

persuasive evidence that Chapter 2 audiovisual equipment was used in a
Catholic school's theology department. "[M]uch" of the equipment at
issue "was purchased with Federal funds," App. 205a, and those federal
funds were, from the 1982-1983 school year on, almost certainly Chapter
2 funds, see id., at 210a; cf. id., at 187a, 189a. The diversion occurred
over seven consecutive school years, id., at 206a-207a, and the use of the
equipment in the theology department was massive in each of those years,
outstripping in every year use in other departments such as science, math,
and foreign language, ibid. In addition, the dissent has documented likely
diversion of computers. Post, at 910.

18 The coordinator of the Jefferson Parish LEA ordered the books

recalled sometime in the summer or early fall of 1985, and it appears
that the schools had complied with the recall order by the second week
of December 1985. App. 162a, 80a-81a. Respondents filed suit in early
December. This self-correction is a key distinction between this instance
of providing improper content and the evidence of actual diversion. See
n. 17, supra.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
amounted to "less than one percent of the total allocationover all those years." Id., at 132a-133a.

The District Court found that prescreening by the LEAcoordinator of requested library books was sufficient to prevent statutory violations, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a, andthe Fifth Circuit did not disagree. Further, as noted, the
monitoring system appears adequate to catch those errorsthat do occur. We are unwilling to elevate scattered

deminimis statutory violations, discovered and remedied by

the relevant authorities themselves prior to any litigation,to such a level as to convert an otherwise unobjectionable
parishwide program into a law that has the effect of advanc-ing religion.

IV
In short, Chapter 2 satisfies both the first and second pri-mary criteria of

Agostini. It therefore does not have theeffect of advancing religion. For the same reason, Chapter

2 also "cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement ofreligion," Agostini, 521 U. S., at 235. Accordingly, we hold
that Chapter 2 is not a law respecting an establishment ofreligion. Jefferson Parish need not exclude religious schools
from its Chapter 2 program.19 To the extent that Meek and
Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.Our conclusion regarding Meek and Wolman should come

as no surprise. The Court as early as Wolman itself left nodoubt that Meek and Allen were irreconcilable, see 433 U. S.,
at 251, n. 18, and we have repeatedly reaffirmed Allen sincethen, see, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 231. (In fact, Meek, in

19 Indeed, as petitioners observe, to require exclusion of religious schools
from such a program would raise serious questions under the Free Exercise Clause. See, e. g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,
508 U. S. 520, 532 (1993) ("At a minimum, the protections of the Free Exercise Clause pertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all
religious beliefs"); Everson, 330 U. S., at 16; cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1996) (holding that Free Speech
Clause bars exclusion of religious viewpoints from limited public forum).

discussing the materials-and-equipment program, did noteven cite Allen. See Meek, 421 U. S., at 363-366.) Less

than three years after Wolman, we explained that Meek didnot, despite appearances, hold that "all loans of secular instructional material and equipment inescapably have the ef-fect of direct advancement of religion." Regan, 444 U. S., at
661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted). Then, in Mueller, we conceded that the aid at issue in Meek and Wolmandid "resembl[e], in many respects," the aid that we had upheld in Everson and Allen. 463 U. S., at 393, and n. 3; seeid., at 402, n. 10; see also id., at 415 (Marshall, J., dissenting)
(viewing Allen as incompatible with Meek and Wolman, andthe distinction between textbooks and other instructional
materials as "simply untenable"). Most recently, Agostini,in rejecting Ball's assumption that "all government aid that
directly assists the educational function of religious schoolsis invalid," Agostini, supra, at 225, necessarily rejected a
large portion (perhaps all, see Ball, 473 U. S., at 395) of thereasoning of

Meek and Wolman in invalidating the lending ofmaterials and equipment, for Ball borrowed that assumption

from those cases. See 521 U. S., at 220-221 (Shared Timeprogram at issue in Ball was "surely invalid . . . [g]iven the
holdings in Meek and Wolman" regarding instructional ma-terials and equipment). Today we simply acknowledge what
has long been evident and was evident to the Ninth and FifthCircuits and to the District Court.

The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring in the judgment.

In 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and SecondaryEducation Act, 79 Stat. 27 (1965 Act). Under Title I, Congress provided monetary grants to States to address theneeds of educationally deprived children of low-income families. Under Title II, Congress provided further monetary

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
grants to States for the acquisition of library resources, text-books, and other instructional materials for use by children

and teachers in public and private elementary and secondaryschools. Since 1965, Congress has reauthorized the Title I
and Title II programs several times. Three Terms ago, weheld in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), that Title I, as
applied in New York City, did not violate the EstablishmentClause. I believe that

Agostini likewise controls the consti-tutional inquiry respecting Title II presented here, and requires the reversal of the Court of Appeals' judgment thatthe program is unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. To the extent our decisions in Meek v. Pit-tenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S.
229 (1977), are inconsistent with the Court's judgment today,I agree that those decisions should be overruled. I therefore concur in the judgment.

I
I write separately because, in my view, the plurality an-nounces a rule of unprecedented breadth for the evaluation

of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aidprograms. Reduced to its essentials, the plurality's rule
states that government aid to religious schools does not havethe effect of advancing religion so long as the aid is offered
on a neutral basis and the aid is secular in content. Theplurality also rejects the distinction between direct and indirect aid, and holds that the actual diversion of secular aid bya religious school to the advancement of its religious mission
is permissible. Although the expansive scope of the plural-ity's rule is troubling, two specific aspects of the opinion compel me to write separately. First, the plurality's treatmentof neutrality comes close to assigning that factor singular
importance in the future adjudication of EstablishmentClause challenges to government school aid programs. Second, the plurality's approval of actual diversion of govern-ment aid to religious indoctrination is in tension with our

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
838 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
precedents and, in any event, unnecessary to decide the in-stant case.

The clearest example of the plurality's near-absolute po-sition with respect to neutrality is found in its following
statement:

"If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike
eligible for governmental aid, no one would concludethat any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.
If the government is offering assistance to recipientswho provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for
any particular indoctrination. To put the point differ-ently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms,without regard to religion, to all who adequately further
that purpose, then it is fair to say that any aid going to areligious recipient only has the effect of furthering that
secular purpose." Ante, at 809-810 (citation omitted).
I agree with Justice Souter that the plurality, by taking
such a stance, "appears to take evenhandedness neutralityand in practical terms promote it to a single and sufficient

test for the establishment constitutionality of school aid."
Post, at 900 (dissenting opinion).

I do not quarrel with the plurality's recognition that neu-trality is an important reason for upholding government-aid

programs against Establishment Clause challenges. Ourcases have described neutrality in precisely this manner, and
we have emphasized a program's neutrality repeatedly in our
decisions approving various forms of school aid. See, e. g.,
Agostini, supra, at 228, 231-232; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487-488 (1986);

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
in judgment); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397-399 (1983).Nevertheless, we have never held that a government-aid

program passes constitutional muster solely because of theneutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid.
For example, in Agostini, neutrality was only one of severalfactors we considered in determining that New York City's
Title I program did not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion. See 521 U. S., at 226-228 (noting lack ofevidence of inculcation of religion by Title I instructors, legal

requirement that Title I services be supplemental to regularcurricula, and that no Title I funds reached religious schools'
coffers). Indeed, given that the aid in Agostini had secular
content and was distributed on the basis of wholly neutral
criteria, our consideration of additional factors demonstrates
that the plurality's rule does not accurately describe our recent Establishment Clause jurisprudence. See also Zobrest,
supra, at 10, 12-13 (noting that no government funds reached
religious school's coffers, aid did not relieve school of expense
it otherwise would have assumed, and aid was not distributed to school but to the child).

Justice Souter provides a comprehensive review of our
Establishment Clause cases on government aid to religious
institutions that is useful for its explanation of the various
ways in which we have used the term "neutrality" in our
decisions. See post, at 878-883. Even if we at one time
used the term "neutrality" in a descriptive sense to refer to
those aid programs characterized by the requisite equipoise
between support of religion and antagonism to religion, Jus-
tice Souter's discussion convincingly demonstrates that
the evolution in the meaning of the term in our jurisprudence
is cause to hesitate before equating the neutrality of recent
decisions with the neutrality of old. As I have previously
explained, neutrality is important, but it is by no means the
only "axiom in the history and precedent of the Establishment Clause." Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.
of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 846 (1995) (concurring opinion). Thus,

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
I agree with Justice Souter's conclusion that our "mostrecent use of `neutrality' to refer to generality or evenhandedness of distribution . . . is relevant in judging whether abenefit scheme so characterized should be seen as aiding a
sectarian school's religious mission, but this neutrality is notalone sufficient to qualify the aid as constitutional."

Post,
at 883-884.

I also disagree with the plurality's conclusion that actualdiversion of government aid to religious indoctrination is

consistent with the Establishment Clause. See ante, at 820-825. Although "[o]ur cases have permitted some government funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations," our decisions "provide no precedent for the use
of public funds to finance religious activities." Rosenberger,
supra, at 847 (O'Connor, J., concurring). At least two of
the decisions at the heart of today's case demonstrate that
we have long been concerned that secular government aid
not be diverted to the advancement of religion. In both
Agostini, our most recent school aid case, and Board of Ed.
of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968),
we rested our approval of the relevant programs in part
on the fact that the aid had not been used to advance the
religious missions of the recipient schools. See Agostini,
supra, at 226-227 ("[N]o evidence has ever shown that any
New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial
school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students");
Allen, supra, at 248 ("Nothing in this record supports the
proposition that all textbooks, whether they deal with mathematics, physics, foreign languages, history, or literature, are
used by the parochial schools to teach religion"). Of course,
our focus on the lack of such evidence would have been entirely unnecessary if we had believed that the Establishment
Clause permits the actual diversion of secular government
aid to religious indoctrination. Our decision in Bowen v.
Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988), also demonstrates that actual
diversion is constitutionally impermissible. After conclud530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

841Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
ing that the government-aid program in question was consti-tutional on its face, we remanded the case so that the District

Court could determine, after further factual development,whether aid recipients had used the government aid to support their religious objectives. See id., at 621-622; id., at624 (

Kennedy, J., concurring) ("[T]he only purpose of further inquiring whether any particular grantee institution is
pervasively sectarian is as a preliminary step to demonstrat-ing that the funds are in fact being used to further religion").

The remand would have been unnecessary if, as the pluralitycontends, actual diversion were irrelevant under the Establishment Clause.

The plurality bases its holding that actual diversion is permissible on Witters and Zobrest. Ante, at 820-821. Those
decisions, however, rested on a significant factual premise
missing from this case, as well as from the majority of cases
thus far considered by the Court involving Establishment
Clause challenges to school aid programs. Specifically, we
decided Witters and Zobrest on the understanding that the
aid was provided directly to the individual student who, in
turn, made the choice of where to put that aid to use. See
Witters, 474 U. S., at 488; Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10, 12. Accordingly, our approval of the aid in both cases relied to a
significant extent on the fact that "[a]ny aid . . . that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result
of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients." Witters, supra, at 487; see Zobrest, supra, at 10 ("[A]
government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian
school only as a result of the private decision of individual
parents"). This characteristic of both programs made them
less like a direct subsidy, which would be impermissible
under the Establishment Clause, and more akin to the government issuing a paycheck to an employee who, in turn,
donates a portion of that check to a religious institution.
See, e. g., Witters, supra, at 486-487; see also Rosenberger,
supra, at 848 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing Witters).

842 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Recognizing this distinction, the plurality neverthelessfinds

Witters and Zobrest--to the extent those decisions
might permit the use of government aid for religious pur-poses--relevant in any case involving a neutral, per-capitaaid program. See ante, at 830-831. Like Justice Souter,I do not believe that we should treat a per-capita-aid program the same as the true private-choice programs considered in Witters and Zobrest. See post, at 902. First, whenthe government provides aid directly to the student beneficiary, that student can attend a religious school and yet re-tain control over whether the secular government aid will be
applied toward the religious education. The fact that aid
flows to the religious school and is used for the advancement
of religion is therefore wholly dependent on the student's
private decision. See Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 848 (O'Con-
nor, J., concurring) (discussing importance of private choice
in Witters); Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 ("[T]he fact that aid
goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State");
id., at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment) ("The aid to religion at issue here is the result
of petitioner's private choice"). It is for this reason that in
Agostini we relied on Witters and Zobrest to reject the rule
"that all government aid that directly assists the educational
function of religious schools is invalid," 521 U. S., at 225, yet
also rested our approval of New York City's Title I program
in part on the lack of evidence of actual diversion, id., at
226-227.

Second, I believe the distinction between a per capita
school aid program and a true private-choice program is significant for purposes of endorsement. See, e. g., Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 692 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). In terms of public perception, a government program
of direct aid to religious schools based on the number of students attending each school differs meaningfully from the
government distributing aid directly to individual students

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

843Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
who, in turn, decide to use the aid at the same religiousschools. In the former example, if the religious school uses

the aid to inculcate religion in its students, it is reasonableto say that the government has communicated a message of
endorsement. Because the religious indoctrination is sup-ported by government assistance, the reasonable observer
would naturally perceive the aid program as government
support for the advancement of religion. That the amountof aid received by the school is based on the school's enrollment does not separate the government from the endorse-ment of the religious message. The aid formula does not--
and could not--indicate to a reasonable observer that the
inculcation of religion is endorsed only by the individuals
attending the religious school, who each affirmatively choose
to direct the secular government aid to the school and its
religious mission. No such choices have been made. In
contrast, when government aid supports a school's religious
mission only because of independent decisions made by numerous individuals to guide their secular aid to that school,
"[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts . . .
an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious
practice or belief." Witters, supra, at 493 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Rather,
endorsement of the religious message is reasonably attributed to the individuals who select the path of the aid.

Finally, the distinction between a per-capita-aid program
and a true private-choice program is important when considering aid that consists of direct monetary subsidies. This
Court has "recognized special Establishment Clause dangers
where the government makes direct money payments to
sectarian institutions." Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842; see
also ibid. (collecting cases). If, as the plurality contends, a
per-capita-aid program is identical in relevant constitutional
respects to a true private-choice program, then there is no
reason that, under the plurality's reasoning, the government
should be precluded from providing direct money payments

844 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
to religious organizations (including churches) based on thenumber of persons belonging to each organization. And, because actual diversion is permissible under the plurality'sholding, the participating religious organizations (including
churches) could use that aid to support religious indoctrina-tion. To be sure, the plurality does not actually hold that
its theory extends to direct money payments. See ante,at 818-820. That omission, however, is of little comfort. In
its logic--as well as its specific advisory language, see ante,at 819-820, n. 8--the plurality opinion foreshadows the approval of direct monetary subsidies to religious organiza-tions, even when they use the money to advance their religious objectives.Our school aid cases often pose difficult questions at the
intersection of the neutrality and no-aid principles and there-fore defy simple categorization under either rule. As I
explained in Rosenberger, "[r]esolution instead depends onthe hard task of judging--sifting through the details and
determining whether the challenged program offends theEstablishment Clause. Such judgment requires courts to
draw lines, sometimes quite fine, based on the particularfacts of each case." 515 U. S., at 847 (concurring opinion).
Agostini represents our most recent attempt to devise a gen-eral framework for approaching questions concerning neutral school aid programs. Agostini also concerned an Es-tablishment Clause challenge to a school aid program closely
related to the one at issue here. For these reasons, as wellas my disagreement with the plurality's approach, I would
decide today's case by applying the criteria set forth inAgostini.

II
In Agostini, after reexamining our jurisprudence since
School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985),we explained that the general principles used to determine

whether government aid violates the Establishment Clausehave remained largely unchanged. 521 U. S., at 222. Thus,

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

845Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
we still ask "whether the government acted with the purposeof advancing or inhibiting religion" and "whether the aid has

the `effect' of advancing or inhibiting religion." Id., at 222-223. We also concluded in

Agostini, however, that the specific criteria used to determine whether government aid hasan impermissible effect had changed.

Id., at 223. Looking
to our recently decided cases, we articulated three primary
criteria to guide the determination whether a government-aid program impermissibly advances religion: (1) whether

the aid results in governmental indoctrination, (2) whetherthe aid program defines its recipients by reference to religion, and (3) whether the aid creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion. Id., at 234. Finally, we noted that the same criteria could be reviewed to
determine whether a government-aid program constitutes an
endorsement of religion. Id., at 235.

Respondents neither question the secular purpose of the
Chapter 2 (Title II) program nor contend that it creates an
excessive entanglement. (Due to its denomination as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act
of 1981, 95 Stat. 469, the parties refer to the 1965 Act's Title
II program, as modified by subsequent legislation, as "Chapter 2." For ease of reference, I will do the same.) Accordingly, for purposes of deciding whether Chapter 2, as applied
in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, violates the Establishment
Clause, we need ask only whether the program results in
governmental indoctrination or defines its recipients by reference to religion.

Taking the second inquiry first, it is clear that Chapter 2
does not define aid recipients by reference to religion. In
Agostini, we explained that scrutiny of the manner in which
a government-aid program identifies its recipients is important because "the criteria might themselves have the effect
of advancing religion by creating a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination." 521 U. S., at 231. We
then clarified that this financial incentive is not present

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
846 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
"where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secularcriteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made

available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on anondiscriminatory basis."

Ibid. Under Chapter 2, the
Secretary of Education allocates funds to the States basedon each State's share of the Nation's school-age population.

20 U. S. C. $ 7311(b). The state educational agency (SEA)
of each recipient State, in turn, must distribute the State'sChapter 2 funds to local educational agencies (LEA's)

"according to the relative enrollments in public and pri-vate, nonprofit schools within the school districts of such
agencies," adjusted to take into account those LEA's "which
have the greatest numbers or percentages of children whose
education imposes a higher than average cost per child."

$ 7312(a). The LEA must then expend those funds on "innovative assistance programs" designed to improve student
achievement. $ 7351(b). The statute generally requires
that an LEA ensure the "equitable participation" of children
enrolled in private nonprofit elementary and secondary
schools, $ 7372(a)(1), and specifically mandates that all LEA
expenditures on behalf of children enrolled in private schools
"be equal (consistent with the number of children to be
served) to expenditures for programs . . . for children enrolled in the public schools of the [LEA]," $ 7372(b). As
these statutory provisions make clear, Chapter 2 uses wholly
neutral and secular criteria to allocate aid to students
enrolled in religious and secular schools alike. As a result,
it creates no financial incentive to undertake religious
indoctrination.

Agostini next requires us to ask whether Chapter 2 "result[s] in governmental indoctrination." 521 U. S., at 234.
Because this is a more complex inquiry under our case law,
it is useful first to review briefly the basis for our decision
in Agostini that New York City's Title I program did not result in governmental indoctrination. Under that program,
public-school teachers provided Title I instruction to eligible

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

847Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
students on private school premises during regular schoolhours. Twelve years earlier, in

Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S.
402 (1985), we had held the same New York City programunconstitutional. In

Ball, a companion case to Aguilar, we
also held that a similar program in Grand Rapids, Michigan,violated the Constitution. Our decisions in

Aguilar and
Ball were both based on a presumption, drawn in large part
from Meek, see 421 U. S., at 367-373, that public-schoolinstructors who teach secular classes on the campuses of

religious schools will inevitably inculcate religion in theirstudents.

In Agostini, we recognized that "[o]ur more recent cases
[had] undermined the assumptions upon which Ball and
Aguilar relied." 521 U. S., at 222. First, we explained that
the Court had since abandoned "the presumption erected in
Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on
parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a
symbolic union between government and religion." Id., at
223. Rather, relying on Zobrest, we explained that in the
absence of evidence showing that teachers were actually
using the Title I aid to inculcate religion, we would presume
that the instructors would comply with the program's secular restrictions. See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-

227. The Title I services were required by statute to be
" `secular, neutral, and nonideological.' " Id., at 210 (quoting
20 U. S. C. $ 6321(a)(2)).

Second, we noted that the Court had "departed from the
rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly
assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid." Agostini, supra, at 225. Relying on Witters and
Zobrest, we noted that our cases had taken a more forgiving
view of neutral government programs that make aid available generally without regard to the religious or nonreligious character of the recipient school. See Agostini, 521
U. S., at 225-226. With respect to the specific Title I pro530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
848 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
gram at issue, we noted several factors that precluded usfrom finding an impermissible financing of religious indoctrination: the aid was "provided to students at whatever schoolthey choose to attend," the services were "by law supplemental to the regular curricula" of the benefited schools,"[n]o Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools,"
and there was no evidence of Title I instructors having "attempted to inculcate religion in students." Id., at 226-228.Relying on the same factors, we also concluded that the New

York City program could not "reasonably be viewed as anendorsement of religion."

Id., at 235. Although we found
it relevant that Title I services could not be provided on a
schoolwide basis, we also explained that this fact was likely a
sufficient rather than a necessary condition of the program's
constitutionality. We were not "willing to conclude that the
constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number
of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid." Id., at 229.

The Chapter 2 program at issue here bears the same hallmarks of the New York City Title I program that we found
important in Agostini. First, as explained above, Chapter
2 aid is distributed on the basis of neutral, secular criteria.
The aid is available to assist students regardless of whether
they attend public or private nonprofit religious schools.
Second, the statute requires participating SEA's and LEA's
to use and allocate Chapter 2 funds only to supplement the
funds otherwise available to a religious school. 20 U. S. C.

$ 7371(b). Chapter 2 funds must in no case be used to
supplant funds from non-Federal sources. Ibid. Third, no
Chapter 2 funds ever reach the coffers of a religious school.
Like the Title I program considered in Agostini, all Chapter
2 funds are controlled by public agencies--the SEA's and
LEA's. $ 7372(c)(1). The LEA's purchase instructional and
educational materials and then lend those materials to public
and private schools. See $$ 7351(a), (b)(2). With respect
to lending to private schools under Chapter 2, the statute

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

849Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
specifically provides that the relevant public agency mustretain title to the materials and equipment. $ 7372(c)(1).

Together with the supplantation restriction, this provisionensures that religious schools reap no financial benefit
by virtue of receiving loans of materials and equipment.Finally, the statute provides that all Chapter 2 materials
and equipment must be "secular, neutral, and nonideologi-cal." $ 7372(a)(1). That restriction is reinforced by a further statutory prohibition on "the making of any payment . . .for religious worship or instruction." $ 8897. Although
respondents claim that Chapter 2 aid has been divertedto religious instruction, that evidence is

de minimis, as Iexplain at greater length below. See infra, at 864-867.

III
Respondents contend that Agostini is distinguishable,pointing to the distinct character of the aid program considered there. See Brief for Respondents 44-47. In Agostini,federal funds paid for public-school teachers to provide secular instruction to eligible children on the premises of theirreligious schools. Here, in contrast, federal funds pay for
instructional materials and equipment that LEA's lend to re-ligious schools for use by those schools' own teachers in their
classes. Because we held similar programs unconstitutionalin

Meek and Wolman, respondents contend that those deci-sions, and not Agostini, are controlling. See, e. g., Brief for

Respondents 11, 22-25. Like respondents, Justice Souteralso relies on Meek and Wolman in finding the character of
the Chapter 2 aid constitutionally problematic. See post, at893, 903.

At the time they were decided, Meek and Wolman createdan inexplicable rift within our Establishment Clause jurisprudence concerning government aid to schools. Sevenyears before our decision in Meek, we held in Allen that a
New York statute that authorized the lending of textbooksto students attending religious schools did not violate the

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
850 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Establishment Clause. 392 U. S., at 238. We explainedthat the statute "merely [made] available to all children the

benefits of a general program to lend school books free ofcharge," that the State retained ownership of the textbooks,
and that religious schools received no financial benefit fromthe program. Id., at 243-244. We specifically rejected the
contrary argument that the statute violated the Establish-ment Clause because textbooks are critical to the teaching
process, which in a religious school is employed to inculcatereligion.

Id., at 245-248.In Meek and Wolman, we adhered to Allen, holding that

the textbook lending programs at issue in each case did notviolate the Establishment Clause. See Meek, 421 U. S.,
at 359-362 (plurality opinion); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 236-238 (plurality opinion). At the same time, however, we held
in both cases that the lending of instructional materialsand equipment to religious schools was unconstitutional.
See Meek, supra, at 362-366; Wolman, supra, at 248-251.We reasoned that, because the religious schools receiving the
materials and equipment were pervasively sectarian, any as-sistance in support of the schools' educational missions would
inevitably have the impermissible effect of advancing reli-gion. For example, in

Meek we explained:

"[I]t would simply ignore reality to attempt to separatesecular educational functions from the predominantly

religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania'schurch-related elementary and secondary schools and to
then characterize [the statute] as channeling aid to thesecular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.
Even though earmarked for secular purposes, `when itflows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive
that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumedin the religious mission,' state aid has the impermissible
primary effect of advancing religion." 421 U. S., at365-366 (quoting

Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743(1973)).

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

851Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Thus, we held that the aid program "necessarily results inaid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole," and "

inescapably results in the direct and substantial advancement ofreligious activity."

Meek, supra, at 366 (emphases added).
Similarly, in Wolman, we concluded that, "[i]n view of theimpossibility of separating the secular education function

from the sectarian, the state aid inevitably flows in part in
support of the religious role of the schools." 433 U. S., at250 (emphasis added).

For whatever reason, the Court was not willing to extendthis presumption of inevitable religious indoctrination to
school aid when it instead consisted of textbooks lent free of
charge. For example, in Meek, despite identifying the religious schools' secular educational functions and religious
missions as inextricably intertwined, 421 U. S., at 366, the
Court upheld the textbook lending program because "the
record in the case . . . , like the record in Allen, contains no
suggestion that religious textbooks will be lent or that the
books provided will be used for anything other than purely
secular purposes," id., at 361-362 (citation omitted). Accordingly, while the Court was willing to apply an irrebuttable presumption that secular instructional materials and
equipment would be diverted to use for religious indoctrination, it required evidence that religious schools were diverting secular textbooks to religious instruction.

The inconsistency between the two strands of the Court's
jurisprudence did not go unnoticed, as Justices on both sides
of the Meek and Wolman decisions relied on the contradiction to support their respective arguments. See, e. g., Meek,
421 U. S., at 384 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[W]hat the Court says of the instructional
materials and equipment may be said perhaps even more
accurately of the textbooks" (citation omitted)); id., at 390
(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) ("The failure of the majority to justify the differing approaches to textbooks and instructional materials and

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
852 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
equipment in the above respect is symptomatic of its failureeven to attempt to distinguish the . . . textbook loan program,

which the plurality upholds, from the . . . instructional mate-rials and equipment loan program, which the majority finds
unconstitutional"). The irrationality of this distinction ispatent. As one Member of our Court has noted, it has
meant that "a State may lend to parochial school children
geography textbooks that contain maps of the United States,but the State may not lend maps of the United States for

use in geography class." Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38,110 (1985) (

Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted).
Indeed, technology's advance since the Allen, Meek, and
Wolman decisions has only made the distinction between
textbooks and instructional materials and equipment more
suspect. In this case, for example, we are asked to draw
a constitutional line between lending textbooks and lending computers. Because computers constitute instructional
equipment, adherence to Meek and Wolman would require
the exclusion of computers from any government school aid
program that includes religious schools. Yet, computers are
now as necessary as were schoolbooks 30 years ago, and they
play a somewhat similar role in the educational process.
That Allen, Meek, and Wolman would permit the constitutionality of a school aid program to turn on whether the aid
took the form of a computer rather than a book further reveals the inconsistency inherent in their logic.

Respondents insist that there is a reasoned basis under
the Establishment Clause for the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment. They
claim that the presumption that religious schools will use
instructional materials and equipment to inculcate religion
is sound because such materials and equipment, unlike textbooks, are reasonably divertible to religious uses. For
example, no matter what secular criteria the government
employs in selecting a film projector to lend to a religious
school, school officials can always divert that projector to re530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

853Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
ligious instruction. Respondents therefore claim that theEstablishment Clause prohibits the government from giving

or lending aid to religious schools when that aid is reasonablydivertible to religious uses. See,

e. g., Brief for Respondents
11, 35. Justice Souter also states that the divertibility ofsecular government aid is an important consideration under

the Establishment Clause, although he apparently would not
ascribe it the constitutionally determinative status that re-spondents do. See

post, at 885, 890-895.
I would reject respondents' proposed divertibility rule.First, respondents cite no precedent of this Court that would

require it. The only possible direct precedential support for
such a rule is a single sentence contained in a footnote from
our Wolman decision. There, the Court described Allen as
having been "premised on the view that the educational content of textbooks is something that can be ascertained in
advance and cannot be diverted to sectarian uses." Wolman, supra, at 251, n. 18. To the extent this simple description of Allen is even correct, it certainly does not constitute
an actual holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits
the government from lending any divertible aid to religious
schools. Rather, as explained above, the Wolman Court
based its holding invalidating the lending of instructional
materials and equipment to religious schools on the rationale
adopted in Meek--that the secular educational function of a
religious school is inseparable from its religious mission.
See Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250. Indeed, if anything, the Wolman footnote confirms the irrationality of the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment.
After the Wolman Court acknowledged that its holding with
respect to instructional materials and equipment was in tension with Allen, the Court explained the continuing validity
of Allen solely on the basis of stare decisis: "Board of Education v. Allen has remained law, and we now follow as a matter of stare decisis the principle that restriction of textbooks
to those provided the public schools is sufficient to ensure

854 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
that the books will not be used for religious purposes."
Wolman, supra, at 252, n. 18. Thus, the Wolman Court
never justified the inconsistent treatment it accordedthe lending of textbooks and the lending of instructional

materials and equipment based on the items' reasonabledivertibility.

Justice Souter's attempt to defend the divertibility rationale as a viable distinction in our Establishment Clausejurisprudence fares no better. For

Justice Souter, secular school aid presents constitutional problems not only whenit is actually diverted to religious ends, but also when it simply has the capacity for, or presents the possibility of, such
diversion. See, e. g., post, at 893 (discussing "susceptibility
[of secular supplies] to the service of religious ends"). Thus,
he explains the Allen, Meek, and Wolman decisions as follows: "While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular
content not readily divertible to religious teaching purposes,
the adaptable materials did not." Post, at 893-894. This
view would have come as a surprise to the Court in Meek,
which expressly conceded that "the material and equipment
that are the subjects of the loan . . . are `self-polic[ing], in
that starting as secular, nonideological and neutral, they will
not change in use.' " 421 U. S., at 365 (quoting Meek v. Pittenger, 374 F. Supp. 639, 660 (ED Pa. 1974)). Indeed, given
the nature of the instructional materials considered in Meek
and Wolman, it is difficult to comprehend how a divertibility
rationale could have explained the decisions. The statutes
at issue in those cases authorized the lending of "periodicals,
photographs, maps, charts, sound recordings, [and] films,"
Meek, supra, at 355, and "maps and globes," Wolman, supra,
at 249. There is no plausible basis for saying that these
items are somehow more divertible than a textbook given
that each of the above items, like a textbook, has a fixed and
ascertainable content.

In any event, even if Meek and Wolman had articulated
the divertibility rationale urged by respondents and Justice

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

855Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Souter, I would still reject it for a more fundamental rea-son. Stated simply, the theory does not provide a logical

distinction between the lending of textbooks and the lendingof instructional materials and equipment. An educator can
use virtually any instructional tool, whether it has ascertain-able content or not, to teach a religious message. In this
respect, I agree with the plurality that "it is hard to imagine
any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands,serve to illustrate a religious message."

Ante, at 823. In
today's case, for example, we are asked to draw a constitu-tional distinction between lending a textbook and lending

a library book. Justice Souter's try at justifying that
distinction only demonstrates the absurdity on which such
a difference must rest. He states that "[a]lthough library
books, like textbooks, have fixed content, religious teachers
can assign secular library books for religious critique."
Post, at 903. Regardless of whether that explanation is
even correct (for a student surely could be given a religious
assignment in connection with a textbook too), it is hardly a
distinction on which constitutional law should turn. Moreover, if the mere ability of a teacher to devise a religious
lesson involving the secular aid in question suffices to hold
the provision of that aid unconstitutional, it is difficult to
discern any limiting principle to the divertibility rule. For
example, even a publicly financed lunch would apparently
be unconstitutional under a divertibility rationale because
religious school officials conceivably could use the lunch to
lead the students in a blessing over the bread. See Brief
for Avi Chai Foundation as Amicus Curiae 18.

To the extent Justice Souter believes several related
Establishment Clause decisions require application of a divertibility rule in the context of this case, I respectfully disagree. Justice Souter is correct to note our continued
recognition of the special dangers associated with direct
money grants to religious institutions. See post, at 890-893.
It does not follow, however, that we should treat as constitu530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
856 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
tionally suspect any form of secular aid that might conceiv-ably be diverted to a religious use. As the cases

Justice
Souter cites demonstrate, our concern with direct monetaryaid is based on more than just diversion. In fact, the most

important reason for according special treatment to directmoney grants is that this form of aid falls precariously close
to the original object of the Establishment Clause's prohibition. See, e. g., Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York,397 U. S. 664, 668 (1970) ("[F]or the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment the `establishment' ofa religion connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active
involvement of the sovereign in religious activity"). State-ments concerning the constitutionally suspect status of direct cash aid, accordingly, provide no justification for apply-ing an absolute rule against divertibility when the aid
consists instead of instructional materials and equipment.

Justice Souter also relies on our decisions in Wolman
(to the extent it concerned field-trip transportation for non-public schools),

Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973), Tilton v. Richardson, 403
U. S. 672 (1971), and Bowen. See post, at 893-895. Nonerequires application of a divertibility rule in the context of

this case. Wolman and Levitt were both based on the same
presumption that government aid will be used in the inculcation of religion that we have chosen not to apply to textbook
lending programs and that we have more generally rejected
in recent decisions. Compare Wolman, 433 U. S., at 254;
Levitt, supra, at 480, with supra, at 851-852; infra, at 859.
In Tilton, we considered a federal statute that authorized
grants to universities for the construction of buildings and
facilities to be used exclusively for secular educational purposes. See 403 U. S., at 674-675. We held the statute unconstitutional only to the extent that a university's "obligation not to use the facility for sectarian instruction or
religious worship . . . appear[ed] to expire at the end of 20
years." Id., at 683. To hold a statute unconstitutional because it lacks a secular content restriction is quite different

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

857Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
from resting on a divertibility rationale. Indeed, the factthat we held the statute constitutional in all other respects

is more probative on the divertibility question because itdemonstrates our willingness to presume that the university
would abide by the secular content restriction during theyears the requirement was in effect. In any event, Chapter
2 contains both a secular content restriction, 20 U. S. C.$ 7372(a)(1), and a prohibition on the use of aid for religious
worship or instruction, $ 8897, so Tilton provides no basisfor upholding respondents' challenge. Finally, our decision
in Bowen proves only that actual diversion, as opposed tomere divertibility, is constitutionally impermissible. See,
e. g., 487 U. S., at 621. Had we believed that the divertibilityof secular aid was sufficient to call the aid program into question, there would have been no need for the remand we or-dered and no basis for the reversal.

IV
Because divertibility fails to explain the distinction ourcases have drawn between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment, there remains the question of which ofthe two irreconcilable strands of our Establishment Clause
jurisprudence we should now follow. Between the two,I would adhere to the rule that we have applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a FirstAmendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid in
question actually is, or has been, used for religious purposes.See Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362; Allen, 392 U. S., at 248.
Just as we held in Agostini that our more recent cases hadundermined the assumptions underlying Ball and Aguilar,
I would now hold that Agostini and the cases on which itrelied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek
and Wolman. To be sure, Agostini only addressed the spe-cific presumption that public-school employees teaching on
the premises of religious schools would inevitably inculcatereligion. Nevertheless, I believe that our definitive rejection of that presumption also stood for--or at least strongly

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
858 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
pointed to--the broader proposition that such presumptions
of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when
evaluating neutral school aid programs under the Establishment Clause. In Agostini, we repeatedly emphasized that
it would be inappropriate to presume inculcation of religion;
rather, plaintiffs raising an Establishment Clause challenge
must present evidence that the government aid in question
has resulted in religious indoctrination. See 521 U. S., at
223-224, 226-227. We specifically relied on our statement
in Zobrest that a presumption of indoctrination, because it
constitutes an absolute bar to the aid in question regardless
of the religious school's ability to separate that aid from its
religious mission, constitutes a "flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of `taint,' [that] would indeed exalt form over
substance." 509 U. S., at 13. That reasoning applies with
equal force to the presumption in Meek and Ball concerning
instructional materials and equipment. As we explained in
Agostini, "we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball
that all government aid that directly assists the educational
function of religious schools is invalid." 521 U. S., at 225.

Respondents contend that Agostini should be limited to
its facts, and point specifically to the following statement
from my separate opinion in Ball as the basis for retaining
a presumption of religious inculcation for instructional materials and equipment:

"When full-time parochial school teachers receive public
funds to teach secular courses to their parochial school
students under parochial school supervision, I agree that
the program has the perceived and actual effect of advancing the religious aims of the church-related schools.
This is particularly the case where, as here, religion pervades the curriculum and the teachers are accustomed
to bring religion to play in everything they teach." 473
U. S., at 399-400 (concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part).

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

859Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Respondents note that in Agostini we did not overrule thatportion of

Ball holding the Community Education program
unconstitutional. Under that program, the government paidreligious school teachers to operate as part-time public

teachers at their religious schools by teaching secular classesat the conclusion of the regular schoolday.

Ball, 473 U. S.,
at 376-377. Relying on both the majority opinion and my
separate opinion in Ball, respondents therefore contend thatwe must presume that religious school teachers will inculcate religion in their students. If that is so, they argue, wemust also presume that religious school teachers will be unable to follow secular restrictions on the use of instructional
materials and equipment lent to their schools by the government. See Brief for Respondents 26-29.

I disagree, however, that the latter proposition follows
from the former. First, as our holding in Allen and its reaffirmance in Meek and Wolman demonstrate, the Court's willingness to assume that religious school instructors will inculcate religion has not caused us to presume also that such
instructors will be unable to follow secular restrictions on
the use of textbooks. I would similarly reject any such presumption regarding the use of instructional materials and
equipment. When a religious school receives textbooks or
instructional materials and equipment lent with secular restrictions, the school's teachers need not refrain from teaching religion altogether. Rather, the instructors need only
ensure that any such religious teaching is done without the
instructional aids provided by the government. We have always been willing to assume that religious school instructors
can abide by such restrictions when the aid consists of textbooks, which Justice Brennan described as "surely the heart
tools of . . . education." Meek, supra, at 384 (concurring in
part and dissenting in part). The same assumption should
extend to instructional materials and equipment.

For the same reason, my position in Ball is distinguishable.
There, the government paid for religious school instructors

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
860 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
to teach classes supplemental to those offered during thenormal schoolday. In that context, I was willing to presume

that the religious school teacher who works throughout theday to advance the school's religious mission would also do
so, at least to some extent, during the supplemental classesprovided at the end of the day. Because the government
financed the entirety of such classes, any religious indoctri-nation taking place therein would be directly attributable to
the government. In the instant case, because the Chapter2 aid concerns only teaching tools that must remain supplementary, the aid constitutes only a portion of the teacher'seducational efforts during any single class. In this context,
I find it easier to believe that a religious school teacher canabide by the secular restrictions placed on the government
assistance. I therefore would not presume that the Chapter2 aid will advance, or be perceived to advance, the school's
religious mission. V

Respondents do not rest, however, on their divertibilityargument alone. Rather, they also contend that the evidence respecting the actual administration of Chapter 2 inJefferson Parish demonstrates that the program violated the
Establishment Clause. First, respondents claim that theprogram's safeguards are insufficient to uncover instances
of actual diversion. Brief for Respondents 37, 42-43, 45-47. Second, they contend that the record shows that some
religious schools in Jefferson Parish may have used theirChapter 2 aid to support religious education (i. e., that
they diverted the aid). Id., at 36-37. Third, respondentshighlight violations of Chapter 2's secular content restrictions. Id., at 39-41. And, finally, they note isolated exam-ples of potential violations of Chapter 2's supplantation restriction. Id., at 43-44. Based on the evidence underlyingthe first and second claims, the plurality appears to contend
that the Chapter 2 program can be upheld only if actualdiversion of government aid to the advancement of religion

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

861Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
is permissible under the Establishment Clause. See ante,at 832-834. Relying on the evidence underlying all but the

last of the above claims, Justice Souter concludes that theChapter 2 program, as applied in Jefferson Parish, violated
the Establishment Clause. See post, at 902-910. I dis-agree with both the plurality and

Justice Souter. The
limited evidence amassed by respondents during 4 years of
discovery (which began approximately 15 years ago) is atbest

de minimis and therefore insufficient to affect the constitutional inquiry.The plurality and

Justice Souter direct the primary
thrust of their arguments at the alleged inadequacy of the
program's safeguards. Respondents, the plurality, and Jus-
tice Souter all appear to proceed from the premise that, so
long as actual diversion presents a constitutional problem,
the government must have a failsafe mechanism capable of
detecting any instance of diversion. We rejected that very
assumption, however, in Agostini. There, we explained that
because we had "abandoned the assumption that properly
instructed public employees will fail to discharge their duties
faithfully, we must also discard the assumption that pervasive monitoring of Title I teachers is required." 521 U. S.,
at 234 (emphasis in original). Because I believe that the
Court should abandon the presumption adopted in Meek and
Wolman respecting the use of instructional materials and
equipment by religious school teachers, I see no constitutional need for pervasive monitoring under the Chapter 2
program.

The safeguards employed by the program are constitutionally sufficient. At the federal level, the statute limits aid to
"secular, neutral, and nonideological services, materials, and
equipment," 20 U. S. C. $ 7372(a)(1); requires that the aid only
supplement and not supplant funds from non-Federal
sources, $ 7371(b); and prohibits "any payment . . . for religious worship or instruction," $ 8897. At the state level, the
Louisiana Department of Education (the relevant SEA for

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
862 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Louisiana) requires all nonpublic schools to submit signedassurances that they will use Chapter 2 aid only to supplement and not to supplant non-Federal funds, and that theinstructional materials and equipment "will only be used for
secular, neutral and nonideological purposes." App. 260a-261a; see also

id., at 120a. Although there is some dispute
concerning the mandatory nature of these assurances, Dan
Lewis, the director of Louisiana's Chapter 2 program, testi-fied that all of the State's nonpublic schools had thus far been

willing to sign the assurances, and that the State retainedthe power to cut off aid to any school that breached an assurance. Id., at 122a-123a. The Louisiana SEA also conducts
monitoring visits to each of the State's LEA's--and one or
two of the nonpublic schools covered by the relevant LEA--
once every three years. Id., at 95a-96a. In addition to
other tasks performed on such visits, SEA representatives
conduct a random review of a school's library books for religious content. Id., at 99a.

At the local level, the Jefferson Parish Public School System (JPPSS) requires nonpublic schools seeking Chapter 2
aid to submit applications, complete with specific project
plans, for approval. Id., at 127a; id., at 194a-203a (sample
application). The JPPSS then conducts annual monitoring
visits to each of the nonpublic schools receiving Chapter 2
aid. Id., at 141a-142a. On each visit, a JPPSS representative meets with a contact person from the nonpublic school
and reviews with that person the school's project plan and
the manner in which the school has used the Chapter 2 materials and equipment to support its plan. Id., at 142a, 149a.
The JPPSS representative also reminds the contact person
of the prohibition on the use of Chapter 2 aid for religious
purposes, id., at 149a, and conducts a random sample of the
school's Chapter 2 materials and equipment to ensure that
they are appropriately labeled and that the school has maintained a record of their usage, id., at 142a-144a. (Although
the plurality and Justice Souter claim that compliance

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

863Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
with the labeling requirement was haphazard, both cite onlya statewide monitoring report that includes no specific findings with respect to Jefferson Parish. Ante, at 832-833 (cit-ing App. 113a);

post, at 906 (same).) Finally, the JPPSS
representative randomly selects library books the nonpublicschool has acquired through Chapter 2 and reviews their

content to ensure that they comply with the program's secular content restriction. App. 210a. If the monitoring doesnot satisfy the JPPSS representative, another visit is scheduled. Id., at 151a-152a. Apart from conducting monitoringvisits, the JPPSS reviews Chapter 2 requests filed by participating nonpublic schools. As part of this process, a JPPSS
employee examines the titles of requested library books and
rejects any book whose title reveals (or suggests) a religious
subject matter. Id., at 135a, 137a-138a. As the above description of the JPPSS monitoring process should make clear,
Justice Souter's citation of a statewide report finding a
lack of monitoring in some Louisiana LEA's is irrelevant as
far as Jefferson Parish is concerned. See post, at 906 (quoting App. 111a).

Respondents, the plurality, and Justice Souter all fault
the above-described safeguards primarily because they depend on the good faith of participating religious school officials. For example, both the plurality and Justice Souter
repeatedly cite testimony by state and parish officials acknowledging that the safeguards depend to a certain extent
on the religious schools' self-reporting and that, therefore,
there is no way for the State or Jefferson Parish to say definitively that no Chapter 2 aid is diverted to religious purposes. See, e. g., ante, at 832-833, n. 15; post, at 906-907.
These admissions, however, do not prove that the safeguards
are inadequate. To find that actual diversion will flourish,
one must presume bad faith on the part of the religious
school officials who report to the JPPSS monitors regarding
the use of Chapter 2 aid. I disagree with the plurality and
Justice Souter on this point and believe that it is entirely

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
864 MITCHELL v. HELMS

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
proper to presume that these school officials will act in goodfaith. That presumption is especially appropriate in this

case, since there is no proof that religious school officialshave breached their schools' assurances or failed to tell government officials the truth. Cf. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 679("A possibility always exists, of course, that the legitimate
objectives of any law or legislative program may be subverted by conscious design or lax enforcement. . . . But judi-cial concern about these possibilities cannot, standing alone,

warrant striking down a statute as unconstitutional").The evidence proffered by respondents, and relied on by
the plurality and Justice Souter, concerning actual diversion of Chapter 2 aid in Jefferson Parish is de minimis. Respondents first cite the following statement from a Jefferson
Parish religious school teacher: "Audio-visual materials are a
very necessary and enjoyable tool used when teaching young
children. As a second grade teacher I use them in all subjects and see a very positive result." App. 108a. Respondents' only other evidence consists of a chart concerning one
Jefferson Parish religious school, which shows that the
school's theology department was a significant user of audiovisual equipment. See id., at 206a-208a. Although an accompanying letter indicates that much of the school's equipment was purchased with federal funds, id., at 205a, the
chart does not provide a breakdown identifying specific
Chapter 2 usage. Indeed, unless we are to relieve respondents of their evidentiary burden and presume a violation
of Chapter 2, we should assume that the school used its
own equipment in the theology department and the Chapter
2 equipment elsewhere. The more basic point, however,
is that neither piece of evidence demonstrates that Chapter
2 aid actually was diverted to religious education. At most,
it proves the possibility that, out of the more than 40 nonpublic schools in Jefferson Parish participating in Chapter 2, aid
may have been diverted in one school's second-grade class
and another school's theology department.

865Cite as: 530 U. S. 793 (2000)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
The plurality's insistence that this evidence is somehowsubstantial flatly contradicts its willingness to disregard similarly insignificant evidence of violations of Chapter 2's sup-plantation and secular content restrictions. See

ante, at
815, n. 7 (finding no "material statutory violation" of the sup-plantation restriction);

ante, at 835 (characterizing violations
of secular content restriction as "scattered" and "de minimis"). As I shall explain below, I believe the evidence onall three points is equally insignificant and, therefore, should

be treated the same.

Justice Souter also relies on testimony by one religious
school principal indicating that a computer lent to her school
under Chapter 2 was connected through a network to nonChapter 2 computers. See post, at 910 (citing App. 77a).
The principal testified that the Chapter 2 computer would
take over the network if another non-Chapter 2 computer
were to break down. Ibid. To the extent the principal's
testimony even proves that Chapter 2 funds were diverted
to the school's religious mission, the evidence is hardly
compelling.

Justice Souter contends that any evidence of actual diversion requires the Court to declare the Chapter 2 program
unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish. Post, at 909,
n. 27. For support, he quotes my concurring opinion in
Bowen and the statement therein that "any use of public
funds to promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment Clause." 487 U. S., at 623 (emphasis in original).
That principle of course remains good law, but the next sentence in my opinion is more relevant to the case at hand:
"[E]xtensive violations--if they can be proved in this case--
will be highly relevant in shaping an appropriate remedy
that ends such abuses." Ibid. (emphasis in original). I
know of no case in which we have declared an entire aid
program unconstitutional on Establishment Clause grounds
solely because of violations on the minuscule scale of those
at issue here. Yet that is precisely the remedy respondents

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
requested from the District Court and that they were
granted by the Court of Appeals. See App. 51a; Helms v.
Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 377 (CA5 1998), amended, 165 F. 3d
311, 312 (CA5 1999). While extensive violations might require a remedy along the lines asked for by respondents, no
such evidence has been presented here. To the contrary, the
presence of so few examples over a period of at least 4 years
(15 years ago) tends to show not that the "no-diversion" rules
have failed, but that they have worked. Accordingly, I see
no reason to affirm the judgment below and thereby declare
a properly functioning aid program unconstitutional.

Respondents' next evidentiary argument concerns an admitted violation of Chapter 2's secular content restriction.
Over three years, Jefferson Parish religious schools ordered
approximately 191 religious library books through Chapter
2. App. 129a-133a. Dan Lewis, the director of Louisiana's
Chapter 2 program, testified that he discovered some of the
religious books while performing a random check during a
state monitoring visit to a Jefferson Parish religious school.
Id., at 99a-100a. The discovery prompted the State to notify the JPPSS, which then reexamined book requests dating
back to 1982, discovered the 191 books in question, and recalled them. Id., at 130a-133a. This series of events demonstrates not that the Chapter 2 safeguards are inadequate,
but rather that the program's monitoring system succeeded.
Even if I were instead willing to find this incident to be evidence of a likelihood of future violations, the evidence is insignificant. The 191 books constituted less than one percent
of the total allocation of Chapter 2 aid in Jefferson Parish
during the relevant years. Id., at 132a. Justice Souter
understandably concedes that the book incident constitutes
"only limited evidence." Post, at 909. I agree with the
plurality that, like the above evidence of actual diversion,
the borrowing of the religious library books constitutes only
de minimis evidence. See ante, at 835.

Souter, J., dissenting
Respondents' last evidentiary challenge concerns the ef-fectiveness of Chapter 2's supplantation restriction in Jefferson Parish. Although Justice Souter does not rest hisdecision on this point, he does "not[e] the likelihood that unconstitutional supplantation occurred as well." Post, at 910,n. 28. I disagree. The evidence cited by respondents and
Justice Souter is too ambiguous to rest any sound conclu-sions on and, at best, shows some scattered violations of the
statutory supplantation restriction that are too insignificantin aggregate to affect the constitutional inquiry. Indeed,
even Justice Souter concedes in this respect that "[t]herecord is sparse."

Post, at 911, n. 28.

* * *
Given the important similarities between the Chapter 2program here and the Title I program at issue in

Agostini,respondents' Establishment Clause challenge must fail. As

in Agostini, the Chapter 2 aid is allocated on the basis ofneutral, secular criteria; the aid must be supplementary and
cannot supplant non-Federal funds; no Chapter 2 funds everreach the coffers of religious schools; the aid must be secular;
any evidence of actual diversion is de minimis; and the pro-gram includes adequate safeguards. Regardless of whether
these factors are constitutional requirements, they are surelysufficient to find that the program at issue here does not
have the impermissible effect of advancing religion. For thesame reasons, "this carefully constrained program also cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion."
Agostini, 521 U. S., at 235. Accordingly, I concur in thejudgment.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibitsCongress (and, by incorporation, the States) from making

any law respecting an establishment of religion. It has been

Souter, J., dissenting
held to prohibit not only the institution of an official church,but any government act favoring religion, a particular religion, or for that matter irreligion. Thus, it bars the use ofpublic funds for religious aid.

The establishment prohibition of government religiousfunding serves more than one end. It is meant to guarantee
the right of individual conscience against compulsion, to protect the integrity of religion against the corrosion of secularsupport, and to preserve the unity of political society against

the implied exclusion of the less favored and the antagonismof controversy over public support for religious causes.

These objectives are always in some jeopardy since the
substantive principle of no aid to religion is not the only limitation on government action toward religion. Because the
First Amendment also bars any prohibition of individual free
exercise of religion, and because religious organizations cannot be isolated from the basic government functions that create the civil environment, it is as much necessary as it is
difficult to draw lines between forbidden aid and lawful benefit. For more than 50 years, this Court has been attempting
to draw these lines. Owing to the variety of factual circumstances in which the lines must be drawn, not all of the
points creating the boundary have enjoyed self-evidence.

So far as the line drawn has addressed government aid to
education, a few fundamental generalizations are nonetheless possible. There may be no aid supporting a sectarian
school's religious exercise or the discharge of its religious
mission, while aid of a secular character with no discernible
benefit to such a sectarian objective is allowable. Because
the religious and secular spheres largely overlap in the life
of many such schools, the Court has tried to identify some
facts likely to reveal the relative religious or secular intent
or effect of the government benefits in particular circumstances. We have asked whether the government is acting
neutrally in distributing its money, and about the form of the
aid itself, its path from government to religious institution,

its divertibility to religious nurture, its potential for reduc-ing traditional expenditures of religious institutions, and its

relative importance to the recipient, among other things.In all the years of its effort, the Court has isolated no
single test of constitutional sufficiency, and the question inevery case addresses the substantive principle of no aid:
what reasons are there to characterize this benefit as aidto the sectarian school in discharging its religious mission?
Particular factual circumstances control, and the answer is amatter of judgment.

In what follows I will flesh out this summary, for this casecomes at a time when our judgment requires perspective on
how the Establishment Clause has come to be understoodand applied. It is not just that a majority today mistakes
the significance of facts that have led to conclusions of uncon-stitutionality in earlier cases, though I believe the Court
commits error in failing to recognize the divertibility offunds to the service of religious objectives. What is more
important is the view revealed in the plurality opinion, whichespouses a new conception of neutrality as a practically sufficient test of constitutionality that would, if adopted by theCourt, eliminate enquiry into a law's effects. The plurality
position breaks fundamentally with Establishment Clauseprinciple, and with the methodology painstakingly worked
out in support of it. I mean to revisit that principle anddescribe the methodology at some length, lest there be any
question about the rupture that the plurality view wouldcause. From that new view of the law, and from a majority's
mistaken application of the old, I respectfully dissent.

The prohibition that "Congress shall make no law respect-ing an establishment of religion," U. S. Const., Amdt. 1,

prompted challenges to programs ranging from constructionsubsidies to hearing aids to textbook loans. Any criteria,

moreover, must not only define the margins of the establish-ment prohibition, but must respect the succeeding Clause of
the First Amendment guaranteeing religion's free exercise.Ibid. It is no wonder that the complementary constitutional
provisions and the inexhaustably various circumstances oftheir applicability have defied any simple test and have instead produced a combination of general rules often in ten-sion at their edges. If coherence is to be had, the Court
has to keep in mind the principal objectives served by theEstablishment Clause, and its application to school aid, and
their recollection may help to explain the misunderstandingsthat underlie the majority's result in this case.

A
At least three concerns have been expressed since thefounding and run throughout our First Amendment jurisprudence. First, compelling an individual to support religionviolates the fundamental principle of freedom of conscience.
Madison's and Jefferson's now familiar words establishclearly that liberty of personal conviction requires freedom
from coercion to support religion,1 and this means that thegovernment can compel no aid to fund it. Madison put it
simply: "[T]he same authority which can force a citizen to

of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 870-872 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting). We
have "previously recognized that the provisions of the First Amendment,
in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson played such
leading roles, had the same objective and were intended to provide the
same protection against governmental intrusion on religious liberty as
the Virginia statute." Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1,
13 (1947).

other establishment." Memorial and Remonstrance || 3, re-printed in

Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 64,
65-66 (1947). Any tax to establish religion is antithetical tothe command "that the minds of men always be wholly free."

Id., at 12 (discussing Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance);
id., at 13 (noting Jefferson's belief that "compel[ling] a manto furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; . . . eventhe forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own
religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable
liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor,
whose morals he would make his pattern" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 868-874 (1995) (Souter,
J., dissenting).

Second, government aid corrupts religion. See Engel
v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 431 (1962) ("[The Establishment
Clause's] first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy
government and to degrade religion"); Everson, supra, at 53
(Rutledge, J., dissenting). Madison argued that establishment of religion weakened the beliefs of adherents so favored, strengthened their opponents, and generated "pride
and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the
laity; [and] in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution."
Memorial and Remonstrance || 7, quoted in Everson, 330
U. S., at 67. "[E]xperience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy
of Religion, have had a contrary operation." Ibid. In a
variant of Madison's concern, we have repeatedly noted that
a government's favor to a particular religion or sect threatens to taint it with "corrosive secularism." Lee v. Weisman,
505 U. S. 577, 608 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board

"[G]overnment and religion have discrete interestswhich are mutually best served when each avoids too
close a proximity to the other. It is not only the nonbe-liever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and
controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degreeit is the devout believer who fears the secularization of
a creed which becomes too deeply involved with and de-pendent upon the government." School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 259 (1963)(Brennan, J., concurring).

See also Rosenberger, supra, at 890- 891 (Souter, J.,dissenting).

Third, government establishment of religion is inextrica-bly linked with conflict.

Everson, supra, at 8-11 (relatingcolonists' understanding of recent history of religious persecution in countries with established religion); Engel, supra,at 429 (discussing struggle among religions for government
approval); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 623 (1971). Inour own history, the turmoil thus produced has led to a rejection of the idea that government should subsidize religiouseducation, id., at 645-649 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (discussing
history of rejection of support for religious schools); McCol-lum, supra, at 214-217 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.), a position
that illustrates the Court's understanding that any implicitendorsement of religion is unconstitutional, see

County ofAllegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater

Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 592-594 (1989).2

2 The plurality mistakes my recognition of this fundamental concern.
Ante, at 825-826. The Court may well have moved away from considering the political divisiveness threatened by particular instances of aid as
a practical criterion for applying the Establishment Clause case by case,
but we have never questioned its importance as a motivating concern behind the Establishment Clause, nor could we change history to find that
sectarian conflict did not influence the Framers who wrote it.

B
These concerns are reflected in the Court's classic summa-tion delivered in

Everson v. Board of Education, supra, itsfirst opinion directly addressing standards governing aid to

religious schools: 3

"The `establishment of religion' clause of the FirstAmendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the

Federal Government can set up a church. Neither canpass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor in-fluence a person to go to or to remain away from church
against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbe-lief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs,for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any
amount, large or small, can be levied to support any reli-gious activities or institutions, whatever they may be
called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach orpractice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairsof any religious organizations or groups and vice versa.
In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establish-ment of religion by law was intended to erect `a wall of
separation between church and State.' " 330 U. S., at15-16 (quoting

Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145,164 (1879)).

The most directly pertinent doctrinal statements here arethese: no government "can pass laws which aid one religion

3 The Court upheld payments by Indian tribes to apparently Roman
Catholic schools in Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50 (1908), suggesting in
dicta that there was no Establishment Clause problem, but it did not
squarely face the question. Nor did the Court address a First Amendment challenge to a state program providing textbooks to children in
Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370 (1930); it simply concluded
that the program had an adequate public purpose. The Court first
squarely faced the issue in Everson.

[or] all religions . . . . No tax in any amount . . . can be

whatever form they may adopt to teach . . . religion." 330
U. S., at 16. Thus, the principle of "no aid," with which no
one in Everson disagreed.4

Immediately, however, there was the difficulty over what
might amount to "aid" or "support." The problem for the
Everson Court was not merely the imprecision of the words,
but the "other language of the [First Amendment that] commands that [government] cannot hamper its citizens in the
free exercise of their own religion," ibid., with the consequence that government must "be a neutral in its relations
with groups of religious believers and non-believers," id., at
18. Since withholding some public benefits from religious
groups could be said to "hamper" religious exercise indirectly, and extending other benefits said to aid it, an
argument-proof formulation of the no-aid principle was impossible, and the Court wisely chose not to attempt any such
thing. Instead it gave definitive examples of public benefits
provided pervasively throughout society that would be of
some value to organized religion but not in a way or to a
degree that could sensibly be described as giving it aid or
violating the neutrality requirement: there was no Establishment Clause concern with "such general government services as ordinary police and fire protection, connections for
sewage disposal, public highways and sidewalks." Id., at
17-18. These "benefits of public welfare legislation," id., at
16, extended in modern times to virtually every member of
the population and valuable to every person and association,
were the paradigms of advantages that religious organiza4 While Everson's dissenters parted company with the majority over the
specific question of school buses, the Court stood as one behind the principle of no aid for religious teaching. 330 U. S., at 15-16; id., at 25-26 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 28-29, 31-32 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).

Souter, J., dissenting
tions could enjoy consistently with the prohibition against
aid, and that governments could extend without deserting
their required position of neutrality.

But paradigms are not perfect fits very often, and government spending resists easy classification as between universal general service or subsidy of favoritism. The 5-to-4 division of the Everson Court turned on the inevitable question
whether reimbursing all parents for the cost of transporting
their children to school was close enough to police protection
to tolerate its indirect benefit in some degree to religious
schools, with the majority in Everson thinking the reimbursement statute fell on the lawful side of the line. Although the state scheme reimbursed parents for transporting children to sectarian schools, among others, it gave "no
money to the schools. It [did] not support them. Its legislation [did] no more than provide a general program to help
parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely
and expeditiously to and from accredited schools." Id., at
18. The dissenters countered with factual analyses showing
the limitation of the law's benefits in fact to private school
pupils who were Roman Catholics, id., at 20 (Jackson, J., dissenting), and indicating the inseparability of transporting pupils to school from support for the religious instruction that
was the school's raison d'e^tre, id., at 45-46 (Rutledge, J.,
dissenting).

Everson is usefully understood in the light of a successor
case two decades later, Board of Ed. of Central School Dist.
No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968), in which the challenged
government practice was lending textbooks to pupils of
schools both public and private, including religious ones (as
to which there was no evidence that they had previously supplied books to their classes and some evidence that they had
not, id., at 244, n. 6). By the time of Allen, the problem of
classifying the state benefit, as between aid to religion and
general public service consistent with government neutral530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
876 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Souter, J., dissenting
ity, had led to the formulation of a "test" that required secu-lar, primary intent and effect as necessary conditions of any

permissible scheme. Id., at 243. Again the Court split, up-holding the state law in issue, but with Everson's majority
author, Justice Black, now in dissent. What is remarkableabout Allen today, however, is not so much its division as its
methodology, for the consistency in the way the Justiceswent about deciding the case transcended their different conclusions. Neither side rested on any facile application of the"test" or any simplistic reliance on the generality or evenhandedness of the state law. Disagreement concentrated onthe true intent inferrable behind the law, the feasibility of
distinguishing in fact between religious and secular teachingin church schools, and the reality or sham of lending books
to pupils instead of supplying books to schools. The major-ity, to be sure, cited the provision for books to all schoolchildren, regardless of religion, 392 U. S., at 243, just as the
Everson majority had spoken of the transportation reim-bursement as going to all, 330 U. S., at 16, in each case for

the sake of analogy to the provision of police and fire serv-ices.

5 But the stress was on the practical significance of the

actual benefits received by the schools. As Everson hadrested on the understanding that no money and no support

went to the school, id., at 18, Allen emphasized that the sav-ings to parents were devoid of any measurable effect in
teaching religion, 392 U. S., at 243-244. Justice Harlan, con-curring, summed up the approach with his observations that
the required government "[n]eutrality is . . . a coat of manycolors," and quoted Justice Goldberg's conclusion, that there
was " `no simple and clear measure' . . . by which this or any[religious school aid] case may readily be decided," id., at 249
(quoting Schempp, 374 U. S., at 306).

5 Indeed, two of the dissenters in Allen agreed with the majority on this
method of analysis, asking whether the books at issue were similar enough
to fire and police protection. See 392 U. S., at 252 (Black, J., dissenting);
id., at 272 (Fortas, J., dissenting).

Souter, J., dissenting
After Everson and Allen, the state of the law applying theEstablishment Clause to public expenditures producing some

benefit to religious schools was this:

1. Government aid to religion is forbidden, and tax reve-nue may not be used to support a religious school or

religious teaching.
2. Government provision of such paradigms of univer-sally general welfare benefits as police and fire protection does not count as aid to religion.
3. Whether a law's benefit is sufficiently close to univer-sally general welfare paradigms to be classified with

them, as distinct from religious aid, is a function of thepurpose and effect of the challenged law in all its particularity. The judgment is not reducible to the applica-tion of any formula. Evenhandedness of distribution as
between religious and secular beneficiaries is a relevantfactor, but not a sufficiency test of constitutionality.
There is no rule of religious equal protection to the ef-fect that any expenditure for the benefit of religious
school students is necessarily constitutional so long aspublic school pupils are favored on ostensibly identical
terms.
4. Government must maintain neutrality as to religion,"neutrality" being a conclusory label for the required

position of government as neither aiding religion norimpeding religious exercise by believers. "Neutrality"
was not the name of any test to identify permissible ac-tion, and in particular, was not synonymous with evenhandedness in conferring benefit on the secular as wellas the religious.

Today, the substantive principle of no aid to religious mis-sion remains the governing understanding of the Establishment Clause as applied to public benefits inuring to religiousschools. The governing opinions on the subject in the 35
years since Allen have never challenged this principle. The

Souter, J., dissenting
cases have, however, recognized that in actual Establishment
Clause litigation over school aid legislation, there is no pure
aid to religion and no purely secular welfare benefit; the effects of the laws fall somewhere in between, with the judicial
task being to make a realistic allocation between the two
possibilities. The Court's decisions demonstrate its repeated attempts to isolate considerations relevant in classifying particular benefits as between those that do not discernibly support or threaten support of a school's religious
mission, and those that cross or threaten to cross the line
into support for religion.

II

A

The most deceptively familiar of those considerations is
"neutrality," the presence or absence of which, in some sense,
we have addressed from the moment of Everson itself. I
say "some sense," for we have used the term in at least three
ways in our cases, and an understanding of the term's evolution will help to explain the concept as it is understood today,
as well as the limits of its significance in Establishment
Clause analysis. "Neutrality" has been employed as a term
to describe the requisite state of government equipoise between the forbidden encouragement and discouragement of
religion; to characterize a benefit or aid as secular; and to
indicate evenhandedness in distributing it.

As already mentioned, the Court first referred to neutrality in Everson, simply stating that government is required
"to be a neutral" among religions and between religion and
nonreligion. 330 U. S., at 18. Although "neutral" may have
carried a hint of inaction when we indicated that the First
Amendment "does not require the state to be [the] adversary" of religious believers, ibid., or to cut off general government services from religious organizations, Everson provided no explicit definition of the term or further indication
of what the government was required to do or not do to be

Souter, J., dissenting
"neutral" toward religion. In practical terms, "neutral" in
Everson was simply a term for government in its required
median position between aiding and handicapping religion.The second major case on aid to religious schools,

Allen, used
"neutrality" to describe an adequate state of balance be-tween government as ally and as adversary to religion, see

392 U. S., at 242 (discussing line between "state neutrality to
religion and state support of religion"). The term was notfurther defined, and a few subsequent school cases used

"neutrality" simply to designate the required relationship toreligion, without explaining how to attain it. See,

e. g., Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (describing cases
that "see[k] to define the boundaries of the neutral area between [the Religion Clauses] within which the legislature
may legitimately act"); Roemer v. Board of Public Works of
Md., 426 U. S. 736, 747 (1976) (plurality opinion of Blackmun,
J.) ("Neutrality is what is required. The State must confine
itself to secular objectives, and neither advance nor impede
religious activity. Of course, that principle is more easily
stated than applied"); see also Committee for Public Ed. &
Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782 (1973) (describing "neutral posture" toward religion); Roemer, supra,
at 745-746 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) ("The Court has enforced
a scrupulous neutrality by the State, as among religions, and
also as between religious and other activities"); cf. Wolman
v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 254 (1977) (quoting Lemon and noting difficulty of religious teachers' remaining " `religiously
neutral' ").

The Court began to employ "neutrality" in a sense different from equipoise, however, as it explicated the distinction between "religious" and "secular" benefits to religious
schools, the latter being in some circumstances permissible.
See infra, at 884-899 (discussing considerations). Even
though both Everson and Allen had anticipated some such
distinction, neither case had used the term "neutral" in this
way. In Everson, Justice Black indicated that providing

530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN
880 MITCHELL v. HELMS

Souter, J., dissenting
police, fire, and similar government services to religious in-stitutions was permissible, in part because they were "so

separate and so indisputably marked off from the religiousfunction." 330 U. S., at 18.

Allen similarly focused on the
fact that the textbooks lent out were "secular" and approvedby secular authorities, 392 U. S., at 245, and assumed that

the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education
they supported were not so intertwined with religious in-struction as "in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of

religion," id., at 248. Such was the Court's premise in
Lemon for shifting the use of the word "neutral" from labeling the required position of the government to describing a
benefit that was nonreligious. We spoke of "[o]ur decisions
from Everson to Allen [as] permitt[ing] the States to provide
church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials," 403 U. S., at 616, and
thereafter, we regularly used "neutral" in this second sense
of "secular" or "nonreligious." See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at
687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as "not
necessarily religiously neutral," but buildings as "religiously
neutral"); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 365-366 (1975)
(describing instructional materials as " `secular, nonideological and neutral' " and "wholly neutral"); id., at 372 (describing auxiliary services as "religiously neutral"); Roemer,
supra, at 751 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (describing Tilton's
approved buildings as "neutral or nonideological in nature");
426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek's speech and hearing services as "neutral and nonideological"); Zobrest v. Catalina
Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993) (discussing
translator as "neutral service"); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S.
203, 232 (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of
aid was "neutral and nonideological"); cf. Levitt v. Committee
for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973)
(noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were " `secular, neutral,

Souter, J., dissenting
616); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616(describing permitted services aid as "secular, neutral, or

nonideological")).The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our
last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the senseof "neutrality" in the 1980's. Reexamining and reinterpreting Everson and Allen, we began to use the word "neutral"
to mean "evenhanded," in the sense of allocating aid on somecommon basis to religious and secular recipients. Again,

neither Everson nor Allen explicitly used "neutral" in thismanner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to
referring to the secular characteristic of what a government
might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the
generality of government services, as in Everson's paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.

The increased attention to a notion of evenhanded distribution was evident in Nyquist, where the Court distinguished the program under consideration from the government services approved in Allen and Everson, in part
because "the class of beneficiaries [in Everson and Allen]
included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those
in private schools." 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38. Nyquist then
reserved the question whether "some form of public
assistance . . . made available generally without regard to
the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the
institution benefitted" would be permissible. Id., at 783,
n. 38 (citations omitted). Subsequent cases continued the
focus on the "generality" of the approved government services as an important characteristic. Meek, for example,
characterized Everson and Allen as approving "a general
program" to pay bus fares and to lend school books, respectively, 421 U. S., at 360; id., at 360, n. 8 (approving two similar
"general program[s]" in New York and Pennsylvania), and
Wolman upheld diagnostic services described as " `general
welfare services for children,' " 433 U. S., at 243 (quoting
Meek, supra, at 371, n. 21).

Justice Blackmun, writing in Roemer, first called such a"general" or evenhanded program "neutral," in speaking of

"facial neutrality" as a relevant consideration in determin-ing whether there was an Establishment Clause violation.
"[R]eligious institutions need not be quarantined from publicbenefits that are neutrally available to all." 426 U. S., at
746-747; see also id., at 746 (discussing buses in Everson and
school books in Allen as examples of "neutrally available"aid). In

Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), the Court
adopted the redefinition of neutrality as evenhandedness, cit-ing

Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38, and alluding to our discussion of equal access in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263
(1981). The Court upheld a system of tax deductions for
sectarian educational expenses, in part because such a "facially neutral law," 463 U. S., at 401, made the deduction
available for "all parents, including those whose children
attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools," id.,
at 397. Subsequent cases carried the point forward. See,
e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474
U. S. 481, 487 (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid "available generally"); Zobrest, supra,
at 8-9 (discussing "government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without
reference to religion" and citing Mueller and Witters); Agostini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of
"neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor
religion, . . . made available to both religious and secular
beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis"); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 839 ("[T]he guarantee of neutrality is
respected, not offended, when the government, following
neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits
to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including
religious ones, are broad and diverse").

In sum, "neutrality" originally entered this field of jurisprudence as a conclusory term, a label for the required rela530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tionship between the government and religion as a state ofequipoise between government as ally and government as

adversary. Reexamining Everson's paradigm cases to de-rive a prescriptive guideline, we first determined that "neutral" aid was secular, nonideological, or unrelated to religiouseducation. Our subsequent reexamination of

Everson and
Allen, beginning in Nyquist and culminating in Mueller and
most recently in Agostini, recast neutrality as a concept of"evenhandedness."

There is, of course, good reason for considering the gener-ality of aid and the evenhandedness of its distribution in
making close calls between benefits that in purpose or effect
support a school's religious mission and those that do not.
This is just what Everson did. Even when the disputed
practice falls short of Everson's paradigms, the breadth of
evenhanded distribution is one pointer toward the law's purpose, since on the face of it aid distributed generally and
without a religious criterion is less likely to be meant to aid
religion than a benefit going only to religious institutions
or people. And, depending on the breadth of distribution,
looking to evenhandedness is a way of asking whether a benefit can reasonably be seen to aid religion in fact; we do not
regard the postal system as aiding religion, even though parochial schools get mail. Given the legitimacy of considering evenhandedness, then, there is no reason to avoid the
term "neutrality" to refer to it. But one crucial point must
be borne in mind.

In the days when "neutral" was used in Everson's sense
of equipoise, neutrality was tantamount to constitutionality;
the term was conclusory, but when it applied it meant that
the government's position was constitutional under the Establishment Clause. This is not so at all, however, under
the most recent use of "neutrality" to refer to generality or
evenhandedness of distribution. This kind of neutrality is
relevant in judging whether a benefit scheme so characterized should be seen as aiding a sectarian school's religious

Souter, J., dissenting
mission, but this neutrality is not alone sufficient to qualifythe aid as constitutional. It is to be considered only along

with other characteristics of aid, its administration, its recipi-ents, or its potential that have been emphasized over the
years as indicators of just how religious the intent and effectof a given aid scheme really is. See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S.,
at 677-678 (opinion of Burger, C. J.) (acknowledging "no sin-gle constitutional caliper");

Meek, 421 U. S., at 358-359 (not-ing considerations as guidelines only and discussing them as

a matter of degree); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball,473 U. S. 373, 383 (1985) (quoting Meek), overruled in part
by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 203; Board of Ed. of Kiryas JoelVillage School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 720 (1994)
(opinion of O'Connor, J.) ("Experience proves that the Es-tablishment Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test"); Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at847-849 (O'C

onnor, J., concurring) (discussing need for line-drawing);
id., at 852 (noting lack of a single "Grand UnifiedTheory" for Establishment Clause and citing

Kiryas Joel);cf. Agostini, supra, at 232-233 (examining a variety of factors). Thus, the basic principle of establishment scrutiny ofaid remains the principle as stated in Everson, that there
may be no public aid to religion or support for the religiousmission of any institution.

B
The insufficiency of evenhandedness neutrality as a stand-alone criterion of constitutional intent or effect has been

clear from the beginning of our interpretative efforts, for anobvious reason. Evenhandedness in distributing a benefit
approaches the equivalence of constitutionality in this areaonly when the term refers to such universality of distribution
that it makes no sense to think of the benefit as going to anydiscrete group. Conversely, when evenhandedness refers to
distribution to limited groups within society, like groups ofschools or schoolchildren, it does make sense to regard the
benefit as aid to the recipients. See, e. g., Everson, 330 U. S.,

at 16 (discussing aid that approaches the "verge" of forbiddenterritory); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 612 ("[W]e can only dimly

perceive the lines of demarcation in this extraordinarily sen-sitive area of constitutional law"); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 760-
761 (noting the "most perplexing questions" presented in thisarea and acknowledging " `entangl[ing] precedents' "); Mueller, 463 U. S., at 393 (quoting Lemon); Witters, 474 U. S., at485 (quoting

Lemon).Hence, if we looked no further than evenhandedness, and

failed to ask what activities the aid might support, or in factdid support, religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the bene-fit of their public school counterparts, and religious missions
would thrive on public money. This is why the consider-ation of less than universal neutrality has never been recognized as dispositive and has always been teamed with atten-tion to other facts bearing on the substantive prohibition of
support for a school's religious objective.At least three main lines of enquiry addressed particularly to school aid have emerged to complement evenhanded-ness neutrality. First, we have noted that two types of aid
recipients heighten Establishment Clause concern: perva-sively religious schools and primary and secondary religious
schools. Second, we have identified two important charac-teristics of the method of distributing aid: directness or indirectness of distribution and distribution by genuinely inde-pendent choice. Third, we have found relevance in at least
five characteristics of the aid itself: its religious content; itscash form; its divertibility or actually diversion to religious
support; its supplantation of traditional items of religiousschool expense; and its substantiality.

1
Two types of school aid recipients have raised special con-cern. First, we have recognized the fact that the overriding

religious mission of certain schools, those sometimes called

"pervasively sectarian," is not confined to a discrete elementof the curriculum, Everson, 330 U. S., at 22-24 (Jackson, J.,

dissenting); id., at 45-47 (Rutledge, J., dissenting), but per-meates their teaching.

6 Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New

York, 397 U. S. 664, 671 (1970); Lemon, supra, at 636-637("A school which operates to commingle religion with other

instruction plainly cannot completely secularize its instruc-tion. Parochial schools, in large measure, do not accept the
assumption that secular subjects should be unrelated to reli-gious teaching"); see also

Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589,621-622 (1988) (discussing pervasively sectarian private

schools). Based on record evidence and long experience, wehave concluded that religious teaching in such schools is at
the core of the instructors' individual and personal obliga-tions, cf. Canon 803, $ 2, Text & Commentary 568 ("It is necessary that the formation and education given in a Catholicschool be based upon the principles of Catholic doctrine;
teachers are to be outstanding for their correct doctrine andintegrity of life"), and that individual religious teachers will
teach religiously.7 Lemon, 403 U. S., at 615-620; id., at 635-

6 In fact, religious education in Roman Catholic schools is defined as part
of required religious practice; aiding it is thus akin to aiding a church
service. See 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 798, reprinted in The Code
of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary 566 (1985) (hereinafter Text &
Commentary) (directing parents to entrust children to Roman Catholic
schools or otherwise provide for Roman Catholic education); Canon 800,

$ 2, Text & Commentary 567 (requiring the faithful to support establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools); Canons 802, 804,
Text & Commentary 567, 568 (requiring diocesan bishop to establish and
regulate schools "imparting an education imbued with the Christian
spirit").

7 Although the Court no longer assumes that public school teachers assigned to religious schools for limited purposes will teach religiously, see
Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 223-228 (1997), we have never abandoned
the presumption that religious teachers will teach just that way. Lemon

Ball, 473 U. S., at 399-400 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by
Agostini, 521 U. S., at 236. As religious teaching cannot
be separated from secular education in such schools or by
such teachers, we have concluded that direct government
subsidies to such schools are prohibited because they will inevitably and impermissibly support religious indoctrination.
Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 (discussing Meek and Ball).

Second, we have expressed special concern about aid to
primary and secondary religious schools. Tilton, 403 U. S.,
at 685-686. On the one hand, we have understood how the
youth of the students in such schools makes them highly susceptible to religious indoctrination. Lemon, supra, at 616
("This process of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course,
enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary
schools particularly"). On the other, we have recognized
that the religious element in the education offered in most
sectarian primary and secondary schools is far more intertwined with the secular than in university teaching, where
the natural and academic skepticism of most older students
may separate the two, see Tilton, supra, at 686-689; Roemer, 426 U. S., at 750. Thus, government benefits accruing
to these pervasively religious primary and secondary schools
raise special dangers of diversion into support for the religious indoctrination of children and the involvement of government in religious training and practice.

We have also evaluated the portent of support to an orga-nization's religious mission that may be inherent in the

method by which aid is granted, finding pertinence in at leasttwo characteristics of distribution. First, we have asked
whether aid is direct or indirect, observing distinctions be-tween government schemes with individual beneficiaries and
those whose beneficiaries in the first instance might be reli-gious schools.

Everson, supra, at 18 (bus fare supports par-ents and not schools); Allen, 392 U. S., 243-244, and n. 6

(textbooks go to benefit children and parents, not schools);
Lemon, supra, at 621 (invalidating direct aid to schools); Lev-itt, supra, at 480, 482 (invalidating direct testing aid to

schools); Witters, 474 U. S., at 487-488 (evaluating whetheraid was a direct subsidy to schools). Direct aid obviously
raises greater risks, although recent cases have discountedthis risk factor, looking to other features of the distribution
mechanism. Agostini, supra, at 225-226.8

8 In Agostini, the Court indicated that "we have departed from the rule
relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid," 521 U. S., at 225, and cited
Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), and
Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993). However,
Agostini did not rely on this dictum, instead clearly stating that "[w]hile
it is true that individual students may not directly apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise that those services are distributed `directly to the religious schools.' In fact, they are not. No Title I
funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may
not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis." 521 U. S., at
228-229 (citations omitted). Until today, this Court has never permitted
aid to go directly to schools on a schoolwide basis.

The plurality misreads our precedent in suggesting that we have abandoned directness of distribution as a relevant consideration. See ante, at
815-818. In Wolman, we stated that nominally describing aid as to students would not bar a court from finding that it actually provided a subsidy to a school, 433 U. S., at 250, but we did not establish that a program
giving "direct" aid to schools was therefore permissible. In Witters, we
made the focus of Wolman clear, continuing to examine aid to determine

Souter, J., dissenting
Second, we have distinguished between indirect aid thatreaches religious schools only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and aid that is in reality directedto religious schools by the government or in practical terms
selected by religious schools themselves. Mueller, 463U. S., at 399; Witters, supra, at 488; Zobrest, supra, at 10.
In these cases, we have declared the constitutionality of pro-grams providing aid directly to parents or students as tax
deductions or scholarship money, where such aid may pay foreducation at some sectarian institutions,

Mueller, supra, at399; Witters, 474 U. S., at 488, but only as the result of "genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients," id.,at 487. We distinguished this path of aid from the route
in Ball and Wolman, where the opinions indicated that"[w]here . . . no meaningful distinction can be made between
aid to the student and aid to the school, the concept of a loanto individuals is a transparent fiction." 474 U. S., at 487, n. 4
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).9

3
In addition to the character of the school to which the ben-efit accrues, and its path from government to school, a number of features of the aid itself have figured in the classificaif it was a "direct subsidy" to a school, 474 U. S., at 487, and distinguishing
the aid at issue from impermissible aid in Ball and Wolman precisely
because the designation of the student as recipient in those cases was only
nominal. 474 U. S., at 487, n. 4. Our subsequent cases have continued to
ask whether government aid programs constituted impermissible "direct
subsidies" to religious schools even where they are directed by individual
choice. Zobrest, supra, at 11-13; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 399
(1983); Agostini, supra, at 226.

9 We have also permitted the government to supply students with

public-employee translators, Zobrest, supra, at 10, and public-employee
special education teachers, Agostini, supra, at 226, 228, who directly provided them with government services in whatever schools those specific
students attended, public or nonpublic. I have already noted Agostini's
limitations. See n. 8, supra.

Souter, J., dissenting
tions we have made. First, we have barred aid with actualreligious content, which would obviously run afoul of the ban

on the government's participation in religion, Everson, 330U. S., at 16; Walz, 397 U. S., at 668; cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at
617 (discussing variable ideological and religious character ofreligious teachers compared to fixed content of books). In
cases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly char-acterized it as "neutral" in the sense (noted

supra, at 879-881) of being without religious content. See, e. g., Tilton,

403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as "religiously neu-tral"); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (describing translator as "neutral service"); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 232 (discussing need toassess whether nature of aid was "neutral and nonideological"). See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aidwith religious content).

10

Second, we have long held government aid invalid whencircumstances would allow its diversion to religious education. The risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in theform of government funds makes its way into the coffers of
religious organizations, and so from the start we have under-stood the Constitution to bar outright money grants of aid
to religion.11 See Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 ("[The State]

10 I agree with the plurality that the Establishment Clause absolutely
prohibits the government from providing aid with clear religious content
to religious, or for that matter nonreligious, schools. Ante, at 822-825.
The plurality, however, misreads our precedent as focusing only on affirmatively religious content. At the very least, a building, for example,
has no such content, but we have squarely required the government to
ensure that no publicly financed building be diverted to religious use.
Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 681-684 (1971). See also Bowen v.
Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 623 (1988) (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[A]ny use
of public funds to promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment
Clause").

11 We have similarly noted that paying salaries of parochial school teachers creates too much of a risk that such support will aid the teaching of
religion, striking down such programs because of the need for pervasive
monitoring that would be required. See Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619 ("We do
not assume, however, that parochial school teachers will be unsuccessful

Walz, supra, at 675 ("Obviously a direct moneysubsidy would be a relationship pregnant with involvement

and, as with most governmental grant programs, could en-compass sustained and detailed administrative relationships
for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards");Lemon, supra, at 612 (identifying "three main evils" against

in their attempts to segregate their religious beliefs from their secular
educational responsibilities. But the potential for impermissible fostering
of religion is present. The [state legislature] has not, and could not, provide state aid on the basis of a mere assumption that secular teachers
under religious discipline can avoid conflicts. The State must be certain,
given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate
religion . . . . A comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that these restrictions are
obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected").

Regan, 444 U. S. 646, 657-659 (1980) (approving program providing religious school with "direct cash reimbursement" for expenses of standardized testing). In that case, we found the other safeguards against the
diversion of such funds to religious uses sufficient to allow such aid: "A

the primary effect of aiding religion whether or not performed by nonpublic school personnel." Id., at 658. Aside from this isolated circumstance,
where we found ironclad guarantees of nondiversion, we have never relaxed our prohibition on direct cash aid to pervasively religious schools,
and have in fact continued to acknowledge the concern. See Agostini,
521 U. S., at 228-229; cf. Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842.

The plurality concedes this basic point. See ante, at 818-819. Given

by Mueller or Witters without foundation. See ante, at 819-820, n. 8.
Those cases involved entirely different types of aid, namely, tax deductions
and individual scholarship aid for university education, see also n. 16,

to support this absolute restriction.

Divertibility is not, of course, a characteristic of cashalone, and when examining provisions for ostensibly secular
supplies we have considered their susceptibility to the serv-ice of religious ends.

13 In upholding a scheme to provide

students with secular textbooks, we emphasized that "eachbook loaned must be approved by the public school authorities; only secular books may receive approval." Allen, 392U. S., at 244-245; see also Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 (opinion
of Stewart, J.); Wolman, supra, at 237-238. By the sametoken, we could not sustain provisions for instructional materials adaptable to teaching a variety of subjects.14 Meek,
supra, at 363; Wolman, supra, at 249-250. While the text-books had a known and fixed secular content not readily di13 I reject the plurality's argument that divertibility is a boundless principle. Ante, at 824-825. Our long experience of evaluating this consideration demonstrates its practical limits. See infra this page and 894-895.
Moreover, the Establishment Clause charges us with making such enquiries, regardless of their difficulty. See supra, at 875-878, 884-885. Finally, the First Amendment's rule permitting only aid with fixed secular
content seems no more difficult to apply than the plurality's rule prohibiting only aid with fixed religious content.

14 Contrary to the plurality's apparent belief, Lamb's Chapel v. Center

Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993), sheds no light on
the question of divertibility and school aid. Ante, at 822, n. 9. The Court
in that case clearly distinguished the question of afterschool access to public facilities from anything resembling the school aid cases: "The showing
of this film series would not have been during school hours, would not have
been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not
just to church members." 508 U. S., at 395.

vertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable mate-rials did not.

15 So, too, we explained the permissibility of

busing on public routes to schools but not busing for fieldtrips designed by religious authorities specifically because

the latter trips were components of teaching in a pervasivelyreligious school. Compare

Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 (noting
wholly separate and secular nature of public bus fare to
schools), with Wolman, 433 U. S., at 254 ("The field trips arean integral part of the educational experience, and where

the teacher works within and for a sectarian institution, anunacceptable risk of fostering of religion is an inevitable byproduct" (citation omitted)). We likewise were able to up-hold underwriting the expenses of standard state testing in
religious schools while being forced to strike down aid fortesting designed by the school officials, because the latter
tests could be used to reinforce religious teaching. Com-pare

id., at 240 ("[T]he State provides both the schools and
the school district with the means of ensuring that the minimum standards are met. The nonpublic school does not control the content of the test or its result. This serves to prevent the use of the test as part of religious teaching, and

413 U. S., at 480 ("We cannot ignore the substantial risk that
these examinations, prepared by teachers under the authority of religious institutions, will be drafted with an eye, unconsciously or otherwise, to inculcate students in the religious precepts of the sponsoring church").

15 In Lemon, we also specifically examined the risk that a government
program that paid religious teachers would support religious education;
the teachers posed the risk of being unable to separate secular from religious education. Although we invalidated the program on entanglement
grounds, we suggested that the monitoring the State had established in
that case was actually required to eliminate the risk of diversion. See
403 U. S., at 619; see also n. 11, supra.

With the same point in mind, we held that buildings
constructed with government grants to universities with
religious affiliation must be barred from religious use
indefinitely to prevent the diversion of government funds
to religious objectives. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 683 (plurality
opinion) ("If, at the end of 20 years, the building is, for example, converted into a chapel or otherwise used to promote
religious interests, the original federal grant will in part
have the effect of advancing religion. To this extent the Act
therefore trespasses on the Religion Clauses"); see also
Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743-744. We were accordingly constrained to strike down aid for repairing buildings of nonpublic schools because they could be used for religious education.
Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 776-777.

Divertibility was, again, the issue in an order remanding
an as-applied challenge to a grant supporting counseling on
teenage sexuality for findings that the aid had not been used
to support religious education. Bowen, 487 U. S., at 621; see
also id., at 623 (O'Connor, J., concurring). And the most
recent example of attention to the significance of divertibility
occurred in our explanation that public school teachers could
be assigned to provide limited instruction in religious schools
in Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-227, a majority of the Court
rejecting the factual assumption that public school teachers
could be readily lured into providing religious instruction.16

16 The plurality is mistaken in its reading of Zobrest. See ante, at 820-
821. Zobrest does not reject the principle of divertibility. There the
government provided only a translator who was not considered divertible
because he did not add to or subtract from the religious message. The
Court approved the translator as it would approve a hearing aid, health
services, diagnostics, and tests. See Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 13, and n. 10.
Cf. Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291, 299-300 (1899); Wolman, 433 U. S.,
at 244. Zobrest thus can be thought of as akin to our approval of diagnostic services in Wolman, supra, at 244, which we considered to have "little
or no educational content[,] not [to be] closely associated with the educational mission of the nonpublic school," and not to pose "an impermissible

Third, our cases have recognized the distinction, adoptedby statute in the Chapter 2 legislation, between aid that

merely supplements and aid that supplants expenditures forofferings at religious schools, the latter being barred. Although we have never adopted the position that any benefitthat flows to a religious school is impermissible because it
frees up resources for the school to engage in religious indoc-trination,

Hunt, supra, at 743, from our first decision holdingit permissible to provide textbooks for religious schools we

have repeatedly explained the unconstitutionality of aid thatsupplants an item of the school's traditional expense. See,
e. g., Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 375(1930) (noting that religious schools "are not the beneficiaries
of these appropriations. They obtain nothing from them,nor are they relieved of a single obligation because of them"
(internal quotation marks omitted)); Everson, 330 U. S., at18 (specifically noting that bus fare program did not support
or fund religious schools); Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (statingthat "the financial benefit [of providing the textbooks] is to
parents and children, not to schools" (footnote omitted)); id.,
risk of the fostering of ideological views." The fact that the dissent saw
things otherwise (as the plurality points out, ante, at 821) is beside the
point here.

Similarly, the plurality is mistaken in reading our holdings in Mueller
and Witters, see ante, at 821, to undermine divertibility as a relevant principle. First, these cases approved quite factually distinct types of aid;
Mueller involving tax deductions, which have a quite separate history
of approval, see 463 U. S., at 396, and nn. 5, 6 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n
of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970)), and Witters involving scholarship money distributed to a university, not a primary or secondary school,
see Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686, that was not significant enough as a
whole to support that institution, Witters, 474 U. S., at 488. Second, in
neither case did the program at issue provide direct aid on a schoolwide
basis (as Chapter 2 does here); in both we found a distinction based on the
genuinely independent, private choices which allocated such very different
types of aid (tax deductions and university scholarship money that did not
amount to substantial support of the university). See Mueller, supra, at
399; Witters, supra, at 488.

at 244, n. 6 (explicitly recognizing that "the record containsno evidence that any of the private schools in appellants' districts previously provided textbooks for their students");
Lemon, 403 U. S., at 656 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (noting no
aid to schools was involved in Allen). We ignored this pro-hibition only once, in

Regan, 444 U. S., at 646; see also ante,
at 16, n. 7, where reimbursement for budgeted expenses of
required testing was not struck down, but we then quicklyreturned to the rule as a guideline for permissible aid.

17 In

Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12, the Court specifically distinguished
Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in
those cases "relieved sectarian schools of costs they other-wise would have borne in educating their students." In

Agostini, the Court made a point of noting that the objectsof the aid were "by law supplemental to the regular curricula" and, citing Zobrest, explained that the remedial educa-tion services did not relieve the religious schools of costs
they would otherwise have borne. 521 U. S., at 228 (citing
Zobrest, supra, at 12). The Court explicitly stated that the

17 Our departure from this principle in Regan is not easily explained, but
it is an isolated holding surrounded by otherwise unbroken adherence to
the no-supplanting principle. Long after Regan we have continued to find
the supplement/supplant distinction, like the bar to substantial aid, to be
an important consideration. See Zobrest, supra, at 12; Agostini, 521 U. S.,
at 228; cf. Witters, supra, at 487-488 (discussing rule against "direct subsidy"). The weight that the plurality places on Regan is thus too much
for it to bear. See ante, at 815, n. 7. Moreover, the apparent object of
the Regan Court's concern was vindicating the principle that aid with fixed
secular content was permissible, distinguishing it from the divertible testing aid in Levitt. Regan, 444 U. S., at 661-662 (citing Wolman, supra, at
263); cf. Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480. The plurality provides no explanation
for our continued reference to the principle of no-supplanting aid in subsequent cases, such as Zobrest and Agostini, which it finds trustworthy
guides elsewhere in its discussion of the First Amendment. See ante, at
822-823, 825, 827, 829-832. Nor does the plurality explain why it places
so much weight on Regan's apparent departure from the no-supplanting
rule while it ignores Regan's core reasoning that the testing aid there was
permissible because, in direct contrast to Levitt, the aid was not divertible.

services in question did not "supplant the remedial instruc-tion and guidance counseling already provided in New York

City's sectarian schools." 521 U. S., at 229.Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding "substantial" amounts of aid to be uncon-stitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would
have borne.18 In Meek, 421 U. S., at 366, we invalidated theloan of instructional materials to religious schools because

"faced with the substantial amounts of direct support author-ized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to
attempt to separate secular educational functions from thepredominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania's church-related elementary and secondary schools andthen characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian."

substantiality of the aid obliquely in noting that "nothing inthe record indicates that . . . any significant portion of the

aid. The plurality challenges any rule based on the proportion of aid that
a program provides to religious recipients, citing Witters and Agostini.
See ante, at 812, n. 6. I reject the plurality's reasoning. The plurality
misreads Witters; Justice Marshall, writing for the Court in Witters, emphasized that only a small amount of aid was provided to religious institutions, 474 U. S., at 488, and no controlling majority rejected the importance of this fact. The plurality also overreads Agostini, supra, at 229,
which simply declined to adopt a rule based on proportionality. Moreover, regardless of whether the proportion of aid actually provided to religious schools is relevant, we have never questioned our holding in Meek
that substantial aid to religious schools is prohibited.

at 12, the Court spoke of the substantiality test in Meek,noting that "[d]isabled children, not sectarian schools, are
the primary beneficiaries of the [Individuals with DisabilitiesAct (IDEA)]; to the extent sectarian schools benefit at all
from the IDEA, they are only incidental beneficiaries."

C
This stretch of doctrinal history leaves one point clear be-yond peradventure: together with James Madison we have

consistently understood the Establishment Clause to imposea substantive prohibition against public aid to religion and,
hence, to the religious mission of sectarian schools. Even-handedness neutrality is one, nondispositive pointer toward
an intent and (to a lesser degree) probable effect on the per-missible side of the line between forbidden aid and general
public welfare benefit. Other pointers are facts about thereligious mission and education level of benefited schools and
their pupils, the pathway by which a benefit travels frompublic treasury to educational effect, the form and content of
the aid, its adaptability to religious ends, and its effects onschool budgets. The object of all enquiries into such matters is the same whatever the particular circumstances: isthe benefit intended to aid in providing the religious element
of the education and is it likely to do so?The substance of the law has thus not changed since

Ever-son. Emphasis on one sort of fact or another has varied

depending on the perceived utility of the enquiry, but all thathas been added is repeated explanation of relevant considerations, confirming that our predecessors were right in theirprophecies that no simple test would emerge to allow easy
application of the establishment principle.The plurality, however, would reject that lesson. The
majority misapplies it.

A

The nub of the plurality's new position is this:

"[I]f the government, seeking to further some legitimatesecular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without

regard to religion, to all who adequately further thatpurpose, then it is fair to say that any aid going to a
religious recipient only has the effect of furthering thatsecular purpose. The government, in crafting such an
aid program, has had to conclude that a given level ofaid is necessary to further that purpose among secular
recipients and has provided no more than that samelevel to religious recipients."

Ante, at 810 (citationomitted).

As a break with consistent doctrine the plurality's new crite-rion is unequaled in the history of Establishment Clause interpretation. Simple on its face, it appears to take even-handedness neutrality and in practical terms promote it to a
single and sufficient test for the establishment constitutional-ity of school aid. Even on its own terms, its errors are manifold, and attention to at least three of its mistaken assump-tions will show the degree to which the plurality's proposal
would replace the principle of no aid with a formula for gen-erous religious support.

First, the plurality treats an external observer's attribu-tion of religious support to the government as the sole impermissible effect of a government aid scheme. See, e. g.,
ante, at 809 ("[N]o one would conclude that any indoctri-nation that any particular recipient conducts has been done

at the behest of the government"). While perceived stateendorsement of religion is undoubtedly a relevant concern
under the Establishment Clause, see, e. g., AlleghenyCounty, 492 U. S., at 592-594; see also Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 772-774(1995) (O'C

judgment); id., at 786-787 (Souter, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment), it is certainly not the only one.

Everson made this clear from the start: secret aid to religionby the government is also barred. 330 U. S., at 16. State
aid not attributed to the government would still violate ataxpayer's liberty of conscience, threaten to corrupt religion,
and generate disputes over aid. In any event, since thesame-terms feature of the scheme would, on the plurality's
view, rule out the attribution or perception of endorsement,adopting the plurality's rule of facial evenhandedness would
convert neutrality into a dispositive criterion of establish-ment constitutionality and eliminate the effects enquiry directed by Allen, Lemon, and other cases. Under the plural-ity's rule of neutrality, if a program met the first part of the
Lemon enquiry, by declining to define a program's recipientsby religion, it would automatically satisfy the second, in supposedly having no impermissible effect of aiding religion.19Second, the plurality apparently assumes as a fact that
equal amounts of aid to religious and nonreligious schoolswill have exclusively secular and equal effects, on both external perception and on incentives to attend different schools.See ante, at 809-810, 813-814. But there is no reason to
believe that this will be the case; the effects of same-termsaid may not be confined to the secular sphere at all. This is
the reason that we have long recognized that unrestrictedaid to religious schools will support religious teaching in ad19 Adopting the plurality's rule would permit practically any government
aid to religion so long as it could be supplied on terms ostensibly comparable to the terms under which aid was provided to nonreligious recipients.
As a principle of constitutional sufficiency, the manipulability of this rule
is breathtaking. A legislature would merely need to state a secular objective in order to legalize massive aid to all religions, one religion, or even
one sect, to which its largess could be directed through the easy exercise
of crafting facially neutral terms under which to offer aid favoring that
religious group. Short of formally replacing the Establishment Clause, a
more dependable key to the public fisc or a cleaner break with prior law
would be difficult to imagine.

dition to secular education, a fact that would be true no mat-ter what the supposedly secular purpose of the law might be.

Third, the plurality assumes that per capita distributionrules safeguard the same principles as independent, private
choices. But that is clearly not so. We approved universityscholarships in

Witters because we found them close to giving a government employee a paycheck and allowing him to
spend it as he chose, but a per capita aid program is a farcry from awarding scholarships to individuals, one of whom

makes an independent private choice. Not the least of thesignificant differences between per capita aid and aid individually determined and directed is the right and genuine op-portunity of the recipient to choose not to give the aid.

20 To

hold otherwise would be to license the government to donatefunds to churches based on the number of their members, on

the patent fiction of independent private choice.The plurality's mistaken assumptions explain and underscore its sharp break with the Framers' understanding ofestablishment and this Court's consistent interpretative
course. Under the plurality's regime, little would be left of
the right of conscience against compelled support for reli-gion; the more massive the aid the more potent would be the

influence of the government on the teaching mission; themore generous the support, the more divisive would be the
resentments of those resisting religious support, and thosereligions without school systems ready to claim their fair
share. B

The plurality's conception of evenhandedness does not,however, control the case, whose disposition turns on the
misapplication of accepted categories of school aid analysis.The facts most obviously relevant to the Chapter 2 scheme

20 Indeed, the opportunity for an individual to choose not to have her
religious school receive government aid is just what at least one of the
respondents seeks here. See Brief for Respondents 1, and n. 1.

in Jefferson Parish are those showing divertibility and actualdiversion in the circumstance of pervasively sectarian religious schools. The type of aid, the structure of the pro-gram, and the lack of effective safeguards clearly demonstrate the divertibility of the aid. While little is knownabout its use, owing to the anemic enforcement system in the
parish, even the thin record before us reveals that actual
diversion occurred.The aid that the government provided was highly susceptible to unconstitutional use. Much of the equipmentprovided under Chapter 2 was not of the type provided for
individual students, App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a; App. 262a-
278a, but included "slide projectors, movie projectors, overhead projectors, television sets, tape recorders, projection screens, maps, globes, filmstrips, cassettes, computers,"
and computer software and peripherals, Helms v. Cody,
No. 85-5533, 1990 WL 36124 (ED La., Mar. 27, 1990); App.
to Pet. for Cert. 140a; App. 90a, 262a-278a, as well as library
books and materials, id., at 56a, 126a, 280a-284a. The videocassette players, overhead projectors, and other instructional aids were of the sort that we have found can easily be
used by religious teachers for religious purposes. Meek, 421
U. S., at 363; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250. The same was
true of the computers, which were as readily employable for
religious teaching as the other equipment, and presumably
as immune to any countervailing safeguard, App. 90a, 118a,
164a-165a. Although library books, like textbooks, have
fixed content, religious teachers can assign secular library
books for religious critique, and books for libraries may be
religious, as any divinity school library would demonstrate.
The sheer number and variety of books that could be and
were ordered gave ample opportunity for such diversion.

The divertibility thus inherent in the forms of Chapter 2
aid was enhanced by the structure of the program in Jefferson Parish. Requests for specific items under Chapter 2
came not from secular officials, cf. Allen, 392 U. S., at 244-

245, but from officials of the religious schools (and even par-ents of religious school pupils), see ante, at 803 (noting that

private religious schools submitted their orders to the gov-ernment for specific requested items); App. 156a-158a. The
sectarian schools decided what they wanted and often or-dered the supplies, id., at 156a-159a, 171a-172a, to be forwarded directly to themselves, id., at 156a-159a. It waseasy to select whatever instructional materials and library
books the schools wanted, just as it was easy to employ com-puters for the support of the religious content of the curriculum infused with religious instruction.The concern with divertibility thus predicated is underscored by the fact that the religious schools in question herecovered the primary and secondary grades, the grades in
which the sectarian nature of instruction is characteris-tically the most pervasive, see

Lemon, 403 U. S., at 616;cf. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 686-689, and in which pupils are

the least critical of the schools' religious objectives, see
Lemon, supra, at 616. No one, indeed, disputes the trialjudge's findings, based on a detailed record, that the Roman

Catholic schools,21 which made up the majority of the privateschools participating,

22 were pervasively sectarian,23 that

21 Litigation, discovery, and the opinions below focused almost exclusively on the aid to the 34 Roman Catholic schools. Consequently, I will
confine my discussion to that information. Of course, the same concerns
would be raised by government aid to religious schools of other faiths that
a court found had similar missions of religious education and religious
teachers teaching religiously.

22 The Jefferson Parish Chapter 2 program included 46 nonpublic schools,

of which 41 were religiously affiliated. Thirty-four of these were Roman
Catholic, seven others were religiously affiliated, and five were not religiously affiliated. App. to Pet. for Cert. 143a-144a.

23 The trial judge found that the Roman Catholic schools in question

operate under the general supervision and authority of the Archbishop of
New Orleans and their parish pastors, and are located next to parish
churches and sometimes a rectory or convent. Id., at 144a. The schools
include religious symbols in their classrooms, App. 75a, require attendance
at daily religion classes, id., at 76a, conduct sacramental preparation

their common objective and mission was to engage in reli-gious education,

24 and that their teachers taught religiously,25 making them precisely the kind of primary and

classes during the schoolday, require attendance at mass, and provide extracurricular religious activities. At least some exercise a religious preference in accepting students and in charging tuition. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 145a.

24 The District Court found that the mission of the Roman Catholic

schools is religious education based on the Archdiocese's and the individual
schools' published statements of philosophy. For example, the St. Anthony School Handbook, cited by the District Court, reads:

"Catholic education is intended to make men's faith become living, conscious and active through the light of instruction. The Catholic school is
the unique setting within which this ideal can be realized in the lives of
the Catholic children and young people.

"Only in such a school can they experience learning and living fully integrated in the light of faith. . . . Here, too, instruction in religious truth and
values is an integral part of the school program. It is not one more subject along side the rest, but instead it is perceived and functions as the
underlying reality in which the student's experiences of learning and living achieve their coherence and their deepest meaning." Ibid.

The Handbook of Policies and Regulations for Elementary Schools of
the Archdiocese of New Orleans indicates that the operation of the Roman
Catholic schools is governed by canon law. It also lists the major objectives of those schools as follows:

"To work closely with the home in educating children towards the fullness of Christian life.

"To specifically teach Catholic principles and Christian values." Id., at
146a.

The mission statements and objectives outlined by the other Roman Catholic schools also support the conclusion that these institutions' primary
objective is religious instruction. See also App. 65a, 71a.

25 The Archdiocese's official policy calls for religious preferences in hiring and the contracts of principals and teachers in its schools contain a
provision allowing for termination for lifestyle contrary to the teachings
of the Roman Catholic church. App. to Pet. for Cert. 145a. One of the
objectives of the handbook is "[t]o encourage teachers to become committed Christians and to develop professional competence." Id., at 146a.
Other record evidence supports the conclusion that these religious schoolteachers teach religiously. See, e. g., App. 125a (deposition of president of
sectarian high school) ("Our teachers, whether they are religion teachers

secondary religious schools that raise the most seriousEstablishment Clause concerns. See Walz, 397 U. S., at 671;

Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743; Lemon, supra, at 636-637. Thethreat to Establishment Clause values was accordingly at its
highest in the circumstances of this case. Such precaution-ary features as there were in the Jefferson Parish scheme
were grossly inadequate to counter the threat. To be sure,the disbursement of the aid was subject to statutory admonitions against diversion, see, e. g., 20 U. S. C. $$ 7332, 8897,and was supposedly subject to a variety of safeguards, see
ante, at 802-803, 832-834. But the provisions for onsitemonitoring visits, labeling of government property, and
government oversight cannot be accepted as sufficient inthe face of record evidence that the safeguard provisions
proved to be empty phrases in Jefferson Parish. Cf. Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229; Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 13 (accept-ing precautionary provisions in absence of evidence of their

uselessness).The plurality has already noted at length the ineffectiveness of the government's monitoring program. Ante, at832-834; see also App. 111a ("A system to monitor nonpublic
schools was often not in operation and therefore the [local
educational agency] did not always know: (a) what was pur-chased or (b) how it was utilized"). Monitors visited a nonpublic school only sporadically, discussed the program with asingle contact person, observed nothing more than attempts
at recordkeeping, and failed to inform the teachers of therestrictions involved.

Id., at 154a-155a. Although Chapter
2 required labeling of government property, it occurred hap-hazardly at best,

id., at 113a, and the government's sole monitoring system for computer use amounted to nothing more

than questioning school officials and examining the location
of computers at the schools, id., at 118a. No records of software and computer use were kept, and no such recordkeeping was even planned. Id., at 118a, 164a-166a. State and
local officials in Jefferson Parish admitted that nothing prevented the Chapter 2 computers from being used for religious instruction, id., at 102a, 118a, 164a-166a, and although
they knew of methods of monitoring computer usage, such
as locking the computer functions, id., at 165a-166a, they

implemented no particular policies, instituted no systems,
and employed no technologies to minimize the likelihood of
diversion to religious uses,26 id., at 118a, 165a-166a. The
watchdogs did require the religious schools to give not so
much as an assurance that they would use Chapter 2 computers solely for secular purposes, Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d
347, 368 (1998), amended, 165 F. 3d 311 (CA5 1999); App.
94a-95a. Government officials themselves admitted that
there was no way to tell whether instructional materials had

book scheme was a review of titles by a single government
official, ante, at 832-833, n. 15; see App. 137a. The government did not even have a policy on the consequences of noncompliance. Id., at 145a.

The risk of immediate diversion of Chapter 2 benefits had
its complement in the risk of future diversion, against which
the Jefferson Parish program had absolutely no protection.
By statute all purchases with Chapter 2 aid were to remain
the property of the United States, 20 U. S. C. $ 7372(c)(1),
merely being "lent" to the recipient nonpublic schools. In
actuality, however, the record indicates that nothing in the

1999) is misplaced. See App. to Brief for Secretary of Education 1a. It
was not in place when discovery closed in this matter, and merely highlights the reasons for a lack of evidence on diversion or compliance.

Jefferson Parish program stood in the way of giving theChapter 2 property outright to the religious schools when it

became older. Although old equipment remained the prop-erty of the local education agency, a local government administrative body, one agency employee testified that there wasno set policy for dealing with old computers, which were
probably given outright to the religious schools. App. 161a-
162a. The witness said that government-funded instruc-tional materials, too, were probably left with the religious

schools when they were old, and that it was unclear whetherlibrary books were ever to be returned to the government.

Providing such governmental aid without effective safeguards against future diversion itself offends the Establishment Clause, Tilton, 403 U. S., at 682-684; Nyquist, 413
U. S., at 776-777, and even without evidence of actual diversion, our cases have repeatedly held that a "substantial risk"
of it suffices to invalidate a government aid program on establishment grounds. See, e. g., Wolman, 433 U. S., at 254
(invalidating aid for transportation on teacher-accompanied
field trips because an "unacceptable risk of fostering of religion" was "an inevitable byproduct"); Meek, 421 U. S., at 372
(striking down program because of a "potential for impermissible fostering of religion"); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 (invalidating aid for tests designed by religious teachers because
of "the substantial risk that . . . examinations, prepared by
teachers under the authority of religious institutions, will be
drafted with an eye, unconsciously or otherwise, to inculcate
students in the religious precepts of the sponsoring church");

for impermissible fostering of religion"); cf. Bowen, 487 U. S.,

out, a case may be remanded for findings on actual diversion

gious testing). A substantial risk of diversion in this casewas more than clear, as the plurality has conceded. The

First Amendment was violated.But the record here goes beyond risk, to instances of
actual diversion. What one would expect from such paltryefforts at monitoring and enforcement naturally resulted,
and the record strongly suggests that other, undocumented
diversions probably occurred as well. First, the recordshows actual diversion in the library book program. App.

132a-133a. Although only limited evidence exists, it con-trasts starkly with the records of the numerous textbook
programs that we have repeatedly upheld, where there wasno evidence of any actual diversion. See

Allen, 392 U. S., at
244-245; Meek, supra, at 361-362; Wolman, supra, at 237-238. Here, discovery revealed that under Chapter 2, nonpublic schools requested and the government purchased atleast 191 religious books with taxpayer funds by December
1985.27 App. 133a. Books such as A Child's Book of Prayers, id., at 84a, and The Illustrated Life of Jesus, id., at 132a,

27 The plurality applies inconsistent standards to the evidence. Although the plurality finds more limited evidence of actual diversion sufficient to support a general finding of diversion in the computer and instructional materials context, even in the face of Justice O'Connor's
objections, it fails to find a violation of the prohibition against providing
aid with religious content based on the more stark, undisputed evidence
of religious books. Compare ante, at 832-834, and nn. 14-17, with ante,
at 834-835. As a matter of precedent, the correct evidentiary standard
is clearly the former: "[A]ny use of public funds to promote religious
doctrines violates the Establishment Clause." Bowen, 487 U. S., at 623
(O'Connor, J., concurring). We have never before found any actual diversion or allowed a risk of it; we have struck down policies that might permit
it, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 682-684, or have remanded for specific factual
findings about whether diversion occurred, Bowen, supra, at 621. See
supra, at 890-895. As a matter of principle, this low threshold is required
to safeguard the values of the First Amendment. Madison's words make
clear that even a small infringement of the prohibition on compelled aid
to religion is odious to the freedom of conscience. No less does it open
the door to the threat of corruption or to a return to religious conflict.

were discovered among others that had been ordered underthe program. See also id., at 59a-62a.

The evidence persuasively suggests that other aid was ac-tually diverted as well. The principal of one religious school
testified, for example, that computers lent with Chapter 2funds were joined in a network with other non-Chapter 2
computers in some schools, and that religious officials andteachers were allowed to develop their own unregulated
software for use on this network. Id., at 77a. She ad-mitted that the Chapter 2 computer took over the support of
the computing system whenever there was a breakdown ofthe master computer purchased with the religious school's
own funds. Ibid. Moreover, as the plurality observes,
ante, at 833-834, n. 17, comparing the records of considerablefederal funding of audiovisual equipment in religious schools

with records of the schools' use of unidentified audiovisualequipment in religion classes strongly suggests that film projectors and videotape machines purchased with public fundswere used in religious indoctrination over a period of at least
seven years. App. 205a, 210a, 206a-207a; see also id., at
108a (statement of second-grade teacher indicating that sheused audiovisual materials in all classes).

Indeed, the plurality readily recognizes that the aid inquestion here was divertible and that substantial evidence
of actual diversion exists. Ante, at 832-834, and nn. 14-17.Although

Justice O'Connor attributes limited significance
to the evidence of divertibility and actual diversion, she alsorecognizes that it exists.

Ante, at 864-865 (opinion concurring in judgment). The Court has no choice but to hold thatthe program as applied violated the Establishment Clause.

28 Since the divertibility and diversion require a finding of unconstitutionality, I will not explore other grounds, beyond noting the likelihood
that unconstitutional supplantation occurred as well. The record demonstrates that Chapter 2 aid impermissibly relieved religious schools of some
costs that they otherwise would have borne, and so unconstitutionally sup530US2 Unit: $U84 [11-21-01 16:33:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN

The plurality would break with the law. The majoritymisapplies it. That misapplication is, however, the only consolation in the case, which reaches an erroneous result butdoes not stage a doctrinal coup. But there is no mistaking
the abandonment of doctrine that would occur if the pluralitywere to become a majority. It is beyond question that the
plurality's notion of evenhandedness neutrality as a practicalguarantee of the validity of aid to sectarian schools would be
the end of the principle of no aid to the schools' religiousmission. And if that were not so obvious it would become
so after reflecting on the plurality's thoughts about diversion
planted support in some budgetary categories. The record of affidavits
and evaluation forms by religious schoolteachers and officials indicates
that Chapter 2 aid was significant in the development of teaching curriculums, the introduction of new programs, and the support of old ones.
App. 105a-108a, 184a-185a. The evidence shows that the concept of
supplementing instead of supplanting was poorly understood by the sole
government official administering the program, who apparently believed
that the bar on supplanting was nothing more than a prohibition on paying
for replacements of equipment that religious schools had previously purchased. Id., at 167a. Government officials admitted that there was no
way to determine whether payments for materials, equipment, books, or
other assistance provided under the program reduced the amount of
money budgeted for library and educational equipment, id., at 145a-146a,
and the 1985 Monitoring Report shows that the officials of at least one
religious school admitted that the government aid was used to create the
library, with the school's regular funds, when occasionally available, used
merely to supplement the government money, Fine Deposition, id., at 63a.
The use records for audiovisual materials at one religious high school revealed that Chapter 2 funds were essential to the school's educational
process, id., at 187a, and a different school, as already noted, used a Chapter 2 computer to support its computer network when its own computers
failed, id., at 77a. The record is sparse, but these incidents suggest that
the constitutional and statutory prohibition on supplanting expenses may
have been largely aspirational. It seems that the program in Jefferson
Parish violated the statute and ran afoul of the Constitution. Cf. Nyquist,
413 U. S., at 783; Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12.

and about giving attention to the pervasiveness of a school'ssectarian teaching.

The plurality is candid in pointing out the extent of actualdiversion of Chapter 2 aid to religious use in the case before
us, ante, at 832-834, and n. 17, and equally candid in saying itdoes not matter, ante, at 820-825, 833-834. To the plurality
there is nothing wrong with aiding a school's religious mis-sion; the only question is whether religious teaching obtains
its tax support under a formally evenhanded criterion of dis-tribution. The principle of no aid to religious teaching has
no independent significance.And if this were not enough to prove that no aid in religious school aid is dead under the plurality's First Amend-ment, the point is nailed down in the plurality's attack on
the legitimacy of considering a school's pervasively sectariancharacter when judging whether aid to the school is likely to
aid its religious mission. Ante, at 826-829. The relevanceof this consideration is simply a matter of common sense:
where religious indoctrination pervades school activities ofchildren and adolescents, it takes great care to be able to aid
the school without supporting the doctrinal effort. This isobvious. The plurality nonetheless condemns any enquiry
into the pervasiveness of doctrinal content as a remnant ofanti-Catholic bigotry (as if evangelical Protestant schools and
Orthodox Jewish yeshivas were never pervasively sectar-ian

29), and it equates a refusal to aid religious schools with

hostility to religion (as if aid to religious teaching were not

30 and numerous religious amici curiae 31 in a tradition

claiming descent from Roger Williams). My concern withthese arguments goes not so much to their details

32 as it

does to the fact that the plurality's choice to employ imputa-tions of bigotry and irreligion as terms in the Court's debate

makes one point clear: that in rejecting the principle of noaid to a school's religious mission the plurality is attacking
the most fundamental assumption underlying the Establish-ment Clause, that government can in fact operate with neutrality in its relation to religion. I believe that it can, andso respectfully dissent.

30 One of the respondents describes herself as a "life-long, committed
member of the Roman Catholic Church" who "objects to the government
providing benefits to her parish school" because "[s]he has seen the chilling
effect such entangling government aid has on the religious mission of
schools run by her church." Brief for Respondents 1. She has been a
member of the church for about 36 years, and six of her children attended
different Jefferson Parish Catholic run schools. Id., at 1, n. 1.

32 I do not think it worthwhile to comment at length, for example, on

the plurality's clear misunderstanding of our access-to-public-forum cases,
such as Lamb's Chapel and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981), as
"decisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating in the
distribution of public benefits based on religious status or sincerity," ante,
at 828, when they were decided on completely different and narrowly limited free-speech grounds. Nor would it be worthwhile here to engage in
extended discussion of why the goal of preventing courts from having to
"trol[l] through a person's or institution's religious beliefs," ibid., calls for
less aid and commingling of government with religion, not for tolerance of
their effects.

STENBERG, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEBRASKA,

et al. v. CARHART

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 99-830. Argued April 25, 2000--Decided June 28, 2000
The Constitution offers basic protection to a woman's right to choose

whether to have an abortion. Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113; Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833. Before fetal viability, a woman has a right to terminate her pregnancy, id., at 870 (plurality
opinion), and a state law is unconstitutional if it imposes on the woman's
decision an "undue burden," i. e., if it has the purpose or effect of placing
a substantial obstacle in the woman's path, id., at 877. Postviability,
the State, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life,
may regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where "necessary, in
appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the [mother's] life
or health." E. g., id., at 879. The Nebraska law at issue prohibits any
"partial birth abortion" unless that procedure is necessary to save the
mother's life. It defines "partial birth abortion" as a procedure in
which the doctor "partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the . . . child," and defines the latter phrase to mean "intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial
portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the
[abortionist] knows will kill the . . . child and does kill the . . . child."
Violation of the law is a felony, and it provides for the automatic revocation of a convicted doctor's state license to practice medicine. Respondent Carhart, a Nebraska physician who performs abortions in a clinical
setting, brought this suit seeking a declaration that the statute violates
the Federal Constitution. The District Court held the statute unconstitutional. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Nebraska's statute criminalizing the performance of "partial birth

abortion[s]" violates the Federal Constitution, as interpreted in Casey
and Roe. Pp. 922-946.

(a) Because the statute seeks to ban one abortion method, the Court
discusses several different abortion procedures, as described in the evidence below and the medical literature. During a pregnancy's second
trimester (12 to 24 weeks), the most common abortion procedure is "dilation and evacuation" (D&E), which involves dilation of the cervix, removal of at least some fetal tissue using nonvacuum surgical instruments, and (after the 15th week) the potential need for instrumental

Syllabus
dismemberment of the fetus or the collapse of fetal parts to facilitate
evacuation from the uterus. When such dismemberment is necessary,
it typically occurs as the doctor pulls a portion of the fetus through the
cervix into the birth canal. The risks of mortality and complication
that accompany D&E are significantly lower than those accompanying
induced labor procedures (the next safest midsecond trimester procedures). A variation of D&E, known as "intact D&E," is used after 16
weeks. It involves removing the fetus from the uterus through the
cervix "intact," i. e., in one pass rather than several passes. The intact
D&E proceeds in one of two ways, depending on whether the fetus presents head first or feet first. The feet-first method is known as "dilation
and extraction" (D&X). D&X is ordinarily associated with the term
"partial birth abortion." The District Court concluded that clear and
convincing evidence established that Carhart's D&X procedure is superior to, and safer than, the D&E and other abortion procedures used
during the relevant gestational period in the 10 to 20 cases a year

that present to Carhart. Moreover, materials presented at trial emphasize the potential benefits of the D&X procedure in certain cases.
Pp. 923-929.

(b) The Nebraska statute lacks the requisite exception "for the preservation of the . . . health of the mother." Casey, supra, at 879 (plurality opinion). The State may promote but not endanger a woman's
health when it regulates the methods of abortion. Pp. 929-938.

(i) The Court rejects Nebraska's contention that there is no need
for a health exception here because safe alternatives remain available and a ban on partial birth abortion/D&X would create no risk
to women's health. The parties strongly contested this factual question in the District Court; and the findings and evidence support
Dr. Carhart. Pp. 931-933.

(ii) Nebraska and its supporting amici respond with eight arguments as to why the District Court's findings are irrelevant, wrong, or
applicable only in a tiny number of instances. Pp. 933-934.

(iii) The eight arguments are insufficient to demonstrate that Nebraska's law needs no health exception. For one thing, certain of the
arguments are beside the point. The D&X procedure's relative rarity
(argument (1)) is not highly relevant. The State cannot prohibit a person from obtaining treatment simply by pointing out that most people
do not need it. And the fact that only a "handful" of doctors use the
procedure (argument (2)) may reflect the comparative rarity of late
second term abortions, the procedure's recent development, the controversy surrounding it, or, as Nebraska suggests, the procedure's lack
of utility. For another thing, the record responds to Nebraska's (and
amici's) medically based arguments. As to argument (3), the District

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
916 STENBERG v. CARHART

Syllabus
Court agreed that alternatives such as D&E and induced labor are
"safe," but found that the D&X method was safer in the circumstances
used by Carhart. As to argument (4)--that testimony showed that the
statutory ban would not increase a woman's risk of several rare abortion
complications--the District Court simply relied on different expert testimony than the State. Argument (5)--the assertion of amici Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. that elements of the
D&X procedure may create special risks--is disputed by Carhart's
amici, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which claims that the suggested alternative procedures
involve similar or greater risks of cervical and uterine injury. Nebraska's argument (6) is right--there are no general medical studies documenting the comparative safety of the various abortion procedures.
Nor does the Court deny the import of the American Medical Association's (AMA) recommendation (argument (7)) that intact D&X not be
used unless alternative procedures pose materially greater risk to the
woman. However, the Court cannot read ACOG's qualification that it
could not identify a circumstance where D&X was the "only" life- or
health-preserving option as if, according to Nebraska's argument (8), it
denied the potential health-related need for D&X. ACOG has also asserted that D&X can be the most appropriate abortion procedure and
presents a variety of potential safety advantages. Pp. 934-936.

(iv) The upshot is a District Court finding that D&X obviates
health risks in certain circumstances, a highly plausible record-based
explanation of why that might be so, a division of medical opinion over
whether D&X is generally safer, and an absence of controlled medical
studies that would help answer these medical questions. Given these
circumstances, the Court believes the law requires a health exception.
For one thing, the word "necessary" in Casey's phrase "necessary, in
appropriate medical judgment, for the . . . health of the mother," 505
U. S., at 879, cannot refer to absolute proof or require unanimity of medical opinion. Doctors often differ in their estimation of comparative
health risks and appropriate treatment. And Casey's words "appropriate medical judgment" must embody the judicial need to tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion. For another thing, the division of medical opinion signals uncertainty. If those who believe that
D&X is a safer abortion method in certain circumstances turn out to be
right, the absence of a health exception will place women at an unnecessary risk. If they are wrong, the exception will simply turn out to have
been unnecessary. Pp. 936-938.

(c) The Nebraska statute imposes an "undue burden" on a woman's
ability to choose an abortion. See Casey, supra, at 874 (plurality opinion). Pp. 938-946.

Syllabus
(i) Nebraska does not deny that the statute imposes an "undue burden" if it applies to the more commonly used D&E procedure as well
as to D&X. This Court agrees with the Eighth Circuit that the D&E
procedure falls within the statutory prohibition of intentionally delivering into the vagina a living fetus, or "a substantial portion thereof," for
the purpose of performing a procedure that the perpetrator knows will
kill the fetus. Because the evidence makes clear that D&E will often
involve a physician pulling an arm, leg, or other "substantial portion" of
a still living fetus into the vagina prior to the fetus' death, the statutory
terms do not to distinguish between D&X and D&E. The statute's language does not track the medical differences between D&E and D&X,
but covers both. Using the law's statutory terms, it is impossible to
distinguish between D&E (where a foot or arm is drawn through the
cervix) and D&X (where the body up to the head is drawn through the
cervix). Both procedures can involve the introduction of a "substantial
portion" of a still living fetus, through the cervix, into the vagina--the
very feature of an abortion that leads to characterizing such a procedure
as involving "partial birth." Pp. 938-940.

(ii) The Court rejects the Nebraska Attorney General's arguments
that the state law does differentiate between the two procedures--i. e.,
that the words "substantial portion" mean "the child up to the head,"
such that the law is inapplicable where the physician introduces into the
birth canal anything less than the entire fetal body--and that the Court
must defer to his views. The Court's case law makes clear that the
Attorney General's narrowing interpretation cannot be given controlling weight. For one thing, this Court normally follows lower federalcourt interpretations of state law, e. g., McMillian v. Monroe County,
520 U. S. 781, 786, and rarely reviews such an interpretation that is
agreed upon by the two lower federal courts. Virginia v. American
Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 395. Here, the two lower courts
both rejected the Attorney General's narrowing interpretation. For
another, the Court's precedent warns against accepting as "authoritative" an Attorney General's interpretation of state law where, as here,
that interpretation does not bind the state courts or local law enforcement. In Nebraska, elected county attorneys have independent authority to initiate criminal prosecutions. Some present prosecutors (and
future Attorneys General) might use the law at issue to pursue physicians who use D&E procedures. Nor can it be said that the lower
courts used the wrong legal standard in assessing the Attorney General's interpretation. The Eighth Circuit recognized its duty to give the
law a construction that would avoid constitutional doubt, but nonetheless concluded that the Attorney General's interpretation would twist
the law's words, giving them a meaning they cannot reasonably bear.

918 STENBERG v. CARHART

Syllabus
The Eighth Circuit is far from alone in rejecting such a narrowing interpretation, since 11 of the 12 federal courts that have interpreted on the
merits the model statutory language on which the Nebraska law is based
have found the language potentially applicable to abortion procedures
other than D&X. Regardless, were the Court to grant the Attorney
General's views "substantial weight," it would still have to reject his
interpretation, for it conflicts with the statutory language. The statutory words, "substantial portion," indicate that the statute does not
include the Attorney General's restriction--"the child up to the head."
The Nebraska Legislature's debates hurt the Attorney General's argument more than they help it, indicating that as small a portion of the
fetus as a foot would constitute a "substantial portion." Even assuming
that the distinction the Attorney General seeks to draw between the
overall abortion procedure itself and the separate procedure used to kill
an unborn child would help him make the D&E/D&X distinction he
seeks, there is no language in the statute that supports it. Although
adopting his interpretation might avoid the constitutional problem discussed above, the Court lacks power do so where, as here, the narrowing construction is not reasonable and readily apparent. E. g., Boos v.
Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 330. Finally, the Court has never held that a
federal litigant must await a state-court construction or the development of an established practice before bringing the federal suit. City
of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U. S. 750, 770, n. 11.
But any authoritative state-court construction is lacking here. The Attorney General neither sought a narrowing interpretation from the Nebraska Supreme Court nor asked the federal courts to certify the interpretive question. Cf. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520
U. S. 43. Even were the Court inclined to certify the question now, it
could not do so because certification is appropriate only where the statute is "fairly susceptible" to a narrowing construction, see Houston v.
Hill, 482 U. S. 451, 468-471, as is not the case here. Moreover, the
Nebraska Supreme Court grants certification only if the certified question is determinative of the cause, see id., at 471, as it would not be
here. In sum, because all those who perform abortion procedures using
the D&E method must fear prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment,
the Nebraska law imposes an undue burden upon a woman's right to
make an abortion decision. Pp. 940-946.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
We again consider the right to an abortion. We understand the controversial nature of the problem. Millions of
Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an
innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would
permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack
dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those
with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the
attendant risks of death and suffering. Taking account of

Opinion of the Court
these virtually irreconcilable points of view, aware that con-stitutional law must govern a society whose different members sincerely hold directly opposing views, and consideringthe matter in light of the Constitution's guarantees of fundamental individual liberty, this Court, in the course of a gen-eration, has determined and then redetermined that the Constitution offers basic protection to the woman's right tochoose.

Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Planned Parent-hood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). We

shall not revisit those legal principles. Rather, we applythem to the circumstances of this case.

Three established principles determine the issue before us.We shall set them forth in the language of the joint opinion
in Casey. First, before "viability . . . the woman has a rightto choose to terminate her pregnancy." Id., at 870 (plurality opinion).Second, "a law designed to further the State's interest in
fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman'sdecision before fetal viability" is unconstitutional.

Id., at877. An "undue burden is . . . shorthand for the conclusion

that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing asubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus." Ibid.Third, " `subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its
interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses,regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preserva-tion of the life or health of the mother.' " Id., at 879 (quoting
Roe v. Wade, supra, at 164-165).We apply these principles to a Nebraska law banning "partial birth abortion." The statute reads as follows:

"No partial birth abortion shall be performed in thisstate, unless such procedure is necessary to save the life

of the mother whose life is endangered by a physicaldisorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including
a life-endangering physical condition caused by or aris530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ing from the pregnancy itself." Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999).

The statute defines "partial birth abortion" as:

"an abortion procedure in which the person performingthe abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn

child before killing the unborn child and completing thedelivery." $ 28-326(9).

It further defines "partially delivers vaginally a living un-born child before killing the unborn child" to mean

"deliberately and intentionally delivering into the va-gina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion
thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure thatthe person performing such procedure knows will kill
the unborn child and does kill the unborn child." Ibid.
The law classifies violation of the statute as a "Class III fel-ony" carrying a prison term of up to 20 years, and a fine of up

to $25,000. $$ 28-328(2), 28-105. It also provides for theautomatic revocation of a doctor's license to practice medicine in Nebraska. $ 28-328(4).We hold that this statute violates the Constitution.

A

Dr. Leroy Carhart is a Nebraska physician who performsabortions in a clinical setting. He brought this lawsuit in

Federal District Court seeking a declaration that the Ne-braska statute violates the Federal Constitution, and asking
for an injunction forbidding its enforcement. After a trialon the merits, during which both sides presented several
expert witnesses, the District Court held the statute uncon-stitutional. 11 F. Supp. 2d 1099 (Neb. 1998). On appeal, the
Eighth Circuit affirmed. 192 F. 3d 1142 (1999); cf. Hope
Clinic v. Ryan, 195 F. 3d 857 (CA7 1999) (en banc) (consider530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ing a similar statute, but reaching a different legal conclu-sion). We granted certiorari to consider the matter.

B
Because Nebraska law seeks to ban one method of abort-ing a pregnancy, we must describe and then discuss several

different abortion procedures. Considering the fact thatthose procedures seek to terminate a potential human life,
our discussion may seem clinically cold or callous to some,perhaps horrifying to others. There is no alternative way,
however, to acquaint the reader with the technical distinc-tions among different abortion methods and related factual
matters, upon which the outcome of this case depends. Forthat reason, drawing upon the findings of the trial court,
underlying testimony, and related medical texts, we shalldescribe the relevant methods of performing abortions in
technical detail.The evidence before the trial court, as supported or supplemented in the literature, indicates the following:1. About 90% of all abortions performed in the United
States take place during the first trimester of pregnancy,before 12 weeks of gestational age. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Abortion Surveillance--UnitedStates, 1996, p. 41 (July 30, 1999) (hereinafter Abortion
Surveillance). During the first trimester, the predominantabortion method is "vacuum aspiration," which involves insertion of a vacuum tube (cannula) into the uterus to evacu-ate the contents. Such an abortion is typically performed
on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia. 11 F. Supp.2d, at 1102; Obstetrics: Normal & Problem Pregnancies
1253-1254 (S. Gabbe, J. Niebyl, & J. Simpson eds. 3d ed.1996). Vacuum aspiration is considered particularly safe.
The procedure's mortality rates for first trimester abortionare, for example, 5 to 10 times lower than those associated
with carrying the fetus to term. Complication rates are alsolow.

Opinion of the Court
States, 1972 through 1987, 171 Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1365,1368 (1994); M. Paul et al., A Clinicians Guide to Medical

and Surgical Abortion 108-109 (1999) (hereinafter Medi-cal and Surgical Abortion). As the fetus grows in size, however, the vacuum aspiration method becomes increasinglydifficult to use. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1102-1103; Obstetrics:
Normal & Problem Pregnancies, supra, at 1268.2. Approximately 10% of all abortions are performed during the second trimester of pregnancy (12 to 24 weeks).Abortion Surveillance 41. In the early 1970's, inducing
labor through the injection of saline into the uterus was thepredominant method of second trimester abortion.

Id., at 8;Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S.

52, 76 (1976). Today, however, the medical profession hasswitched from medical induction of labor to surgical procedures for most second trimester abortions. The most com-monly used procedure is called "dilation and evacuation"
(D&E). That procedure (together with a modified formof vacuum aspiration used in the early second trimester)
accounts for about 95% of all abortions performed from 12to 20 weeks of gestational age. Abortion Surveillance 41.

3. D&E "refers generically to transcervical proceduresperformed at 13 weeks gestation or later." American Medical Association, Report of Board of Trustees on Late-TermAbortion, App. 490 (hereinafter AMA Report). The AMA
Report, adopted by the District Court, describes the processas follows.

Between 13 and 15 weeks of gestation:

"D&E is similar to vacuum aspiration except that thecervix must be dilated more widely because surgical instruments are used to remove larger pieces of tissue.Osmotic dilators are usually used. Intravenous fluids
and an analgesic or sedative may be administered. Alocal anesthetic such as a paracervical block may be
administered, dilating agents, if used, are removed andinstruments are inserted through the cervix into the

Opinion of the Court
uterus to removal fetal and placental tissue. Becausefetal tissue is friable and easily broken, the fetus may

not be removed intact. The walls of the uterus arescraped with a curette to ensure that no tissue remains."
Id., at 490-491.
After 15 weeks:

"Because the fetus is larger at this stage of gestation(particularly the head), and because bones are more

rigid, dismemberment or other destructive proceduresare more likely to be required than at earlier gestational
ages to remove fetal and placental tissue." Id., at 491.
After 20 weeks:

"Some physicians use intrafetal potassium chloride ordigoxin to induce fetal demise prior to a late D&E (after

20 weeks), to facilitate evacuation." Id., at 491-492.
There are variations in D&E operative strategy; compare
ibid. with W. Hern, Abortion Practice 146-156 (1984), andMedical and Surgical Abortion 133-135. However, the common points are that D&E involves (1) dilation of the cervix;(2) removal of at least some fetal tissue using nonvacuum
instruments; and (3) (after the 15th week) the potential needfor instrumental disarticulation or dismemberment of the
fetus or the collapse of fetal parts to facilitate evacuationfrom the uterus.

4. When instrumental disarticulation incident to D&E isnecessary, it typically occurs as the doctor pulls a portion of
the fetus through the cervix into the birth canal. Dr. Car-hart testified at trial as follows:

"Dr. Carhart: . . . `The dismemberment occurs betweenthe traction of . . . my instrument and the countertraction of the internal os of the cervix . . . .
"Counsel: `So the dismemberment occurs after youpulled a part of the fetus through the cervix, is that

correct?

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
926 STENBERG v. CARHART

Opinion of the Court
"Dr. Carhart: `Exactly. Because you're using--The cer-vix has two strictures or two rings, the internal os and

the external os . . . that's what's actually doing thedismembering. . . .
"Counsel: `When we talked before or talked beforeabout a D&E, that is not--where there is not intention
to do it intact, do you, in that situation, dismember thefetus in utero first, then remove portions?
"Dr. Carhart: `I don't think so. . . . I don't know of any
way that one could go in and intentionally dismember
the fetus in the uterus. . . . It takes something that
restricts the motion of the fetus against what you're
doing before you're going to get dismemberment.' " 11
F. Supp. 2d, at 1104.

Dr. Carhart's specification of the location of fetal disarticulation is consistent with other sources. See Medical and Surgical Abortion 135; App. in Nos. 98-3245 and 98-3300 (CA8),
p. 683, (testimony of Dr. Phillip Stubblefield) ("Q: So you
don't actually dismember the fetus in utero, then take the
pieces out? A: No").

5. The D&E procedure carries certain risks. The use of
instruments within the uterus creates a danger of accidental
perforation and damage to neighboring organs. Sharp fetal
bone fragments create similar dangers. And fetal tissue accidentally left behind can cause infection and various other
complications. See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1110; Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery 1045 (D. Nichols & D. ClarkePearson eds. 2d ed. 2000); F. Cunningham et al., Williams
Obstetrics 598 (20th ed. 1997). Nonetheless studies show
that the risks of mortality and complication that accompany
the D&E procedure between the 12th and 20th weeks of gestation are significantly lower than those accompanying induced labor procedures (the next safest midsecond trimester
procedures). See Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, supra, at 1046; AMA Report, App. 495, 496; Medical

Opinion of the Court
and Surgical Abortion 139, 142; Lawson, 171 Am. J. Obstet.Gynecol., at 1368.

6. At trial, Dr. Carhart and Dr. Stubblefield described avariation of the D&E procedure, which they referred to as
an "intact D&E." See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105, 1111. Likeother versions of the D&E technique, it begins with induced
dilation of the cervix. The procedure then involves removing the fetus from the uterus through the cervix "intact,"
i. e., in one pass, rather than in several passes. Ibid. It is
used after 16 weeks at the earliest, as vacuum aspirationbecomes ineffective and the fetal skull becomes too large to

pass through the cervix. Id., at 1105. The intact D&E proceeds in one of two ways, depending on the presentation of
the fetus. If the fetus presents head first (a vertex presentation), the doctor collapses the skull; and the doctor then
extracts the entire fetus through the cervix. If the fetus
presents feet first (a breech presentation), the doctor pulls
the fetal body through the cervix, collapses the skull, and
extracts the fetus through the cervix. Ibid. The breech
extraction version of the intact D&E is also known commonly as "dilation and extraction," or D&X. Id., at 1112.
In the late second trimester, vertex, breech, and traverse/
compound (sideways) presentations occur in roughly similar
proportions. Medical and Surgical Abortion 135; 11 F. Supp.
2d, at 1108.

7. The intact D&E procedure can also be found described
in certain obstetric and abortion clinical textbooks, where
two variations are recognized. The first, as just described,
calls for the physician to adapt his method for extracting the
intact fetus depending on fetal presentation. See Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, supra, at 1043; Medical
and Surgical Abortion 136-137. This is the method used by
Dr. Carhart. See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105. A slightly different version of the intact D&E procedure, associated with
Dr. Martin Haskell, calls for conversion to a breech presentation in all cases. See Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related

Opinion of the Court
Surgery, supra, at 1043 (citing M. Haskell, Dilation and Ex-traction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), in 139

Cong. Rec. 8605 (1993)).8. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes the D&X procedure in a manner correspond-ing to a breech-conversion intact D&E, including the following steps:

"1. deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a
sequence of days;"2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling

breech;"3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head;
and

"4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents ofa living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but

otherwise intact fetus." American College of Obste-tricians and Gynecologists Executive Board, Statement
on Intact Dilation and Extraction (Jan. 12, 1997) (here-inafter ACOG Statement), App. 599-560.

Despite the technical differences we have just described, intact D&E and D&X are sufficiently similar for us to use the
terms interchangeably.9. Dr. Carhart testified he attempts to use the intact

D&E procedure during weeks 16 to 20 because (1) it reducesthe dangers from sharp bone fragments passing through the
cervix, (2) minimizes the number of instrument passesneeded for extraction and lessens the likelihood of uterine
perforations caused by those instruments, (3) reduces thelikelihood of leaving infection-causing fetal and placental tissue in the uterus, and (4) could help to prevent potentially
fatal absorption of fetal tissue into the maternal circulation.
See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1107. The District Court made no
findings about the D&X procedure's overall safety. Id., at
1126, n. 39. The District Court concluded, however, that
"the evidence is both clear and convincing that Carhart's

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
D&X procedure is superior to, and safer than, the . . . otherabortion procedures used during the relevant gestational period in the 10 to 20 cases a year that present to Dr. Carhart."Id., at 1126.

10. The materials presented at trial referred to the poten-tial benefits of the D&X procedure in circumstances involving nonviable fetuses, such as fetuses with abnormal fluidaccumulation in the brain (hydrocephaly). See 11 F. Supp.
2d, at 1107 (quoting AMA Report, App. 492 (" `Intact D&Xmay be preferred by some physicians, particularly when the
fetus has been diagnosed with hydrocephaly or other anoma-lies incompatible with life outside the womb' ")); see also
Grimes, The Continuing Need for Late Abortions, 280 JAMA747, 748 (Aug. 26, 1998) (D&X "may be especially useful in
the presence of fetal anomalies, such as hydrocephalus," be-cause its reduction of the cranium allows "a smaller diameter
to pass through the cervix, thus reducing risk of cervicalinjury"). Others have emphasized its potential for women
with prior uterine scars, or for women for whom inductionof labor would be particularly dangerous. See Women's
Medical Professional Corp. v. Voinovich, 911 F. Supp. 2d1051, 1067 (SD Ohio 1995); Evans v. Kelley, 977 F. Supp. 2d
1283, 1296 (ED Mich. 1997).11. There are no reliable data on the number of D&X abortions performed annually. Estimates have ranged between640 and 5,000 per year. Compare Henshaw, Abortion Incidence and Services in the United States, 1995-1996, 30 Fam-ily Planning Perspectives 263, 268 (1998), with Joint Hearing
on S. 6 and H. R. 929 before the Senate Committee on theJudiciary and the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 1st Sess.,46 (1997).

II
The question before us is whether Nebraska's statute,making criminal the performance of a "partial birth abortion," violates the Federal Constitution, as interpreted in

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
930 STENBERG v. CARHART

Opinion of the Court
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.833 (1992), and Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). We conclude that it does for at least two independent reasons.First, the law lacks any exception " `for the preservation of
the . . . health of the mother.' " Casey, 505 U. S., at 879 (plu-rality opinion). Second, it "imposes an undue burden on a
woman's ability" to choose a D&E abortion, thereby undulyburdening the right to choose abortion itself.

Id., at 874.We shall discuss each of these reasons in turn.

A
The Casey plurality opinion reiterated what the Court heldin Roe; that " `subsequent to viability, the State in promoting

its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses,regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preserva-tion of the life or health of the mother.' " 505 U. S., at 879
(quoting Roe, supra, at 164-165) (emphasis added).The fact that Nebraska's law applies both previability and
postviability aggravates the constitutional problem pre-sented. The State's interest in regulating abortion previability is considerably weaker than postviability. See Casey,supra, at 870. Since the law requires a health exception in
order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, itat a minimum requires the same in respect to previability
regulation. See Casey, supra, at 880 (majority opinion)(assuming need for health exception previability); see also
Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 316 (1980).The quoted standard also depends on the state regulations
"promoting [the State's] interest in the potentiality of humanlife." The Nebraska law, of course, does not directly further
an interest "in the potentiality of human life" by saving thefetus in question from destruction, as it regulates only a
method of performing abortion. Nebraska describes its in-terests differently. It says the law " `show[s] concern for the
life of the unborn,' " "prevent[s] cruelty to partially born chil530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

931Cite as: 530 U. S. 914 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
dren," and "preserve[s] the integrity of the medical profes-sion." Brief for Petitioners 48. But we cannot see how the

interest-related differences could make any difference to thequestion at hand, namely, the application of the "health"
requirement.Consequently, the governing standard requires an exception "where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgmentfor the preservation of the life or health of the mother,"
Casey, supra, at 879, for this Court has made clear that aState may promote but not endanger a woman's health when
it regulates the methods of abortion. Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S.747, 768-769 (1986); Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 400

(1979); Danforth, 428 U. S., at 76-79; Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S.179, 197 (1973).

Justice Thomas says that the cases just cited limit thisprinciple to situations where the pregnancy itself creates a
threat to health. See post, at 1010. He is wrong. Thecited cases, reaffirmed in

Casey, recognize that a State can-not subject women's health to significant risks both in that

context, and also where state regulations force women touse riskier methods of abortion. Our cases have repeatedly
invalidated statutes that in the process of regulating themethods of abortion, imposed significant health risks. They
make clear that a risk to a women's health is the samewhether it happens to arise from regulating a particular
method of abortion, or from barring abortion entirely. Ourholding does not go beyond those cases, as ratified in Casey.

Nebraska responds that the law does not require a healthexception unless there is a need for such an exception. And

here there is no such need, it says. It argues that "safealternatives remain available" and "a ban on partial-birth
abortion/D&X would create no risk to the health of women."Brief for Petitioners 29, 40. The problem for Nebraska is

932 STENBERG v. CARHART

Opinion of the Court
that the parties strongly contested this factual question inthe trial court below; and the findings and evidence support

Dr. Carhart. The State fails to demonstrate that banningD&X without a health exception may not create significant
health risks for women, because the record shows that sig-nificant medical authority supports the proposition that in
some circumstances, D&X would be the safest procedure.We shall reiterate in summary form the relevant findings
and evidence. On the basis of medical testimony the Dis-trict Court concluded that "Carhart's D&X procedure is . . .
safer tha[n] the D&E and other abortion procedures usedduring the relevant gestational period in the 10 to 20 cases
a year that present to Dr. Carhart." 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1126.It found that the D&X procedure permits the fetus to pass
through the cervix with a minimum of instrumentation.
Ibid. It thereby

"reduces operating time, blood loss and risk of infection;reduces complications from bony fragments; reduces

instrument-inflicted damage to the uterus and cervix;prevents the most common causes of maternal mortality
(DIC and amniotic fluid embolus); and eliminates thepossibility of `horrible complications' arising from retained fetal parts." Ibid.
The District Court also noted that a select panel of theAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that D&X " `may be the best or most appropriate pro-cedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman.' " Id., at 1105, n. 10 (quotingACOG Statement, App. 600-601) (but see an important qualification, infra, at 934). With one exception, the federaltrial courts that have heard expert evidence on the matter
have reached similar factual conclusions. See Rhode Island

Nebraska, along with supporting amici, replies that thesefindings are irrelevant, wrong, or applicable only in a tiny

number of instances. It says (1) that the D&X procedure is"little-used," (2) by only "a handful of doctors." Brief for
Petitioners 32. It argues (3) that D&E and labor inductionare at all times "safe alternative procedures." Id., at 36.
It refers to the testimony of petitioners' medical expert, whotestified (4) that the ban would not increase a woman's risk
of several rare abortion complications (disseminated intra-vascular coagulopathy and amniotic fluid embolus), id., at 37;
App. 642-644.The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons
et al., amici supporting Nebraska, argue (5) that elements ofthe D&X procedure may create special risks, including cervical incompetence caused by overdilitation, injury caused byconversion of the fetal presentation, and dangers arising
from the "blind" use of instrumentation to pierce the fetalskull while lodged in the birth canal. See Brief for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as Amici
Curiae 21-23; see also Sprang & Neerhof, Rationale for Ban-ning Abortions Late in Pregnancy, 280 JAMA 744, 746 (Aug.

26, 1998).Nebraska further emphasizes (6) that there are no medical
studies "establishing the safety of the partial-birth abortion/D&X procedure," Brief for Petitioners 39, and "no medical
studies comparing the safety of partial-birth abortion/D&Xto other abortion procedures,"

ibid. It points to, id., at 35,

which intact D&X is the only appropriate procedure to in-duce abortion,' " Late Term Pregnancy Termination Techniques, AMA Policy H-5.982 (1997). And it points out (8)that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists qualified its statement that D&X "may be the best ormost appropriate procedure," by adding that the panel
"could identify no circumstances under which [the D&X]procedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or
preserve the health of the woman." App. 600-601.

We find these eight arguments insufficient to demonstratethat Nebraska's law needs no health exception. For one

thing, certain of the arguments are beside the point. TheD&X procedure's relative rarity (argument (1)) is not highly
relevant. The D&X is an infrequently used abortion proce-dure; but the health exception question is whether protecting women's health requires an exception for thoseinfrequent occasions. A rarely used treatment might be
necessary to treat a rarely occurring disease that couldstrike anyone--the State cannot prohibit a person from obtaining treatment simply by pointing out that most peopledo not need it. Nor can we know whether the fact that only
a "handful" of doctors use the procedure (argument (2)) re-flects the comparative rarity of late second term abortions,
the procedure's recent development, Gynecologic, Obstetric,and Related Surgery, at 1043, the controversy surrounding
it, or, as Nebraska suggests, the procedure's lack of utility.For another thing, the record responds to Nebraska's (and
amici's) medically based arguments. In respect to argu-ment (3), for example, the District Court agreed that alternatives, such as D&E and induced labor, are "safe" but foundthat the D&X method was significantly

safer in certain cir-cumstances. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125-1126. In respect to

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

935Cite as: 530 U. S. 914 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
argument (4), the District Court simply relied on differentexpert testimony--testimony stating that " `[a]nother advantage of the Intact D&E is that it eliminates the risk of embo-lism of cerebral tissue into the woman's blood stream.' "

Id.,
at 1124 (quoting Hearing on H. R. 1833 before the SenateCommittee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 260 (1995)

(statement of W. Hern).

In response to amici's argument (5), the American Collegeof Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in its own

amici brief,
denies that D&X generally poses risks greater than the al-ternatives. It says that the suggested alternative procedures involve similar or greater risks of cervical and uterine
injury, for "D&E procedures, involve similar amounts of dilitation" and "of course childbirth involves even greater cervical dilitation." Brief for American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists et al. as Amici Curiae 23. The College
points out that Dr. Carhart does not reposition the fetus
thereby avoiding any risks stemming from conversion to
breech presentation, and that, as compared with D&X, D&E
involves the same, if not greater, "blind" use of sharp instruments in the uterine cavity. Id., at 23-24.

We do not quarrel with Nebraska's argument (6), for
Nebraska is right. There are no general medical studies
documenting comparative safety. Neither do we deny the
import of the American Medical Association's statement
(argument (7))--even though the State does omit the remainder of that statement: "The AMA recommends that the procedure not be used unless alternative procedures pose materially greater risk to the woman." Late Term Pregnancy
Termination Techniques, AMA Policy H-5.982 (emphasis
added).

We cannot, however, read the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists panel's qualification (that it could
not "identify" a circumstance where D&X was the "only"
life- or health-preserving option) as if, according to Nebraska's argument (8), it denied the potential health-related need

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
936 STENBERG v. CARHART

Opinion of the Court
for D&X. That is because the College writes the following
in its amici brief:

"Depending on the physician's skill and experience,
the D&X procedure can be the most appropriate abortion procedure for some women in some circumstances.
D&X presents a variety of potential safety advantages
over other abortion procedures used during the same
gestational period. Compared to D&Es involving dismemberment, D&X involves less risk of uterine perforation or cervical laceration because it requires the physician to make fewer passes into the uterus with sharp
instruments and reduces the presence of sharp fetal
bone fragments that can injure the uterus and cervix.
There is also considerable evidence that D&X reduces
the risk of retained fetal tissue, a serious abortion complication that can cause maternal death, and that D&X
reduces the incidence of a `free floating' fetal head that
can be difficult for a physician to grasp and remove and
can thus cause maternal injury. That D&X procedures
usually take less time than other abortion methods used
at a comparable stage of pregnancy can also have health
advantages. The shorter the procedure, the less blood
loss, trauma, and exposure to anesthesia. The intuitive
safety advantages of intact D&E are supported by clinical experience. Especially for women with particular
health conditions, there is medical evidence that D&X
may be safer than available alternatives." Brief for
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
et al. as Amici Curiae 21-22 (citation and footnotes
omitted).

The upshot is a District Court finding that D&X significantly obviates health risks in certain circumstances, a
highly plausible record-based explanation of why that might
be so, a division of opinion among some medical experts over

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

937Cite as: 530 U. S. 914 (2000)
Opinion of the Court
whether D&X is generally safer, and an absence of controlledmedical studies that would help answer these medical questions. Given these medically related evidentiary circum-stances, we believe the law requires a health exception.

The word "necessary" in Casey's phrase "necessary, inappropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the
life or health of the mother," 505 U. S., at 879 (internal quotation marks omitted), cannot refer to an absolute necessity orto absolute proof. Medical treatments and procedures are

often considered appropriate (or inappropriate) in light of es-timated comparative health risks (and health benefits) in particular cases. Neither can that phrase require unanimity of
medical opinion. Doctors often differ in their estimation of
comparative health risks and appropriate treatment. And
Casey's words "appropriate medical judgment" must embody
the judicial need to tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion--differences of a sort that the American Medical
Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' statements together indicate are present here.

For another thing, the division of medical opinion about
the matter at most means uncertainty, a factor that signals
the presence of risk, not its absence. That division here involves highly qualified knowledgeable experts on both sides
of the issue. Where a significant body of medical opinion
believes a procedure may bring with it greater safety for
some patients and explains the medical reasons supporting
that view, we cannot say that the presence of a different
view by itself proves the contrary. Rather, the uncertainty
means a significant likelihood that those who believe that
D&X is a safer abortion method in certain circumstances
may turn out to be right. If so, then the absence of a health
exception will place women at an unnecessary risk of tragic
health consequences. If they are wrong, the exception will
simply turn out to have been unnecessary.

In sum, Nebraska has not convinced us that a health
exception is "never necessary to preserve the health of

938 STENBERG v. CARHART

Opinion of the Court
women." Reply Brief for Petitioners 4. Rather, a statutethat altogether forbids D&X creates a significant health risk.

The statute consequently must contain a health exception.This is not to say, as

Justice Thomas and Justice Ken-
nedy claim, that a State is prohibited from proscribing anabortion procedure whenever a particular physician deems

the procedure preferable. By no means must a State grantphysicians "unfettered discretion" in their selection of abortion methods. Post, at 969 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Butwhere substantial medical authority supports the proposition
that banning a particular abortion procedure could endangerwomen's health,

Casey requires the statute to include ahealth exception when the procedure is " `necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the lifeor health of the mother.' " 505 U. S., at 879. Requiring
such an exception in this case is no departure from Casey,but simply a straightforward application of its holding.

B
The Eighth Circuit found the Nebraska statute unconstitu-tional because, in Casey's words, it has the "effect of placing

a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking anabortion of a nonviable fetus." Id., at 877. It thereby
places an "undue burden" upon a woman's right to terminateher pregnancy before viability.

Ibid. Nebraska does notdeny that the statute imposes an "undue burden" if it applies

to the more commonly used D&E procedure as well as toD&X. And we agree with the Eighth Circuit that it does
so apply.Our earlier discussion of the D&E procedure, supra, at
924-926, shows that it falls within the statutory prohibition.The statute forbids "deliberately and intentionally delivering
into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portionthereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the
person performing such procedure knows will kill the unbornchild." Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999). We

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
do not understand how one could distinguish, using this lan-guage, between D&E (where a foot or arm is drawn through

the cervix) and D&X (where the body up to the head isdrawn through the cervix). Evidence before the trial court
makes clear that D&E will often involve a physician pullinga "substantial portion" of a still living fetus, say, an arm or
leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus. 11 F.
Supp. 2d, at 1128; id., at 1128-1130. Indeed D&E involvesdismemberment that commonly occurs only when the fetus

meets resistance that restricts the motion of the fetus: "Thedismemberment occurs between the traction of . . . [the] instrument and the counter-traction of the internal os of the
cervix." Id., at 1128. And these events often do not occur
until after a portion of a living fetus has been pulled into the
vagina. Id., at 1104; see also Medical and Surgical Abortion
135 ("During the mid-second trimester, separation of the
fetal corpus may occur when the fetus is drawn into the
lower uterine segment, where compression and traction
against the endocervix facilitates disarticulation").

Even if the statute's basic aim is to ban D&X, its language
makes clear that it also covers a much broader category of
procedures. The language does not track the medical differences between D&E and D&X--though it would have been
a simple matter, for example, to provide an exception for the
performance of D&E and other abortion procedures. E. g.,
Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 65-6721(b)(1) (Supp. 1999). Nor does the
statute anywhere suggest that its application turns on
whether a portion of the fetus' body is drawn into the vagina
as part of a process to extract an intact fetus after collapsing
the head as opposed to a process that would dismember the
fetus. Thus, the dissenters' argument that the law was generally intended to bar D&X can be both correct and irrelevant. The relevant question is not whether the legislature
wanted to ban D&X; it is whether the law was intended to
apply only to D&X. The plain language covers both procedures. A rereading of this opinion, supra, at 924-929, as

940 STENBERG v. CARHART

Opinion of the Court
well as Justice Thomas' dissent, post, at 984-987, will makeclear why we can find no difference, in terms of

this statute,
between the D&X procedure as described and the D&E pro-cedure as it might be performed. (In particular, compare

post, at 984-986 (Thomas, J., dissenting), with post, at 986-989 (

Thomas, J., dissenting).) Both procedures can involve
the introduction of a "substantial portion" of a still living
fetus, through the cervix, into the vagina--the very featureof an abortion that leads

Justice Thomas to characterize
such a procedure as involving "partial birth."The Nebraska State Attorney General argues that the

statute does differentiate between the two procedures. He
says that the statutory words "substantial portion" mean
"the child up to the head." He consequently denies the statute's application where the physician introduces into the
birth canal a fetal arm or leg or anything less than the entire
fetal body. Brief for Petitioners 20. He argues further
that we must defer to his views about the meaning of the
state statute. Id., at 12-13.

We cannot accept the Attorney General's narrowing interpretation of the Nebraska statute. This Court's case
law makes clear that we are not to give the Attorney
General's interpretative views controlling weight. For one
thing, this Court normally follows lower federal-court interpretations of state law. McMillian v. Monroe County,
520 U. S. 781, 786 (1997); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades,
Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 500, n. 9 (1985). It "rarely reviews a
construction of state law agreed upon by the two lower
federal courts." Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn.,
Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 395 (1988). In this case, the two lower
courts have both rejected the Attorney General's narrowing interpretation.

For another, our precedent warns against accepting as
"authoritative" an Attorney General's interpretation of
state law when "the Attorney General does not bind the
state courts or local law enforcement authorities." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
Under Nebraska law, the Attorney General's interpreta-tive views do not bind the state courts.

State v. Coffman, 213 Neb. 560, 561, 330 N. W. 2d 727, 728 (1983)(Attorney General's issued opinions, while entitled to "substantial weight" and "to be respectfully considered," areof "no controlling authority"). Nor apparently do they
bind elected county attorneys, to whom Nebraska gives
an independent authority to initiate criminal prosecutions.Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 23-1201(1), 28-328(5), 84-205(3)

(Supp. 1999); cf. Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152,177 (1990) (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("[W]e
have never thought that the interpretation of those
charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to
deference").

Nor can we say that the lower courts used the wrong
legal standard in assessing the Attorney General's interpretation. The Eighth Circuit recognized its "duty to give
[the law] a construction . . . that would avoid constitutional
doubts." 192 F. 3d, at 1150. It nonetheless concluded
that the Attorney General's interpretation would "twist
the words of the law and give them a meaning they cannot
reasonably bear." Ibid. The Eighth Circuit is far from
alone in rejecting such a narrowing interpretation. The
language in question is based on model statutory language
(though some States omit any further definition of "partial
birth abortion"), which 10 lower federal courts have considered on the merits. All 10 of those courts (including the
Eighth Circuit) have found the language potentially applicable to other abortion procedures. See Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, Inc. v. Miller, 195 F. 3d 386 (CA8
1999); Little Rock Family Planning Services v. Jegley, 192
F. 3d 794, 797-798 (CA8 1999); Hope Clinic, 195 F. 3d,

but cf. Richmond Medical Center v. Gilmore, 144 F. 3d326, 330-332 (CA4 1998) (Luttig, J., granting stay).

Regardless, even were we to grant the Attorney Gener-al's views "substantial weight," we still have to reject his
interpretation, for it conflicts with the statutory language
discussed supra, at 940. The Attorney General, echoed by
the dissents, tries to overcome that language by relying
on other language in the statute; in particular, the words
"partial birth abortion," a term ordinarily associated with
the D&X procedure, and the words "partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child." Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28-
326(9) (Supp. 1999). But these words cannot help the Attorney General. They are subject to the statute's further
explicit statutory definition, specifying that both terms
include "delivering into the vagina a living unborn child,
or a substantial portion thereof." Ibid. When a statute
includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition, even if it varies from that term's ordinary meaning.
Meese v. Keene, 481 U. S. 465, 484-485 (1987) ("It is axiomatic that the statutory definition of the term excludes
unstated meanings of that term"); Colautti v. Franklin,
439 U. S., at 392-393, n. 10 ("As a rule, `a definition which
declares what a term "means" . . . excludes any meaning
that is not stated' "); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Lenroot, 323 U. S. 490, 502 (1945); Fox v. Standard Oil Co. of
N. J., 294 U. S. 87, 95-96 (1935) (Cardozo, J.); see also 2A N.
Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction

$ 47.07, p. 152, and n. 10 (5th ed. 1992) (collecting cases).
That is to say, the statute, read "as a whole," post, at 998

Opinion of the Court
(Thomas, J., dissenting), leads the reader to a definition.That definition does not include the Attorney General's

restriction--"the child up to the head." Its words, "sub-stantial portion," indicate the contrary.

The Attorney General also points to the Nebraska Legis-lature's debates, where the term "partial birth abortion"
appeared frequently. But those debates hurt his argument
more than they help it. Nebraska's legislators focused di-rectly upon the meaning of the word "substantial." One

senator asked the bill's sponsor, "[Y]ou said that as smalla portion of the fetus as a foot would constitute a substantial portion in your opinion. Is that correct?" The
sponsoring senator replied, "Yes, I believe that's correct." App. 452-453; see also id., at 442-443 (same senator explaining "substantial" would "indicate that more
than a little bit has been delivered into the vagina," i. e.,
"[e]nough that would allow for the procedure to end up
with the killing of the unborn child"); id., at 404 (rejecting
amendment to limit law to D&X). The legislature seems
to have wanted to avoid more limiting language lest it
become too easy to evade the statute's strictures--a motive
that Justice Thomas well explains. Post, at 1001-1003.
That goal, however, exacerbates the problem.

The Attorney General, again echoed by the dissents,
further argues that the statute "distinguishes between the
overall `abortion procedure' itself and the separate `procedure' used to kill the unborn child." Brief for Petitioners
16-18; post, at 991-992 (opinion of Thomas, J.), 975-976
(opinion of Kennedy, J.). Even assuming that the distinction would help the Attorney General make the D&E/
D&X distinction he seeks, however, we cannot find any
language in the statute that supports it. He wants us
to read "procedure" in the statute's last sentence to mean
"separate procedure," i. e., the killing of the fetus, as opposed to a whole procedure, i. e., a D&E or D&X abortion.
But the critical word "separate" is missing. And the same

Opinion of the Court
word "procedure," in the same subsection and through-out the statute, is used to refer to an entire abortion procedure. Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 28-326(9), 28-328(1)-(4)(Supp. 1999); cf.

Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561,
570 (1995) ("[I]dentical words used in different parts ofthe same act are intended to have the same meaning"

(internal quotation marks omitted)).

The dissenters add that the statutory words "partiallydelivers" can be read to exclude D&E.

Post, at 990-991
(opinion of Thomas, J.), 974 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).They say that introduction of, say, a limb or both limbs

into the vagina does not involve "delivery." But obstetric
textbooks and even dictionaries routinely use that term to
describe any facilitated removal of tissue from the uterus,
not only the removal of an intact fetus. E. g., Obstetrics:
Normal & Problem Pregnancies, at 388 (describing "delivery" of fetal membranes, placenta, and umbilical cord in
the third stage of labor); B. Maloy, Medical Dictionary for
Lawyers 221 (3d ed. 1960) ("Also, the removal of a [fetal]
part such as the placenta"); 4 Oxford English Dictionary
422 (2d ed. 1989) (to "deliver" means, inter alia, to "disburden (a women) of the foetus"); Webster's Third New
International Dictionary (1993) ("[D]elivery" means "the
expulsion or extraction of a fetus and its membranes").
In any event, the statute itself specifies that it applies
both to delivering "an intact unborn child" or "a substantial portion thereof." The dissents cannot explain how
introduction of a substantial portion of a fetus into the
vagina pursuant to D&X is a "delivery," while introduction
pursuant to D&E is not.

We are aware that adopting the Attorney General's interpretation might avoid the constitutional problem discussed
in this section. But we are "without power to adopt a narrowing construction of a state statute unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent." Boos v. Barry, 485
U. S. 312, 330 (1988); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U. S. 518, 520-

Opinion of the Court
521 (1972). For the reasons stated, it is not reasonable toreplace the term "substantial portion" with the Attorney

General's phrase "body up to the head." See AlmendarezTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 237-239 (1998) (statute
must be "genuinely susceptible" to two interpretations).Finally, the law does not require us to certify the state-law

question to the Nebraska Supreme Court. Of course, we
lack any authoritative state-court construction. But "wehave never held that a federal litigant must await a statecourt construction or the development of an established prac-tice before bringing the federal suit."

City of Lakewood v.
Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U. S. 750, 770, n. 11 (1988).
The Attorney General did not seek a narrowing interpretation from the Nebraska Supreme Court nor did he ask the
federal courts to certify the interpretive question. See
Brief for State Appellants in Nos. 98-3245 and 98-3300
(CA8); cf. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520
U. S. 43 (1997). Even if we were inclined to certify the question now, we cannot do so. Certification of a question (or
abstention) is appropriate only where the statute is "fairly
susceptible" to a narrowing construction, see Houston v.
Hill, 482 U. S. 451, 468-471 (1987). We believe it is not.
Moreover, the Nebraska Supreme Court grants certification
only if the certified question is "determinative of the cause."
Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 24-219 (1995); see also Houston v. Hill,
supra, at 471 ("It would be manifestly inappropriate to certify a question in a case where . . . there is no uncertain
question of state law whose resolution might affect the pending federal claim"). Here, it would not be determinative, in
light of the discussion in Part II-A, supra.

In sum, using this law some present prosecutors and future Attorneys General may choose to pursue physicians who
use D&E procedures, the most commonly used method for
performing previability second trimester abortions. All
those who perform abortion procedures using that method
must fear prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment. The

result is an undue burden upon a woman's right to make an
abortion decision. We must consequently find the statute
unconstitutional.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
concurring.

Although much ink is spilled today describing the gruesome nature of late-term abortion procedures, that rhetoric
does not provide me a reason to believe that the procedure
Nebraska here claims it seeks to ban is more brutal, more
gruesome, or less respectful of "potential life" than the
equally gruesome procedure Nebraska claims it still allows.
Justice Ginsburg and Judge Posner have, I believe, correctly diagnosed the underlying reason for the enactment of
this legislation--a reason that also explains much of the
Court's rhetoric directed at an objective that extends well
beyond the narrow issue that this case presents. The rhetoric is almost, but not quite, loud enough to obscure the quiet
fact that during the past 27 years, the central holding of Roe
v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), has been endorsed by all but 4
of the 17 Justices who have addressed the issue. That holding--that the word "liberty" in the Fourteenth Amendment
includes a woman's right to make this difficult and extremely
personal decision--makes it impossible for me to understand
how a State has any legitimate interest in requiring a doctor
to follow any procedure other than the one that he or she
reasonably believes will best protect the woman in her exercise of this constitutional liberty. But one need not even
approach this view today to conclude that Nebraska's law
must fall. For the notion that either of these two equally
gruesome procedures performed at this late stage of gestation is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that the
State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one but

not the other, is simply irrational. See U. S. Const., Amdt.14.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
The issue of abortion is one of the most contentious andcontroversial in contemporary American society. It presents extraordinarily difficult questions that, as the Court
recognizes, involve "virtually irreconcilable points of view."
Ante, at 921. The specific question we face today is whether
Nebraska's attempt to proscribe a particular method of abor-tion, commonly known as "partial birth abortion," is constitutional. For the reasons stated in the Court's opinion,I agree that Nebraska's statute cannot be reconciled with
our decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and is therefore unconstitutional.
I write separately to emphasize the following points.

First, the Nebraska statute is inconsistent with Casey because it lacks an exception for those instances when the
banned procedure is necessary to preserve the health of the
mother. See id., at 879 (plurality opinion). Importantly,
Nebraska's own statutory scheme underscores this constitutional infirmity. As we held in Casey, prior to viability "the
woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy."
Id., at 870. After the fetus has become viable, States may
substantially regulate and even proscribe abortion, but any
such regulation or proscription must contain an exception
for instances " `where it is necessary, in appropriate medical
judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the
mother.' " Id., at 879 (quoting Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,
165 (1973)). Nebraska has recognized this constitutional
limitation in its separate statute generally proscribing
postviability abortions. See Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28-329
(Supp. 1999). That statute provides that "[n]o abortion shall
be performed after the time at which, in the sound medical
judgment of the attending physician, the unborn child clearly
appears to have reached viability, except when necessary to

948 STENBERG v. CARHART

O'Connor, J., concurring
preserve the life or health of the mother." Ibid. (emphasisadded). Because even a postviability proscription of abortion would be invalid absent a health exception, Nebraska'sban on previability partial birth abortions, under the circumstances presented here, must include a health exceptionas well, since the State's interest in regulating abortions before viability is "considerably weaker" than after viability.
Ante, at 930. The statute at issue here, however, only ex-cepts those procedures "necessary to save the life of the

mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder,physical illness, or physical injury." Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999). This lack of a health exception
necessarily renders the statute unconstitutional.

Contrary to the assertions of Justice Kennedy and Jus-
tice Thomas, the need for a health exception does not arise
from "the individual views of Dr. Carhart and his supporters." Post, at 969 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); see also post,
at 1012-1013 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Rather, as the majority explains, where, as here, "a significant body of medical
opinion believes a procedure may bring with it greater safety
for some patients and explains the medical reasons supporting that view," ante, at 937, then Nebraska cannot say that
the procedure will not, in some circumstances, be "necessary
to preserve the life or health of the mother." Accordingly,
our precedent requires that the statute include a health
exception.

Second, Nebraska's statute is unconstitutional on the alternative and independent ground that it imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy
before viability. Nebraska's ban covers not just the dilation
and extraction (D&X) procedure, but also the dilation and
evacuation (D&E) procedure, "the most commonly used
method for performing previability second trimester abortions." Ante, at 945. The statute defines the banned
procedure as "deliberately and intentionally delivering into
the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion

O'Connor, J., concurring
thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that theperson performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn

child and does kill the unborn child." Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999) (emphasis added). As the Court explains, the medical evidence establishes that the D&E proce-dure is included in this definition. Thus, it is not possible to
interpret the statute's language as applying only to the D&X
procedure. Moreover, it is significant that both the DistrictCourt and the Court of Appeals interpreted the statute as

prohibiting abortions performed using the D&E method aswell as the D&X method. See 192 F. 3d 1142, 1150 (CA8
1999); 11 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1127-1131 (Neb. 1998). We have
stated on several occasions that we ordinarily defer to the
construction of a state statute given it by the lower federal
courts unless such a construction amounts to plain error.
See, e. g., Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 346 (1976) ("[T]his
Court has accepted the interpretation of state law in which
the District Court and the Court of Appeals have concurred
even if an examination of the state-law issue without such
guidance might have justified a different conclusion"); The
Tungus v. Skovgaard, 358 U. S. 588, 596 (1959). Such deference is not unique to the abortion context, but applies generally to state statutes addressing all areas of the law. See,
e. g., UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358,
368 (1999) ("notice-prejudice" rule in state insurance law);
Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 499 (1985)
(moral nuisance law); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 181
(1976) (statute of limitations for personal injury actions);
Bishop v. Wood, supra, at 346, n. 10 (city employment ordinance). Given this construction, the statute is impermissible. Indeed, Nebraska conceded at oral argument that "the
State could not prohibit the D&E procedure." Tr. of Oral
Arg. 10. By proscribing the most commonly used method
for previability second trimester abortions, see ante, at 924,
the statute creates a "substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion," Casey, supra, at 884, and therefore imposes

950 STENBERG v. CARHART

O'Connor, J., concurring
an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her preg-nancy prior to viability.

It is important to note that, unlike Nebraska, some otherStates have enacted statutes more narrowly tailored to proscribing the D&X procedure alone. Some of those statuteshave done so by specifically excluding from their coverage
the most common methods of abortion, such as the D&E and
vacuum aspiration procedures. For example, the Kansasstatute states that its ban does not apply to the "(A) [s]uction

curettage abortion procedure; (B) suction aspiration abortionprocedure; or (C) dilation and evacuation abortion procedure
involving dismemberment of the fetus prior to removal from
the body of the pregnant woman." Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 65-
6721(b)(2) (Supp. 1998). The Utah statute similarly provides that its prohibition "does not include the dilation and
evacuation procedure involving dismemberment prior to removal, the suction curettage procedure, or the suction aspiration procedure for abortion." Utah Code Ann. $ 76-7-
310.5(1)(a) (1999). Likewise, the Montana statute defines
the banned procedure as one in which "(A) the living fetus
is removed intact from the uterus until only the head remains in the uterus; (B) all or a part of the intracranial contents of the fetus are evacuated; (C) the head of the fetus
is compressed; and (D) following fetal demise, the fetus is
removed from the birth canal." Mont. Code Ann. $ 50-20-
401(3)(c)(ii) (Supp. 1999). By restricting their prohibitions
to the D&X procedure exclusively, the Kansas, Utah, and
Montana statutes avoid a principal defect of the Nebraska
law.

If Nebraska's statute limited its application to the D&X
procedure and included an exception for the life and health
of the mother, the question presented would be quite different from the one we face today. As we held in Casey, an
abortion regulation constitutes an undue burden if it "has
the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the
path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., concurring
505 U. S., at 877. If there were adequate alternative meth-ods for a woman safely to obtain an abortion before viability,

it is unlikely that prohibiting the D&X procedure alonewould "amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to
a woman seeking an abortion." Id., at 884. Thus, a ban onpartial birth abortion that only proscribed the D&X method
of abortion and that included an exception to preserve the
life and health of the mother would be constitutional in myview.

Nebraska's statute, however, does not meet these criteria.It contains no exception for when the procedure, in appropriate medical judgment, is necessary to preserve the healthof the mother; and it proscribes not only the D&X procedure
but also the D&E procedure, the most commonly used
method for previability second trimester abortions, thus
making it an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate
her pregnancy. For these reasons, I agree with the Court
that Nebraska's law is unconstitutional.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
concurring.

I write separately only to stress that amidst all the emotional uproar caused by an abortion case, we should not lose
sight of the character of Nebraska's "partial birth abortion"
law. As the Court observes, this law does not save any
fetus from destruction, for it targets only "a method of
performing abortion." Ante, at 930. Nor does the statute
seek to protect the lives or health of pregnant women.
Moreover, as Justice Stevens points out, ante, at 946 (concurring opinion), the most common method of performing
previability second trimester abortions is no less distressing
or susceptible to gruesome description. Seventh Circuit
Chief Judge Posner correspondingly observed, regarding
similar bans in Wisconsin and Illinois, that the law prohibits
the D&X procedure "not because the procedure kills the
fetus, not because it risks worse complications for the woman

than alternative procedures would do, not because it is acrueler or more painful or more disgusting method of terminating a pregnancy." Hope Clinic v. Ryan, 195 F. 3d 857,881 (CA7 1999) (dissenting opinion). Rather, Chief Judge
Posner commented, the law prohibits the procedure becausethe state legislators seek to chip away at the private choice
shielded by Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), even as modified by Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,505 U. S. 833 (1992). 195 F. 3d, at 880-882.

A state regulation that "has the purpose or effect of plac-ing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking
an abortion of a nonviable fetus" violates the Constitution.
Casey, 505 U. S., at 877 (plurality opinion). Such an obstacle
exists if the State stops a woman from choosing the procedure her doctor "reasonably believes will best protect the
woman in [the] exercise of [her] constitutional liberty."
Ante, at 946 (Stevens, J., concurring); see Casey, 505 U. S.,
at 877 ("means chosen by the State to further the interest in
potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free
choice, not hinder it"). Again as stated by Chief Judge
Posner, "if a statute burdens constitutional rights and all
that can be said on its behalf is that it is the vehicle that
legislators have chosen for expressing their hostility to those
rights, the burden is undue." Hope Clinic, 195 F. 3d, at
881.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.
I did not join the joint opinion in Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and continue
to believe that case is wrongly decided. Despite my disagreement with the opinion, under the rule laid down in
Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), the Casey
joint opinion represents the holding of the Court in that case.
I believe Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas have correctly applied Casey's principles and join their dissenting
opinions.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Justice Scalia, dissenting.
I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, Stenbergv.

Carhart will be assigned its rightful place in the historyof this Court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred

Scott. The method of killing a human child--one cannoteven accurately say an entirely unborn human child--proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinicaldescription of it evokes a shudder of revulsion. And the
Court must know (as most state legislatures banning thisprocedure have concluded) that demanding a "health exception"--which requires the abortionist to assure himself that,in his expert medical judgment, this method is, in the case
at hand, marginally safer than others (how can one prove thecontrary beyond a reasonable doubt?)--is to give live-birth
abortion free rein. The notion that the Constitution of theUnited States, designed, among other things, "to establish
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, . . . and secure theBlessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity," prohibits the States from simply banning this visibly brutal meansof eliminating our half-born posterity is quite simply absurd.

Even so, I had not intended to write separately here untilthe focus of the other separate writings (including the one I
have joined) gave me cause to fear that this case might betaken to stand for an error different from the one that it
actually exemplifies. Because of the Court's practice of pub-lishing dissents in the order of the seniority of their authors,
this writing will appear in the United States Reports beforethose others, but the reader will not comprehend what follows unless he reads them first.

* * *
The two lengthy dissents in this case have, appropriatelyenough, set out to establish that today's result does not follow from this Court's most recent pronouncement on thematter of abortion,

Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). It would be unfortunate, how530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
ever, if those who disagree with the result were induced toregard it as merely a regrettable misapplication of

Casey.
It is not that, but is Casey's logical and entirely predictableconsequence. To be sure, the Court's construction of this

statute so as to make it include procedures other than live-birth abortion involves not only a disregard of fair meaning,
but an abandonment of the principle that even ambiguous
statutes should be interpreted in such fashion as to renderthem valid rather than void.

Casey does not permit that
jurisprudential novelty--which must be chalked up to theCourt's inclination to bend the rules when any effort to limit

abortion, or even to speak in opposition to abortion, is atissue. It is of a piece, in other words, with

Hill v. Colorado,
ante, p. 703, also decided today.But the Court gives a second and independent reason for

invalidating this humane (not to say antibarbarian) law: Thatit fails to allow an exception for the situation in which the
abortionist believes that this live-birth method of destroyingthe child might be safer for the woman. (As pointed out by
Justice Thomas, and elaborated upon by Justice Ken-
nedy, there is no good reason to believe this is ever the case,but--who knows?--it sometime

might be.)
I have joined Justice Thomas's dissent because I agree
that today's decision is an "unprecedented expansio[n]" of
our prior cases, post, at 1012, "is not mandated" by Casey's
"undue-burden" test, post, at 1010, and can even be called
(though this pushes me to the limit of my belief) "obviously
irreconcilable with Casey's explication of what its undueburden standard requires," post, at 983. But I never put
much stock in Casey's explication of the inexplicable. In the
last analysis, my judgment that Casey does not support today's tragic result can be traced to the fact that what I consider to be an "undue burden" is different from what the
majority considers to be an "undue burden"--a conclusion
that cannot be demonstrated true or false by factual inquiry
or legal reasoning. It is a value judgment, dependent upon
how much one respects (or believes society ought to respect)

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
the life of a partially delivered fetus, and how much one respects (or believes society ought to respect) the freedom of
the woman who gave it life to kill it. Evidently, the five
Justices in today's majority value the former less, or the latter more, (or both), than the four of us in dissent. Case
closed. There is no cause for anyone who believes in Casey
to feel betrayed by this outcome. It has been arrived at by
precisely the process Casey promised--a democratic vote by
nine lawyers, not on the question whether the text of the
Constitution has anything to say about this subject (it obviously does not); nor even on the question (also appropriate
for lawyers) whether the legal traditions of the American
people would have sustained such a limitation upon abortion
(they obviously would); but upon the pure policy question
whether this limitation upon abortion is "undue"--i. e., goes
too far.

In my dissent in Casey, I wrote that the "undue burden"
test made law by the joint opinion created a standard that
was "as doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in origin," Casey, 505 U. S., at 985; "hopelessly unworkable in
practice," id., at 986; "ultimately standardless," id., at 987.
Today's decision is the proof. As long as we are debating
this issue of necessity for a health-of-the-mother exception
on the basis of Casey, it is really quite impossible for us dissenters to contend that the majority is wrong on the law--
any more than it could be said that one is wrong in law to
support or oppose the death penalty, or to support or oppose
mandatory minimum sentences. The most that we can honestly say is that we disagree with the majority on their
policy-judgment-couched-as-law. And those who believe
that a 5-to-4 vote on a policy matter by unelected lawyers
should not overcome the judgment of 30 state legislatures
have a problem, not with the application of Casey, but with
its existence. Casey must be overruled.

While I am in an I-told-you-so mood, I must recall my bemusement, in Casey, at the majority opinion's expressed be530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
lief that Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 133 (1973), had "call[ed] thecontending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in theConstitution,"

Casey, 505 U. S., at 867, and that the decision
in Casey would ratify that happy truce. It seemed to me,quite to the contrary, that "

Roe fanned into life an issue that
has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Courtin particular, ever since"; and that, "by keeping us in the

abortion-umpiring business, it is the perpetuation of that dis-ruption, rather than of any

Pax Roeana, that the Court's
new majority decrees." Id., at 995-996. Today's decision,that the Constitution of the United States prevents the prohibition of a horrible mode of abortion, will be greeted by a
firestorm of criticism--as well it should. I cannot understand why those who acknowledge that, in the opening words
of Justice O'Connor's concurrence, "[t]he issue of abortion
is one of the most contentious and controversial in contemporary American society," ante, at 947, persist in the belief that
this Court, armed with neither constitutional text nor accepted tradition, can resolve that contention and controversy
rather than be consumed by it. If only for the sake of its
own preservation, the Court should return this matter to the
people--where the Constitution, by its silence on the subject,
left it--and let them decide, State by State, whether this
practice should be allowed. Casey must be overruled.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice
joins, dissenting.

For close to two decades after Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113
(1973), the Court gave but slight weight to the interests of
the separate States when their legislatures sought to address
persisting concerns raised by the existence of a woman's
right to elect an abortion in defined circumstances. When
the Court reaffirmed the essential holding of Roe, a central
premise was that the States retain a critical and legitimate

role in legislating on the subject of abortion, as limited bythe woman's right the Court restated and again guaranteed.

Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.833 (1992). The political processes of the State are not to
be foreclosed from enacting laws to promote the life of theunborn and to ensure respect for all human life and its potential. Id., at 871 (plurality opinion). The State's constitu-tional authority is a vital means for citizens to address these
grave and serious issues, as they must if we are to progressin knowledge and understanding and in the attainment of
some degree of consensus.The Court's decision today, in my submission, repudiates
this understanding by invalidating a statute advancing criti-cal state interests, even though the law denies no woman the
right to choose an abortion and places no undue burden uponthe right. The legislation is well within the State's competence to enact. Having concluded Nebraska's law survivesthe scrutiny dictated by a proper understanding of

Casey,I dissent from the judgment invalidating it.

I
The Court's failure to accord any weight to Nebraska's in-terest in prohibiting partial birth abortion is erroneous and

undermines its discussion and holding. The Court's ap-proach in this regard is revealed by its description of the
abortion methods at issue, which the Court is correct to de-scribe as "clinically cold or callous."

Ante, at 923. The ma-jority views the procedures from the perspective of the abortionist, rather than from the perspective of a society shockedwhen confronted with a new method of ending human life.
Words invoked by the majority, such as "transcervical proce-dures," "[o]smotic dilators," "instrumental disarticulation,"
and "paracervical block," may be accurate and are to someextent necessary, ante, at 924-925; but for citizens who seek
to know why laws on this subject have been enacted acrossthe Nation, the words are insufficient. Repeated references

to sources understandable only to a trained physician mayobscure matters for persons not trained in medical terminology. Thus it seems necessary at the outset to set forth whatmay happen during an abortion.

The person challenging Nebraska's law is Dr. Leroy Car-hart, a physician who received his medical degree from
Hahnemann Hospital and University in 1973. App. 29.
Dr. Carhart performs the procedures in a clinic in Nebraska,
id., at 30, and will also travel to Ohio to perform abortions
there, id., at 86. Dr. Carhart has no specialty certificationsin a field related to childbirth or abortion and lacks admitting

privileges at any hospital. Id., at 82, 83. He performs
abortions throughout pregnancy, including when he is unsure
whether the fetus is viable. Id., at 116. In contrast to the
physicians who provided expert testimony in this case (who
are board certified instructors at leading medical education
institutions and members of the American Board of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), Dr. Carhart performs the partial
birth abortion procedure (D&X) that Nebraska seeks to ban.
He also performs the other method of abortion at issue in
the case, the D&E.

As described by Dr. Carhart, the D&E procedure requires
the abortionist to use instruments to grasp a portion (such
as a foot or hand) of a developed and living fetus and drag
the grasped portion out of the uterus into the vagina. Id.,
at 61. Dr. Carhart uses the traction created by the opening
between the uterus and vagina to dismember the fetus, tearing the grasped portion away from the remainder of the
body. Ibid. The traction between the uterus and vagina is
essential to the procedure because attempting to abort a
fetus without using that traction is described by Dr. Carhart
as "pulling the cat's tail" or "drag[ging] a string across the
floor, you'll just keep dragging it. It's not until something
grabs the other end that you are going to develop traction."
Id., at 62. The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human
adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
limb. Id., at 63. The fetus can be alive at the beginning ofthe dismemberment process and can survive for a time while

its limbs are being torn off. Dr. Carhart agreed that"[w]hen you pull out a piece of the fetus, let's say, an arm or
a leg and remove that, at the time just prior to removal ofthe portion of the fetus, . . . the fetus [is] alive."

Id., at 62.
Dr. Carhart has observed fetal heartbeat via ultrasound with
"extensive parts of the fetus removed," id., at 64, and testi-fied that mere dismemberment of a limb does not always

cause death because he knows of a physician who removedthe arm of a fetus only to have the fetus go on to be born
"as a living child with one arm." Id., at 63. At the conclusion of a D&E abortion no intact fetus remains. In
Dr. Carhart's words, the abortionist is left with "a tray full
of pieces." Id., at 125.

The other procedure implicated today is called "partial
birth abortion" or the D&X. The D&X can be used, as a
general matter, after 19 weeks' gestation because the fetus
has become so developed that it may survive intact partial
delivery from the uterus into the vagina. Id., at 61. In the
D&X, the abortionist initiates the woman's natural delivery
process by causing the cervix of the woman to be dilated,
sometimes over a sequence of days. Id., at 492. The fetus'
arms and legs are delivered outside the uterus while the
fetus is alive; witnesses to the procedure report seeing the
body of the fetus moving outside the woman's body. Brief
for Petitioners 4. At this point, the abortion procedure has
the appearance of a live birth. As stated by one group of
physicians, "[a]s the physician manually performs breech extraction of the body of a live fetus, excepting the head, she
continues in the apparent role of an obstetrician delivering
a child." Brief for Association of American Physicians and
Surgeons et al. as Amici Curiae 27. With only the head of
the fetus remaining in utero, the abortionist tears open the
skull. According to Dr. Martin Haskell, a leading proponent
of the procedure, the appropriate instrument to be used at

the skull penetration. Brief for Petitioners 4. The abor-tionist then inserts a suction tube and vacuums out the

The process of making the size of the fetus' head smalleris given the clinically neutral term "reduction procedure."

11 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1106 (Neb. 1998). Brain death doesnot occur until after the skull invasion, and, according to
Dr. Carhart, the heart of the fetus may continue to beat for
minutes after the contents of the skull are vacuumed out.
App. 58. The abortionist next completes the delivery of a
dead fetus, intact except for the damage to the head and the
missing contents of the skull.

Of the two described procedures, Nebraska seeks only to
ban the D&X. In light of the description of the D&X procedure, it should go without saying that Nebraska's ban on
partial birth abortion furthers purposes States are entitled
to pursue. Dr. Carhart nevertheless maintains the State
has no legitimate interest in forbidding the D&X. As he
interprets the controlling cases in this Court, the only two
interests the State may advance through regulation of abortion are in the health of the woman who is considering the
procedure and in the life of the fetus she carries. Brief for
Respondent 45. The Court, as I read its opinion, accedes to
his views, misunderstanding Casey and the authorities it
confirmed.

Casey held that cases decided in the wake of Roe v. Wade,
410 U. S. 113 (1973), had "given [state interests] too little
acknowledgment and implementation." 505 U. S., at 871
(plurality opinion). The decision turned aside any contention that a person has the "right to decide whether to have
an abortion without `interference from the State,' " id., at
875, and rejected a strict scrutiny standard of review as "in530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

compatible with the recognition that there is a substantialstate interest in potential life throughout pregnancy."

Id.,
at 876. "The very notion that the State has a substantialinterest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all

regulations must be deemed unwarranted." Ibid. We heldit was inappropriate for the Judicial Branch to provide an
exhaustive list of state interests implicated by abortion.
Id., at 877.

Casey is premised on the States having an important constitutional role in defining their interests in the abortion de-bate. It is only with this principle in mind that Nebraska's

interests can be given proper weight. The State's brief de-scribes its interests as including concern for the life of the
unborn and "for the partially-born," in preserving the integ-rity of the medical profession, and in "erecting a barrier
to infanticide." Brief for Petitioners 48-49. A review of
Casey demonstrates the legitimacy of these policies. The
Court should say so.States may take sides in the abortion debate and come

down on the side of life, even life in the unborn:

"Even in the earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may
enact rules and regulations designed to encourage [awoman] to know that there are philosophic and social

arguments of great weight that can be brought to bear
in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term andthat there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as a certain degree ofstate assistance if the mother chooses to raise the child
herself." 505 U. S., at 872 (plurality opinion).
States also have an interest in forbidding medical procedures which, in the State's reasonable determination, might
cause the medical profession or society as a whole to become
insensitive, even disdainful, to life, including life in the
human fetus. Abortion, Casey held, has consequences beyond the woman and her fetus. The States' interests in reg530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ulating are of concomitant extension. Casey recognized thatabortion is "fraught with consequences for . . . the persons

who perform and assist in the procedure [and for] societywhich must confront the knowledge that these procedures
exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of vio-lence against innocent human life."

Id., at 852 (majority
opinion).

A State may take measures to ensure the medical profes-sion and its members are viewed as healers, sustained by

a compassionate and rigorous ethic and cognizant of thedignity and value of human life, even life which cannot survive without the assistance of others. Ibid.; Washington v.
Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 730-734 (1997).

Casey demonstrates that the interests asserted by the
State are legitimate and recognized by law. It is argued,
however, that a ban on the D&X does not further these interests. This is because, the reasoning continues, the D&E
method, which Nebraska claims to be beyond its intent to
regulate, can still be used to abort a fetus and is no less
dehumanizing than the D&X method. While not adopting
the argument in express terms, the Court indicates tacit approval of it by refusing to reject it in a forthright manner.
Rendering express what is only implicit in the majority opinion, Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg are forthright in declaring that the two procedures are indistinguishable and that Nebraska has acted both irrationally and
without a proper purpose in enacting the law. The issue is
not whether members of the judiciary can see a difference
between the two procedures. It is whether Nebraska can.
The Court's refusal to recognize Nebraska's right to declare
a moral difference between the procedures is a dispiriting
disclosure of the illogic and illegitimacy of the Court's approach to the entire case.

Nebraska was entitled to find the existence of a consequential moral difference between the procedures. We are referred to substantial medical authority that D&X perverts

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the natural birth process to a greater degree than D&E, com-mandeering the live birth process until the skull is pierced.

American Medical Association (AMA) publications describethe D&X abortion method as "ethically wrong." AMA
Board of Trustees Factsheet on HR 1122 (June 1997), inApp. to Brief for Association of American Physicians and
Surgeons et al. as Amici Curiae 1 (AMA Factsheet). The
D&X differs from the D&E because in the D&X the fetus is"killed

outside of the womb" where the fetus has "an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman tochoose treatments for her own body."

Ibid.; see also App.
639-640; Brief for Association of American Physicians and
Surgeons et al. as Amici Curiae 27 ("Intact D&X is aberrant
and troubling because the technique confuses the disparate
role of a physician in childbirth and abortion in such a way
as to blur the medical, legal, and ethical line between infanticide and abortion"). Witnesses to the procedure relate that
the fingers and feet of the fetus are moving prior to the
piercing of the skull; when the scissors are inserted in the
back of the head, the fetus' body, wholly outside the woman's
body and alive, reacts as though startled and goes limp.
D&X's stronger resemblance to infanticide means Nebraska
could conclude the procedure presents a greater risk of disrespect for life and a consequent greater risk to the profession
and society, which depend for their sustenance upon reciprocal recognition of dignity and respect. The Court is without
authority to second-guess this conclusion.

Those who oppose abortion would agree, indeed would insist, that both procedures are subject to the most severe
moral condemnation, condemnation reserved for the most repulsive human conduct. This is not inconsistent, however,
with the further proposition that as an ethical and moral
matter D&X is distinct from D&E and is a more serious concern for medical ethics and the morality of the larger society
the medical profession must serve. Nebraska must obey the
legal regime which has declared the right of the woman to

Kennedy, J., dissenting
have an abortion before viability. Yet it retains its powerto adopt regulations which do not impose an undue burden

on the woman's right. By its regulation, Nebraska instructsall participants in the abortion process, including the mother,
of its moral judgment that all life, including the life of theunborn, is to be respected. The participants, Nebraska has
determined, cannot be indifferent to the procedure used andmust refrain from using the natural delivery process to kill
the fetus. The differentiation between the procedures is it-self a moral statement, serving to promote respect for human
life; and if the woman and her physician in contemplating themoral consequences of the prohibited procedure conclude
that grave moral consequences pertain to the permittedabortion process as well, the choice to elect or not to elect
abortion is more informed; and the policy of promoting re-spect for life is advanced.

It ill-serves the Court, its institutional position, and theconstitutional sources it seeks to invoke to refuse to issue a
forthright affirmation of Nebraska's right to declare thatcritical moral differences exist between the two procedures.
The natural birth process has been appropriated; yet theCourt refuses to hear the State's voice in defining its interests in its law. The Court's holding contradicts Casey's as-surance that the State's constitutional position in the realm
of promoting respect for life is more than marginal.

II
Demonstrating a further and basic misunderstanding of
Casey, the Court holds the ban on the D&X procedure failsbecause it does not include an exception permitting an abortionist to perform a D&X whenever he believes it will bestpreserve the health of the woman. Casting aside the views
of distinguished physicians and the statements of leadingmedical organizations, the Court awards each physician a
veto power over the State's judgment that the proceduresshould not be performed. Dr. Carhart has made the medical

Kennedy, J., dissenting
judgment to use the D&X procedure in every case, regard-less of indications, after 15 weeks' gestation. 11 F. Supp.

2d, at 1105. Requiring Nebraska to defer to Dr. Carhart'sjudgment is no different from forbidding Nebraska from
enacting a ban at all; for it is now Dr. Leroy Carhart whosets abortion policy for the State of Nebraska, not the legislature or the people. Casey does not give precedence to the
views of a single physician or a group of physicians regardingthe relative safety of a particular procedure.

I am in full agreement with Justice Thomas that the ap-propriate

Casey inquiry is not, as the Court would have it,
whether the State is preventing an abortionist from doing
something that, in his medical judgment, he believes to be
the most appropriate course of treatment. Post, at 1009-
1013. Casey addressed the question "whether the State can
resolve . . . philosophic questions [about abortion] in such a
definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter."
505 U. S., at 850. We decided the issue against the State,
holding that a woman cannot be deprived of the opportunity
to make reproductive decisions. Id., at 860. Casey made it
quite evident, however, that the State has substantial concerns for childbirth and the life of the unborn and may enact
laws "which in no real sense depriv[e] women of the ultimate
decision." Id., at 875 (plurality opinion). Laws having the
"purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the
path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus"
are prohibited. Id., at 877. Nebraska's law does not have
this purpose or effect.

The holding of Casey, allowing a woman to elect abortion
in defined circumstances, is not in question here. Nebraska,
however, was entitled to conclude that its ban, while advancing important interests regarding the sanctity of life, deprived no woman of a safe abortion and therefore did not
impose a substantial obstacle on the rights of any woman.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG) "could identify no circumstances under which [D&X]

would be the only option to save the life or preserve thehealth of the woman." App. 600-601. The AMA agrees,

stating the "AMA's expert panel, which included an ACOGrepresentative, could not find `any' identified circumstance
where it was `the only appropriate alternative.' " AMAFactsheet 1. The Court's conclusion that the D&X is the
safest method requires it to replace the words "may be" with
the word "is" in the following sentence from ACOG's positionstatement: "An intact D&X, however, may be the best or

most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance."App. 600-601.

No studies support the contention that the D&X abortion
method is safer than other abortion methods. Brief for Respondent 36, n. 41. Leading proponents of the procedure
acknowledge that the D&X has "disadvantages" versus other
methods because it requires a high degree of surgical skill
to pierce the skull with a sharp instrument in a blind procedure. Haskell, 139 Cong. Rec. 8605 (1993). Other doctors
point to complications that may arise from the D&X. Brief
for American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as Amici Curiae 21-23; App. 186. A leading physician, Frank Boehm,
M. D., who has performed and supervised abortions as director of the Fetal Intensive Care Unit and the Maternal/Fetal
Medicine Division at Vanderbilt University Hospital, has refused to support use of the D&X, both because no medical
need for the procedure exists and because of ethical concerns. Id., at 636, 639-640, 656-657. Dr. Boehm, a fellow
of ACOG, id., at 565, supports abortion rights and has provided sworn testimony in opposition to previous state attempts to regulate abortion. Id., at 608-614.

The Court cannot conclude the D&X is part of standard
medical practice. It is telling that no expert called by
Dr. Carhart, and no expert testifying in favor of the procedure, had in fact performed a partial birth abortion in his
or her medical practice. E. g., id., at 308 (testimony of
Dr. Phillip Stubblefield). In this respect their opinions were

Kennedy, J., dissenting
courtroom conversions of uncertain reliability. Litigation inother jurisdictions establishes that physicians do not adopt

the D&X procedure as part of standard medical practice.
E. g., Richmond Medical Center for Women v. Gilmore, 144
F. 3d 326, 328 (CA4 1998); Hope Clinic v. Ryan, 195 F. 3d 857,871 (CA7 1999); see also App. 603-604. It is quite wrong for

the Court to conclude, as it seems to have done here, that
Dr. Carhart conforms his practice to the proper standard ofcare because he has incorporated the procedure into his practice. Neither Dr. Boehm nor Dr. Carhart's lead expert,Dr. Stubblefield (the chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine
and director of obstetrics and gynecology for the Boston
Medical Center), has done so.

Substantial evidence supports Nebraska's conclusion that
its law denies no woman a safe abortion. The most to be
said for the D&X is it may present an unquantified lower
risk of complication for a particular patient but that other
proven safe procedures remain available even for this patient. Under these circumstances, the Court is wrong to
limit its inquiry to the relative physical safety of the two
procedures, with the slightest potential difference requiring
the invalidation of the law. As Justice O'Connor explained in an earlier case, the State may regulate based on
matters beyond "what various medical organizations have to
say about the physical safety of a particular procedure."
Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462
U. S. 416, 467 (1983) (dissenting opinion). Where the difference in physical safety is, at best, marginal, the State may
take into account the grave moral issues presented by a new
abortion method. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 880 (requiring a
regulation to impose a "significant threat to the life or health
of a woman" before its application would impose an undue
burden (internal quotation marks omitted)). Dr. Carhart
does not decide to use the D&X based on a conclusion that
it is best for a particular woman. Unsubstantiated and gen530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
968 STENBERG v. CARHART

Kennedy, J., dissenting
eralized health differences which are, at best, marginal, donot amount to a substantial obstacle to the abortion right.

Id., at 874, 876 (plurality opinion). It is also important torecognize that the D&X is effective only when the fetus is
close to viable or, in fact, viable; thus the State is regulatingthe process at the point where its interest in life is nearing
its peak.

Courts are ill-equipped to evaluate the relative worth ofparticular surgical procedures. The legislatures of the several States have superior factfinding capabilities in this re-gard

. In an earlier case, Justice O'Connor had explained
that the general rule extends to abortion cases, writing that
the Court is not suited to be "the Nation's ex officio medical
board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and
operative practices and standards throughout the United
States." 462 U. S., at 456 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Irrespective of the difficulty of the
task, legislatures, with their superior factfinding capabilities,
are certainly better able to make the necessary judgments
than are courts." Id., at 456, n. 4. Nebraska's judgment
here must stand.

In deferring to the physician's judgment, the Court turns
back to cases decided in the wake of Roe, cases which gave
a physician's treatment decisions controlling weight. Before
it was repudiated by Casey, the approach of deferring to physicians had reached its apex in Akron, supra, where the
Court held an informed consent requirement was unconstitutional. The law challenged in Akron required the abortionist to inform the woman of the status of her pregnancy, the
development of her fetus, the date of possible viability, the
physical and emotional complications that may result from
an abortion, and the availability of agencies to provide assistance and information. Id., at 442. The physician was also
required to advise the woman of the risks associated with
the abortion technique to be employed and other information. Ibid. The law was invalidated based on the physi530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
cian's right to practice medicine in the way he or she saw fit;for, according to the

Akron Court, "[i]t remains primarily
the responsibility of the physician to ensure that appropriateinformation is conveyed to his patient, depending on her

particular circumstances." Id., at 443. Dispositive for theCourt was that the law was an "intrusion upon the discretion
of the pregnant woman's physician." Id., at 445. The physician was placed in an "undesired and uncomfortable strait-jacket."

Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The
Court's decision today echoes the Akron Court's deferenceto a physician's right to practice medicine in the way he or

she sees fit.

The Court, of course, does not wish to cite Akron; yet the
Court's holding is indistinguishable from the reasoning in
Akron that Casey repudiated. No doubt exists that today's
holding is based on a physician-first view which finds its
primary support in that now-discredited case. Rather than
exalting the right of a physician to practice medicine with
unfettered discretion, Casey recognized: "Whatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation may have as a general matter, in the present context it is derivative of the
woman's position." 505 U. S., at 884 ( joint opinion of O'Con-
nor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Casey discussed the informed consent requirement struck down in Akron and held
Akron was wrong. The doctor-patient relation was only
"entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts."
505 U. S., at 884. The standard of medical practice cannot
depend on the individual views of Dr. Carhart and his supporters. The question here is whether there was substantial and objective medical evidence to demonstrate the State
had considerable support for its conclusion that the ban created a substantial risk to no woman's health. Casey recognized the point, holding the physician's ability to practice
medicine was "subject to reasonable . . . regulation by the
State" and would receive the "same solicitude it receives in
other contexts." Ibid. In other contexts, the State is enti530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tled to make judgments where high medical authority is indisagreement.

The Court fails to acknowledge substantial authorityallowing the State to take sides in a medical debate, even
when fundamental liberty interests are at stake and evenwhen leading members of the profession disagree with the
conclusions drawn by the legislature. In Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346 (1997), we held that disagreementsamong medical professionals "do not tie the State's hands in

setting the bounds of . . . laws. In fact, it is precisely wheresuch disagreement exists that legislatures have been afforded the widest latitude." Id., at 360, n. 3. Instead,
courts must exercise caution (rather than require deference
to the physician's treatment decision) when medical uncertainty is present. Ibid. ("[W]hen a legislature `undertakes
to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially broad and courts
should be cautious not to rewrite legislation' ") (quoting
Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 370 (1983)); see also
Collins v. Texas, 223 U. S. 288, 297-298 (1912) (Holmes, J.)
(declaring the "right of the state to adopt a policy even upon
medical matters concerning which there is difference of opinion and dispute"); Lambert v. Yellowley, 272 U. S. 581, 596-
597 (1926) (rejecting claim of distinguished physician because

Instructive is Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11
(1905), where the defendant was convicted because he refused to undergo a smallpox vaccination. The defendant
claimed the mandatory vaccination violated his liberty to
"care for his own body and health in such way as to him

seems best." Id., at 26. He offered to prove that membersof the medical profession took the position that the vaccination was of no value and, in fact, was harmful. Id., at 30.The Court rejected the claim, establishing beyond doubt the
right of the legislature to resolve matters upon which physi-cians disagreed:

"Those offers [of proof by the defendant] in the mainseem to have had no purpose except to state the general
theory of those of the medical profession who attach lit-tle or no value to vaccination as a means of preventing
the spread of smallpox, or who think that vaccinationcauses other diseases of the body. What everybody
knows the court must know, and therefore the statecourt judicially knew, as this court knows, that an opposite theory accords with the common belief, and is main-tained by high medical authority. We must assume
that, when the statute in question was passed, the legis-lature of Massachusetts was not unaware of these opposing theories, and was compelled, of necessity, to choosebetween them. It was not compelled to commit a matter involving the public health and safety to the finaldecision of a court or jury. It is no part of the function
of a court or a jury to determine which one of two modeswas likely to be the most effective for the protection of
the public against disease. That was for the legislativedepartment to determine in the light of all the information it had or could obtain. It could not properly abdi-cate its function to guard the public health and safety."
Ibid.
The Jacobson Court quoted with approval a recent state-court decision which observed, in words having full application today:

"The fact that the belief is not universal [in the medicalcommunity] is not controlling, for there is scarcely any

belief that is accepted by everyone. The possibility that

the belief may be wrong, and that science may yet showit to be wrong, is not conclusive; for the legislature has

the right to pass laws which, according to common beliefof the people, are adapted to [address medical matters].
In a free country, where government is by the people,through their chosen representatives, practical legislation admits of no other standard of action.' " Id., at 35(quoting

Viemester v. White, 179 N. Y. 235, 241, 72 N. E.97, 99 (1904)).

Justice O'Connor assures the people of Nebraska theyare free to redraft the law to include an exception permitting
the D&X to be performed when "the procedure, in appro-priate medical judgment, is necessary to preserve the health
of the mother." Ante, at 951. The assurance is meaning-less. She has joined an opinion which accepts that Dr. Carhart exercises "appropriate medical judgment" in using theD&X for every patient in every procedure, regardless of indications, after 15 weeks' gestation. Ante, at 937 (requiringany health exception to "tolerate responsible differences of
medical opinion" which "are present here"). A ban whichdepends on the "appropriate medical judgment" of Dr. Carhart is no ban at all. He will be unaffected by any newlegislation. This, of course, is the vice of a health exception
resting in the physician's discretion.In light of divided medical opinion on the propriety of the
partial birth abortion technique (both in terms of physicalsafety and ethical practice) and the vital interests asserted
by Nebraska in its law, one is left to ask what the first JusticeHarlan asked: "Upon what sound principles as to the relations existing between the different departments of govern-ment can the court review this action of the legislature?"
Jacobson, supra, at 31. The answer is none.

dure. In so ruling the Court misapplies settled doctrines ofstatutory construction and contradicts Casey's premise that

the States have a vital constitutional position in the abortiondebate. I agree with the careful statutory analysis conducted by Justice Thomas, post, at 989-1005. Like theruling requiring a physician veto, requiring a State to meet
unattainable standards of statutory draftsmanship in orderto have its voice heard on this grave and difficult subject is
no different from foreclosing state participation altogether.Nebraska's statute provides:

"No partial birth abortion shall be performed in thisstate unless such procedure is necessary to save the life
of the mother whose life is endangered by a physicaldisorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including
a life-endangering physical condition caused by or aris-ing from the pregnancy itself." Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999).
The statute defines "partial birth abortion" as

"an abortion procedure in which the person performingthe abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn

child before killing the unborn child and completing thedelivery." $ 28-326(9).

It further defines "partially delivers vaginally a living un-born child before killing the unborn child" to mean

"deliberately and intentionally delivering into the va-gina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion
thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure thatthe person performing such procedure knows will kill
the unborn child and does kill the unborn child." Ibid.
The text demonstrates the law applies only to the D&X pro-cedure. Nebraska's intention is demonstrated at three

points in the statutory language: references to "partial-birthabortion" and to the "delivery" of a fetus; and the require530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment that the delivery occur "before" the performance of thedeath-causing procedure.

The term "partial birth abortion" means an abortion per-formed using the D&X method as described above. The
Court of Appeals acknowledged the term "is commonly un-derstood to refer to a particular procedure known as intact dilation and extraction (D&X)." Little Rock Family
Planning Servs. v. Jegley, 192 F. 3d 794, 795 (CA8 1999).Dr. Carhart's own lead expert, Dr. Phillip Stubblefield, prefaced his description of the D&X procedure by describing itas the procedure "which, in the lay press, has been called a
partial-birth abortion." App. 271-272. And the AMA has
declared: "The `partial birth abortion' legislation is by its
very name aimed exclusively [at the D&X.] There is no
other abortion procedure which could be confused with that
description." AMA Factsheet 3. A commonsense understanding of the statute's reference to "partial-birth abortion"
demonstrates its intended reach and provides all citizens the
fair warning required by the law. McBoyle v. United
States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931).

The statute's intended scope is demonstrated by its requirement that the banned procedure include a partial "delivery" of the fetus into the vagina and the completion of a
"delivery" at the end of the procedure. Only removal of an
intact fetus can be described as a "delivery" of a fetus and
only the D&X involves an intact fetus. In a D&E, portions
of the fetus are pulled into the vagina with the intention of
dismembering the fetus by using the traction at the opening
between the uterus and vagina. This cannot be considered
a delivery of a portion of a fetus. In Dr. Carhart's own
words, the D&E leaves the abortionist with a "tray full of
pieces," App. 125, at the end of the procedure. Even if it
could be argued, as the majority does, ante, at 944, that
dragging a portion of an intact fetus into the vagina as the
first step of a D&E is a delivery of that portion of an intact
fetus, the D&E still does not involve "completing the deliv530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ery" of an intact fetus. Whatever the statutory term "com-pleting the delivery" of an unborn child means, it cannot

mean, as the Court would have it, placing fetal remains on atray. See

Planned Parenthood of Wis. v. Doyle, 9 F. Supp.
2d 1033, 1041 (WD Wis. 1998) (the statute is "readily appliedto the partial delivery of an intact child but hardly applicable

to the delivery of dismembered body parts").

Medical descriptions of the abortion procedures confirmthe point, for it is only the description of the D&X that invokes the word "delivery." App. 600. The United States,as

amicus, cannot bring itself to describe the D&E as involving a "delivery," instead substituting the word "emerges" to
describe how the fetus is brought into the vagina in a D&E.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10. The Court,
in a similar admission, uses the words "a physician pulling"
a portion of a fetus, ante, at 939, rather than a "physician
delivering" a portion of a fetus; yet only a procedure involving a delivery is banned by the law. Of all the definitions of
"delivery" provided by the Court, ante, at 944, not one
supports (or, more important for statutory construction purposes, requires) the conclusion that the statutory term "completing the delivery" refers to the placement of dismembered
body parts on a tray rather than the removal of an intact
fetus from the woman's body.

The operation of Nebraska's law is further defined by the
requirement that the fetus be partially delivered into the
vagina "before" the abortionist kills it. The partial delivery
must be undertaken "for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person . . . knows will kill the unborn child."
Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999). The law is
most naturally read to require the death of the fetus to take
place in two steps: First the fetus must be partially delivered
into the vagina and then the defendant must perform a
death-causing procedure. In a D&E, forcing the fetus into
the vagina (the pulling of extremities off the body in the
process of extracting the body parts from the uterus into the

vagina) is also the procedure that kills the fetus. Richmond
Medical Center for Women v. Gilmore, 144 F. 3d, at 330
(order of Luttig, J.). In a D&X, the fetus is partially deliv-ered into the vagina before a separate procedure (the socalled "reduction procedure") is performed in order to killthe fetus.

The majority rejects this argument based on its conclusion
that the word "procedure" must "refer to an entire abortionprocedure" each time it is used.

Ante, at 944. This interpretation makes no sense. It would require us to concludethat the Nebraska Legislature considered the "entire abortion procedure" to take place after the abortionist has already delivered into the vagina a living unborn child, or
a substantial portion thereof. Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28-
326(9) (Supp. 1999). All medical authorities agree, however,
that the entire abortion procedure begins several days before this stage, with the dilation of the cervix. The majority
asks us, in effect, to replace the words "for the purpose of
performing" with the words "in the course of performing" in
the portion of $ 28-326(9) quoted in the preceding paragraph.
The reference to "procedure" refers to the separate deathcausing procedure that is unique to the D&X.

In light of the statutory text, the commonsense understanding must be that the statute covers only the D&X.
See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 698 (1973). The
AMA does not disagree. It writes: "The partial birth abortion legislation is by its very name aimed exclusively at a
procedure by which a living fetus is intentionally and deliberately given partial birth and delivered for the purpose of
killing it. There is no other abortion procedure which could
be confused with that description." AMA Factsheet 3 (internal quotation marks omitted). Casey disavows strict
scrutiny review; and Nebraska must be afforded leeway
when attempting to regulate the medical profession. See
Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 359 ("[W]e have traditionally left to legislators the task of defining terms of a medical

nature that have legal significance"). To hold the statutecovers the D&E, the Court must disagree with the AMA

and disregard the known intent of the legislature, adequatelyexpressed in the statute.

Strained statutory constructions in abortion cases are notnew, for

Justice O'Connor identified years ago "an unprecedented canon of construction under which in cases involving
abortion, a permissible reading of a statute is to be avoidedat all costs."

Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 829 (1986) (dissentingopinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Casey banished this doctrine from our jurisprudence; yet the Court
today reinvigorates it and, in the process, ignores its obligation to interpret the law in a manner to validate it, not
render it void. E. g., Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361, 366-
367 (1974); Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast
Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988).
Avoidance of unconstitutional constructions is discussed only
in two sentences of the Court's analysis and dismissed as
inapplicable because the statute is not susceptible to the construction offered by the Nebraska Attorney General. Ante,
at 944-945. For the reasons here discussed, the statute is
susceptible to the construction; and the Court is required to
adopt it.

The Court and Justice O'Connor seek to shield themselves from criticism by citing the interpretations of the partial birth abortion statutes offered by some other federal
courts. Ante, at 941-942. On this issue of nationwide importance, these courts have no special competence; and of
appellate courts to consider similar statutes, a majority have,
in contrast to the Court, declared that the law could be interpreted to cover only the D&X. See Hope Clinic, 195 F. 3d,
at 865-871; Richmond Medical Center, supra, at 330-332
(order of Luttig, J.). Thirty States have enacted similar
laws. It is an abdication of responsibility for the Court to
suggest its hands are tied by decisions which paid scant at530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
tention to Casey's recognition of the State's authority and
misapplied the doctrine of construing statutes to avoid constitutional difficulty. Further, the leading case describing
the deference argument, Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 483
(1988), declined to defer to a lower court construction of
the state statute at issue in the case. As Frisby observed,
the "lower courts ran afoul of the well-established principle
that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties." See also Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 514 (1989) (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.);
id., at 525 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment).

The majority and, even more so, the concurring opinion
by Justice O'Connor, ignore the settled rule against deciding unnecessary constitutional questions. The State of Nebraska conceded, under its understanding of Casey, that if
this law must be interpreted to bar D&E as well as D&X it
is unconstitutional. Since the majority concludes this is indeed the case, that should have been the end of the matter.
Yet the Court and Justice O'Connor go much further.
They conclude that the statute requires a health exception
which, for all practical purposes and certainly in the circumstances of this case, allows the physician to make the determination in his own professional judgment. This is an immense constitutional holding. It is unnecessary; and, for the
reasons I have sought to explain, it is incorrect. While it is
not clear which of the two halves of the majority opinion is
dictum, both are wrong.

The United States District Court in this case leaped to
prevent the law from being enforced, granting an injunction
before it was applied or interpreted by Nebraska. Cf. Hill
v. Colorado, ante, p. 703. In so doing, the court excluded
from the abortion debate not just the Nebraska legislative
branch but the State's executive and judiciary as well. The
law was enjoined before the chief law enforcement officer

of the State, its Attorney General, had any opportunity tointerpret it. The federal court then ignored the representations made by that officer during this litigation. In likemanner, Nebraska's courts will be given no opportunity to
define the contours of the law, although by all indicationsthose courts would give the statute a more narrow construction than the one so eagerly adopted by the Court today.
E. g., Stenberg v. Moore, 258 Neb. 199, 206, 602 N. W. 2d 465,472 (1995). Thus the court denied each branch of Nebraska's

government any role in the interpretation or enforcement ofthe statute. This cannot be what Casey meant when it said
we would be more solicitous of state attempts to vindicateinterests related to abortion. Casey did not assume this
state of affairs. IV

Ignoring substantial medical and ethical opinion, theCourt substitutes its own judgment for the judgment of Nebraska and some 30 other States and sweeps the law away.The Court's holding stems from misunderstanding the record, misinterpretation of Casey, outright refusal to respectthe law of a State, and statutory construction in conflict with
settled rules. The decision nullifies a law expressing thewill of the people of Nebraska that medical procedures must
be governed by moral principles having their foundation inthe intrinsic value of human life, including the life of the
unborn. Through their law the people of Nebraska were
forthright in confronting an issue of immense moral conse-quence. The State chose to forbid a procedure many decent

and civilized people find so abhorrent as to be among themost serious of crimes against human life, while the State
still protected the woman's autonomous right of choice asreaffirmed in

Casey. The Court closes its eyes to these profound concerns.From the decision, the reasoning, and the judgment,

Thomas, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

In 1973, this Court struck down an Act of the Texas Legislature that had been in effect since 1857, thereby rendering
unconstitutional abortion statutes in dozens of States. Roe
v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 119. As some of my colleagues on
the Court, past and present, ably demonstrated, that decision
was grievously wrong. See, e. g., Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S.
179, 221-223 (1973) (White, J., dissenting); Roe v. Wade,
supra, at 171-178 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Abortion is
a unique act, in which a woman's exercise of control over
her own body ends, depending on one's view, human life or
potential human life. Nothing in our Federal Constitution
deprives the people of this country of the right to determine
whether the consequences of abortion to the fetus and to
society outweigh the burden of an unwanted pregnancy on
the mother. Although a State may permit abortion, nothing
in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so.

In the years following Roe, this Court applied, and, worse,
extended, that decision to strike down numerous state statutes that purportedly threatened a woman's ability to obtain
an abortion. The Court voided parental consent laws, see
Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S.
52, 75 (1976), legislation requiring that second-trimester
abortions take place in hospitals, see Akron v. Akron Center
for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 431 (1983), and
even a requirement that both parents of a minor be notified
before their child has an abortion, see Hodgson v. Minnesota,
497 U. S. 417, 455 (1990). It was only a slight exaggeration
when this Court described, in 1976, a right to abortion "without interference from the State." Danforth, supra, at 61.
The Court's expansive application of Roe in this period, even
more than Roe itself, was fairly described as the "unrestrained imposition of [the Court's] own, extraconstitutional
value preferences" on the American people. Thornburgh v.

It appeared that this era of Court-mandated abortion ondemand had come to an end, first with our decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989),see id., at 557 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (lamenting that the plurality had "discard[ed]"
Roe), and then finally (or so we were told) in our decision inPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.

833 (1992). Although in Casey the separate opinions of The
Chief Justice and Justice Scalia urging the Court tooverrule

Roe did not command a majority, seven Members ofthat Court, including six Members sitting today, acknowledged that States have a legitimate role in regulating abor-tion and recognized the States' interest in respecting fetal
life at all stages of development. See 505 U. S., at 877 ( jointopinion of

O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.); id., at 944(

Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissent-ing in part). The plurality authored by

Justices O'Con-
nor, Kennedy, and Souter concluded that prior case law"went too far" in "undervalu[ing] the State's interest in potential life" and in "striking down . . . some abortion regula-tions which in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate
decision." Id., at 875.1 Roe and subsequent cases, accord-ing to the plurality, had wrongly "treat[ed] all governmental
attempts to influence a woman's decision on behalf of thepotential life within her as unwarranted," a treatment that
was "incompatible with the recognition that there is a sub-stantial state interest in potential life throughout pregnancy." Id., at 876. Accordingly, the plurality held that so

long as state regulation of abortion furthers legitimate inter-ests--that is, interests not designed to strike at the right

itself--the regulation is invalid only if it imposes an undueburden on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion, meaning
that it places a substantial obstacle in the woman's path.
Id., at 874, 877.

My views on the merits of the Casey plurality have been
fully articulated by others. Id., at 944 (Rehnquist, C. J.,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part);

id.,
at 979 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dis-senting in part). I will not restate those views here, except

to note that the Casey plurality opinion was constructed by
its authors out of whole cloth. The standard set forth in the
Casey plurality has no historical or doctrinal pedigree. The
standard is a product of its authors' own philosophical views
about abortion, and it should go without saying that it has
no origins in or relationship to the Constitution and is, consequently, as illegitimate as the standard it purported to replace. Even assuming, however, as I will for the remainder
of this dissent, that Casey's fabricated undue-burden standard merits adherence (which it does not), today's decision is
extraordinary. Today, the Court inexplicably holds that the
States cannot constitutionally prohibit a method of abortion
that millions find hard to distinguish from infanticide and
that the Court hesitates even to describe. Ante, at 923.
This holding cannot be reconciled with Casey's undue-burden
standard, as that standard was explained to us by the authors of the plurality opinion, and the majority hardly pretends otherwise. In striking down this statute--which expresses a profound and legitimate respect for fetal life and
which leaves unimpeded several other safe forms of abortion--the majority opinion gives the lie to the promise of
Casey that regulations that do no more than "express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they
are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the
right to choose" whether or not to have an abortion. 505

U. S., at 877. Today's decision is so obviously irreconcilablewith Casey's explication of what its undue-burden standard

requires, let alone the Constitution, that it should be seenfor what it is, a reinstitution of the pre-Webster abortion-ondemand era in which the mere invocation of "abortion rights"trumps any contrary societal interest. If this statute is unconstitutional under Casey, then Casey meant nothing at all,and the Court should candidly admit it.

To reach its decision, the majority must take a series ofindefensible steps. The majority must first disregard the
principles that this Court follows in every context but abor-tion: We interpret statutes according to their plain meaning,
and we do not strike down statutes susceptible of a narrow-ing construction. The majority also must disregard the
very constitutional standard it purports to employ, and thendisplace the considered judgment of the people of Nebraska
and 29 other States. The majority's decision is lamentable,because of the result the majority reaches, the illogical steps
the majority takes to reach it, and because it portends a re-turn to an era I had thought we had at last abandoned.

In the almost 30 years since Roe, this Court has neverdescribed the various methods of aborting a second- or

third-trimester fetus. From reading the majority's sani-tized description, one would think that this case involves
state regulation of a widely accepted routine medical proce-dure. Nothing could be further from the truth. The most
widely used method of abortion during this stage of preg-nancy is so gruesome that its use can be traumatic even for
the physicians and medical staff who perform it. See App.656 (testimony of Dr. Boehm); W. Hern, Abortion Practice
134 (1990). And the particular procedure at issue in thiscase, "partial birth abortion," so closely borders on infanticide that 30 States have attempted to ban it. I will beginwith a discussion of the methods of abortion available to

1. The primary form of abortion used at or after 16 weeks'gestation is known as "dilation and evacuation" or "D&E."

11 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1103, 1129 (Neb. 1998). When per-formed during that stage of pregnancy, the D&E procedure
requires the physician to dilate the woman's cervix and thenextract the fetus from her uterus with forceps.

Id., at 1103;App. 490 (American Medical Association (AMA), Report of

the Board of Trustees on Late-Term Abortion). Because ofthe fetus' size at this stage, the physician generally removes
the fetus by dismembering the fetus one piece at a time.311 F. Supp. 2d, at 1103-1104. The doctor grabs a fetal
extremity, such as an arm or a leg, with forceps and "pullsit through the cervical os . . . tearing . . . fetal parts from
the fetal body . . . by means of traction." Id., at 1104. SeeApp. 55 (testimony of Dr. Carhart). In other words, the
physician will grasp the fetal parts and "basically tear offpieces of the fetus and pull them out."

Id., at 267 (testimonyof Dr. Stubblefield). See also id., at 149 (testimony of

2 In 1996, the most recent year for which abortion statistics are available
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were approximately 1,221,585 abortions performed in the United States. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Abortion Surveillance--United States,
1996, p. 1 (July 30, 1999). Of these abortions, about 67,000--5.5%--were
performed in or after the 16th week of gestation, that is, from the middle
of the second trimester through the third trimester. Id., at 5. The majority apparently accepts that none of the abortion procedures used for
pregnancies in earlier stages of gestation, including "dilation and evacuation" (D&E) as it is practiced between 13 and 15 weeks' gestation, would
be compromised by the statute. See ante, at 938-940 (concluding that
the statute could be interpreted to apply to instrumental dismemberment
procedures used in a later term D&E). Therefore, only the methods of
abortion available to women in this later stage of pregnancy are at issue
in this case.

3 At 16 weeks' gestation, the average fetus is approximately six inches

long. By 20 weeks' gestation, the fetus is approximately eight inches
long. K. Moore & T. Persaud, The Developing Human 112 (6th ed. 1998).

its . . . simply all there is to it"). The fetus will die fromblood loss, either because the physician has separated the
umbilical cord prior to beginning the procedure or becausethe fetus loses blood as its limbs are removed. Id., at 62-

64 (testimony of Dr. Carhart); id., at 151 (testimony ofDr. Hodgson).

4 When all of the fetus' limbs have been removed and only the head is left in utero, the physician willthen collapse the skull and pull it through the cervical canal.

2. Some abortions after the 15th week are performedusing a method of abortion known as induction. 11 F. Supp.
2d, at 1108; App. 492 (AMA, Report of the Board of Trusteeson Late-Term Abortion). In an induction procedure, the
amniotic sac is injected with an abortifacient such as a sa-line solution or a solution that contains prostaglandin. 11
F. Supp. 2d, at 1108. Uterine contractions typically follow,causing the fetus to be expelled.

both of which require the physician to dilate the woman'scervix. Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery 1043

Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, supra, at 1043;
App. 271 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield). When the fetal

The second variation of intact D&E is the procedure commonly known as "partial birth abortion." 5 11 F. Supp. 2d,
at 1106; Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, supra,
at 1043; App. 271 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield). This procedure, which is used only rarely, is performed on mid- to
late-second-trimester (and sometimes third-trimester) fetuses.6 Although there are variations, it is generally per5 There is a disagreement among the parties regarding the appropriate
term for this procedure. Congress and numerous state legislatures, including Nebraska's, have described this procedure as "partial birth abortion," reflecting the fact that the fetus is all but born when the physician
causes its death. See infra this page and 987. Respondent prefers to
refer generically to "intact dilation and evacuation" or "intact D&E" without reference to whether the fetus is presented head first or feet first.
One of the doctors who developed the procedure, Martin Haskell, described it as "Dilation and Extraction" or "D&X." See The Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act of 1995, Hearing on H. R. 1833 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1995) (hereinafter H. R.
1833 Hearing). The Executive Board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) refers to the procedure by the hybrid
term "intact dilation and extraction" or "intact D&X," see App. 599
(ACOG Executive Board, Statement on Intact Dilation and Extraction
(Jan. 12, 1997)), which term was adopted by the AMA, see id., at 492
(AMA, Report of the Board of Trustees on Late-Term Abortion). I will
use the term "partial birth abortion" to describe the procedure because it
is the legal term preferred by 28 state legislatures, including the State of
Nebraska, and by the United States Congress. As I will discuss, see
infra, at 999-1001, there is no justification for the majority's preference
for the terms "breech-conversion intact D&E" and "D&X" other than the
desire to make this procedure appear to be medically sanctioned.

6 There is apparently no general understanding of which women are appropriate candidates for the procedure. Respondent uses the procedure
on women at 16 to 20 weeks' gestation. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105. The
doctor who developed the procedure, Dr. Martin Haskell, indicated that he

formed as follows: After dilating the cervix, the physician
will grab the fetus by its feet and pull the fetal body out of
the uterus into the vaginal cavity. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106.
At this stage of development, the head is the largest part of
the body. Assuming the physician has performed the dilation procedure correctly, the head will be held inside the
uterus by the woman's cervix. Ibid.; H. R. 1833 Hearing 8.
While the fetus is stuck in this position, dangling partly out
of the woman's body, and just a few inches from a completed
birth, the physician uses an instrument such as a pair of scissors to tear or perforate the skull. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106;

then either crush the skull or will use a vacuum to remove
the brain and other intracranial contents from the fetal skull,
collapse the fetus' head, and pull the fetus from the uterus.
11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106.7

Use of the partial birth abortion procedure achieved prominence as a national issue after it was publicly described by
Dr. Martin Haskell, in a paper entitled "Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion," at the National
Abortion Federation's September 1992 Risk Management
Seminar. In that paper, Dr. Haskell described his version
of the procedure as follows:

"With a lower [fetal] extremity in the vagina, the
surgeon uses his fingers to deliver the opposite lower

patients 25 through 26 weeks. See H. R. 1833 Hearing 36.

7 There are, in addition, two forms of abortion that are used only rarely:

hysterotomy, a procedure resembling a Caesarean section, requires the

extremities.

"The skull lodges at the internal cervical os. Usually
there is not enough dilation for it to pass through. The
fetus is oriented dorsum or spine up.

"At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the
fingers of the left hand along the back of the fetus and
`hooks' the shoulders of the fetus with the index and
ring fingers (palm down).

"[T]he surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances
the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull
under the tip of his middle finger.

"[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base
of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having
safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.

"The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a
suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull
contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies
traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the
patient." H. R. 1833 Hearing 3, 8-9.

In cases in which the physician inadvertently dilates the
woman to too great a degree, the physician will have to hold
the fetus inside the woman so that he can perform the procedure. Id., at 80 (statement of Pamela Smith, M. D.) ("In
these procedures, one basically relies on cervical entrapment
of the head, along with a firm grip, to help keep the baby in

Nebraska, along with 29 other States, has attempted to
ban the partial birth abortion procedure. Although the Ne-braska statute purports to prohibit only "partial birth abortion," a phrase which is commonly used, as I mentioned, torefer to the breech extraction version of intact D&E, the
majority concludes that this statute could also be read insome future case to prohibit ordinary D&E, the first procedure described above. According to the majority, such anapplication would pose a substantial obstacle to some women
seeking abortions and, therefore, the statute is unconstitutional. The majority errs with its very first step. I thinkit is clear that the Nebraska statute does not prohibit the

D&E procedure. The Nebraska partial birth abortion stat-ute at issue in this case reads as follows:

"No partial-birth abortion shall be performed in this
state, unless such procedure is necessary to save the life
of the mother whose life is endangered by a physical
disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including
a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself." Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999).

"Partial birth abortion" is defined in the statute as

"an abortion procedure in which the person performing
the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn
child before killing the unborn child and completing the
delivery. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before
killing the unborn child means deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child,
or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such

procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does killthe unborn child." $ 28-326(9).

A
Starting with the statutory definition of "partial birthabortion," I think it highly doubtful that the statute could

be applied to ordinary D&E. First, the Nebraska statuteapplies only if the physician "partially delivers vaginally a
living unborn child," which phrase is defined to mean "delib-erately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living
unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof." $ 28-326(9)(emphases added). When read in context, the term "partially delivers" cannot be fairly interpreted to include remov-ing pieces of an unborn child from the uterus one at a time.

The word "deliver," particularly delivery of an "unbornchild," refers to the process of "assist[ing] in giving birth,"
which suggests removing an intact unborn child from thewomb, rather than pieces of a child. See Webster's Ninth
New Collegiate Dictionary 336 (1991) (defining "deliver" as"to assist in giving birth; to aid in the birth of "); Stedman's
Medical Dictionary 409 (26th ed. 1995) ("To assist a womanin childbirth"). Without question, one does not "deliver" a
child when one removes the child from the uterus piece bypiece, as in a D&E. Rather, in the words of respondent and
his experts, one "remove[s]" or "dismember[s]" the child in aD&E. App. 45, 55 (testimony of Dr. Carhart) (referring to
the act of removing the fetus in a D&E); id., at 150 (testi-mony of Dr. Hodgson) (same); id., at 267 (testimony of
Dr. Stubblefield) (physician "dismember[s]" the fetus). Seealso H. R. 1833 Hearing 3, 8 (Dr. Haskell describing "delivery" of part of the fetus during a D&X). The majority citessources using the terms "deliver" and "delivery" to refer to
removal of the fetus and the placenta during birth. Butthese sources also presume an intact fetus, rather than dismembered fetal parts. See Obstetrics: Normal & ProblemPregnancies 388 (S. Gabbe, J. Niebyl, & J. Simpson eds., 3d

ed. 1996) ("After delivery [of infant and placenta], the pla-centa, cord, and membranes should be examined"); 4 Oxford

English Dictionary 421, 422 (2d ed. 1989) ("To disburden (awoman) of the foetus, to bring to childbirth"); B. Maloy, Medical Dictionary for Lawyers 221 (2d ed. 1989) ("To aid in theprocess of childbirth; to bring forth; to deliver the fetus, placenta"). The majority has pointed to no source in which
"delivery" is used to refer to removal of first a fetal arm,then a leg, then the torso, etc. In fact, even the majority

describes the D&E procedure without using the word "de-liver" to refer to the removal of fetal tissue from the uterus.
See ante, at 939 ("pulling a `substantial portion' of a still
living fetus" (emphasis added)); ibid. ("portion of a living
fetus has been pulled into the vagina" (emphasis added)).
No one, including the majority, understands the act of pulling
off a part of a fetus to be a "delivery."

To make the statute's meaning even more clear, the statute
applies only if the physician "partially delivers vaginally a
living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery." The statute defines this phrase to
mean that the physician must complete the delivery "for the
purpose of performing a procedure" that will kill the unborn
child. It is clear from these phrases that the procedure that
kills the fetus must be subsequent to, and therefore separate
from, the "partia[l] deliver[y]" or the "deliver[y] into the
vagina" of "a living unborn child or substantial portion
thereof." In other words, even if one assumes, arguendo,
that dismemberment--the act of grasping a fetal arm or leg
and pulling until it comes off, leaving the remaining part of
the fetal body still in the uterus--is a kind of "delivery," it
does not take place "before" the death-causing procedure or
"for the purpose of performing" the death-causing procedure; it is the death-causing procedure. Under the majority's view, D&E is covered by the statute because when the
doctor pulls on a fetal foot until it tears off he has "delivered"
a substantial portion of the unborn child and has performed

530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
992 STENBERG v. CARHART

Thomas, J., dissenting
a procedure known to cause death. But, significantly, thephysician has not "delivered" the child before performing the

death-causing procedure or "for the purpose of " performingthe death-causing procedure; the dismemberment "delivery"
is itself the act that causes the fetus' death.8Moreover, even if removal of a fetal foot or arm from the
uterus incidental to severing it from the rest of the fetalbody could amount to delivery

before, or for the purpose of,performing a death-causing procedure, the delivery would

not be of an "unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof."And even supposing that a fetal foot or arm could conceivably be a "substantial portion" of an unborn child, both thecommon understanding of "partial birth abortion" and the
principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid consti-tutional difficulties would require one to read "substantial"
otherwise. See infra, at 996-997.

B
Although I think that the text of $ 28-326(9) forecloses anyapplication of the Nebraska statute to the D&E procedure,

even if there were any ambiguity, the ambiguity would beconclusively resolved by reading the definition in light of the
fact that the Nebraska statute, by its own terms, applies onlyto "partial birth abortion," $ 28-328(1). By ordinary rules
of statutory interpretation, we should resolve any ambiguityin the specific statutory definition to comport with the common understanding of "partial birth abortion," for that termitself, no less than the specific definition, is part of the stat8 The majority argues that the statute does not explicitly require that
the death-causing procedure be separate from the overall abortion procedure. That is beside the point; under the statute the death-causing procedure must be separate from the delivery. Moreover, it is incorrect to
state that the statute contemplates only one "procedure." The statute
clearly uses the term "procedure" to refer to both the overall abortion
procedure ("partial birth abortion" is "an abortion procedure") as well as
to a component of the overall abortion procedure ("for the purpose of performing a procedure . . . that will kill the unborn child").

ute. United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984) ("Wedo not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read

statutes as a whole").9"Partial birth abortion" is a term that has been used by a
majority of state legislatures, the United States Congress,medical journals, physicians, reporters, even judges, and has
never, as far as I am aware, been used to refer to the D&E
procedure. The number of instances in which "partial birthabortion" has been equated with the breech extraction form

of intact D&E (otherwise known as "D&X") 10 and explicitlycontrasted with D&E, are numerous. I will limit myself to
just a few examples.First, numerous medical authorities have equated "partial
birth abortion" with D&X. The AMA has done so and hasrecognized that the procedure is "different from other destructive abortion techniques because the fetus . . . is killed
outside of the womb." AMA Board of Trustees Factsheet
on H. R. 1122 (June 1997), in App. to Brief for Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as Amici Curiae 1.
Medical literature has also equated "partial birth abortion"
with D&X as distinguished from D&E. See Gynecologic,
Obstetric, and Related Surgery, at 1043; Sprang & Neerhof,
Rationale for Banning Abortions Late in Pregnancy, 280
JAMA 744 (Aug. 26, 1998); Bopp & Cook, Partial Birth Abortion: The Final Frontier of Abortion Jurisprudence, 14 Issues in Law and Medicine 3 (1998). Physicians have equated
"partial birth abortion" with D&X. See Planned Parenthood v. Doyle, 44 F. Supp. 2d 975, 999 (WD Wis. 1999) (citing
testimony); Richmond Medical Center for Women v. Gil9 It is certainly true that an undefined term must be construed in accordance with its ordinary and plain meaning. FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471,
476 (1994). But this does not mean that the ordinary and plain meaning
of a term is wholly irrelevant when that term is defined.

10 As noted, see n. 5, supra, there is no consensus regarding which of

these terms is appropriate to describe the procedure. I assume, as the
majority does, that the terms are, for purposes here, interchangeable.

more, 55 F. Supp. 2d 441, 455 (ED Va. 1999) (citing testi-mony). Even respondent's expert, Dr. Phillip Stubblefield,

acknowledged that breech extraction intact D&E is referredto in the lay press as "partial birth abortion." App. 271.

Second, the lower courts have repeatedly acknowledgedthat "partial birth abortion" is commonly understood to
mean D&X. See Little Rock Family Planning Services v.
Jegley, 192 F. 3d 794, 795 (CA8 1999) ("The term `partial-birth abortion,' . . . is commonly understood to refer to a

particular procedure also known as intact dilation and ex-traction"); Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, Inc. v.
Miller, 195 F. 3d 386, 387 (CA8 1999) ("The [Iowa] Act pro-hibits `partial-birth abortion,' a term commonly understood
to refer to a procedure called a dilation and extraction(D&X)"). The District Court in this case noted that
"[p]artial-birth abortions" are "known medically as intact di-lation and extraction or D&X." 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1121,
n. 26. Even the majority notes that "partial birth abortion"is a term "ordinarily associated with the D&X procedure."
Ante, at 942.

Third, the term "partial birth abortion" has been used instate legislation on 28 occasions and by Congress twice.

The term "partial birth abortion" was adopted by Congressin both 1995 and 1997 in two separate pieces of legislation
prohibiting the procedure.11 In considering the legislation,

11 Congressional legislation prohibiting the procedure was first introduced in June 1995, with the introduction of the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act, H. R. 1833. This measure, which was sponsored by 165 individual House Members, passed both Houses by wide margins, 141 Cong. Rec.
35892 (1995); 142 Cong. Rec. 31169 (1996), but was vetoed by President
Clinton, see id., at 7467. The House voted to override the veto on September 19, 1996, see id., at 23851; however, the Senate failed to override
by a margin of 13 votes, see id., at 25829. In the next Congress, 181
individual House cosponsors reintroduced the Partial Birth Abortion Ban
Act as H. R. 929, which was later replaced in the House with H. R. 1122.
See H. R. 1122, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997). The House and Senate
again adopted the legislation, as amended, by wide margins. See 143

Thomas, J., dissenting
Congress conducted numerous hearings and debates on the
issue, which repeatedly described "partial birth abortion" as
a procedure distinct from D&E. The Congressional Record
contained numerous references to Dr. Haskell's procedure.
See, e. g., H. R. 1833 Hearing 3, 17, 52, 77; S. 6 and H. R. 929
Joint Hearing 45. Since that time, debates have taken place
in state legislatures across the country, 30 of which have
voted to prohibit the procedure. With only two exceptions,
the legislatures that voted to ban the procedure referred to
it as "partial birth abortion." 12 These debates also referred
to Dr. Haskell's procedure as D&X. Both the evidence before the legislators and the legislators themselves equated
"partial birth abortion" with D&X. The fact that 28 States
adopted legislation banning "partial birth abortion," defined
it in a way similar or identical to Nebraska's definition,13 and,

Cong. Rec. H1230 (Mar. 20, 1997); id., at S4715 (May 20, 1997). President
Clinton again vetoed the bill. See id., at H8891 (Oct. 10, 1997). Again,
the veto override passed in the House and fell short in the Senate. See
144 Cong. Rec. H6213 (July 23, 1998); id., at S10564 (Sept. 18, 1998).

12 Consistent with the practice of Dr. Haskell (an Ohio practitioner), Ohio

referred to the procedure as "dilation and extraction," defined as "the
termination of a human pregnancy by purposely inserting a suction device
into the skull of a fetus to remove the brain." Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 2919.15(A) (1997). Missouri refers to the killing of a "partially-born"
infant as "infanticide." Mo. Stat. Ann. $ 565.300 (Vernon Supp. 2000).

13 For the most part, these States defined the term "partial birth abortion" using language similar to that in the 1995 proposed congressional
legislation, that is "an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and
completing the delivery." See H. R. 1833 Hearing 210. See, e. g., Alaska
Stat. Ann. $ 18.16.050 (1998); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-3603.01 (Supp.

using language similar to that used in the 1997 proposed congressional

in doing so, repeatedly referred to the breech extractionform of intact D&E and repeatedly distinguished it from ordinary D&E, makes it inconceivable that the term "partialbirth abortion" could reasonably be interpreted to mean
D&E. C

Were there any doubt remaining whether the statute couldapply to a D&E procedure, that doubt is no ground for invalidating the statute. Rather, we are bound to first considerwhether a construction of the statute is fairly possible that
would avoid the constitutional question. Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 216 (1975) ("[A] state statute shouldnot be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject

to a narrowing construction by the state courts"); Frisby v.Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 482 (1988) ("The precise scope of the
ban is not further described within the text of the ordinance,but in our view the ordinance is readily subject to a narrowing construction that avoids constitutional difficulties").This principle is, as

Justice O'Connor has said, so "well-established" that failure to apply is "plain error."

Id., at483. Although our interpretation of a Nebraska law is of

course not binding on Nebraska courts, it is clear, as Erznoznik and Frisby demonstrate, that, absent a conflicting inter-pretation by Nebraska (and there is none here), we should,

if the text permits, adopt such a construction.
legislation, which retained the definition of partial birth abortion used in
the 1995 bill, that is "an abortion in which the person performing the
abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus
and completing the delivery," but further defined that phrase to mean
"deliberately and intentionally delivers into the vagina a living fetus, or a
substantial portion there of, for the purpose of performing a procedure
the physician knows will kill the fetus, and kills the fetus." See Partial
Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997, H. R. 1122, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997).

The majority contends that application of the Nebraskastatute to D&E would pose constitutional difficulties because

it would eliminate the most common form of second-trimester abortions. To the extent that the majority's contention is true, there is no doubt that the Nebraska statuteis susceptible of a narrowing construction by Nebraska
courts that would preserve a physicians' ability to performD&E. See

State v. Carpenter, 250 Neb. 427, 434, 551 N. W.2d 518, 524 (1996) ("A penal statute must be construed so as

to meet constitutional requirements if such can reasonablybe done"). For example, the statute requires that the physician "deliberately and intentionally delive[r] into the vaginaa living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof," before performing a death-causing procedure. The term "sub-stantial portion" is susceptible to a narrowing construction
that would exclude the D&E procedure. One definition ofthe word "substantial" is "being largely but not wholly that
which is specified." Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dic-tionary, at 1176. See

Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552,564 (1988) (describing different meanings of the term "substantial"). In other words, "substantial" can mean "almostall" of the thing denominated. If nothing else, a court could
construe the statute to require that the fetus be "largely, butnot wholly," delivered out of the uterus before the physician
performs a procedure that he knows will kill the unbornchild. Or, as I have discussed, a court could (and should)
construe "for the purpose of performing a procedure" tomean "for the purpose of performing a separate procedure."

III
The majority and Justice O'Connor reject the plain lan-guage of the statutory definition, refuse to read that definition in light of the statutory reference to "partial birth abor-tion," and ignore the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.
In so doing, they offer scant statutory analysis of their own.See

(majority opinion); ante, at 948-949 (O'Connor, J., concurring). In their brief analyses, the majority and Justice
O'Connor disregard all of the statutory language except for
the final definitional sentence, thereby violating the fundamental canon of construction that statutes are to be read as
a whole. United States v. Morton, 467 U. S., at 828 ("We do
not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole. Thus, the words [in question] must be read
in light of the immediately following phrase") (footnote omitted)); United States v. Heirs of Boisdore', 8 How. 113, 122
(1849) ("In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by
a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the
provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy");
Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995) ("[A] word
is known by the company it keeps").14 In lieu of analyzing
the statute as a whole, the majority and Justice O'Connor

14 The majority argues that its approach is supported by Meese v. Keene,
481 U. S. 465, 487 (1987), in which the Court stated that "the statutory
definition of [a] term excludes unstated meanings of that term." But this
case provides no support for the approach adopted by the majority and
Justice O'Connor. In Meese, the Court addressed a statute that used
the term "political propaganda." Id., at 470. The Court noted that there
were two commonly understood meanings to the term "political propaganda," id., at 477, and, not surprisingly, chose the definition that was
most consistent with the statutory definition, id., at 485. Nowhere did
the Court suggest that, because "political propaganda" was defined in the
statute, the commonly understood meanings of that term were irrelevant.
Indeed, a significant portion of the Court's opinion was devoted to describing the effect of Congress' use of that term. Id., at 477-479, 483-484. So
too, Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 392-393, n. 10 (1979), and Western
Union Telegraph Co. v. Lenroot, 323 U. S. 490 (1945), support the proposition that when there are two possible interpretations of a term, and only
one comports with the statutory definition, the term should not be read
to include the unstated meaning. But here, there is only one possible
interpretation of "partial birth abortion"--the majority can cite no authority using that term to describe D&E--and so there is no justification for
the majority's willingness to entirely disregard the statute's use of that
term.

offer five principal arguments for their interpretation of thestatute. I will address them in turn.

First, the majority appears to accept, if only obliquely, anargument made by respondent: If the term "partial birth
abortion" refers to only the breech extraction form of intactD&E, or D&X, the Nebraska Legislature should have used
the medical nomenclature. See ante, at 943 (noting that the
Nebraska Legislature rejected an amendment that would re-place "partial birth abortion" with "dilation and extraction");

Brief for Respondent 4-5, 24.There is, of course, no requirement that a legislature use
terminology accepted by the medical community. A legislature could, no doubt, draft a statute using the term "heart
attack" even if the medical community preferred "myocardial
infarction." Legislatures, in fact, sometimes use medical
terms in ways that conflict with their clinical definitions, see,
e. g., Barber v. Director, 43 F. 3d 899, 901 (CA4 1995) (noting
that the medical definition of "pneumoconiosis" is only a subset of the afflictions that fall within the definition of "pneumoconiosis" in the Black Lung Act), a practice that is unremarkable so long as the legal term is adequately defined.
We have never, until today, suggested that legislature may
only use words accepted by every individual physician.
Rather, "we have traditionally left to legislators the task of
defining terms of a medical nature that have legal significance." Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 359 (1997).
And we have noted that "[o]ften, those definitions do not fit
precisely with the definitions employed by the medical community." Ibid.

Further, it is simply not true that the many legislatures,
including Nebraska's, that prohibited "partial birth abortion"
chose to use a term known only in the vernacular in place
of a term with an accepted clinical meaning. When the
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995 was introduced in
Congress, the term "dilation and extraction" did not appear
in any medical dictionary. See, e. g., Dorland's Illustrated

e. g., G. Cunningham et al., Williams Ob-stetrics 579-605 (20th ed. 1997); Obstetrics: Normal & Problem Pregnancies, at 1249-1279; W. Hern, Abortion Practice(1990). Abortion reference books also omitted any reference to the term. See, e. g., Modern Methods of InducingAbortion (D. Baird, D. Grimes, & P. Van Look eds. 1995);
E. Glick, Surgical Abortion (1998).15Not only did D&X have no medical meaning at the time,
but the term is ambiguous on its face. "Dilation and extrac-tion" would, on its face, accurately describe any procedure
in which the woman is "dilated" and the fetus "extracted,"including D&E. See

supra, at 984-985. In contrast, "par-tial birth abortion" has the advantage of faithfully describing

the procedure the legislature meant to address because thefact that a fetus is "partially born" during the procedure is
indisputable. The term "partial birth abortion" is com-pletely accurate and descriptive, which is perhaps the reason
why the majority finds it objectionable. Only a desire tofind fault at any cost could explain the Court's willingness to
penalize the Nebraska Legislature for failing to replace a

15 Nor, for that matter, did the terms "intact dilation and extraction" or
"intact dilation and evacuation" appear in textbooks or medical dictionaries. See supra, at 999 and this page. In fact, respondent's preferred
term "intact D&E" would compound, rather than remedy, any confusion
regarding the statute's meaning. As is evident from the majority opinion,
there is no consensus on what this term means. Compare ante, at 927
(describing "intact D&E" to refer to both breech and vertex presentation
procedures), with App. 6 (testimony of Dr. Henshaw) (using "intact D&E"
to mean only breech procedure), with id., at 275 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield) (using "intact D&E" to refer to delivery of fetus that has died
in utero).

descriptive term with a vague one. There is, therefore,
nothing to the majority's argument that the Nebraska Legislature is at fault for declining to use the term "dilation and
extraction." 16

Second, the majority faults the Nebraska Legislature for
failing to "track the medical differences between D&E and
D&X" and for failing to "suggest that its application turns
on whether a portion of the fetus' body is drawn into the
vagina as part of a process to extract an intact fetus after
collapsing the head as opposed to a process that would dismember the fetus." Ante, at 939. I have already explained
why the Nebraska statute reflects the medical differences
between D&X and D&E. To the extent the majority means
that the Nebraska Legislature should have "tracked the
medical differences" by adopting one of the informal definitions of D&X, this argument is without merit; none of these
definitions would have been effective to accomplish the
State's purpose of preventing abortions of partially born fetuses. Take, for example, ACOG's informal definition of the
term "intact D&X." According to ACOG, an "intact D&X"
consists of the following four steps: (1) deliberate dilation of

16 The fact that the statutory term "partial birth abortion" may express
a political or moral judgment, whereas "dilation and extraction" does not,
is irrelevant. It is certainly true that technical terms are frequently
empty of normative content. (Of course, the decision to use a technical
term can itself be normative. See ante, passim (majority opinion)). But,
so long as statutory terms are adequately defined, there is no requirement
that Congress or state legislatures draft statutes using morally agnostic
terminology. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 922(v) (making it unlawful to "manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon"); Kobayashi & Olson et al., In re 101 California Street: A Legal and Economic
Analysis of Strict Liability for the Manufacture and Sale of "Assault Weapons," 8 Stan. L. & Pol'y Rev. 41, 43 (1997) ("Prior to 1989, the term `assault
weapon' did not exist in the lexicon of firearms. It is a political term,
developed by anti-gun publicists to expand the category of `assault rifles'
so as to allow an attack on as many additional firearms as possible on
the basis of undefined `evil' appearance"). See also Meese, 481 U. S., at

the cervix, usually over a sequence of days; (2) instrumental
conversion of the fetus to a footling breach; (3) breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and (4) partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a living fetus to effect
vaginal delivery of a dead but otherwise intact fetus. App.
599-600 (ACOG Executive Board, Statement on Intact Dilation and Extraction (Jan. 12, 1997)). ACOG emphasizes that
"unless all four elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an intact D&X." Id., at 600. Had Nebraska
adopted a statute prohibiting "intact D&X," and defined it
along the lines of the ACOG definition, physicians attempting
to perform abortions on partially born fetuses could have
easily evaded the statute. Any doctor wishing to perform a
partial birth abortion procedure could simply avoid liability
under such a statute by performing the procedure, as respondent does, only when the fetus is presented feet first,
thereby avoiding the necessity of "conversion of the fetus to
a footling breech." Id., at 599. Or, a doctor could convert
the fetus without instruments. Or, the doctor could cause
the fetus' death before "partial evacuation of the intracranial
contents," id., at 600, by plunging scissors into the fetus'
heart, for example. A doctor could even attempt to evade
the statute by chopping off two fetal toes prior to completing
delivery, preventing the State from arguing that the fetus
was "otherwise intact." Presumably, however, Nebraska,
and the many other legislative bodies that adopted partial
birth abortion bans, were not concerned with whether death
was inflicted by injury to the brain or the heart, whether the
fetus was converted with or without instruments, or whether
the fetus died with its toes attached. These legislative bodies were, I presume, concerned with whether the child was
partially born before the physician caused its death. The
legislatures' evident concern was with permitting a procedure that resembles infanticide and threatens to dehumanize
the fetus. They, therefore, presumably declined to adopt a

Thomas, J., dissenting
ban only on "intact D&X," as defined by ACOG, because itwould have been ineffective to that purpose. Again, the

majority is faulting Nebraska for a legitimate legislativecalculation.

Third, the majority and Justice O'Connor argue thatthis Court generally defers to lower federal courts' interpretations of state law. Ante, at 940 (majority opinion); ante,
at 949 (O'Connor, J., concurring). However, a decisiondrafted by

Justice O'Connor, which she inexplicably fails
to discuss, Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988), makes clearwhy deference is inappropriate here. As

Justice O'Con-
nor explained in that case:

"[W]hile we ordinarily defer to lower court constructions of state statutes, we do not invariably do so. Weare particularly reluctant to defer when the lower courts

have fallen into plain error, which is precisely the situa-tion presented here. To the extent they endorsed a
broad reading of the ordinance, the lower courts ranafoul of the well-established principle that statutes will
be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties." Id.,
at 483 (citations omitted).

Frisby, then, identifies exactly why the lower courts' opinions here are not entitled to deference: The lower courts
failed to identify the narrower construction that, consistent
with the text, would avoid any constitutional difficulties.

Fourth, the majority speculates that some Nebraska
prosecutor may attempt to stretch the statute to apply it to
D&E. But a state statute is not unconstitutional on its face
merely because we can imagine an aggressive prosecutor
who would attempt an overly aggressive application of the
statute. We have noted that " `[w]ords inevitably contain
germs of uncertainty.' " Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S.
601, 608 (1973). We do not give statutes the broadest definition imaginable. Rather, we ask whether "the ordinary

person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with [the statute]." Ibid. (quoting
Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 579
(1973)). While a creative legal mind might be able to stretch
the plain language of the Nebraska statute to apply to D&E,
"citizens who desire to obey the statute will have no difficulty in understanding it." Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S.
104, 110 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Finally, the majority discusses at some length the reasons
it will not defer to the interpretation of the statute proffered
by the Nebraska Attorney General, despite the Attorney
General's repeated representations to this Court that his
State will not apply the partial birth abortion statute to
D&E. See Brief for Petitioners 11-13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-
11. The fact that the Court declines to defer to the interpretation of the Attorney General is not, however, a reason
to give the statute a contrary representation. Even without
according the Attorney General's view any particular respect, we should agree with his interpretation because it is
undoubtedly the correct one. Moreover, Justice O'Connor
has noted that the Court should adopt a narrow interpretation of a state statute when it is supported by the principle
that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties as well as by "the representations of counsel . . . at
oral argument." Frisby v. Schultz, supra, at 483. Such an
approach is particularly appropriate in this case because, as
the majority notes, Nebraska courts accord the Nebraska Attorney General's interpretations of state statutes "substantial weight." See State v. Coffman, 213 Neb. 560, 561, 330
N. W. 2d 727, 728 (1983). Therefore, any renegade prosecutor bringing criminal charges against a physician for performing a D&E would find himself confronted with a contrary interpretation of the statute by the Nebraska Attorney
General, and, I assume, a judge who both possessed common

IV
Having resolved that Nebraska's partial birth abortionstatute permits doctors to perform D&E abortions, the question remains whether a State can constitutionally prohibitthe partial birth abortion procedure without a health exception. Although the majority and Justice O'Connor pur-port to rely on the standard articulated in the Casey plurality in concluding that a State may not, they in fact disregardit entirely.

A
Though Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter de-clined in

Casey, on the ground of stare decisis, to reconsiderwhether abortion enjoys any constitutional protection, 505

U. S., at 844-846, 854-869 (majority opinion); id., at 871 (plu-rality opinion),

Casey professed to be, in part, a repudiationof Roe and its progeny. The Casey plurality expressly noted

that prior case law had undervalued the State's interest inpotential life, 505 U. S., at 875-876, and had invalidated regulations of abortion that "in no real sense deprived women ofthe ultimate decision," id., at 875. See id., at 871 ("Roe v.
Wade speaks with clarity in establishing . . . the State's `im-portant and legitimate interest in potential life.' That por17 The majority relies on Justice Scalia's observation in Crandon v.
United States, 494 U. S. 152 (1990), that "we have never thought that the
interpretation of those charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to deference." Id., at 177. But Justice Scalia was commenting on
the United States Attorney General's overly broad interpretation of a federal statute, deference to which, as he said, would "turn the normal construction of criminal statutes upside-down, replacing the doctrine of lenity
with a doctrine of severity." Id., at 178. Here, the Nebraska Attorney
General has adopted a narrow view of a criminal statute, one that comports with the rule of lenity (not to mention the statute's plain meaning).

tion of the decision in Roe has been given too little acknowl-edgment" (citation omitted)). The plurality repeatedly

recognized the States' weighty interest in this area. Seeid., at 877 ("State . . . may express profound respect for the
life of the unborn"); id., at 878 ("the State's profound interestin potential life"); id., at 850 (majority opinion) ("profound
moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy,even in its earliest stage"). And, the plurality expressed
repeatedly the States' legitimate role in regulating abortionprocedures. See

id., at 876 ("The very notion that the Statehas a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted");id., at 875 ("Not all governmental intrusion [with abortion]
is of necessity unwarranted"). According to the plurality:"The fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not
designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effectof making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an
abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it." Id., at 874.The

Casey plurality therefore adopted the standard: "Onlywhere state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make this decision does the power of the Statereach into the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause." Ibid. A regulation imposes an "undue bur-den" only if it "has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle
in the path of a woman's choice." Id., at 877.

B
There is no question that the State of Nebraska has a validinterest--one not designed to strike at the right itself--in

prohibiting partial birth abortion. Casey itself noted thatStates may "express profound respect for the life of the unborn." Ibid. States may, without a doubt, express thisprofound respect by prohibiting a procedure that approaches
infanticide, and thereby dehumanizes the fetus and trivial-izes human life. The AMA has recognized that this procedure is "ethically different from other destructive abortion

techniques because the fetus, normally twenty weeks orlonger in gestation, is killed outside the womb. The `partial

birth' gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it fromthe right of the woman to choose treatments for her own
body." AMA Board of Trustees Factsheet on H. R. 1122(June 1997), in App. to Brief for Association of American
Physicians and Surgeons et al. as Amici Curiae 1. ThirtyStates have concurred with this view.

Although the description of this procedure set forth aboveshould be sufficient to demonstrate the resemblance between
the partial birth abortion procedure and infanticide, the tes-timony of one nurse who observed a partial birth abortion
procedure makes the point even more vividly:

"The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasp-ing, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor

stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby'sarms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like
a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall."The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a highpowered suction tube into the opening, and suckedthe baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely
limp." H. R. 1833 Hearing 18 (statement of BrendaPratt Shafer).

The question whether States have a legitimate interest inbanning the procedure does not require additional authority.
See ante, at 961-964 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).18 In a civi18 I read the majority opinion to concede, if only implicitly, that the State
has a legitimate interest in banning this dehumanizing procedure. The
threshold question under Casey is whether the abortion regulation serves
a legitimate state interest. 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Only if the statute
serves a legitimate state interest is it necessary to consider whether the
regulation imposes a substantial obstacle to women seeking an abortion.
Ibid. The fact that the majority considers whether Nebraska's statute
creates a substantial obstacle suggests that the Members of the majority
other than Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg have rejected
respondent's threshold argument that the statute serves no legitimate
state purpose.

lized society, the answer is too obvious, and the contrary ar-guments too offensive, to merit further discussion. But see

ante, at 946-947 (Stevens, J., concurring) (arguing that the
decision of 30 States to ban the partial birth abortion procedure was "simply irrational" because other forms of abortion
were "equally gruesome"); ante, at 951-952 (Ginsburg, J.,
concurring) (similar).19

19 Justice Ginsburg seems to suggest that even if the Nebraska statute does not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions, the
statute is unconstitutional because it has the purpose of imposing an undue
burden. Justice Ginsburg's view is, apparently, that we can presume
an unconstitutional purpose because the regulation is not designed to save
any fetus from "destruction" or protect the health of pregnant women and
so must, therefore, be designed to "chip away at . . . Roe." Ante, at 952.
This is a strange claim to make with respect to legislation that was
enacted in 30 individual States and was enacted in Nebraska by a vote of
45 to 1, Nebraska Legislative Journal, 95th Leg., 1st Sess., 2609 (1997).
Moreover, in support of her assertion that the Nebraska Legislature acted
with an unconstitutional purpose, Justice Ginsburg is apparently unable
to muster a single shred of evidence that the Nebraska legislation was
enacted to prevent women from obtaining abortions (a purpose to which
it would be entirely ineffective), let alone the kind of persuasive proof we
would require before concluding that a legislature acted with an unconstitutional intent. In fact, as far as I can tell, Justice Ginsburg's views
regarding the motives of the Nebraska Legislature derive from the views
of a dissenting Court of Appeals judge discussing the motives of legislators of other States. Justice Ginsburg's presumption is, in addition,
squarely inconsistent with Casey, which stated that States may enact legislation to "express profound respect for the life of the unborn," 505 U. S.,
at 877, and with our opinion in Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U. S. 968 (1997)
(per curiam), in which we stated:

"[E]ven assuming . . . that a legislative purpose to interfere with the constitutionally protected right to abortion without the effect of interfering
with that right . . . could render the Montana law invalid--there is no
basis for finding a vitiating legislative purpose here. We do not assume
unconstitutional legislative intent even when statutes produce harmful results, see, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 246 (1976); much less
do we assume it when the results are harmless." Id., at 972 (emphases
in original).

The next question, therefore, is whether the Nebraskastatute is unconstitutional because it does not contain an exception that would allow use of the procedure whenever" ` "necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the . . . health of the mother." ' " Ante, at 930(majority opinion) (quoting

Casey, 505 U. S., at 879, in turnquoting Roe, 410 U. S., at 164-165) (emphasis deleted). According to the majority, such a health exception is requiredhere because there is a "division of opinion among some medical experts over whether D&X is generally safer [thanD&E], and an absence of controlled medical studies that
would help answer these medical questions." Ante, at 936-937. In other words, unless a State can conclusively establish that an abortion procedure is no safer than other proce-dures, the State cannot regulate that procedure without
including a health exception. Justice O'Connor agrees.
Ante, at 947-948 (concurring opinion). The rule set forth bythe majority and

Justice O'Connor dramatically expandson our prior abortion cases and threatens to undo

any stateregulation of abortion procedures.

The majority and Justice O'Connor suggest that theirrule is dictated by a straightforward application of Roe and
Casey. Ante, at 929-930 (majority opinion); ante, at 947-948(O'C

onnor, J., concurring). But that is simply not true. In
Roe and Casey, the Court stated that the State may "regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is neces-sary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation

of the life or health of the mother." Roe, supra, at 165;
Casey, 505 U. S., at 879. Casey said that a health exception
must be available if "continuing her pregnancy would consti-tute a threat" to the woman.

Id., at 880 (majority opinion)
(emphasis added). Under these cases, if a State seeks toprohibit abortion, even if only temporarily or under particular circumstances, as Casey says that it may, id., at 879 (plu530US2 Unit: $U85 [11-21-01 16:51:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

rality opinion), the State must make an exception for cases
in which the life or health of the mother is endangered by
continuing the pregnancy. These cases addressed only the
situation in which a woman must obtain an abortion because
of some threat to her health from continued pregnancy. But
Roe and Casey say nothing at all about cases in which a physician considers one prohibited method of abortion to be preferable to permissible methods. Today's majority and Jus-
tice O'Connor twist Roe and Casey to apply to the situation
in which a woman desires--for whatever reason--an abortion and wishes to obtain the abortion by some particular
method. See ante, at 929-931 (majority opinion); ante, at
947-948 (concurring opinion). In other words, the majority
and Justice O'Connor fail to distinguish between cases in
which health concerns require a woman to obtain an abortion
and cases in which health concerns cause a woman who desires an abortion (for whatever reason) to prefer one method
over another.

It is clear that the Court's understanding of when a health
exception is required is not mandated by our prior cases. In
fact, we have, post-Casey, approved regulations of methods
of conducting abortion despite the lack of a health exception.
Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U. S. 968, 971 (1997) (per curiam) (reversing Court of Appeals holding that plaintiffs
challenging requirement that only physicians perform abortions had a " `fair chance of success' "); id., at 979 (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (arguing that the regulation was designed to
make abortion more difficult). And one can think of vast
bodies of law regulating abortion that are valid, one would
hope, despite the lack of health exceptions. For example,
physicians are presumably prohibited from using abortifacients that have not been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration even if some physicians reasonably believe

Thomas, J., dissenting
that these abortifacients would be safer for women than
existing abortifacients.20

The majority effectively concedes that Casey provides no
support for its broad health exception rule by relying on
pre-Casey authority, see ante, at 931, including a case that
was specifically disapproved of in Casey for giving too little
weight to the State's interest in fetal life. See Casey, supra,
at 869, 882 (overruling the parts of Thornburgh v. American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747
(1986), that were "inconsistent with Roe's statement that the
State has a legitimate interest in promoting the life or potential life of the unborn," 505 U. S., at 870); id., at 893 (majority
opinion) (relying on Thornburgh, supra, at 783 (Burger, C. J.,
dissenting), for the proposition that the Court was expanding
on Roe in that case). Indeed, Justice O'Connor, who joins
the Court's opinion, was on the Court for Thornburgh and
was in dissent, arguing that, under the undue-burden standard, the statute at issue was constitutional. See 476 U. S.,
at 828-832 (arguing that the challenged state statute was not
"unduly burdensome"). The majority's resort to this case
proves my point that the holding today assumes that the
standard set forth in the Casey joint opinion is no longer
governing.

And even if I were to assume that the pre-Casey standards
govern, the cases cited by the majority provide no support
for the proposition that the partial birth abortion ban must

20 As I discuss below, the only question after Casey is whether a ban on
partial birth abortion without a health exception imposes an "undue burden" on a woman seeking an abortion, meaning that it creates a "substantial obstacle" for the woman. I assume that the Court does not discuss
the health risks with respect to undue burden, and instead suggests that
health risks are relevant to the necessity of a health exception, because a
marginal increase in safety risk for some women is clearly not an undue
burden within the meaning of Casey. At bottom, the majority is using the
health exception language to water down Casey's undue-burden standard.

include a health exception because some doctors believe thatpartial birth abortion is safer. In

Thornburgh, Danforth,
and Doe, the Court addressed health exceptions for cases inwhich

continued pregnancy would pose a risk to the woman.
Thornburgh, supra, at 770; Planned Parenthood of Central
Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S.,
at 197. And in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379 (1979),
the Court explicitly declined to address whether a State canconstitutionally require a tradeoff between the woman's

health and that of the fetus. The broad rule articulated bythe majority and by

Justice O'Connor are unprecedented
expansions of this Court's already expansive pre-Caseyjurisprudence.

As if this state of affairs were not bad enough, the major-ity expands the health exception rule articulated in

Casey in
one additional and equally pernicious way. Although Roeand

Casey mandated a health exception for cases in which
abortion is "necessary" for a woman's health, the majorityconcludes that a procedure is "necessary" if it has any comparative health benefits. Ante, at 937. In other words, according to the majority, so long as a doctor can point to sup-port in the profession for his (or the woman's) preferred

procedure, it is "necessary" and the physician is entitled to
perform it. Ibid. See also ante, at 952 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (arguing that a State cannot constitutionally "sto[p]
a woman from choosing the procedure her doctor `reasonably
believes' " is in her best interest). But such a health exception requirement eviscerates Casey's undue-burden standard
and imposes unfettered abortion on demand. The exception
entirely swallows the rule. In effect, no regulation of abortion procedures is permitted because there will always be
some support for a procedure and there will always be some
doctors who conclude that the procedure is preferable. If
Nebraska reenacts its partial birth abortion ban with a
health exception, the State will not be able to prevent physicians like Dr. Carhart from using partial birth abortion as a
routine abortion procedure. This Court has now expressed

its own conclusion that there is "highly plausible" supportfor the view that partial birth abortion is safer, which, in

the majority's view, means that the procedure is therefore"necessary." Ante, at 937. Any doctor who wishes to perform such a procedure under the new statute will be able todo so with impunity. Therefore,

Justice O'Connor's assur-ance that the constitutional failings of Nebraska's statute can

be easily fixed, ante, at 950-951, is illusory. The majority'sinsistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering
its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States--a hos-tility that Casey purported to reject.

D
The majority assiduously avoids addressing the actualstandard articulated in Casey--whether prohibiting partial

birth abortion without a health exception poses a substantialobstacle to obtaining an abortion. 505 U. S., at 877. And
for good reason: Such an obstacle does not exist. There aretwo essential reasons why the Court cannot identify a substantial obstacle. First, the Court cannot identify any real,much less substantial, barrier to any woman's ability to obtain an abortion. And second, the Court cannot demon-strate that any such obstacle would affect a sufficient number
of women to justify invalidating the statute on its face.

The Casey joint opinion makes clear that the Court shouldnot strike down state regulations of abortion based on the

for "all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age--relevant to the well being of the patient." Doe v. Bolton, 410
U. S. 179, 192 (1973). See also Voinovich v. Women's Medical Professional Corp., 523 U. S. 1036, 1037 (1998) (Thomas, J., joined by Rehn-

fact that some women might face a marginally higher healthrisk from the regulation. In

Casey, the Court upheld a 24-
hour waiting period even though the Court credited evidencethat for some women the delay would, in practice, be much

longer than 24 hours, and even though it was undisputed thatany delay in obtaining an abortion would impose additional
health risks. Id., at 887; id., at 937 (Blackmun, J., concurring
in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting inpart) ("The District Court found that the mandatory 24-hour

delay could lead to delays in excess of 24 hours, thus increas-ing health risks"). Although some women would be able to
avoid the waiting period because of a "medical emergency,"
the medical emergency exception in the statute was limited
to those women for whom delay would create "serious risk
of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily
function." Id., at 902 (appendix to joint opinion) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Without question, there were
women for whom the regulation would impose some additional health risk who would not fall within the medical
emergency exception. The Court concluded, despite the
certainty of this increased risk, that there was no showing
that the burden on any of the women was substantial. Id.,
at 887.

The only case in which this Court has overturned a State's
attempt to prohibit a particular form of abortion also demonstrates that a marginal increase in health risks is not sufficient to create an undue burden. In Planned Parenthood of
Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976), the Court
struck down a state regulation because the State had outlawed the method of abortion used in 70% of abortions and
because alternative methods were, the Court emphasized,
"significantly more dangerous and critical" than the prohibited method. Id., at 76.

Like the Casey 24-hour waiting period, and in contrast to
the situation in Danforth, any increased health risk to
women imposed by the partial birth abortion ban is minimal

at most. Of the 5.5% of abortions that occur after 15 weeks(the time after which a partial birth abortion would be possible), the vast majority are performed with a D&E or induc-tion procedure. And, for any woman with a vertex presentation fetus, the vertex presentation form of intact D&E,which presumably shares some of the health benefits of the
partial birth abortion procedure but is not covered by the
Nebraska statute, is available. Of the remaining women--that is, those women for whom a partial birth abortion procedure would be considered and who have a breech presenta-tion fetus--there is no showing that any one faces a significant health risk from the partial birth abortion ban. A
select committee of ACOG "could identify no circumstances
under which this procedure . . . would be the only option to
save the life or preserve the health of the woman." App.
600 (ACOG Executive Board, Statement on Intact Dilation
and Extraction (Jan. 12, 1997)). See also Hope Clinic v.
Ryan, 195 F. 3d 857, 872 (CA7 1999) (en banc) (" `There does
not appear to be any identified situation in which intact
D&X is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion' "
(quoting Late Term Pregnancy Techniques, AMA Policy
H-5.982 W. D. Wis. 1999)); Planned Parenthood of Wis. v.
Doyle, 44 F. Supp. 2d, at 980 (citing testimony of Dr. Haskell
that "the D&X procedure is never medically necessary to . . .
preserve the health of a woman"), vacated, 195 F. 3d 857
(CA7 1999). And, an ad hoc coalition of doctors, including
former Surgeon General Koop, concluded that there are
no medical conditions that require use of the partial birth
abortion procedure to preserve the mother's health. See
App. 719.

In fact, there was evidence before the Nebraska Legislature that partial birth abortion increases health risks relative to other procedures. During floor debates, a proponent
of the Nebraska legislation read from and cited several articles by physicians concluding that partial birth abortion procedures are risky. App. in Nos. 98-3245, 98-3300 (CA8),

Thomas, J., dissenting
p. 812. One doctor testifying before a committee of the Nebraska Legislature stated that partial birth abortion involves three "very risky procedures": dilation of the cervix,
using instruments blindly, and conversion of the fetus. App.
721 (quoting testimony of Paul Hays, M. D.).22

There was also evidence before Congress that partial birth
abortion "does not meet medical standards set by ACOG nor
has it been adequately proven to be safe nor efficacious."
H. R. 1833 Hearing 112 (statement of Nancy G. Romer,
M. D.); see id., at 110-111.23 The AMA supported the congressional ban on partial birth abortion, concluding that the
procedure is "not medically indicated" and "not good medicine." See 143 Cong. Rec. S4670 (May 19, 1997) (reprinting
a letter from the AMA to Sen. Santorum). And there was
evidence before Congress that there is "certainly no basis
upon which to state the claim that [partial birth abortion] is
a safer or even a preferred procedure." Partial Birth Abortion: The Truth, S. 6 and H. R. 929 Joint Hearing 123 (statement of Curtis Cook, M. D.). This same doctor testified that

22 Use of the procedure may increase the risk of complications, including
cervical incompetence, because it requires greater dilation of the cervix
than other forms of abortion. See Epner, Jonas, & Seckinger, Late-term
Abortion, 280 JAMA 724, 726 (Aug. 26, 1998). Physicians have also suggested that the procedure may pose a greater risk of infection. See
Planned Parenthood of Wis. v. Doyle, 44 F. Supp. 2d 975, 979 (WD Wis.
1999). See also Sprang & Neerhof, Rationale for Banning Abortions Late
in Pregnancy, 280 JAMA 744 (Aug. 26, 1998) ("Intact D&X poses serious
medical risks to the mother").

23 Nebraska was entitled to rely on testimony and evidence presented to

Congress and to other state legislatures. Cf. Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529
U. S. 277, 296-297 (2000); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S.
41, 51 (1986). At numerous points during the legislative debates, various
members of the Nebraska Legislature made clear that that body was
aware of, and relying on, evidence before Congress and other legislative
bodies. See App. in Nos. 98-3245, 98-3300 (CA8), pp. 846, 852-853, 878-
879, 890-891, 912-913.

"partial-birth abortion is an unnecessary, unsteady, and potentially dangerous procedure," and that "safe alternatives
are in existence." Id., at 122.

The majority justifies its result by asserting that a "significant body of medical opinion" supports the view that partial birth abortion may be a safer abortion procedure. Ante,
at 937. I find this assertion puzzling. If there is a "significant body of medical opinion" supporting this procedure, no
one in the majority has identified it. In fact, it is uncontested that although this procedure has been used since at
least 1992, no formal studies have compared partial birth
abortion with other procedures. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1112 (citing testimony of Dr. Stubblefield); id., at 1115 (citing testimony of Dr. Boehm); Epner, Jonas, & Seckinger, Late-term
Abortion, 280 JAMA 724 (Aug. 26, 1998); Sprang & Neerhof,
Rationale for Banning Abortion Late in Pregnancy, 280
JAMA 744 (Aug. 26, 1998). Cf. Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U. S. 137, 149-152 (1999) (observing that the reliability of a scientific technique may turn on whether the technique can be and has been tested; whether it has been
subjected to peer review and publication; and whether there
is a high rate of error or standards controlling its operation).
The majority's conclusion makes sense only if the undueburden standard is not whether a "significant body of medical opinion" supports the result, but rather, as Justice
Ginsburg candidly admits, whether any doctor could reasonably believe that the partial birth abortion procedure
would best protect the woman. Ante, at 952.

Moreover, even if I were to assume credible evidence on
both sides of the debate, that fact should resolve the undueburden question in favor of allowing Nebraska to legislate.
Where no one knows whether a regulation of abortion poses
any burden at all, the burden surely does not amount to a
"substantial obstacle." Under Casey, in such a case we
should defer to the legislative judgment. We have said:

uncertainties, legislative options must be especiallybroad . . . ." Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 360, n. 3

In Justice O'Connor's words:

"It is . . . difficult to believe that this Court, withoutthe resources available to those bodies entrusted with

every time the American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists (ACOG) or similar group revises its views
about what is and what is not appropriate medical pro-cedure in this area."

See id., at 456, n. 4 ("Irrespective of the difficulty of the task,legislatures, with their superior factfinding capabilities, are

certainly better able to make the necessary judgments thanare courts");

a conclusion would not require invalidating the Act, becausethis case comes to us on a facial challenge. The only question before us is whether respondent has shown that " `noset of circumstances exists under which the Act would be
valid.' " Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497U. S. 502, 514 (1990) (quoting

Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services, supra, at 524 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment)). Courts may not invalidate on itsface a state statute regulating abortion "based upon a

worst-case analysis that may never occur." 497 U. S., at 514.Invalidation of the statute would be improper even assuming that Casey rejected this standard sub silentio (at least
so far as abortion cases are concerned) in favor of a so-called
" `large fraction' " test. See Fargo Women's Health Organization v. Schafer, 507 U. S. 1013, 1014 (1993) (O'Connor,
J., joined by Souter, J., concurring) (arguing that the "no
set of circumstances" standard is incompatible with Casey).
See also Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls
Clinic, 517 U. S. 1174, 1177-1179 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). In Casey, the Court was presented with a facial challenge to, among other provisions, a
spousal notice requirement. The question, according to the
majority, was whether the spousal notice provision operated
as a "substantial obstacle" to the women "whose conduct it
affects," namely, "married women seeking abortions who do
not wish to notify their husbands of their intentions and who
do not qualify for one of the statutory exceptions to the
notice requirement." 505 U. S., at 895. The Court determined that a "large fraction" of the women in this category
were victims of psychological or physical abuse. Ibid. For
this subset of women, according to the Court, the provision
would pose a substantial obstacle to the ability to obtain an
abortion because their husbands could exercise an effective
veto over their decision. Id., at 897.

None of the opinions supporting the majority so much as
mentions the large fraction standard, undoubtedly because

Thomas, J., dissenting
the Nebraska statute easily survives it. I will assume, forthe sake of discussion, that the category of women whose

conduct Nebraska's partial birth abortion statute might af-fect includes any woman who wishes to obtain a safe abortion
after 16 weeks' gestation. I will also assume (although Idoubt it is true) that, of these women, every one would be
willing to use the partial birth abortion procedure if so ad-vised by her doctor. Indisputably, there is no "large fraction" of these women who would face a substantial obstacleto obtaining a safe abortion because of their inability to use
this particular procedure. In fact, it is not clear that anywoman would be deprived of a safe abortion by her inability
to obtain a partial birth abortion. More medically sophisti-cated minds than ours have searched and failed to identify a
single circumstance (let alone a large fraction) in which par-tial birth abortion is required. But no matter. The "ad hoc
nullification" machine is back at full throttle. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 814 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Madsenv. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 785 (1994)

(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissentingin part).

* * *
We were reassured repeatedly in Casey that not all regula-tions of abortion are unwarranted and that the States may

express profound respect for fetal life. Under Casey, theregulation before us today should easily pass constitutional
muster. But the Court's abortion jurisprudence is a particu-larly virulent strain of constitutional exegesis. And so
today we are told that 30 States are prohibited from banningone rarely used form of abortion that they believe to border
on infanticide. It is clear that the Constitution does notcompel this result.

I respectfully dissent.

UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

on bill of complaint
No. 84, Orig. Decided June 19, 1997--Decree entered June 29, 2000
Decree entered.
Opinion reported: 521 U. S. 1.

The joint motion for entry of a decree is granted.

DECREE
On June 18, 1979, the Court granted the United States
leave to file a bill of complaint setting out a dispute over the
rights of the United States and the State of Alaska to offer
lands in the Beaufort Sea for mineral leasing. 442 U. S. 937.
The Court appointed a Special Master to direct subsequent
proceedings and to submit such reports as he deemed appropriate. 444 U. S. 1065 (1980). The Court later referred
to the Master the State of Alaska's motion for leave to file
a counterclaim seeking a decree quieting its title to coastal
submerged lands within two federal reservations, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Arctic National
Wildlife Range (now known as the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge). 445 U. S. 914 (1980).

From 1980 through 1986, the Master oversaw extensive
hearings and briefing. On May 20, 1996, the Court received
and ordered filed the Special Master's Report. 517 U. S.
1207. On June 19, 1997, this Court overruled Alaska's exceptions, sustained the United States' exception, and directed the parties to prepare and submit an appropriate
decree, consistent with the Court's decision, for the Court's
consideration. 521 U. S. 1. The parties have prepared a
proposed decree and have recommended its entry by the
Court.

Accordingly,

A. Alaska's Motion for Leave to File a Counterclaim.
The motion of the State of Alaska for leave to file a counterclaim is granted.

B. The Federal-State Boundary Marking the Seaward Extent of the State of Alaska's Submerged Lands Act Grant.

1. Except as provided in Paragraph C below, as against
the State of Alaska and all persons claiming under it, theUnited States has exclusive rights to explore the area lying

seaward of the line described in Exhibit A hereof and toexploit the natural resources of said area. The State of
Alaska is not entitled to any interest in such lands, minerals,and resources, except as may be provided by $ 8(g) of the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 67 Stat. 468, 43 U. S. C.$ 1337(g), and Paragraph C of this Decree. The State of
Alaska, its privies, assigns, lessees, and other persons claim-ing under it are hereby enjoined from interfering with the
rights of the United States in such lands, minerals, and
resources.

2. Except as provided in Paragraph C below and except
within the boundaries of the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and subject to the exceptions set out in $ 5 of the Submerged Lands
Act, 67 Stat. 32, 43 U. S. C. $ 1313, as against the United
States and all persons claiming under it, the State of Alaska
has exclusive rights to explore the area lying shoreward of
the line described in Exhibit A hereof and to exploit the natural resources of said area. The United States is not entitled to any interest in such lands, minerals, and resources
except as may be provided by Paragraph C of this Decree.

3. The boundary described in Exhibit A shall remain fixed
for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act.

C. Distribution of Revenues in Escrow and Administration of Leases.

1. The United States and the State of Alaska shall resolve
accounting and administration issues arising from the past
issuance of offshore oil and gas leases in disputed areas based
on the following principles:

a. Existing and Former Leases That Are Subject to

$ 7 Agreements. During the course of this litigation,
the United States and the State of Alaska entered into
agreements under $ 7 of the Outer Continental Shelf
Lands Act, 43 U. S. C. $ 1336, and Alaska Stat.

$$ 38.05.020 and 38.05.137, to allow mineral leasing of
submerged lands in disputed areas. Under the terms
of those "$ 7 Agreements," lease revenues are held in
income-producing escrow accounts for distribution based
on the outcome of the litigation. No later than 180 days
after entry of this Decree, the funds held in escrow accounts shall be distributed in accordance with the distribution provisions contained in the $ 7 Agreements. The
United States and the State of Alaska shall carry out all
applicable provisions and terms of the $ 7 Agreements
and shall administer the leases in accordance with the
provisions therein.

b. Existing and Former Leases That Are Affected by
the Fixed Federal-State Boundary Described in Exhibit
A. The United States and the State of Alaska have issued mineral leases in offshore areas that were not in
dispute on the date of lease issuance and are therefore
not subject to $ 7 Agreements. Those leases may be intersected, however, by the fixed federal-state boundary
described in Exhibit A, which is based upon surveys conducted after the lease dates. Leases existing on the

date of this Decree and not covered by $ 7 Agreements,but intersected by the fixed federal-state boundary described in Exhibit A, shall continue to be administeredby the original lessor, who shall have the exclusive right
to all past and future revenues from the lease. Follow-ing the expiration, relinquishment, or termination of
such leases, the rights to explore and exploit the naturalresources within the area that was leased shall be determined solely in accordance with Paragraph B of this De-cree. The distribution of revenues from former leases
that expired before the date of this Decree, that werenot covered by $ 7 Agreements, but that would have
been intersected by the fixed federal-state boundary de-scribed in Exhibit A, shall not be affected by the fixing
of the federal-state boundary.c.

Existing and Former Leases That Are Both Sub-ject t o $ 7 A greements and A ffected by the Fixed

Federal-State Boundary Described in Exhibit A. Inthe event that an existing lease is subject to a $ 7 Agreement and is intersected by the fixed federal-state bound-ary described in Exhibit A, the funds held in escrow
shall be distributed, and the lease shall be administered,in accordance with the provisions of the $ 7 Agreement.
Following the expiration, relinquishment, or terminationof the lease, the rights to explore and exploit the natural
resources within the area that was leased shall be deter-mined solely in accordance with Paragraph B of this Decree. The distribution of revenues from former leasesthat expired before the date of this Decree, that were
subject to $ 7 Agreements, but that would have been in-tersected by the fixed federal-state boundary described
in Exhibit A, shall not be affected by the fixing of thefederal-state boundary.

2. This Decree shall not affect the rights or obligationsof the United States or the State of Alaska with respect to

its lessees or third parties, whether arising from the $ 7Agreements or otherwise. This Decree shall not affect any

rights or obligations arising under present or future uniti-zation, operating, enhanced recovery, commingling, or other
similar agreements between the parties or with others.

D. The Coastal Boundary of the National Petroleum
Reserve-Alaska.

The coastal boundary of the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska is a continuous line, as described in Executive Order
No. 3739-A (1923), in Presidential Executive Orders (1980)
(microform, reel 6), that begins at the western bank of the
Colville River and follows the highest highwater mark westerly, extending across the entrances of small lagoons, including Peard Bay, Wainwright Inlet, the Kuk River, Kugrua
Bay and River, and other small bays and river estuaries,
and following the ocean side of barrier islands and sandspits
within three miles of shore and the ocean side of the Plover
Islands, to the northwestern extremity of Icy Cape, approximately 70o 21\Delta  N., 161o 46\Delta  W.

E. The Coastal Boundary of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.

The coastal boundary of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a continuous line, as described in Public Land Order
No. 2214, 25 Fed. Reg. 12598 (1960), that begins at the intersection of the International Boundary line between the State
of Alaska and Yukon Territory, Canada, with the line of extreme low water of the Arctic Ocean in the vicinity of Monument 1 of said International Boundary line, and follows the
line of extreme low water westerly, extending across the entrances of lagoons such that all offshore bars, reefs and islands, and lagoons that separate them from the mainland,
are part of the Refuge, to Brownlow Point, at approximately
70o 10\Delta  N., 145o 51\Delta  W.

F. Resolution of Disputes Respecting the Coastal Bound-aries of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

The coastal boundaries of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are ambulatory and will therefore migrate as a result of changes in rel-evant physical features. The United States and the State
of Alaska may resolve disputes arising from those changesthrough negotiation, through alternative methods of dispute
resolution, or through invocation of this Court's retainedjurisdiction in accordance with Paragraph G. The United
States and the State of Alaska may jointly submit to thisCourt, for entry as a supplement to this Decree, any agreement respecting the location of the coastal boundary of theNational Petroleum Reserve-Alaska or of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

G. Retention of Jurisdiction.
The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such furtherproceedings, enter such orders, and issue such writs as from

time to time may be determined necessary or advisable toeffectuate and supplement this Decree and the rights of the
respective parties. In all other respects, this Decree is final.

Statement of Justice O'Connor respecting the denial of thepetition for a writ of certiorari.
This case involves an award of attorney's fees that, by anymeasure, is extraordinary. Respondents brought a securities
class action, alleging that petitioners had fraudulently solicitedand stimulated excessive trading of commodities options. The
parties ultimately settled the suit, whereby petitioners agreed tocreate a $40 million "reversionary fund" for the class plaintiffs.
Under the terms of the settlement, the portion of the fund notclaimed by class members and not paid to respondents in attorney's fees and expenses was to revert to petitioners.After the parties reached their agreement, the District Court
approved respondents' application for attorney's fees in theamount of $13,333,333, or one-third of the reversionary fund. The
figure was unrelated to the amount actually claimed by classplaintiffs. As it later turned out, the actual distribution to class
members was $6,485,362.15. Accordingly, the fee award approvedby the District Court was more than twice the amount of the
class' actual recovery. The Court of Appeals affirmed the award,

Statement of O'Connor, J. 530 U. S.
holding that the District Court had not abused its discretion.See 190 F. 3d 1291, 1293 (CA11 1999).

In Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U. S. 472 (1980), we upheldan award of attorney's fees in a class action where the award was
based on the total fund available to the class rather than theamount actually recovered. Id., at 480-481. We had no occasion
in Boeing, however, to address whether there must at least besome rational connection between the fee award and the amount
of the actual distribution to the class. The approval of attorney'sfees absent any such inquiry could have several troubling consequences. Arrangements such as that at issue here decouple classcounsel's financial incentives from those of the class, increasing
the risk that the actual distribution will be misallocated betweenattorney's fees and the plaintiffs' recovery. They potentially undermine the underlying purposes of class actions by providingdefendants with a powerful means to enticing class counsel to
settle lawsuits in a manner detrimental to the class. And theycould encourage the filing of needless lawsuits where, because the
value of each class member's individual claim is small comparedto the transaction costs in obtaining recovery, the actual distribution to the class will inevitably be minimal. The Courts of Ap-peals have differed in their approaches to the problem. Compare
Strong v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 137 F. 3d 844, 852(CA5 1998) (District Court did not abuse its discretion in basing
fee award on actual payout rather than reversionary fund), withWilliams v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co., 129 F. 3d 1026,
1027 (CA9 1997) (benchmark for fee award is 25% of entire fund,and District Court abused its discretion in basing award on actual
distribution to class).Although I believe this issue warrants the Court's attention,
this particular case does not present a suitable opportunity forits resolution. As part of their settlement, the parties agreed
that respondents would apply for attorney's fees in an amount upto one-third of the reversionary fund, and petitioners expressly
pledged not to "directly or indirectly oppose [respondents'] appli-cation for fees." App. to Pet. for Cert. G-36. Moreover, according to the District Court's order approving the settlement, peti-tioners' counsel represented to the court that "the fee application
specifically contemplated by the [settlement], i. e. $13,333,333 . . .was reasonable and that its reasonableness was supported by his
experience in other class actions." Id., at S-4. Consequently,

petitioners appear to have waived any right to challenge the rea-sonableness of the fee award in this case. I therefore agree with
the Court's decision to deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.Nonetheless, I believe the importance of the issue counsels in
favor of granting review in an appropriate case.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice
Thomas join, dissenting. I

On April 19, 1994, the Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, Board ofEducation (Board) passed the following resolution:

"Whenever, in classes of elementary or high school, thescientific theory of evolution is to be presented, whether from
textbook, workbook, pamphlet, other written material, or oralpresentation the following statement shall be quoted immediately before the unit of study begins as a disclaimer fromendorsement of such theory.

"It is hereby recognized by the Tangipahoa Parish Boardof Education, that the lesson to be presented, regarding the
origin of life and matter, is known as the Scientific Theoryof Evolution and should be presented to inform students of
the scientific concept and not intended to influence or dis-suade the Biblical version of Creation or any other concept.

"It is further recognized by the Board of Education that itis the basic right and privilege of each student to form his/
her own opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents onthis very important matter of the origin of life and matter.
Students are urged to exercise critical thinking and gatherall information possible and closely examine each alternative
toward forming an opinion." Pet. for Cert. 2.
Approximately seven months after this resolution was adopted,respondents, three parents of children attending the Tangipahoa

Parish Public Schools, brought suit in the United States DistrictCourt for the Eastern District of Louisiana against petitioners,
the Board, its members, and the superintendent of the schooldistrict. They brought a facial challenge to the disclaimer contained in the last two paragraphs of the resolution, claiming thatit violated the coextensive Establishment Clauses of the United
States and Louisiana Constitutions. The District Court ruled infavor of respondents. 975 F. Supp. 819 (1997). It concluded that
the disclaimer lacked a secular purpose, and thus failed the firstprong of the three-prong test outlined in

Lemon v. Kurtzman,

Scalia, J., dissenting 530 U. S.
403 U. S. 602 (1971), because the Board's articulated purpose--that it adopted the disclaimer to promote critical thinking by
students on the subject of the origin of life--was a sham. See975 F. Supp., at 829. It therefore held the disclaimer unconstitutional under both the Federal and the Louisiana Constitutions.See id., at 830.

The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 185 F. 3d 337 (1999). It began bynoting that, in the context of public education, this Court has
used three different tests to evaluate state actions challenged onEstablishment Clause grounds: the three-prong test of Lemon;
the "endorsement" test of County of Allegheny v. American CivilLiberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 (1989);
and the "coercion" test of Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992).See 185 F. 3d, at 343. Although noting that the Lemon test has
been "widely criticized and occasionally ignored," the court optedto apply it. 185 F. 3d, at 344. The court first concluded that the
disclaimer had a secular purpose and therefore survived the firstprong of the Lemon test. See 185 F. 3d, at 344-346. While
agreeing with the District Court that the purpose of promotingcritical thinking by students on the subject of the origin of life
was a sham, the court concluded that the disclaimer served twoother, legitimate secular purposes: disclaiming any orthodoxy of
belief that could be inferred from the exclusive place of evolutionin the curriculum, and reducing offense to any student or parent
caused by the teaching of evolution. See ibid.The Fifth Circuit then turned to the second prong of the Lemon
test--the so-called "effects" prong. See 185 F. 3d, at 346-348.The court concluded that the disclaimer failed this prong because
"the primary effect of the disclaimer is to protect and maintain aparticular religious viewpoint, namely belief in the Biblical version of creation." Id., at 346. It based this conclusion on threefactors: "(1) the juxtaposition of the disavowal of endorsement of
evolution with an urging that students contemplate alternativetheories of the origin of life; (2) the reminder that students have
the right to maintain beliefs taught by their parents regardingthe origin of life; and (3) the `Biblical version of Creation' as the
only alternative theory explicitly referenced in the disclaimer."Ibid. (Finally, the court noted, albeit in passing and without
elaboration, that, because the disclaimer failed the second prongof the Lemon test, it would also fail the endorsement test. See
185 F. 3d, at 348.)

Petitioners unsuccessfully moved for rehearing by the paneland by the en banc Fifth Circuit. 201 F. 3d 602 (2000). Judge
Barksdale, joined by six other judges, dissented from the denialof rehearing en banc. See id., at 603-608.

II
Like a majority of the Members of this Court, I have previouslyexpressed my disapproval of the Lemon test. See Lamb's Chapel

v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 398-400 (1993) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); County of Allegheny, supra, at 655-657 (Kennedy, J., con-curring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Corporation
of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 346-349 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 107-113(1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). I would grant certiorari in
this case if only to take the opportunity to inter the Lemon testonce for all.

Even assuming, however, that the Fifth Circuit correctly choseto apply the Lemon test, I believe the manner of its application so erroneous as independently to merit the granting of certio-rari, if not summary reversal. Under the second prong of Lemon,
the "principal or primary effect [of a state action] must be onethat neither advances nor inhibits religion." Lemon, supra, at
612. Far from advancing religion, the "principal or primary ef-fect" of the disclaimer at issue here is merely to advance freedom
of thought. At the outset, it is worth noting that the theory ofevolution is the only theory actually taught in the Tangipahoa
Parish schools. As the introductory paragraph of the resolutionsuggests, the disclaimer operates merely as a (perhaps not too
believable) "disclaimer from endorsement" of that single theory,and not as an affirmative endorsement of any particular religious
theory as to the origin of life, or even of religious theories as tothe origin of life generally. The only allusion to religion in the
entire disclaimer is a reference to the "Biblical version of Cre-ation," mentioned as an illustrative example--surely the most
obvious example--of a "concept" that the teaching of evolutionwas "not intended to influence or dissuade." The disclaimer does
not refer again to the "Biblical version of Creation," much lessprovide any elaboration as to what that theory entails; instead, it
merely reaffirms that "it is the basic right and privilege of each

student to form his/her own opinion or maintain beliefs taughtby parents on this very important matter of the origin of life and
matter," and neutrally encourages students "closely [to] examineeach alternative" before forming an opinion.

As even this cursory discussion of the disclaimer amply demon-strates, the Fifth Circuit's conclusion that "[t]he disclaimer . . .
encourages students to read and meditate upon religion in generaland the `Biblical version of Creation' in particular," 185 F. 3d, at
346, lacks any support in the text of the invalidated document.In view of the fact that the disclaimer merely reminds students
of their right to form their own beliefs on the subject, or tomaintain beliefs taught by their parents--not to mention the fact
that the theory of evolution is the only theory actually taught inthe lesson that follows the disclaimer--there is "no realistic danger that the community would think that the [School Board] wasendorsing religion or any particular creed, and any benefit to
religion or to the Church would have been no more than inciden-tal." Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 395. At bottom, the disclaimer
constitutes nothing more than "simply a tolerable acknowledg-ment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country,"
Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, 792 (1983). See also Lynch v.Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 673 (1984) ("Nor does the Constitution
require complete separation of church and state; it affirmativelymandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions,
and forbids hostility toward any").In denying the petition for rehearing, the Fifth Circuit panel
took another tack: "In denying rehearing, we emphasize that wedo not decide that a state-mandated statement violates the Constitution simply because it disclaims any intent to communicateto students that the theory of evolution is the only accepted explanation of the origin of life, informs students of their right to followtheir religious principles, and encourages students to evaluate all
explanations of life's origins, including those taught outside theclassroom. We decide only that under the facts and circumstances of this case, the statement of the Tangipahoa ParishSchool Board is not sufficiently neutral to prevent it from violating the Establishment Clause." 201 F. 3d, at 603. Inasmuch aswhat the disclaimer contains is nothing more than what this statement purports to allow, the explanation is incoherent. Referenceto unnamed "facts and circumstances of this case" is not a substi530ORD Unit: $PT1 [10-22-01 15:04:33] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

tute for judicial reasoning. The only aspect of the disclaimer thatcould conceivably be regarded as going beyond what the rehearing statement purports to approve is the explicit mention--as anexample--of "the Biblical version of Creation." To think that
this reference to (and plainly not endorsement of) a reality ofreligious literature--and this use of an example that is not a
contrived one, but to the contrary the example most likely tocome into play--somehow converts the otherwise innocuous disclaimer into an establishment of religion is quite simply absurd.In Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 (1968), we invalidated a
statute that forbade the teaching of evolution in public schools; inEdwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578 (1987), we invalidated a statute that required the teaching of creationism whenever evolutionwas also taught; today we permit a Court of Appeals to push the
much beloved secular legend of the Monkey Trial one step further.We stand by in silence while a deeply divided Fifth Circuit bars
a school district from even suggesting to students that other theo-ries besides evolution--including, but not limited to, the Biblical
theory of creation--are worthy of their consideration. I dissent.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
When faced with an application of this kind, we are required

INS v. Legalization Assistance Project of Los Angeles County

in chambers); see also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S.
305, 322 (1982) (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("Unless Congress specifically commands a particular form of relief, the question of
remedy remains subject to a court's equitable discretion"). Because the applicant in this case has failed to demonstrate that
the denial of necessary medicine to seriously ill and dying patients will advance the public interest or that the failure to
enjoin the distribution of such medicine will impair the orderly
enforcement of federal criminal statutes, whereas respondents
have demonstrated that the entry of a stay will cause them
irreparable harm, I am persuaded that a fair assessment of
that balance favors a denial of the extraordinary relief that the
Government seeks. I respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, dissenting in No. 00-139.
I would note probable jurisdiction in this case. 15 U. S. C.$ 29(b). The case significantly affects an important sector of the

economy--a sector characterized by rapid technological change.Speed in reaching a final decision may help create legal certainty.
That certainty, in turn, may further the economic developmentof that sector so important to our Nation's prosperity.

I recognize that there are competing considerations. A Courtof Appeals proceeding would likely narrow, focus, and initially
decide the legal issues now presented here. It would therebyfacilitate any later deliberation in this Court. Nonetheless, I believe this Court can consider the issues fully now by taking addi-tional briefs and by granting additional time for oral argument,
if necessary. Consequently, I would hear the appeal.

Statement of Chief Justice Rehnquist.
Microsoft Corporation has retained the law firm of Goodwin,Procter & Hoar in Boston as local counsel in private antitrust

litigation. My son James C. Rehnquist is a partner in that firmand is one of the attorneys working on those cases. I have therefore considered at length whether his representation requires meto disqualify myself on the Microsoft matters currently before
this Court. I have reviewed the relevant legal authorities andconsulted with my colleagues. I have decided that I ought not to
disqualify myself from these cases.Title 28 U. S. C. $ 455 sets forth the legal criteria for disqualification of federal magistrates, judges, and Supreme Court Jus-tices. This statute is divided into two subsections, both of which
are relevant to the present situation. Section 455(b) lists specific

Statement of Rehnquist, C. J. 530 U. S.
instances in which disqualification is required, including thoseinstances where the child of a Justice "[i]s known . . . to have
an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcomeof the proceeding." $ 455(b)(5)(iii). As that provision has been
interpreted in relevant case law, there is no reasonable basis toconclude that the interests of my son or his law firm will be
substantially affected by the proceedings currently before theSupreme Court. It is my understanding that Microsoft has retained Goodwin, Procter & Hoar on an hourly basis at the firm'susual rates. Even assuming that my son's nonpecuniary interests are relevant under the statute, it would be unreasonableand speculative to conclude that the outcome of any Microsoft
proceeding in this Court would have an impact on those interestswhen neither he nor his firm would have done any work on
the matters here. Thus, I believe my continued participation isconsistent with $ 455(b)(5)(iii).

Section 455(a) contains the more general declaration that aJustice "shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his
impartiality might reasonably be questioned." As this Courthas stated, what matters under $ 455(a) "is not the reality of
bias or prejudice but its appearance." Liteky v. United States,510 U. S. 540, 548 (1994). This inquiry is an objective one, made
from the perspective of a reasonable observer who is informedof all the surrounding facts and circumstances. See ibid.; In re
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., 861 F. 2d 1307, 1309 (CA2 1988).I have already explained that my son's personal and financial
concerns will not be affected by our disposition of the SupremeCourt's Microsoft matters. Therefore, I do not believe that a
well-informed individual would conclude that an appearance ofimpropriety exists simply because my son represents, in another
case, a party that is also a party to litigation pending in thisCourt.

It is true that both my son's representation and the mattersbefore this Court relate to Microsoft's potential antitrust liability.
A decision by this Court as to Microsoft's antitrust liability couldhave a significant effect on Microsoft's exposure to antitrust suits
in other courts. But, by virtue of this Court's position atop theFederal Judiciary, the impact of many of our decisions is often
quite broad. The fact that our disposition of the pending Micro-soft litigation could potentially affect Microsoft's exposure to
antitrust liability in other litigation does not, to my mind, signifi530ORD Unit: $PT2 [10-22-01 15:15:39] PGT: ORDBV (Bound Volume)

cantly distinguish the present situation from other cases thatthis Court decides. Even our most unremarkable decision interpreting an obscure federal regulation might have a significantimpact on the clients of our children who practice law. Giving
such a broad sweep to $ 455(a) seems contrary to the "reasonableperson" standard which it embraces. I think that an objective
observer, informed of these facts, would not conclude that myparticipation in the pending Microsoft matters gives rise to an
appearance of partiality.Finally, it is important to note the negative impact that the
unnecessary disqualification of even one Justice may have uponour Court. Here--unlike the situation in a District Court or a
Court of Appeals--there is no way to replace a recused Justice.Not only is the Court deprived of the participation of one of its
nine Members, but the even number of those remaining createsa risk of affirmance of a lower court decision by an equally
divided court.

ABORTION. See Constitutional Law, IV; VI.
AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967.

Judgment as a matter of law--Prima facie case.--An employer is not
entitled to judgment as a matter of law when its employee's ADEA case
consists of a prima facie case of discrimination and sufficient evidence
for trier of fact to disbelieve employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for its action. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,
p. 133.

AGGRAVATED CRIMES. See Criminal Law, 2.
BANK ROBBERY. See Criminal Law, 1.
BANKRUPTCY.

1. Chapter 11--Administrative claimant--Secured property.--Title 11
U. S. C. $ 506(c) does not provide an administrative claimant of a bankruptcy estate an independent right to seek payment of its claim from property encumbered by a secured creditor's lien. Hartford Underwriters
Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., p. 1.

2. Chapter 7--Tax obligation--Burden of proof.--When substantive
law creating a tax obligation puts burden of proof on a taxpayer, bankruptcy does not alter that burden. Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue,
p. 15.

COMPULSORY SELF-INCRIMINATION. See Constitutional Law, V.
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Due Process.

1. Jury instructions--Capital sentencing--Parole ineligibility.--
Fourth Circuit's judgment--that petitioner was not entitled to a jury instruction on parole ineligibility at his capital sentencing trial because one
conviction did not count for purposes of Virginia's three-strikes law--is
affirmed. Ramdass v. Angelone, p. 156.

2. Penalty for crime--Increasing maximum prison term.--Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause requires that any fact that increases
penalty for a crime beyond prescribed statutory maximum, other than
fact of a prior conviction, must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond
a reasonable doubt. Apprendi v. New Jersey, p. 466.

3. Right to rear children--Nonparent visitation.--Washington Supreme Court's judgment that State's nonparental visitation statute violated respondent's due process right to rear her children is affirmed.
Troxel v. Granville, p. 57.

II. Establishment of Religion.

1. Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981.--Fifth Circuit judgment invalidating Chapter 2 of Act, a school aid program, as
a law respecting an establishment of religion is reversed. Mitchell v.
Helms, p. 793.

2. Student-led prayer--High school football games.--A Texas school
district's policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at high
school football games violates Establishment Clause. Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, p. 90.

III. Freedom of Association.

1. Political party--Blanket primary.--California's blanket primary violates a political party's First Amendment right of association. California
Democratic Party v. Jones, p. 567.

2. Public accommodations law--Boy Scouts.--New Jersey Supreme
Court's application of that State's public accommodations law to require
Boy Scouts to readmit an excluded homosexual Scout leader violates
Scouts' First Amendment right of expressive association. Boy Scouts of
America v. Dale, p. 640.

IV. Freedom of Speech.

Regulating speech near health care facilities.--A Colorado law regulating speech-related conduct within 100 feet of entrance to any health care
facility does not violate First Amendment. Hill v. Colorado, p. 703.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
V. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.

1. Miranda warnings.--Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and its
progeny continue to govern admissibility in state and federal courts of
statements made during custodial interrogation. Dickerson v. United
States, p. 428.

2. Subpoenaed documents--Use in subsequent investigation.--Respondent's indictment must be dismissed because Government cannot
prove that evidence it used in obtaining indictment and proposed to use
at trial was derived from legitimate sources wholly independent of testimonial aspect of respondent's immunized conduct in producing subpoenaed
documents. United States v. Hubbell, p. 7.

VI. Right to Abortion.

Partial birth abortion ban.--Nebraska's statute criminalizing performance of partial birth abortions violates Federal Constitution. Stenberg v.
Carhart, p. 914.

VII. Separation of Powers.

Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995--Automatic stays.--Congress
intended Act's automatic stay provision to preclude courts from exercising
their equitable powers to enjoin such stay, and provision does not violate
separation of powers principles. Miller v. French, p. 327.

VIII. Supremacy Clause.

Massachusetts' Burma sanctions--Pre-emption.--Where a Massachusetts law barring state entities from buying goods and services from companies doing business with Burma conflicts with a federal law imposing
sanctions on Burma, state law is pre-empted, and its application unconstitutional, under Supremacy Clause. Crosby v. National Foreign Trade
Council, p. 363.

CONTRACTS.

Oil leases--Restitution.--Petitioner oil companies are entitled to restitution of $156 million they paid to Federal Government in return for leases
to explore for and develop offshore oil, where a change in federal law
required Government to impose a delay that violated their contracts.
Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United States, p. 604.

CREDITORS AND DEBTORS. See Bankruptcy.
CRIMINAL LAW. See also Constitutional Law, I, 1, 2; V; VI.

offense in his bank robbery trial. Carter v. United States, p. 55.
