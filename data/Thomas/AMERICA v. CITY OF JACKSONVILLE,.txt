A Jacksonville, Florida, ordinance accords preferentialtreatment to certain minority-owned businesses in the awardof city contracts. In this case we decide whether, in orderto have standing to challenge the ordinance, an associationof contractors is required to show that one of its memberswould have received a contract absent the ordinance. Wehold that it is not.IAIn 1984, respondent Jacksonville enacted an ordinanceentitled "Minority Business Enterprise Participation," whichrequired that 10% of the amount spent on city contracts beset aside each fiscal year for so-called "Minority BusinessEnterprises" (MBE's). City of Jacksonville PurchasingCode $$ 126.604(a), 126.605(a) (1988). An MBE was definedas a business whose ownership was at least 51% "minority"or female, $ 126.603(a), and a "minority" was in turn definedas a person who is or considers himself to be black, Spanishspeaking, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, or handicapped,$ 126.603(b). Once projects were earmarked for MBEbidding by the city's chief purchasing officer, they were"deemed reserved for minority business enterprises only."$$ 126.604(c), 126.605(c).

Petitioner's members do business in Jacksonville,and most of them do not qualify as MBE's under the city'sordinance. On April 4, 1989, petitioner filed an action,pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, against the city and itsmayor (also a respondent here) in the United States DistrictCourt for the Middle District of Florida. Claiming thatJacksonville's ordinance violated the Equal ProtectionClause of the Fourteenth Amendment (both on its face andas applied), petitioner sought declaratory and injunctiverelief. In its complaint, petitioner alleged that many ofits members "regularly bid on and perform constructionwork for the City of Jacksonville," Complaint || 9, and thatthey "would have . . . bid on . . . designated set aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed" by the ordinance,id., || 46.On April 6, 1989, the District Court entered a temporaryrestraining order prohibiting the city from implementing theMBE ordinance, and, on April 20, it issued a preliminary injunction. Respondents appealed. Concluding that petitioner had not demonstrated irreparable injury, the Courtof Appeals reversed the issuance of the preliminary injunction, and remanded the case for an expedited disposition onthe merits. 896 F. 2d 1283 (CA11 1990). Chief JudgeTjoflat concurred in the judgment. In his view the suitshould have been dismissed for lack of standing, becausepetitioner's complaint did not "refer to any specific contractor subcontract that would have been awarded to a nonminority bidder but for the set-aside ordinance." Id., at1287.508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT660 NORTHEASTERN FLA. CHAPTER, ASSOCIATED GEN.CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLEOpinion of the CourtIn the meantime, both petitioner and respondents hadmoved for summary judgment.1 On May 31, 1990, the District Court entered summary judgment for petitioner, concluding that the MBE ordinance was inconsistent with theequal protection criteria established by this Court in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989). Once againrespondents appealed, and once again they obtained a favorable ruling. 951 F. 2d 1217 (1992). Rather than addressingthe merits of petitioner's equal protection claim, the Courtof Appeals held that petitioner "lacks standing to challengethe ordinance establishing the set-aside program," id., at1218, because it "has not demonstrated that, but for the program, any AGC member would have bid successfully for anyof these contracts," id., at 1219. The Court of Appeals accordingly vacated the District Court's judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss petitioner'scomplaint without prejudice.Because the Eleventh Circuit's decision conflicts with decisions of the District of Columbia Circuit and the NinthCircuit, see O'Donnell Constr. Co. v. District of Columbia,295 U. S. App. D. C. 317, 320, 963 F. 2d 420, 423 (1992);Coral Constr. Co. v. King County, 941 F. 2d 910, 930 (CA91991), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1033 (1992), we granted certiorari. 506 U. S. 813 (1992).BOn October 27, 1992, 22 days after our grant of certiorari,the city repealed its MBE ordinance and replaced it with anordinance entitled "African-American and Women's BusinessEnterprise Participation," which became effective the nextday. This ordinance differs from the repealed ordinance inthree principal respects. First, unlike the prior ordinance,1 In their motion for summary judgment, respondents claimed only thatthey were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the merits; they didnot challenge petitioner's standing. See 2 Record, Exh. 33.508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT661Cite as: 508 U.

Jacksonville Purchasing Code $ 126.601(b) (1992).Second, rather than a 10% "set aside," the new ordinancehas established "participation goals" ranging from 5 to 16%,depending upon the type of contract, the ownership of thecontractor, and the fiscal year in which the contract isawarded. $ 126.604. Third, the new ordinance provides notone but five alternative methods for achieving the "participa-tion goals." $$ 126.605, 126.618. Which of these methodsthe city will use is decided on a "project by project basis,"$ 126.605, but one of them, the "Sheltered Market Plan," is(apart from the percentages) virtually identical to the priorordinance's "set aside." Under this plan, certain contractsare reserved "for the exclusive competition" of certifiedblack- and female-owned businesses. $ 126.605(b).2Claiming that there was no longer a live controversy withrespect to the constitutionality of the repealed ordinance,respondents filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot onNovember 18, 1992. We denied that motion on December14. 506 U. S. 1031 (1992). IIIn their brief on the merits, respondents reassert theirclaim that the repeal of the challenged ordinance renders thecase moot. We decline to disturb our earlier ruling, how-ever; now, as then, the mootness question is controlled by2 The four other methods are (1) a "Participation Percentage Plan,"under which contractors are required to subcontract with black- or femaleowned businesses, $$ 126.605(a), 126.612; (2) a "Direct Negotiation Plan,"pursuant to which the city engages in "direct negotiations" with black- orfemale-owned businesses, $ 126.605(c); (3) a "Bid Preference Plan," whichprovides for the award of a contract to the black- or female-owned business whose bid is within a certain percentage or dollar amount of thelowest bid, $ 126.605(d); and (4) an "Impact Plan," under which "point values" are awarded to black- and female-owned businesses and to businessesthat use black- or female-owned subcontractors or suppliers or have aspecified employment program for black and female employees, $ 126.618.508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT662 NORTHEASTERN FLA. CHAPTER, ASSOCIATED GEN.CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLEOpinion of the CourtCity of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283(1982), where we applied the "well settled" rule that "a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice doesnot deprive a federal court of its power to determine thelegality of the practice." Id., at 289. Although the chal-lenged statutory language at issue inCity of Mesquite hadbeen eliminated while the case was pending in the Court ofAppeals, we held that the case was not moot, because thedefendant's "repeal of the objectionable language would notpreclude it from reenacting precisely the same provision ifthe District Court's judgment were vacated." Ibid.This is an a fortiori case. There is no mere risk that Jack-sonville will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct; it has already done so. Nor does it matter that the new ordinancediffers in certain respects from the old one.City of Mes-quite does not stand for the proposition that it is only thepossibility that the selfsame statute will be enacted that pre-vents a case from being moot; if that were the rule, a defendant could moot a case by repealing the challenged statuteand replacing it with one that differs only in some insignificant respect. The gravamen of petitioner's complaint is thatits members are disadvantaged in their efforts to obtain citycontracts. The new ordinance may disadvantage them to alesser degree than the old one, but insofar as it accords preferential treatment to black- and female-owned contractors--and, in particular, insofar as its "Sheltered Market Plan" isa "set aside" by another name--it disadvantages them in thesame fundamental way.33 At bottom, the dissent differs with us only over the question whetherthe new ordinance is sufficiently similar to the repealed ordinance that itis permissible to say that the challenged conduct continues--or, as thedissent puts it, whether the ordinance has been "sufficiently altered so asto present a substantially different controversy from the one the DistrictCourt originally decided." Post, at 671. We believe that the ordinance hasnot been "sufficiently altered"; the dissent disagrees. As for the meritsof that disagreement, the short answer to the dissent's argument that thiscase is controlled by Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami,508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT663Cite as: 508 U. S. 656 (1993)Opinion of the CourtWe hold that the case is not moot, and we now turn to thequestion on which we granted certiorari: whether petitionerhas standing to challenge Jacksonville's ordinance.IIIThe doctrine of standing is "an essential and unchangingpart of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III,"Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992),which itself "defines with respect to the Judicial Branch theidea of separation of powers on which the Federal Govern-ment is founded," Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750 (1984).It has been established by a long line of cases that a partyseeking to invoke a federal court's jurisdiction must demonstrate three things: (1) "injury in fact," by which we meanan invasion of a legally protected interest that is "(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not con-jectural or hypothetical,"Lujan, supra, at 560 (citations,footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted); (2) a causalrelationship between the injury and the challenged conduct,by which we mean that the injury "fairly can be traced tothe challenged action of the defendant," and has not resulted"from the independent action of some third party not beforethe court," Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976); and (3) a likelihoodthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision, bywhich we mean that the "prospect of obtaining relief fromInc., 404 U. S. 412 (1972) (per curiam), and Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U. S.379 (1975)--both of which predate City of Mesquite--is that the statutesat issue in those cases were changed substantially, and that there wastherefore no basis for concluding that the challenged conduct was beingrepeated. See Diffenderfer, supra, at 413-414 ("crux of [the] complaint"was that old statute violated Constitution insofar as it authorized tax exemption "for church property used primarily for commercial purposes";new statute authorized exemption "only if the property is used predominantly for religious purposes"); Fusari, 419 U. S., at 380 (challenged statute was "significantly revised"); id., at 385 (legislature enacted "majorrevisions" of statute).508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT664 NORTHEASTERN FLA. CHAPTER, ASSOCIATED GEN.CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLEOpinion of the Courtthe injury as a result of a favorable ruling" is not "too specu-lative," Allen v. Wright, supra, at 752. These elements arethe "irreducible minimum," Valley Forge Christian Collegev. Americans United for Separation of Church and State,Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982), required by the Constitution.The Court of Appeals held that petitioner could not establish standing because it failed to allege that one or more ofits members would have been awarded a contract but forthe challenged ordinance. Under these circumstances, theCourt of Appeals concluded, there is no "injury." 951 F. 2d,at 1219-1220. This holding cannot be reconciled with ourprecedents.AIn Turner v. Fouche, 396 U. S. 346 (1970), a Georgia lawlimiting school board membership to property owners waschallenged on equal protection grounds. We held that aplaintiff who did not own property had standing to challengethe law, id., at 361, n. 23, and although we did not say soexplicitly, our holding did not depend upon an allegation thathe would have been appointed to the board but for the prop-erty requirement. All that was necessary was that theplaintiff wished to be considered for the position. Accord,Quinn v. Millsap, 491 U. S. 95, 103 (1989) (plaintiffs who donot own real property have standing to challenge propertyrequirement for membership on "board of freeholders").We confronted a similar issue inClements v. Fashing, 457U. S. 957 (1982). There, a number of officeholders claimedthat their equal protection rights were violated by the "auto-matic resignation" provision of the Texas Constitution, whichrequires the immediate resignation of some (but not all)state officeholders upon their announcement of a candidacyfor another office. Noting that the plaintiffs had allegedthat they would have announced their candidacy were it notfor the consequences of doing so, we rejected the claim thatthe dispute was "merely hypothetical," and that the allegations were insufficient to create an "actual case or contro508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT665Cite as: 508 U. S. 656 (1993)Opinion of the Courtversy." Id., at 962. Citing Turner v. Fouche, we emphasized that the plaintiffs' injury was the "obstacle to [their]candidacy," 457 U. S., at 962 (emphasis added); we did notrequire any allegation that the plaintiffs would actually havebeen elected but for the prohibition.The decision that is most closely analogous to this case,however, is Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265(1978), where a twice-rejected white male applicant claimedthat a medical school's admissions program, which reserved16 of the 100 places in the entering class for minority applicants, was inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause.Addressing the argument that the applicant lacked standingto challenge the program, Justice Powell concluded that the"constitutional requirements of Art. III" had been satisfied,because the requisite "injury" was the medical school's "decision not to permit Bakke to compete for all 100 places in theclass, simply because of his race." Id., at 281, n. 14 (emphasis added) (principal opinion). Thus, "even if Bakke hadbeen unable to prove that he would have been admitted inthe absence of the special program, it would not follow thathe lacked standing." Id., at 280-281, n. 14 (emphasis added).This portion of Justice Powell's opinion was joined by fourother Justices. See id., at 272.44 Although Bakke came to us from state court, our decision in ASARCOInc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605 (1989), does not retroactively render Bakke'sdiscussion of standing dictum. See Brief for Public Citizen et al. as AmiciCuriae 7, n. 4 (suggesting that it might). In ASARCO we held that wehad jurisdiction to review the judgment of a state court even though therespondents (plaintiffs in the trial court) "had no standing to sue underthe principles governing the federal courts," 490 U. S., at 623, becausethe petitioners (defendants in the trial court) "allege[d] a specific injurystemming from the state-court decree," id., at 617. But we did not holdthat it was irrelevant whether the state-court plaintiffs met federal standing requirements; instead we made it clear that a determination that theplaintiffs satisfied those requirements would have "obviated any furtherinquiry." Id., at 623, n. 2. Thus, while Bakke's standing was not a necessary condition for our exercise of jurisdiction, it was sufficient.508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT666 NORTHEASTERN FLA. CHAPTER, ASSOCIATED GEN.CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLEOpinion of the CourtSingly and collectively, these cases stand for the followingproposition: When the government erects a barrier thatmakes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain abenefit than it is for members of another group, a member ofthe former group seeking to challenge the barrier need notallege that he would have obtained the benefit but for thebarrier in order to establish standing. The "injury in fact"in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial ofequal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier,not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. See,e. g.,Turner v. Fouche, supra, at 362 ("We may assume that the[plaintiffs] have no right to be appointed to the . . . board ofeducation. But [they] do have a federal constitutional rightto be considered for public service without the burden ofinvidiously discriminatory disqualifications") (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). And in the context of a challenge toa set-aside program, the "injury in fact" is the inability tocompete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not theloss of a contract. SeeCroson, 488 U. S., at 493 (principalopinion ofO'Connor, J.) ("The [set-aside program] deniescertain citizens the opportunity to compete for a fixed percentage of public contracts based solely upon their race")(emphasis added). To establish standing, therefore, a partychallenging a set-aside program like Jacksonville's need onlydemonstrate that it is able and ready to bid on contracts andthat a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on anequal basis.5BIn urging affirmance, respondents rely primarily uponWarth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975). There the plaintiffsclaimed that a town's zoning ordinance, both by its terms andas enforced, violated the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as5 It follows from our definition of "injury in fact" that petitioner hassufficiently alleged both that the city's ordinance is the "cause" of its injuryand that a judicial decree directing the city to discontinue its programwould "redress" the injury.508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT667Cite as: 508 U. S. 656 (1993)Opinion of the Courtit had the effect of preventing people of low and moderateincome from living in the town. Seeking to intervene in thesuit, an association of construction firms alleged that the zon-ing restrictions had deprived some of its members of business opportunities and profits. We held that the associationlacked standing, and we provided the following explanationfor our holding:"The complaint refers to no specific project of any of [theassociation's] members that is currently precluded eitherby the ordinance or by respondents' action in enforcingit. There is no averment that any member has appliedto respondents for a building permit or a variance withrespect to any current project. Indeed, there is no indication that respondents have delayed or thwarted anyproject currently proposed by [the association's] members, or that any of its members has taken advantage ofthe remedial processes available under the ordinance.In short, insofar as the complaint seeks prospective relief, [the association] has failed to show the existence ofany injury to its members of sufficient immediacy andripeness to warrant judicial intervention." Id., at 516.We think Warth is distinguishable. Unlike the other casesthat we have discussed,Warth did not involve an allegationthat some discriminatory classification prevented the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing in its quest for abenefit. InTurner v. Fouche, Quinn v. Millsap, and Clements v. Fashing, the plaintiffs complained that they could notbe considered for public office. And in bothBakke and thiscase, the allegation was that the plaintiff (or the plaintiff 'smembership) was excluded from consideration for a certainportion of benefits--in Bakke, places in a medical schoolclass; here, municipal contracts. In Warth, by contrast,there was no claim that the construction association's members could not apply for variances and building permits onthe same basis as other firms; what the association objected508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT668 NORTHEASTERN FLA. CHAPTER, ASSOCIATED GEN.CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLEOpinion of the Courtto were the "refusals by the town officials to grant variancesand permits." 422 U. S., at 515 (emphasis added). See alsoid., at 530 (Brennan, J., dissenting) ("[T]he claim is that re-spondents will not approve any project") (emphasis deleted).The firms' complaint, in other words, was not that they couldnot compete equally; it was that they did not win. Thus,while there is undoubtedly some tension between Warth andthe aforementioned line of cases, this case is governed bythe latter.In any event, the tension is minimal. Even assuming thatthe alleged injury in Warth was an inability to compete forvariances and permits on an equal basis, and thatWarth, too,is analogous to this case, it is distinguishable nonetheless.Unlike petitioner, which alleged that its members regularlybid on contracts in Jacksonville and would bid on those thatthe city's ordinance makes unavailable to them, the construc-tion association inWarth did not allege that "any memberha[d] applied . . . for a building permit or a variance withrespect to any current project." Id., at 516. Thus, unlikethe association inWarth, petitioner has alleged an "injury . . .of sufficient immediacy . . . to warrant judicial intervention."Ibid. Furthermore, we did not hold in Warth, as the Courtof Appeals--mutatis mutandis--did here, that the association was required to allege that but for a discriminatory pol-icy, variances or permits would have been awarded to itsmembers. An allegation that a "specific project" was "pre-cluded" by the existence or administration of the zoning ordinance, ibid., would certainly have been sufficient to establishstanding, but there is no suggestion inWarth that it wasnecessary.IVIn its complaint, petitioner alleged that its members regu-larly bid on construction contracts in Jacksonville, and thatthey would have bid on contracts set aside pursuant to thecity's ordinance were they so able.

S. 656 (1993)O'Connor, J., dissentinga motion for summary judgment, for example), we mustassume that they are true. See Lucas v. South CarolinaCoastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1012-1013, n. 3 (1992); Pen-nell v. San Jose, 485 U. S. 1, 7 (1988). Given that assumption, and given the legal standard we have reaffirmed today,it was inappropriate for the Court of Appeals to order thatpetitioner's complaint be dismissed for lack of standing.6The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
