The qui tam provision of the False Claims Act (FCA orAct), 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b), permits, in certain circumstances,suits by private parties on behalf of the United Statesagainst anyone submitting a false claim to the Government.Prior to 1986, such suits were barred if the information onwhich they were based was already in the Government's possession. At issue in this case is whether a 1986 amendmentto the FCA partially removing that bar applies retroactivelyto qui tam suits regarding allegedly false claims submittedprior to its enactment and, if so, whether this particular action meets the requirements of the amended Act.

SCHUMEROpinion of the Courtthat the 1986 amendment does not apply to this action andtherefore that this action should have been dismissed, asrequired by the 1982 version of the Act.IIn December 1981, the Northrop Corporation awardedpetitioner Hughes Aircraft Company a subcontract to designand develop a radar system for the B-2 bomber, which Nor-throp was then constructing under contract with the AirForce. Both Northrop's subcontract with Hughes and theAir Force's contract with Northrop were "cost-plus" contracts, which provided that the subcontractor and the con-tractor, respectively, were to be reimbursed for all costsproperly incurred plus a reasonable profit. Several monthsafter Hughes was awarded the B-2 subcontract, theMcDonnell-Douglas Corporation awarded Hughes a "fixed-price" subcontract to design and develop an upgraded radarsystem for the F-15 fighter aircraft, which McDonnell-Douglas was then building for the Air Force. (Under thefixed-price contract, Hughes was to receive a set price, re-gardless of costs.) When it became apparent to Hughes thatthe projects overlapped in significant respects, Hughesadopted two internal "commonality agreements" allocatingbetween its F-15 and B-2 divisions various costs that werecommon to the two projects.After costs in the B-2 program escalated, Northrop re-quested a Government audit of Hughes' accounting practicesto ascertain whether Hughes had improperly shifted costsfrom the fixed-price F-15 subcontract to the cost-plus B-2subcontract. The Air Force initially concluded, in a June1986 preliminary classified audit report, that Hughes had improperly billed the B-2 program for certain developmentcosts that should have been charged solely to the F-15 program. Between October 1986 and September 1988, the De-fense Contract Audit Agency prepared a series of unclassified audit reports similarly concluding that Hughes had520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:07 PAGES OPINPGT943Cite as: 520 U. S. 939 (1997)Opinion of the Courtmisallocated costs between the two programs, and also con-cluding that Hughes had not adequately disclosed the company's commonality accounting practices in a Cost Account-ing Standards report it had submitted to the Governmentin 1984. Based on those audits, the Government directedNorthrop to withhold $15.4 million in B-2 contract paymentsfrom Hughes.1On January 20, 1989, respondent William J. Schumer, formerly the Division Contracts Manager for Hughes' B-2 Divi-sion, commenced this action against Hughes pursuant to 31U. S. C. $ 3730(b), the qui tam provision of the FCA that au-thorizes private individuals, "relators," to bring claims onbehalf of the United States against any person who know-ingly presented false or fraudulent claims to the UnitedStates in violation of $ 3729. Schumer's complaint allegedthat Hughes knowingly mischarged Northrop--and throughit the United States--for certain radar development coststhat should have been allocated to the fixed-price F-15 subcontract with McDonnell-Douglas instead of to the cost-plusB-2 subcontract with Northrop. App. 72-80. Schumer'samended complaint alleged that Hughes' accounting prac-tices resulted in a $50 million net overcharge, and soughttreble damages in the amount of $150 million. Id., at 102.2Hughes moved to dismiss Schumer's action, contendingthat the 1986 FCA amendment was not retroactive and that1 The Government ultimately reversed its preliminary determination,concluding that the commonality agreements had actually benefited theGovernment by charging costs to the fixed-price F-15 program that otherwise would have been borne solely by the cost-plus B-2 program. Accordingly, the Government withdrew its earlier finding of noncompliance,determined that any noncompliance with accounting disclosure requirements was immaterial, and directed that Hughes be paid the $15.4 millionpreviously withheld on the B-2 project. App. 136-137; App. to Pet. forCert. 68a.2 The Government chose not to intervene in the action, as it was entitledto do under 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(2), nor did it move to dismiss the action,as it was likewise entitled to do, see $ 3730(c)(2)(A).520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:07 PAGES OPINPGT944 HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v. UNITED STATESex rel. SCHUMEROpinion of the Courtthe qui tam provision in effect when Hughes engaged in itsallegedly wrongful conduct precluded qui tam suits based oninformation already possessed by the Government. See 31U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(4) (1982 ed.). Hughes argued in the alternative that the suit was barred even under the 1986 versionof the Act because it was "based upon the public disclosureof allegations . . . in a[n] . . . administrative . . . audit," withinthe meaning of 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(e)(4)(A).3 The DistrictCourt denied Hughes' motion.Hughes then moved for summary judgment on the merits,contending that it had fully disclosed the basis of its costaccounting system to all of its customers and had compliedwith all applicable contractual and regulatory requirementsrelating to cost allocation. After full briefing, the DistrictCourt concluded that Hughes had allocated some costs be-tween the F-15 and B-2 programs consistent with disclosures Hughes made to Northrop, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a,had allocated other costs to the fixed-price F-15 contractthat could have been charged to the cost-plus B-2 contractalone (thereby benefiting the Government), id., at 50a, andhad properly disclosed the contents of the commonalityagreements to Northrop and the Air Force,id., at 46a-48a,56a. Accordingly, the District Court held that "Schumer hasnot shown that Hughes violated the False Claims Act." Id.,at 64a.Schumer appealed from the grant of summary judgmentagainst him, and Hughes cross-appealed from the denial ofits motion to dismiss. The Ninth Circuit rejected Hughes'cross-appeal, holding that the 1986 amendment removingcertain defenses to qui tam suits should be applied retroac-tively to suits based on pre-1986 conduct because the amendment involved only the "subject matter jurisdiction" of3 Hughes also raised several constitutional challenges to the qui tamprovisions of the Act that are not presently before us. See 519 U. S. 926(1996) (limiting grant of certiorari to the nonconstitutional questions presented by the petition).520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:07 PAGES OPINPGT945Cite as: 520 U. S. 939 (1997)Opinion of the Courtcourts to hear qui tam claims and did not affect the substantive liability of qui tam defendants. 63 F. 3d 1512, 1517(1995). The court further determined that the action wasnot barred under the 1986 version of the Act because no"public disclosure" of information possessed by the Government had been made. Id., at 1518. Finally, the court reversed in part and remanded for further consideration on themerits, holding that a material factual dispute existed as towhether Hughes had made misleading and incomplete disclosures about its commonality agreements, whether or not theallegedly incomplete disclosures resulted in any harm to thepublic fisc. Id., at 1522-1525.We granted the petition for certiorari to consider whetherthe 1986 amendment is applicable to pre-1986 conduct and, ifso, whether the Government's release of its audits to Hughesemployees constituted a public disclosure bar under the 1986amendment and whether harm to the public fisc is an essential element of a qui tam action under the amended Act. 519U. S. 926 (1996). Because we conclude that the lower courtsshould not have applied the 1986 amendment and thereforethat this action should have been dismissed, we express noopinion as to the Ninth Circuit's "public disclosure" and "public fisc" holdings, or as to the merits of respondent's factualcontentions.IIThe allegedly false claims at issue in this case were submitted by Hughes between 1982 and 1984. At that time, theFCA required a district court to "dismiss [a qui tam] action. . . based on evidence or information the Government hadwhen the action was brought." 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(4) (1982ed.). The Ninth Circuit accepted, and respondent does notdispute, that because "the government was aware of [respondent's] allegations before he filed his suit, the [1982provision] would bar his claim," were it applicable. 63 F.3d, at 1517.520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:07 PAGES OPINPGT946 HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v. UNITED STATESex rel. SCHUMEROpinion of the CourtCongress amended the FCA in 1986, however, to permitqui tam suits based on information in the Government's possession, except where the suit was based on information thathad been publicly disclosed and was not brought by an original source of the information. See 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(e)(4)(A). Because the 1986 amendment became effective beforethis suit was commenced, respondent contends that it, ratherthan the 1982qui tam provision, controls. We disagree.We have frequently noted, and just recently reaffirmed,that there is a "presumption against retroactive legislation[that] is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence." Landgraf v.USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265 (1994). "The `princi-ple that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct tookplace has timeless and universal appeal.' "Ibid. (quotingKaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S.827, 855 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring)). Accordingly, weapply this time-honored presumption unless Congress hasclearly manifested its intent to the contrary. 511 U. S., at268.Nothing in the 1986 amendment evidences a clear intentby Congress that it be applied retroactively, and no onesuggests otherwise. Thus, under the analysis the Courtadopted inLandgraf, if the 1986 amendment has a retroac-tive effect, then we presume it will not apply to the conductalleged in this case, which occurred prior to its effectivedate.4Respondent argues that the 1986 amendment has no retro-active effect because it does not fit within Justice Story's"influential definition" of impermissibly retroactive legisla-tion, which we quoted with approval in Landgraf:4 Because both the allegedly false claim submission and the disclosure tothe Government of information about that submission occurred prior tothe effective date of the 1986 amendments, we need not address whichof these two events constitutes the relevant conduct for purposes of ourretroactivity analysis.520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:07 PAGES OPINPGT947Cite as: 520 U. S. 939 (1997)Opinion of the Court" `[E]very statute, which takes away or impairs vestedrights acquired under existing laws, or creates a newobligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new dis-ability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective.' " 511 U. S.,at 269 (quotingSociety for Propagation of the Gospel v.Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814)(Story, J.)).To the extent respondent contends that only statutes withone of these effects are subject to our presumption againstretroactivity, he simply misreads our opinion in Landgraf.The language upon which he relies does not purport to definethe outer limit of impermissible retroactivity. Rather, ouropinion inLandgraf, like that of Justice Story, merely de-scribed that any such effect constituted a sufficient, ratherthan a necessary, condition for invoking the presumptionagainst retroactivity. Indeed, we recognized that the Courthas used various formulations to describe the "functionalconceptio[n] of legislative `retroactivity,' " and made no suggestion that Justice Story's formulation was the exclusivedefinition of presumptively impermissible retroactive legislation. 511 U. S., at 269.In any event, even applying Justice Story's formulation,we reject respondent's contention that the 1986 amendmentlacks retroactive effect. Respondent first argues that the1986 amendment does not " `impose new duties with respectto transactions already completed' " because, since 1863, "theFCA has made it unlawful to knowingly submit a false claimfor payment to the United States." Brief for Respondent15 (quoting Landgraf, supra, at 280). The same argumentwas made, and rejected, inLandgraf. There, we noted thatthe provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 authorizing compensatory damages "does not make unlawful conduct thatwas lawful when it occurred," but we "[n]onetheless" heldthat "the new compensatory damages provision would oper-ate `retrospectively' if it were applied to conduct occurring520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:07 PAGES OPINPGT948 HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v.

S. 298, 303 (1994)(holding that an increase in monetary liability could not beapplied retroactively even though the "normative scope ofTitle VII's prohibition on workplace discrimination" wasnot altered).Respondent next contends that "the 1986 Amendments tothe qui tam bar do not create a new cause of action wherethere was none before, change the substance of the extantcause of action, or alter a defendant's exposure for a falseclaim by even a single penny [and] thus d[o] not `increase aparty's liability for past conduct.' " Brief for Respondent 15(quoting Landgraf, supra, at 280). See also Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 13-14. Again, respondent is mistaken. While we acknowledge that the monetary liabilityfaced by an FCA defendant is the same whether the actionis brought by the Government or by a qui tam relator, the1986 amendment eliminates a defense to a qui tam suit--prior disclosure to the Government--and therefore changesthe substance of the existing cause of action for qui tamdefendants by " `attach[ing] a new disability, in respect totransactions or considerations already past.' " Landgraf,supra, at 269 (quoting Wheeler, supra, at 767); see also Brieffor United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 6 ("[P]roof thatthe government had the information when suit was broughtwas . . . a jurisdictional defense to an action brought by aqui tam relator" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 49 (1990) ("A law that abolishes an affirmative defense" violates the Ex Post FactoClause); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167, 169-170 (1925) ("[A]nystatute . . . which deprives one charged with crime of anydefense available according to law at the time when the actwas committed, is prohibited as ex post facto").Nor is it the case that the 1986 amendment does not "create a new cause of action." As respondent himself recognizes, "as a result of the 1986 Amendments, the federal520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:08 PAGES OPINPGT949Cite as: 520 U. S. 939 (1997)Opinion of the Courtcourts are open to an FCA action brought by a private rela-tor on behalf of the United States," whereas "[p]rior to 1986,once the United States learned of a false claim, only the Gov-ernment could assert its rights under the FCA against thefalse claimant." Brief for Respondent 16; see also Brief forUnited States asAmicus Curiae 14 (recognizing that the1986 amendment "expanded the circumstances under whichqui tam relators may pursue actions to enforce" a falseclaimant's liability to the Government).The extension of an FCA cause of action to private partiesin circumstances where the action was previously foreclosedis not insignificant. As a class of plaintiffs, qui tam relatorsare different in kind than the Government. They are motivated primarily by prospects of monetary reward ratherthan the public good. As we have previously recognized:" `[Qui tam statutes are] passed upon the theory, basedon experience as old as modern civilization, that one ofthe least expensive and most effective means of prevent-ing frauds on the Treasury is to make the perpetratorsof them liable to actions by private persons acting, if youplease, under the strong stimulus of personal ill will orthe hope of gain. Prosecutions conducted by suchmeans compare with the ordinary methods as the enterprising privateer does to the slow-going public vessel.' "United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 541,n. 5 (1943) (quoting United States v. Griswold, 24 F. 361,366 (Ore. 1885)).Qui tam relators are thus less likely than is the Governmentto forgo an action arguably based on a mere technical noncompliance with reporting requirements that involved noharm to the public fisc.55 That a qui tam suit is brought by a private party "on behalf of theUnited States," see Brief for Respondent 17, does not alter the fact thata relator's interests and the Government's do not necessarily coincide.Moreover, as the statute specifies, qui tam actions are brought both520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:08 PAGES OPINPGT950 HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v. UNITED STATESex rel. SCHUMEROpinion of the CourtIn permitting actions by an expanded universe of plaintiffswith different incentives, the 1986 amendment essentiallycreates a new cause of action, not just an increased likelihoodthat an existing cause of action will be pursued. See, e. g.,Winfree v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 227 U. S. 296, 302 (1913).Prior to the 1986 amendment, respondent'squi tam actionwas completely barred because of Hughes' disclosure to theGovernment of information about its claim submissions.The 1986 amendment would revive that action, subjectingHughes to previously foreclosed qui tam litigation, much likeextending a statute of limitations after the pre-existing period of limitations has expired impermissibly revives a mori-bund cause of action, see,e. g., Chenault v. U. S. Postal Serv-ice, 37 F. 3d 535, 537, 539 (CA9 1994) (relying on Landgrafin concluding that "a newly enacted statute that lengthensthe applicable statute of limitations may not be applied retroactively to revive a plaintiff 's claim that was otherwisebarred under the old statutory scheme because to do sowould alter the substantive rights of a party and increase aparty's liability" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thisis true even if a cause of action remained open to some otherparty. It is simply not the case that, as respondent asserts,the elimination of a prior defense to qui tam actions doesnot "create a new cause of action" or "change the substanceof the extant cause of action."Finally, respondent contends that the 1986 amendment isjurisdictional, and hence that it is an exception to the generalLandgraf presumption against retroactivity. Indeed, theNinth Circuit went further, holding that, absent a clearstatement of congressional intent, there is a strong presumption in favor of retroactivity for jurisdictional statutes. 63F. 3d, at 1517. The Ninth Circuit simply misread our decision in Landgraf, for the only "presumption" mentioned inthat opinion is a general presumptionagainst retroactivity."for the person and for the United States Government." 31 U. S. C.$ 3730(b)(1) (emphasis added).520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:08 PAGES OPINPGT951Cite as: 520 U. S. 939 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe fact that courts often apply newly enacted jurisdiction-allocating statutes to pending cases merely evidences certainlimited circumstances failing to meet the conditions for ourgenerally applicable presumption against retroactivity, notan exception to the rule itself, as the United States recog-nizes. See Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 15,and n. 8. As we stated in Landgraf:"Application of a new jurisdictional rule usually `takesaway no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.' Present law normally gov-erns in such situations because jurisdictional statutes`speak to the power of the court rather than to the rightsor obligations of the parties.' " 511 U. S., at 274 (emphasis added; citations omitted).Statutes merely addressing which court shall have jurisdic-tion to entertain a particular cause of action can fairly besaid merely to regulate the secondary conduct of litigationand not the underlying primary conduct of the parties. Cf.id., at 275; id., at 291 (Scalia, J., concurring). Such statutesaffect only where a suit may be brought, not whether it maybe brought at all. The 1986 amendment, however, does notmerely allocate jurisdiction among forums. Rather, it creates jurisdiction where none previously existed; it thusspeaks not just to the power of a particular court but to thesubstantive rights of the parties as well. Such a statute,even though phrased in "jurisdictional" terms, is as muchsubject to our presumption against retroactivity as anyother.IIIIn sum, whether we consider the relevant conduct to beHughes' disclosure to the Government or its submission ofthe allegedly false claim, disclosure of information about theclaim to the Government constituted a full defense to a quitam action prior to 1986. If applied in this case, the legaleffect of the 1986 amendment would be to deprive Hughes of520us3$71N 08-19-98 18:13:08 PAGES OPINPGT952 HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v. UNITED STATESex rel. SCHUMEROpinion of the Courtthat defense. Given the absence of a clear statutory expres-sion of congressional intent to apply the 1986 amendment toconduct completed before its enactment, we apply our pre-sumption against retroactivity and hold that, under the relevant 1982 version of the FCA, the District Court was obligedto dismiss this action because it was "based on evidence orinformation the Government had when the action wasbrought." 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(4) (1982 ed.). We thereforevacate the judgment below, and remand the case for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.
