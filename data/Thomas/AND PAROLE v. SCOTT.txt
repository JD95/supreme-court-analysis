This case presents the question whether the exclusionaryrule, which generally prohibits the introduction at criminaltrial of evidence obtained in violation of a defendant's FourthAmendment rights, applies in parole revocation hearings.We hold that it does not.

SCOTTOpinion of the Courtterm of 10 to 20 years, beginning on March 31, 1983. OnSeptember 1, 1993, just months after completing the minimum sentence, respondent was released on parole. One ofthe conditions of respondent's parole was that he would refrain from "owning or possessing any firearms or other weapons." App. 5a. The parole agreement, which respondentsigned, further provided:"I expressly consent to the search of my person, property and residence, without a warrant by agents of thePennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole. Anyitems, in [sic] the possession of which constitutes a violation of parole/reparole shall be subject to seizure, andmay be used as evidence in the parole revocation process." Id., at 7a.About five months later, after obtaining an arrest warrantbased on evidence that respondent had violated several con-ditions of his parole by possessing firearms, consuming alcohol, and assaulting a co-worker, three parole officers arrestedrespondent at a local diner. Before being transferred to acorrectional facility, respondent gave the officers the keysto his residence. The officers entered the home, which wasowned by his mother, but did not perform a search for paroleviolations until respondent's mother arrived. The officersneither requested nor obtained consent to perform thesearch, but respondent's mother did direct them to his bed-room. After finding no relevant evidence there, the officerssearched an adjacent sitting room in which they found fivefirearms, a compound bow, and three arrows.At his parole violation hearing, respondent objected to theintroduction of the evidence obtained during the search ofhis home on the ground that the search was unreasonableunder the Fourth Amendment. The hearing examiner, however, rejected the challenge and admitted the evidence. Asa result, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parolefound sufficient evidence in the record to support the weap524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN361Cite as: 524 U. S. 357 (1998)Opinion of the Courtons and alcohol charges and recommitted respondent toserve 36 months' backtime.The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reversed andremanded, holding, inter alia, that the hearing examiner haderred in admitting the evidence obtained during the searchof respondent's residence.1 The court ruled that the searchviolated respondent's Fourth Amendment rights because itwas conducted without the owner's consent and was notauthorized by any state statutory or regulatory frameworkensuring the reasonableness of searches by parole officers.668 A. 2d 590, 596 (1995). The court further held that theexclusionary rule should apply because, in the circumstancesof respondent's case, the deterrence benefits of the rule outweighed its costs. Id., at 600.2The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. 548 Pa. 418,698 A. 2d 32 (1997). The court stated that respondent'sFourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches andseizures was "unaffected" by his signing of the parole agreement giving parole officers permission to conduct warrantless searches. Id., at 427, 698 A. 2d, at 36. It then heldthat the search in question was unreasonable because it wassupported only by "mere speculation" rather than a "reasonable suspicion" of a parole violation. Ibid. Carving out anexception to its per se bar against application of the exclusionary rule in parole revocation hearings, see Commonwealth v. Kates, 452 Pa. 102, 120, 305 A. 2d 701, 710 (1973),the court further ruled that the federal exclusionary ruleapplied to this case because the officers who conducted the1 The court also held that the Board of Probation and Parole erred byadmitting hearsay evidence regarding alcohol consumption and a separateincident of weapons possession.2 While this case was pending in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, theCommonwealth Court filed an en banc opinion in another case that overruled its decision in respondent's case and held that the exclusionary ruledoes not apply in parole revocation hearings.

SCOTTOpinion of the Courtsearch were aware of respondent's parole status, 548 Pa., at428-432, 698 A. 2d, at 37-38. The court reasoned that, inthe absence of the rule, illegal searches would be undeterredwhen officers know that the subjects of their searches areparolees and that illegally obtained evidence can be intro-duced at parole hearings.Ibid.We granted certiorari to determine whether the FourthAmendment exclusionary rule applies to parole revocationproceedings. 522 U. S. 992 (1997).3IIWe have emphasized repeatedly that the government's useof evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendmentdoes not itself violate the Constitution. See, e. g., UnitedStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 906 (1984); Stone v. Powell, 428U. S. 465, 482, 486 (1976). Rather, a Fourth Amendmentviolation is " `fully accomplished' " by the illegal search orseizure, and no exclusion of evidence from a judicial or admin-istrative proceeding can " `cure the invasion of the defendant'srights which he has already suffered.' " United States v.Leon, supra, at 906 (quoting Stone v. Powell, supra, at 5403 We also invited the parties to brief the question whether a search of aparolee's residence must be based on reasonable suspicion where the parolee has consented to searches as a condition of parole. Respondent argues that we lack jurisdiction to decide this question in this case becausethe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held, as a matter of Pennsylvania law,that respondent's consent to warrantless searches as a condition of hisstate parole did not constitute consent to searches that are unreasonableunder the Fourth Amendment. Petitioner and its amici contend that thePennsylvania Supreme Court's opinion was at least ambiguous as towhether it relied on state or federal law to determine the extent of respondent's consent, and that we therefore have jurisdiction under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983). We need not parse the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court's decision in an attempt to discern its intent, however,because it is clear that we have jurisdiction to determine whether theexclusionary rule applies to state parole revocation proceedings, and ourdecision on that issue is sufficient to decide the case. We thereforeexpress no opinion regarding the constitutionality of the search.524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN363Cite as: 524 U. S. 357 (1998)Opinion of the Court(White, J., dissenting)). The exclusionary rule is instead ajudicially created means of deterring illegal searches and seizures. United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974).As such, the rule does not "proscribe the introduction ofillegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against allpersons," Stone v. Powell, supra, at 486, but applies only incontexts "where its remedial objectives are thought mostefficaciously served," United States v. Calandra, supra, at348; see alsoUnited States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454 (1976)("If . . . the exclusionary rule does not result in appreciabledeterrence, then, clearly, its use in the instant situation isunwarranted"). Moreover, because the rule is prudentialrather than constitutionally mandated, we have held it to beapplicable only where its deterrence benefits outweigh its"substantial social costs." United States v. Leon, 468 U. S.,at 907.Recognizing these costs, we have repeatedly declined toextend the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal trials. Id., at 909; United States v. Janis, supra, at 447.For example, in United States v. Calandra, we held that theexclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings;in so doing, we emphasized that such proceedings play a special role in the law enforcement process and that the traditionally flexible, nonadversarial nature of those proceedingswould be jeopardized by application of the rule. 414 U. S.,at 343-346, 349-350. Likewise, in United States v. Janis,we held that the exclusionary rule did not bar the introduction of unconstitutionally obtained evidence in a civil tax proceeding because the costs of excluding relevant and reliableevidence would outweigh the marginal deterrence benefits,which, we noted, would be minimal because the use of theexclusionary rule in criminal trials already deterred illegalsearches. 428 U. S., at 448, 454. Finally, in INS v. LopezMendoza, 468 U. S. 1032 (1984), we refused to extend theexclusionary rule to civil deportation proceedings, citing thehigh social costs of allowing an immigrant to remain illegally524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN364 PENNSYLVANIA BD. OF PROBATIONAND PAROLE v. SCOTTOpinion of the Courtin this country and noting the incompatibility of the rulewith the civil, administrative nature of those proceedings.Id., at 1050.As in Calandra, Janis, and Lopez-Mendoza, we are askedto extend the operation of the exclusionary rule beyond thecriminal trial context. We again decline to do so. Application of the exclusionary rule would both hinder the function-ing of state parole systems and alter the traditionally flexible, administrative nature of parole revocation proceedings.The rule would provide only minimal deterrence benefits inthis context, because application of the rule in the criminaltrial context already provides significant deterrence of unconstitutional searches. We therefore hold that the federalexclusionary rule does not bar the introduction at parole revocation hearings of evidence seized in violation of parolees'Fourth Amendment rights.Because the exclusionary rule precludes consideration ofreliable, probative evidence, it imposes significant costs: Itundeniably detracts from the truthfinding process and allowsmany who would otherwise be incarcerated to escape theconsequences of their actions. SeeStone v. Powell, supra,at 490. Although we have held these costs to be worth bear-ing in certain circumstances,4 our cases have repeatedly emphasized that the rule's "costly toll" upon truth-seeking andlaw enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those4 As discussed above, we have generally held the exclusionary rule toapply only in criminal trials. We have, moreover, significantly limited itsapplication even in that context. For example, we have held that the ruledoes not apply when the officer reasonably relied on a search warrant thatwas later deemed invalid, United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 920-922(1984); when the officer reasonably relied on a statute later deemed unconstitutional, Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 349-350 (1987); when the defendant seeks to assert another person's Fourth Amendment rights, Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 174-175 (1969); and when the illegallyobtained evidence is used to impeach a defendant's testimony, UnitedStates v. Havens, 446 U. S. 620, 627-628 (1980); Walder v. United States,347 U. S. 62, 65 (1954).524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN365Cite as: 524 U. S. 357 (1998)Opinion of the Courturging application of the rule. United States v. Payner, 447U. S. 727, 734 (1980).The costs of excluding reliable, probative evidence are par-ticularly high in the context of parole revocation proceedings. Parole is a "variation on imprisonment of convictedcriminals,"Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 477 (1972), inwhich the State accords a limited degree of freedom in return for the parolee's assurance that he will comply with theoften strict terms and conditions of his release. In mostcases, the State is willing to extend parole only because it isable to condition it upon compliance with certain requirements. The State thus has an "overwhelming interest" inensuring that a parolee complies with those requirementsand is returned to prison if he fails to do so. Id., at 483.The exclusion of evidence establishing a parole violation,however, hampers the State's ability to ensure compliancewith these conditions by permitting the parolee to avoid theconsequences of his noncompliance. The costs of allowing aparolee to avoid the consequences of his violation are compounded by the fact that parolees (particularly those whohave already committed parole violations) are more likely tocommit future criminal offenses than are average citizens.See Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868, 880 (1987). Indeed,this is the very premise behind the system of close parolesupervision. Ibid.The exclusionary rule, moreover, is incompatible with thetraditionally flexible, administrative procedures of parolerevocation. Because parole revocation deprives the paroleenot "of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled,but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on ob-servance of special parole restrictions,"Morrissey v. Brewer,supra, at 480, States have wide latitude under the Constitution to structure parole revocation proceedings.5 Most5 We thus have held that a parolee is not entitled to "the full panoply"of due process rights to which a criminal defendant is entitled, Morrisseyv. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 480 (1972), and that the right to counsel generally524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN366 PENNSYLVANIA BD. OF PROBATIONAND PAROLE v. SCOTTOpinion of the CourtStates, including Pennsylvania, see 548 Pa., at 427-428, 698A. 2d, at 36; Rivenbark v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probationand Parole, 509 Pa. 248, 501 A. 2d 1110 (1985), have adoptedinformal, administrative parole revocation procedures inorder to accommodate the large number of parole proceed-ings. These proceedings generally are not conducted byjudges, but instead by parole boards, "members of whichneed not be judicial officers or lawyers."Morrissey v.Brewer, 408 U. S., at 489. And traditional rules of evidencegenerally do not apply. Ibid. ("[T]he process should beflexible enough to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in anadversary criminal trial"). Nor are these proceedings entirely adversarial, as they are designed to be " `predictiveand discretionary' as well as factfinding."Gagnon v. Scar-pelli, 411 U. S. 778, 787 (1973) (quoting Morrissey v. Brewer,supra, at 480).Application of the exclusionary rule would significantlyalter this process. The exclusionary rule frequently re-quires extensive litigation to determine whether particularevidence must be excluded. Cf. United States v. Calandra,414 U. S., at 349 (noting that application of the exclusionaryrule "would delay and disrupt grand jury proceedings" be-cause "[s]uppression hearings would halt the orderly processof an investigation and might necessitate extended litigationof issues only tangentially related to the grand jury's primary objective"); INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S., at 1048(noting that "[t]he prospect of even occasional invocation ofthe exclusionary rule might significantly change and compli-cate the character of " the deportation system). Such litigation is inconsistent with the nonadversarial, administrativeprocesses established by the States. Although States couldadapt their parole revocation proceedings to accommodatedoes not attach to such proceedings because the introduction of counselwould "alter significantly the nature of the proceeding," Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, 787 (1973).524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN367Cite as: 524 U. S. 357 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsuch litigation, such a change would transform those pro-ceedings from a "predictive and discretionary" effort to promote the best interests of both parolees and society intotrial-like proceedings "less attuned" to the interests of theparolee. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at 787-788 (quotingMorrissey v. Brewer, supra, at 480). We are simply unwill-ing so to intrude into the States' correctional schemes. SeeMorrissey v. Brewer, supra, at 483 (recognizing that Stateshave an "overwhelming interest" in maintaining informal,administrative parole revocation procedures). Such a trans-formation ultimately might disadvantage parolees becausein an adversarial proceeding, "the hearing body may be lesstolerant of marginal deviant behavior and feel more pressureto reincarcerate than to continue nonpunitive rehabilitation."Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at 788. And the financial costsof such a system could reduce the State's incentive to extendparole in the first place, as one of the purposes of parole isto reduce the costs of criminal punishment while maintaininga degree of supervision over the parolee.The deterrence benefits of the exclusionary rule would notoutweigh these costs. As the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recognized, application of the exclusionary rule to parolerevocation proceedings would have little deterrent effectupon an officer who is unaware that the subject of his searchis a parolee. 548 Pa., at 431, 698 A. 2d, at 38. In that situation, the officer will likely be searching for evidence of criminal conduct with an eye toward the introduction of theevidence at a criminal trial. The likelihood that illegally obtained evidence will be excluded from trial provides deterrence against Fourth Amendment violations, and the remotepossibility that the subject is a parolee and that the evidencemay be admitted at a parole revocation proceeding surelyhas little, if any, effect on the officer's incentives. Cf. UnitedStates v. Janis, 428 U. S., at 448.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court thus fashioned a specialrule for those situations in which the officer performing the524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 PENNSYLVANIA BD. OF PROBATIONAND PAROLE v. SCOTTOpinion of the Courtsearch knows that the subject of his search is a parolee. Wedecline to adopt such an approach. We have never suggested that the exclusionary rule must apply in every cir-cumstance in which it might provide marginal deterrence.United States v. Calandra, supra, at 350; Alderman v.United States, 394 U. S. 165, 174 (1969). Furthermore, sucha piecemeal approach to the exclusionary rule would add anadditional layer of collateral litigation regarding the officer'sknowledge of the parolee's status.In any event, any additional deterrence from the Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court's rule would be minimal. Where theperson conducting the search is a police officer, the officer'sfocus is not upon ensuring compliance with parole conditionsor obtaining evidence for introduction at administrative proceedings, but upon obtaining convictions of those who commit crimes. The noncriminal parole proceeding "falls outside the offending officer's zone of primary interest." Janis,supra, at 458. Thus, even when the officer knows that thesubject of his search is a parolee, the officer will be deterredfrom violating Fourth Amendment rights by the applicationof the exclusionary rule to criminal trials.Even when the officer performing the search is a paroleofficer, the deterrence benefits of the exclusionary rule remain limited. Parole agents, in contrast to police officers,are not "engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime," United States v. Leon, 468 U. S., at 914;instead, their primary concern is whether their paroleesshould remain free on parole. Thus, their relationship withparolees is more supervisory than adversarial. Griffin v.Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868, 879 (1987). It is thus "unfair toassume that the parole officer bears hostility against the parolee that destroys his neutrality; realistically the failure ofthe parolee is in a sense a failure for his supervising officer."Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, at 485-486. Although this relationship does not prevent parole officers from ever violatingthe Fourth Amendment rights of their parolees, it does mean524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN369Cite as: 524 U. S. 357 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentingthat the harsh deterrent of exclusion is unwarranted, givensuch other deterrents as departmental training and discipline and the threat of damages actions. Moreover, al-though in some instances parole officers may act like policeofficers and seek to uncover evidence of illegal activity, they(like police officers) are undoubtedly aware that any unconstitutionally seized evidence that could lead to an indictmentcould be suppressed in a criminal trial. In this case, assuming that the search violated respondent's Fourth Amendmentrights, the evidence could have been inadmissible at trial ifrespondent had been criminally prosecuted.* * *We have long been averse to imposing federal require-ments upon the parole systems of the States. A federal requirement that parole boards apply the exclusionary rule,which is itself a " `grud[g]ingly taken, medicament,' "UnitedStates v. Janis, supra, at 455, n. 29, would severely disrupt the traditionally informal, administrative process of pa-role revocation. The marginal deterrence of unreasonablesearches and seizures is insufficient to justify such an intru-sion. We therefore hold that parole boards are not requiredby federal law to exclude evidence obtained in violation ofthe Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the judgment belowis reversed, and the case is remanded to the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court.
