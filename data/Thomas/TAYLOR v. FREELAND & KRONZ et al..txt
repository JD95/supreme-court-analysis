Section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code requires a debtorto file a list of the property that the debtor claims as statutorily exempt from distribution to creditors. Federal Rule ofBankruptcy Procedure 4003 affords creditors and the bankruptcy trustee 30 days to object to claimed exemptions. Wemust decide in this case whether the trustee may contest thevalidity of an exemption after the 30-day period if the debtorhad no colorable basis for claiming the exemption.*Gary Klein and Daniel L.

FREELAND & KRONZOpinion of the CourtIThe debtor in this case, Emily Davis, declared bankruptcywhile she was pursuing an employment discrimination claimin the state courts. The relevant proceedings began in 1978when Davis filed a complaint with the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations. Davis alleged that her employer,Trans World Airlines (TWA), had denied her promotions onthe basis of her race and sex. The Commission held forDavis as to liability but did not calculate the damages owedby TWA. The Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas re-versed the Commission, but the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court reversed that court and reinstated the Com-mission's determination of liability. TWA next appealed tothe Pennsylvania Supreme Court.In October 1984, while that appeal was pending, Davisfiled a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Petitioner, RobertJ. Taylor, became the trustee of Davis' bankruptcy estate.Respondents, Wendell G. Freeland, Richard F. Kronz, andtheir law firm, represented Davis in the discriminationsuit. On a schedule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Davisclaimed as exempt property the money that she expected towin in her discrimination suit against TWA. She describedthis property as "Proceeds from lawsuit--[Davis] v. TWA"and "Claim for lost wages" and listed its value as "unknown."App. 18.Performing his duty as a trustee, Taylor held the requiredinitial meeting of creditors in January 1985. See 11 U. S. C.$ 341; Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 2003(a). At this meeting, re-spondents told Taylor that they estimated that Davis mightwin $90,000 in her suit against TWA. Several days after themeeting, Taylor wrote a letter to respondents telling themthat he considered the potential proceeds of the lawsuit tobe property of Davis' bankruptcy estate. He also askedrespondents for more details about the suit. Respondentsdescribed the procedural posture of the case and expressedoptimism that they might settle with TWA for $110,000.503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT641Cite as: 503 U. S. 638 (1992)Opinion of the CourtTaylor decided not to object to the claimed exemption.The record reveals that Taylor doubted that the lawsuit hadany value. Taylor at one point explained: "I have had pastexperience in examining debtors . . . [.] [M]any of them . . .indicate they have potential lawsuits. . . . [M]any of them donot turn out to be advantageous and . . . many of them mightwind up settling far within the exemption limitation." App.52. Taylor also said that he thought Davis' discriminationclaim against TWA might be a "nullity."Id., at 58.Taylor proved mistaken. In October 1986, the Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court affirmed the Commonwealth Court'sdetermination that TWA had discriminated against Davis.In a subsequent settlement of the issue of damages, TWAagreed to pay Davis a total of $110,000. TWA paid part ofthis amount by issuing a check made to both Davis and respondents for $71,000. Davis apparently signed this checkover to respondents in payment of their fees. TWA paid theremainder of the $110,000 by other means. Upon learningof the settlement, Taylor filed a complaint against respondents in the Bankruptcy Court. He demanded that respondents turn over the money that they had received from Davisbecause he considered it property of Davis' bankruptcy estate. Respondents argued that they could keep the feesbecause Davis had claimed the proceeds of the lawsuit asexempt.The Bankruptcy Court sided with Taylor. It concludedthat Davis had "no statutory basis" for claiming the proceedsof the lawsuit as exempt and ordered respondents to "return" approximately $23,000 to Taylor, a sum sufficient topay off all of Davis' unpaid creditors. In re Davis, 105 B. R.288 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Pa. 1989). The District Court affirmed,In re Davis, 118 B. R. 272 (WD Pa. 1990), but the Court ofAppeals for the Third Circuit reversed, 938 F. 2d 420 (1991).The Court of Appeals held that the Bankruptcy Court couldnot require respondents to turn over the money becauseDavis had claimed it as exempt, and Taylor had failed to503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT642 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZOpinion of the Courtobject to the claimed exemption in a timely manner. Wegranted certiorari, 502 U. S. 976 (1991), and now affirm.IIWhen a debtor files a bankruptcy petition, all of hisproperty becomes property of a bankruptcy estate. See 11U. S. C. $ 541. The Code, however, allows the debtor to pre-vent the distribution of certain property by claiming it asexempt. Section 522(b) allowed Davis to choose the exemp-tions afforded by state law or the federal exemptions listedin $ 522(d). Section 522(l) states the procedure for claimingexemptions and objecting to claimed exemptions as follows:"The debtor shall file a list of property that the debtorclaims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section. . . .Unless a party in interest objects, the property claimedas exempt on such list is exempt."Although $ 522(l) itself does not specify the time for object-ing to a claimed exemption, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4003(b) provides in part:"The trustee or any creditor may file objections to thelist of property claimed as exempt within 30 days afterthe conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuantto Rule 2003(a) . . . unless, within such period, furthertime is granted by the court."In this case, as noted, Davis claimed the proceeds from heremployment discrimination lawsuit as exempt by listingthem in the schedule that she filed under $ 522(l). The par-ties agree that Davis did not have a right to exempt morethan a small portion of these proceeds either under state lawor under the federal exemptions specified in $ 522(d). Davisin fact claimed the full amount as exempt. Taylor, as a re-sult, apparently could have made a valid objection under$ 522(l) and Rule 4003 if he had acted promptly. We hold,however, that his failure to do so prevents him from challenging the validity of the exemption now.503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT643Cite as: 503 U. S. 638 (1992)Opinion of the CourtATaylor acknowledges that Rule 4003(b) establishes a 30-day period for objecting to exemptions and that $ 522(l)states that "[u]nless a party in interest objects, the propertyclaimed as exempt . . . is exempt." He argues, nonetheless,that his failure to object does not preclude him from challenging the exemption at this time. In Taylor's view,$ 522(l) and Rule 4003(b) serve only to narrow judicial inquiry into the validity of an exemption after 30 days, not topreclude judicial inquiry altogether. In particular, he maintains that courts may invalidate a claimed exemption afterexpiration of the 30-day period if the debtor did not have agood-faith or reasonably disputable basis for claiming it. Inthis case, Taylor asserts, Davis did not have a colorable basisfor claiming all of the lawsuit proceeds as exempt and thuslacked good faith.Taylor justifies his interpretation of $ 522(l) by arguingthat requiring debtors to file claims in good faith will discourage them from claiming meritless exemptions merely inhopes that no one will object. Taylor does not stand alonein this reading of $ 522(b). Several Courts of Appeals haveadopted the same position upon similar reasoning. See Inre Peterson, 920 F. 2d 1389, 1393-1394 (CA8 1990); In reDembs, 757 F. 2d 777, 780 (CA6 1985); In re Sherk, 918 F. 2d1170, 1174 (CA5 1990).We reject Taylor's argument. Davis claimed the lawsuitproceeds as exempt on a list filed with the BankruptcyCourt. Section 522(l), to repeat, says that "[u]nless a partyin interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on suchlist is exempt." Rule 4003(b) gives the trustee and creditors30 days from the initial creditors' meeting to object. Bynegative implication, the Rule indicates that creditors maynot object after 30 days "unless, within such period, furthertime is granted by the court." The Bankruptcy Court didnot extend the 30-day period. Section 522(l) therefore hasmade the property exempt. Taylor cannot contest the ex503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT644 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZOpinion of the Courtemption at this time whether or not Davis had a colorablestatutory basis for claiming it.Deadlines may lead to unwelcome results, but they promptparties to act and they produce finality. In this case, despitewhat respondents repeatedly told him, Taylor did not objectto the claimed exemption. If Taylor did not know the valueof the potential proceeds of the lawsuit, he could have soughta hearing on the issue, see Rule 4003(c), or he could haveasked the Bankruptcy Court for an extension of time toobject, see Rule 4003(b). Having done neither, Taylor cannot now seek to deprive Davis and respondents of theexemption.Taylor suggests that our holding will create improper incentives. He asserts that it will lead debtors to claim property exempt on the chance that the trustee and creditors, forwhatever reason, will fail to object to the claimed exemptionon time. He asserts that only a requirement of good faithcan prevent what the Eighth Circuit has termed "exemptionby declaration." Peterson, supra, at 1393. This concern,however, does not cause us to alter our interpretation of$ 522(l).Debtors and their attorneys face penalties under variousprovisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcyproceedings. See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $ 727(a)(4)(B) (authorizingdenial of discharge for presenting fraudulent claims); Rule1008 (requiring filings to "be verified or contain an unsworndeclaration" of truthfulness under penalty of perjury); Rule9011 (authorizing sanctions for signing certain documentsnot "well grounded in fact and . . . warranted by existing lawor a good faith argument for the extension, modification, orreversal of existing law"); 18 U. S. C. $ 152 (imposing criminalpenalties for fraud in bankruptcy cases). These provisionsmay limit bad-faith claims of exemptions by debtors. To theextent that they do not, Congress may enact comparable provisions to address the difficulties that Taylor predicts will503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT645Cite as: 503 U. S. 638 (1992)Opinion of the Courtfollow our decision. We have no authority to limit the appli-cation of $ 522(l) to exemptions claimed in good faith.BTaylor also asserts that courts may consider the validity ofthe exemption under a different provision of the BankruptcyCode, 11 U. S. C. $ 105(a), despite his failure to object in atimely manner. That provision states:"The court may issue any order, process, or judgmentthat is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title. No provision of this title providingfor the raising of an issue by a party in interest shallbe construed to preclude the court from, sua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessaryor appropriate to enforce or implement court orders orrules, or to prevent an abuse of process." Ibid. (empha-sis added).Although Taylor stresses that he is not asserting that courtsin bankruptcy have broad authorization to do equity in derogation of the Code and Rules, he maintains that $ 105 permitscourts to disallow exemptions not claimed in good faith. Several courts have accepted this position. See, e. g., Ragsdalev. Genesco, Inc., 674 F. 2d 277, 278 (CA4 1982); In re Staniforth, 116 B. R. 127, 131 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Wis. 1990); In reBudinsky, No. 90-01099, 1991 WL 105640 (WD Pa., June10, 1991).We decline to consider $ 105(a) in this case because Taylorraised the argument for the first time in his opening brief onthe merits. Our Rule 14.1(a) makes clear that "[o]nly thequestions set forth in the petition [for certiorari], or fairlyincluded therein, will be considered by the Court," and ourRule 24.1(a) states that a brief on the merits should not"raise additional questions or change the substance of thequestions already presented" in the petition. SeeYee v.Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992). In addition, we have503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT646 TAYLOR v.

S. 231, 234 (1976) (per curiam). These princi-ples help to maintain the integrity of the process of certiorari. Cf. Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985).The Court decides which questions to consider through wellestablished procedures; allowing the able counsel who arguebefore us to alter these questions or to devise additionalquestions at the last minute would thwart this system. Wesee no "unusual circumstances" that warrant addressing Taylor's $ 105(a) argument at this time. Berkemer v. McCarty,468 U.

It does not deny, however, that it has ampleauthority to hold that the doctrine of equitable tolling appliesto the 30-day limitations period in Federal Rule of Bank-ruptcy Procedure 4003(b).1 In my view, such a result is supported not only by strong equitable considerations, but alsoby the common law, the widespread practice of the bankruptcy courts, and the text of $ 522(b).IRule 4003, which is derived from $ 522(l) of the Code andin part from former Bankruptcy Rule 403, shifted the em1 Rule 4003(b) provides:"The trustee or any creditor may file objections to the list of propertyclaimed as exempt within 30 days after the conclusion of the meeting ofcreditors held pursuant to Rule 2003(a) or the filing of any amendment tothe list or supplemental schedules unless, within such period, further timeis granted by the court. Copies of the objections shall be delivered ormailed to the trustee and to the person filing the list and the attorney forsuch person."503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT647Cite as: 503 U. S. 638 (1992)Stevens, J., dissentingphasis of the earlier Rule, placing the burden on the debtorto list her exemptions and the burden on the parties in interest to raise objections. Rule 4003(b) in particular fills a gapthat remains in $ 522(l), which is silent as to the time inwhich parties in interest must file their objections. Rule4003(b) provides for a 30-day period for objections. Al-though the adoption of Rule 4003 has furthered the interestin orderly administration, there is no suggestion that it wasput into effect in order to avoid prejudice to the debtor.Thus, there is no identifiable reason why ordinary tollingprinciples that apply in other contexts should not also applyin bankruptcy proceedings; indeed, the generally equitablecharacter of bankruptcy makes it especially appropriate toapply such rules in this context.It is familiar learning that the harsh consequences of federal statutes of limitations have been avoided at times byrelying on either fraudulent concealment or undiscoveredfraud to toll the period of limitation. For example, in Baileyv. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 349-350 (1875), the Court describedtwo situations in which the "strict letter of general statutesof limitation" would not be followed, id., at 347. The firstsituation is "where the ignorance of the fraud has beenproduced by affirmative acts of the guilty party in concealingthe facts," and the second is "where the party injured by thefraud remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want ofdiligence or care on his part." Id., at 347-348. The formerinvolves fraudulent concealment; the latter defines undiscovered fraud. The Court concluded in Bailey that fraudulentconcealment, which was at issue in that case, tolls the running of the statute of limitations when the fraud "has beenconcealed, or is of such character as to conceal itself." Id.,at 349-350. To hold otherwise, reasoned the Court, would"make the law which was designed to prevent fraud themeans by which it is made successful and secure." Id., at349. In Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397 (1946),the Court extended the reach of this tolling doctrine when503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT648 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZStevens, J., dissentingit observed that it is to be "read into every federal statuteof limitation."2In this case, even if there was no fraud, and even if it isassumed that the trustee failed to exercise due diligence, itremains true that the parties injured by the trustee's failureto object within the 30-day period are innocent creditors.Moreover, it is apparently undisputed that there was no le-gitimate basis for the claim of an exemption for the entireaward. See ante, at 642. Under these circumstances, un-less the debtor could establish some prejudice caused by thetrustee's failure to object promptly, I would hold that thefiling of a frivolous claim for an exemption is tantamount tofraud for purposes of deciding when the 30-day period beginsto run.IIThis, in essence, is also the position adopted by numerousBankruptcy Courts and three Courts of Appeals.3 Over aperiod of years, they have held that the failure to make atimely objection is not dispositive, Rule 4003(b) notwithstanding. For example, in In re Hackett, 13 B. R. 755, 756(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Pa. 1981), the court explained that "[e]quita2 The tolling of a statute of limitations is not limited to cases of fraud.In medical malpractice suits, for example, this Court has long endorsedthe view that the statute of limitations will not bar the claim of one whowas "blameless[ly] ignoran[t]" of his injury; rather, the statute of limitations will not begin to run until he has knowledge of his injury. Urie v.Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 170 (1949).3 Some Bankruptcy Courts, however, have read the statute and Rulenarrowly and have refused to examine any exemption in the absence of atimely objection. See, e. g., In re Bradlow, 119 B. R. 330, 331 (Bkrtcy. Ct.SD Fla. 1990); In re Duncan, 107 B. R. 754 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Okla. 1988);In re Payton, 73 B. R. 31, 32 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex. 1987); In re Kretzer,48 B. R. 585, 587 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Nev. 1985); In re Gullickson, 39 B. R. 922(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Wis. 1984). Although the court in In re Hawn, 69 B. R.567 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 1987), took a similar view, it at least recognizedthat the result might be different if there had been "evidence that thedebtor fraudulently or negligently concealed any facts from the trustee orany creditors." Id., at 568.503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT649Cite as: 503 U. S. 638 (1992)Stevens, J., dissentingble considerations dictate that a debtor should not be allowedexemptions to which she is obviously not entitled." Thisview was echoed in In re Rollins, 63 B. R. 780, 783-784(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 1986): "[T]he debtor cannot makeproperty exempt simply by claiming it as exempt when thereis no apparent legal basis for the exemption. In that situation, the trustee's failure to object to the claim of exemptionwithin the time limit of Rule 4003(b) does not create an exemption." More recently, the court in In re Ehr, 116 B. R.665, 667 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Wis. 1988), reaffirmed this approach, as did the court in In re Staniforth, 116 B. R. 127,130 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Wis. 1990). As one court explained:"Read strictly, Rule 4003 and Section 522(l) support appel-lants' position concerning waiver. But, most courts havenot followed appellants' interpretation of these provisions.Instead, most courts hold that an exemption must have anapparent legal basis for an exemption to overcome an un-timely objection." In re Stutterheim, 109 B. R. 1010, 1012(Kan. 1989).The equitable principles that motivated these BankruptcyCourts are best encapsulated by the court in In re Bennett,36 B. R. 893 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Ky. 1984). There, the courtexplained that to apply Rule 4003(b) rigidly would be to en-courage a debtor to claim that all of her property was exempt, thus leaving it to the trustee and creditors to siftthrough the myriad claimed exemptions to assess their validity. Such a policy would result in reversion to "the law ofthe streets, with bare possession constituting not nine, butten, parts of the law; orderly administration of estates wouldbe replaced by uncertainty and constant litigation if not outright anarchy." Id., at 895.44 Bankruptcy courts would understandably be reluctant to encourage apolicy that would contribute to the overburdening of the bankruptcy courtsystem. As counsel for the trustee explained: "Last year there were880,000 bankruptcy filings, 291 bankruptcy judges to deal with all of thosefilings, and a real need on the part of the bankruptcy courts to rely on the503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT650 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZStevens, J., dissentingAlthough several Courts of Appeals and BankruptcyCourts did not go as far as these courts, preferring insteadin the case of an untimely objection to examine a claimedexemption to determine if there was a "good-faith statutorybasis" for the exemption, they nevertheless eschewed the lit-eral reading of the statute and rule adopted by the Courttoday. They did so because they believed it was importantto strike a proper balance between avoiding the undesirableeffect of "exemption by declaration" and yet not permittinga trustee "another bite at the debtor's apple where thedebtor has claimed certain property exempt in good faith."In re Peterson, 920 F. 2d 1389, 1393-1394 (CA8 1990); see Inre Sherk, 918 F. 2d 1170, 1174 (CA5 1990); In re Dembs, 757F. 2d 777, 780 (CA6 1985).Here, the trustee would succeed under either approach.Whether the court is always permitted to entertain anobjection to a claimed exemption (at least until the case isclosed)5 when the claimed exemption is invalid or whetherthe court can do so only if the claimed exemption lacks agood-faith statutory basis would mean that in this case thecourt could review the debtor's claimed exemption. Here,the parties acknowledge that the debtor could not claim astatutory basis for her claimed exemption for the full awardbecause neither backpay nor tort recovery is exempt under$ 522(d)(5). IIIThe practice of these lower courts has been motivated notonly by equitable considerations, but also by the requirementset forth in $ 522(b). Section 522(l) explicitly provides that"[t]he debtor shall file a list of property that the debtorgood faith of debtors in claiming exemptions, otherwise the whole systemwould collapse." Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. For example, this trustee alone"had approximately two or three hundred of these cases a year, which . . .is typical of bankruptcy trustees all across the country." Id., at 15.5 The parties have stipulated that the debtor's case has never beenclosed. App. 56.503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT651Cite as: 503 U. S. 638 (1992)Stevens, J., dissentingclaims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section." Sub-section (b) limits exemptions claimed by the debtor to "anyproperty that is exempt under federal law . . . or State orlocal law that is applicable on the date of the filing of thepetition." 11 U. S. C. $ 522(b)(2)(A). When a debtor claimsexemptions that do not even arguably satisfy this condition,6there is good reason to hold that the filing does not complywith $ 522 and therefore the 30-day objection period does notbegin to run. As one court noted: "If Debtor may select inany manner her exemptions, then no purpose is served bythe inclusion of the . . . terms."In re Kingsbury, 124 B. R.146, 148, n. 9 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Me. 1991). It declined to concludethat Congress added the requirements that the propertybe exempted "under federal law . . . or state law or locallaw" but "refused to grant them meaning." Ibid. (emphasis omitted).IVThe Court's disposition of this case is straightforward.Because it regards the meaning of the statute and Rule as"plain," that is the end of the case. I have no doubt, however, that if the debtor or the trustee were guilty of fraud,the Court would readily ignore what it now treats as theinsurmountable barrier of "plain meaning." The equities inthis case are not as strong as if fraud were implicated, butour power to reach a just result despite the "plain meaning"barrier is exactly the same as it was in Bailey v. Glover, 216 The debtor's claimed exemptions in this case not only failed to satisfyany statutory basis, but also failed to provide even the basic informationnecessary to inform the trustee adequately about the exemption. Forexample, the debtor indicated on her Schedule B-4 Property Claimed AsExempt form that she was claiming the "[p]roceeds from lawsuit," but thatthe value was "unknown." App. 14-15. Although the value of the fullaward ended up amounting to $110,000, and only an amount of approximately $24,000 was required to satisfy the claims of all of her creditors,the debtor never amended her schedule to reflect the precise value ofthe award.503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT652 TAYLOR v.

Here, as in Bailey, we should be guidedby the common-law principles that have supported the tolling of other statutes of limitations, and, in addition, by theexperience of bankruptcy courts that have recognized theneed for a similar rule to achieve both equitable results andfair administration in cases of this kind. In my view, it is amistake to adopt a "strict letter" approach, id., at 347, whenjustice requires a more searching inquiry.

He argues that California's method of execution--exposure to cyanide gas--constitutes cruel and unusual punishment andtherefore violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.In light of all that we know today about the extreme andunnecessary pain inflicted by execution by cyanide gas, andin light of the availability of more humane and less violentmethods of execution, Harris' claim has merit. I would denythe State's application to vacate the stay imposed by theCourt of Appeals and allow the courts below to hear and ruleon Harris' claim.503us2$65z 11-22-95 08:47:36 PAGES OPINPGT655Cite as: 503 U. S. 653 (1992)Stevens, J., dissentingExecution by cyanide gas is "in essence asphyxiation bysuffocation or strangulation." 1 As dozens of uncontroverted expert statements filed in this case illustrate, execution by cyanide gas is extremely and unnecessarily painful."Following inhalation of cyanide gas, a person will firstexperience hypoxia, a condition defined as a lack of oxygen in the body. The hypoxic state can continue forseveral minutes after the cyanide gas is released in theexecution chamber. During this time, a person will remain conscious and immediately may suffer extremepain throughout his arms, shoulders, back, and chest.The sensation may be similar to pain felt by a personduring a massive heart attack." 2"Execution by gas . . . produces prolonged seizures, incontinence of stool and urine, salivation, vomiting, retching,ballistic writhing, flailing, twitching of extremities, [and]grimacing." 3 This suffering lasts for 8 to 10 minutes, orlonger.4Eyewitness descriptions of executions by cyanide gas lenddepth to these clinical accounts. On April 6, 1992, Arizonaexecuted Don Eugene Harding."When the fumes enveloped Don's head he took aquick breath. A few seconds later he again looked inmy direction. His face was red and contorted as if hewere attempting to fight through tremendous pain. Hismouth was pursed shut and his jaw was clenched tight.Don then took several more quick gulps of the fumes.1 Exhibits in Support of Motion for Temporary Restraining Order inNo. 92-70237 (ND Cal.)

OF CAL.Stevens, J., dissenting"At this point Don's body started convulsing violently. . . . His face and body turned a deep red and the veinsin his temple and neck began to bulge until I thoughtthey might explode."After about a minute Don's face leaned partially forward, but he was still conscious. Every few seconds hecontinued to gulp in. He was shuddering uncontrollably and his body was racked with spasms. His headcontinued to snap back. His hands were clenched."After several more minutes, the most violent of theconvulsions subsided. At this time the muscles alongDon's left arm and back began twitching in a wavelike motion under his skin. Spittle drooled from hismouth. . . ."Don did not stop moving for approximately eightminutes, and after that he continued to twitch and jerkfor another minute. Approximately two minutes later,we were told by a prison official that the execution wascomplete."Don Harding took ten minutes and thirty one secondsto die." 5The unnecessary cruelty of this method of execution convinced Arizona's Attorney General that that State shouldabandon execution by gas in favor of execution by lethal injection.6 His conclusion coincides with that of numerousmedical, legal, and ethical experts.7The prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment "is notfastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning as public5 2 id., Exh. 17, at 3-4 (Affidavit of James J.

S. 349, 378 (1910). Accordingly, wehave "interpreted the [Eighth] Amendment `in a flexible anddynamic manner.' " Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 369(1989) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 171 (1976)(opinion of Stewart, Powell, andStevens, JJ.)). When theCalifornia statute requiring execution by cyanide gas wasenacted in 1937, the gas chamber was considered a humanemethod of execution. Fifty-five years of history and moraldevelopment have superseded that judgment. The barbaricuse of cyanide gas in the Holocaust, the development of cyanide agents as chemical weapons, our contemporary under-standing of execution by lethal gas, and the development ofless cruel methods of execution all demonstrate that execu-tion by cyanide gas is unnecessarily cruel. "The traditionalhumanity of modern Anglo-American law forbids the inflic-tion of unnecessary pain in the execution of the death sentence." Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S.459, 463 (1947) (opinion of Reed, J.).Nowhere is this moral progress better demonstrated thanin the decisions of the state legislatures. Of the 20 or soStates to adopt new methods of execution since our rulingin Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), not a single Statehas chosen execution by lethal gas. Ten years ago, 10 Statesmandated execution by lethal gas; one by one, those Stateshave abandoned that method as inhumane and torturous.Only California, Maryland, and Arizona currently mandateexecution by gas.8 Of the 168 persons executed in theUnited States since 1977, only 6 have been executed by lethalgas. We have frequently emphasized that "[t]he clearestand most reliable objective evidence of contemporary valuesis the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures."Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989). These "objec8 As noted above, Arizona is considering abandoning lethal gas as ameans of execution. See n. 6, supra.

OF CAL.Stevens, J., dissentingtive indicia that reflect the public attitude" toward executionby lethal gas, Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S., at 370, clearlyexhibit a nearly universal rejection of that means of execution.9 Cf. Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 788-796 (1982);Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 593-597 (1977). All of thisleads me to conclude that execution by cyanide gas is bothcruel and unusual, and that it violates contemporary standards of human decency.10More than a century ago, we declared that "[p]unishmentsare cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death."In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890). In light of ourcontemporary understanding of the methods of executionand in light of less cruel alternatives presently available, Ibelieve that execution by cyanide gas is "incompatible with`the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress ofa maturing society.' " Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102(1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).The State contends that Harris should have brought hisclaim earlier. This is not reason enough to upset the stayissued by the Court of Appeals and dispatch the consideredjudgment of the 14 appellate judges who voted to rehearthe case en banc. Indeed, although reluctant to recognize9 Notably, a memorandum prepared by California corrections officialscorrectly observes that "[l]ethal injection is considered to be more humanethan other methods of execution (e. g., hanging, firing squad, lethal gas, orelectrocution)." 1 Exhibits, Exh. 11, at 4.10 In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 135-136 (1879), we ruled that punishments of "unnecessary cruelty" violated the Eighth Amendment, citingthe ancient practices of drawing and quartering and "public dissection" asexamples. Similarly in In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 446 (1890), we indicated that "burning at the stake, crucifixion, [and] breaking on the wheel"were as well cruel and unusual. To that list we might have added thegarrotte, a device for execution by strangulation developed--and abandoned--centuries ago in Spain. See G. Scott, The History of Capital Punishment 159-160 (1950). To my mind, the gas chamber is nothing morethan a chemical garrotte.503us2$65z 11-22-95 08:47:36 PAGES OPINPGT659Cite as: 503 U. S. 653 (1992)Stevens, J., dissentingas much, the State itself could have avoided this last-minutelitigation. In 1983, seven States authorized executions byexposure to cyanide gas. In that year, three Members ofthis Court indicated that that method of execution raised sufficiently serious questions under the Eighth Amendment tomerit review by writ of certiorari. SeeGray v. Lucas, 463U. S. 1237 (1983). Thereafter, four States (Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wyoming) abandoned cyanide gas as amethod of execution. In light of these events and the decisions of other legislatures, California as well should have re-visited its 55-year-old statute.More fundamentally, if execution by cyanide gas is in factunconstitutional, then the State lacks thepower to imposesuch punishment. Harris' delay, even if unjustified, cannotendow the State with the authority to violate the Constitu-tion. It was this principle that animated Justice Harlan'sopinion in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 692-693(1971), and that a plurality of this Court embraced in Teaguev. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 306-307 (1989) (opinion of O'Connor,J.). As Harlan emphasized, there are some instances inwhich the State's interest in finality must give way. Whenthe challenged conduct falls clearly beyond the State's legiti-mate power, "[t]here is little societal interest in permittingthe criminal process to rest at a point where it ought prop-erly never to repose." 401 U. S., at 693. For these reasons,the State's interest in an immediate execution must yield toa deliberate and careful study of the merits of Harris' claims.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.02-18-99 13:29:48 503ordnote PART 1Reporter's NoteThe next page is purposely numbered 901.

Zatko v. Califor-nia, 502 U. S. 16 (1991) (per curiam). In explaining its action,the Court emphasized that Zatko and Martin were "unique." Id.,at 18. What distinguished these petitioners, the Court explained,was not the frivolousness, but the frequency of their filings. In-deed, the Court found it "important to observe" that it had notapplied Rule 39.8 to numerous other frivolous petitions. Ibid.The Court noted that these other petitions were denied "in theusual manner, underscoring our commitment to hearing theclaims, however meritless, of the poor." Ibid.Zatko had filed 73 petitions in this Court over the past 10 years;Martin had filed more than 45. Id., at 17. In invoking Rule 39.8today, the Court denies leave to proceed in forma pauperis topetitioner Joseph Head. Head has previously filed one petitionin this Court.2Today's action thus represents an unexplained expansion ofRule 39.8 and an apparent rejection of the explanation for theaction taken with respect to petitioners Zatko and Martin.

Reported below: 939 F. 2d1106.Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.This case concerns the appropriate standard for determiningthe admissibility of expert testimony. It is an issue that has longdivided the federal courts, see Mustafa v. United States, 479 U. S.953 (1986) (White, J., joined by Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and here deeply divided the Court of Appealsfor the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc.503ORD$Pt1 11-14-95 15:35:56 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)913ORDERSMarch 2, 1992503 U. S.Albert Roy Christophersen died of a rare form of cancer in1986. Petitioners, his widow and son, brought suit, claiming thatChristophersen's illness was caused by fumes from the manufac-ture of nickel/cadmium batteries in the factory where he hadworked for 14 years. Petitioners based this claim upon the ex-pert opinion of an internist and toxicologist. Respondents contended that there was no reliable basis for the expert's views andmoved for summary judgment. The United States District Courtfor the Western District of Texas agreed that the doctor's affida-vit was "not based upon the type of evidence usually relied uponby experts in the field of cancer research" and entered judgmentfor respondents. App. C to Pet. for Cert. 74-75.A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, 902 F. 2d 362 (1990),but on rehearing en banc, eight members of the court voted toaffirm the judgment of the District Court, based in part on theirconclusion that the admissibility of an expert witness' evidenceshould turn on whether his or her methodology is generally ac-cepted within the scientific community. 939 F. 2d 1106 (1991) (percuriam). This standard, known as the Frye test, was announcedalmost 70 years ago. See Frye v. United States, 54 App. D. C.46, 293 F. 1013 (1923). But five members of the Court of Appealsconcluded that the Frye test was not the applicable evidentiarystandard. 939 F. 2d, at 1116 (Clark, C. J., concurring in result);id., at 1122, 1136 (Reavley, King, Johnson, Wiener, JJ., dissentingin two opinions).As the Fifth Circuit is divided, so the Courts of Appeals arein disagreement. Some continue to apply the approach set forthin Frye in deciding whether expert evidence is admissible. E. g.,Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 951 F. 2d 1128(CA9 1991); United States v. Two Bulls, 918 F. 2d 56 (CA8 1990);United States v. Smith, 869 F. 2d 348 (CA7 1989). But courts inother Circuits have concluded that Frye was superseded in 1975by the Federal Rules of Evidence, which they maintain estab-lished a lower threshold for determining the admissibility of expert evidence. E. g., United States v. Jakobetz, 955 F. 2d 786(CA2 1992); DeLuca v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 911F. 2d 941 (CA3 1990). Because this is an important and recurringissue, I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict.No. 91-883.

Reported below: 933 F. 2d 1014.Opinion of Justice Stevens, respecting the denial of the peti-tion for writ of certiorari.Petitioner asks us to resolve a recurring conflict among theCourts of Appeals concerning the meaning of a once obscure sentence in $ 3 of the Mississippi River Flood Control Act of 1928.11 Section 3 of the statute, which is now codified as 33 U. S. C. $ 702c, readsin full as follows:"Sec. 3. Except when authorized by the Secretary of War upon the rec-ommendation of the Chief of Engineers, no money appropriated under authority of this Act shall be expended on the construction of any item of theproject until the States or levee districts have given assurances satisfactory503ORD$Pt1 11-14-95 15:35:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)924 OCTOBER TERM, 1991Opinion of Stevens, J. 503 U. S.During the past decade that sentence has assumed greater andgreater importance because it has provided the Government witha defense to claims for personal injury and death caused by federal negligence, gross negligence, and even "conscious governmen-tal indifference to the safety of the public."United States v.James, 478 U. S. 597, 600 (1986) (citation and internal quotationmarks omitted).2This is the latest in an expanding series of tragic cases. Je-rome Hiersche, a professional diver, contracted with the Government to inspect submerged fish screens at the hydroelectric intakeon the John Day Dam on the Columbia River between Oregonand Washington. Although Government employees assured himthat the water flow to the fish bypass system would be shut off,they negligently failed to do so. Petitioner's head was drawninto an orifice in the fish bypass system, and he suffered fatalinjuries. The Government defended this wrongful-death actionto the Secretary of War that they will (a) maintain all flood-control worksafter their completion, except controlling and regulating spillway structures,including special relief levees; maintenance includes normally such mattersas cutting grass, removal of weeds, local drainage, and minor repairs of mainriver levees; (b) agree to accept land turned over to them under the provi-sions of section 4; (c) provide without cost to the United States, all rights ofway for levee foundations and levees on the main stem of the MississippiRiver between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and the Head of Passes."No liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United Statesfor any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place: Provided,however, That if in carrying out the purposes of this Act it shall be foundthat upon any stretch of the banks of the Mississippi River it is impracticable to construct levees, either because such construction is not economicallyjustified or because such construction would unreasonably restrict the floodchannel, and lands in such stretch of the river are subjected to overflow anddamage which are not now overflowed or damaged by reason of the construction of levees on the opposite banks of the river it shall be the duty ofthe Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers to institute proceedings onbehalf of the United States Government to acquire either the absolute own-ership of the lands so subjected to overflow and damage or floodage rightsover such lands." 45 Stat. 535-536 (emphasis added).2 As one court noted, while Congress often enacts special legislation to aidthe victims of floods, thus mitigating the harsh effect of $ 702c with respectto property damage, Congress does not pass special legislation to assist individuals who suffer personal injury in flood-control waters as a result of Gov-ernment negligence. See Fryman v. United States, 901 F. 2d 79, 80 (CA7),cert. denied, 498 U. S. 920 (1990).503ORD$Pt1 11-14-95 15:35:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)925ORDERSOpinion of Stevens, J.923on the ground that the 1928 Act immunizes it from liability forall personal injuries caused by its employees in federal floodcontrol projects. Following this Court's unfortunate decision inJames, as well as settled precedent in the Ninth Circuit,3 theDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals sustained that defense.Since 1928 when Congress authorized the construction of thelevees on the banks of the Mississippi River, the number andimportance of federal flood-control projects has grown dramatically. In addition to controlling floods, these projects generatehydroelectric power and create artificial lakes that serve important recreational and conservation purposes. In some Circuitsthe Government's flood-control immunity would not constitute adefense in the case of injuries resulting from Government conductthat was unrelated to any flood-control purpose, see, e. g., Boyd v.United States ex rel. United States Army, Corps of Engineers,881 F. 2d 895 (CA10 1989); Hayes v. United States, 585 F. 2d 701(CA4 1978). If this case had arisen in one of those Circuits, theclaim would likely succeed because Hiersche's assignment relatedto fish conservation and power generation, rather than flood control. But in the Ninth Circuit, if flood control was one of thepurposes of the Act of Congress authorizing the project itself,the immunity applies.4 The Seventh Circuit has suggested thatimmunity might depend on whether the flood-control activities atthe project increased the probability of injury. See Fryman v.United States, 901 F. 2d 79 (CA7), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 920(1990).This Court has a duty to resolve conflicts among the courts ofappeals. As several scholars have recognized, however, that dutyis not absolute.5 Some conflicts are tolerable. Others can be resolved more effectively by Congress. This is such a case.3 See McCarthy v. United States, 850 F. 2d 558 (1988), cert. denied, 489U. S. 1052 (1989).4 See McCarthy v. United States, 850 F. 2d, at 562; see also Zavadil v.United States, 908 F. 2d 334 (CA8 1990) (per curiam), cert. denied, 498 U. S.1108 (1991); Mocklin v. Orleans Levee District, 877 F. 2d 427 (CA5 1989).5 See generally A. Hellman, Unresolved Intercircuit Conflicts: The Natureand Scope of the Problem, Final Report: Phase I, pp. 65-80 (1991) (report ofFederal Judicial Center); Wallace, The Nature and Extent of IntercircuitConflicts: A Solution Needed for a Mountain or a Molehill?, 71 Calif.

It was enacted18 years before the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2671 etseq., waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity fromliability for personal injuries. At the time of its enactment, noconsideration was given to the power generation, recreational,and conservation purposes of flood-control projects, or to theirpossible impact on the then nonexistent federal liability for per-sonal injury and death caused by the negligent operation of suchprojects. Today this obsolete legislative remnant is nothing morethan an engine of injustice. Congress, not this Court, has theprimary duty to confront the question whether any part of thisharsh immunity doctrine should be retained.No. 91-976.

S. 386 (1987), a statelaw cause of action is pre-empted under $ 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act by a defense based on a collectivebargaining agreement. A state-law cause of action is pre-emptedunder $ 301 if its resolution is "substantially dependent on analysis of a collective-bargaining agreement." Electrical Workers v.Hechler, 481 U. S. 851, 859, n. 3 (1987). See also Allis-ChalmersCorp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202, 220 (1985).In the decision below, petitioners based their claims solely onstate law, but respondent's defense invoked the provisions of acollective-bargaining agreement. The Illinois court held that503ORD$Pt1 11-14-95 15:35:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)927ORDERSMarch 9, 1992503 U. S.petitioners' state-law claims were pre-empted under $ 301 becausetheir resolution was substantially dependent on interpretation ofthe applicable collective-bargaining agreement. 213 Ill. App. 3d169, 175-176, 571 N. E. 2d 1215, 1218 (1991). Several FederalCourts of Appeals similarly have held that a court must look todefenses to determine whether a claim requires interpretation ofa collective-bargaining agreement. See, e. g., Smith v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 943 F. 2d 764, 769-771 (CA7 1991); Hanks v. General Motors Corp., 859 F. 2d 67, 70 (CA8 1988).By contrast, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, relyingon our decision in Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, has held that "inorder for there to be section 301 preemption, the plaintiff, inits well-pleaded complaint, must plead an action that requiresinterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement." Thatcourt accordingly examined the claims presented in the complaintand found no $ 301 pre-emption. Berda v. CBS Inc., 881 F. 2d20, 25 (1989). See also McCormick v. AT & T Technologies, Inc.,934 F. 2d 531, 545 (CA4 1991) (en banc) (Phillips, J., dissenting).The Illinois court below expressly rejected the reasoning ofBerda.I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.No. 91-1220.

Reported below: 940 F. 2d 1150.Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.The issue in this case is whether the Ex Post Facto Clause ofthe Constitution, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3, is violated when a newly modified state parole regulation is applied to a prisoner who beganserving his sentence prior to the rule change.Petitioner pleaded guilty to the 1976 kidnap, sexual abuse, andmurder of a young girl; he was sentenced to three concurrent jailterms, the longest of which was 40 years. In 1981, the MinnesotaCorrections Board determined that, because of the severity ofpetitioner's crimes, the target date for his release should be theexpiration of his sentence. In a letter to petitioner, the boardstated that it would "not consider any form of release prior tothe expiration of your sentence unless psychiatric, psychological,and correctional staff can certify that you are no longer a dangerto the public in general and/or young females specifically."A year later, the Minnesota Legislature abolished the correc-tions board and transferred parole responsibility to the commis503ORD$Pt1 11-14-95 15:35:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)953ORDERSMarch 23, 1992503 U. S.sioner of corrections. Minn. Stat. $ 243.05 (1990). The commis-sioner enacted new parole regulations, including a rule that "[a]llrelease dates established by the Minnesota corrections board willbe left in full force and effect by the commissioner." 3 Minn.Rule $ 2940.1500, subp. 2 (1991). Petitioner was informed thatthis new regulation effectively froze his release date.Petitioner filed this civil rights action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,42 U. S. C. $ 1983, asserting that application of the new paroleregulation to his case violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. TheUnited States District Court for the District of Minnesota enteredsummary judgment for respondents. A divided panel of theCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that"the Minnesota parole regulations are not `laws' for ex post factopurposes . . . ." Bailey v. Gardebring, 940 F. 2d 1150, 1157 (1991).The court, again divided, denied rehearing en banc.The judgment of the Court of Appeals conflicts with decisionsof other Courts of Appeals, which have held that application ofchanged state parole regulations may pose ex post facto problems.See, e. g., Akins v. Snow, 922 F. 2d 1558 (CA11), cert. denied, 501U. S. 1260 (1991); Royster v. Fauver, 775 F. 2d 527 (CA3 1985).Because the issue is likely to arise frequently, I would grantcertiorari to resolve the disagreement.No. 91-7239. Mount v. United States. C. A. 1st Cir.
