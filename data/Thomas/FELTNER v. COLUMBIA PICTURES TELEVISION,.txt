Section 504(c) of the Copyright Act of 1976 permits a copy-right owner "to recover, instead of actual damages andprofits, an award of statutory damages . . . , in a sum of notless than $500 or more than $20,000 as the court considersjust." 90 Stat. 2585, as amended, 17 U. S. C. $ 504(c)(1). Inthis case, we consider whether $ 504(c) or the SeventhAmendment grants a right to a jury trial when a copyrightowner elects to recover statutory damages. We hold thatalthough the statute is silent on the point, the SeventhAmendment provides a right to a jury trial, which includesa right to a jury determination of the amount of statutorydamages. We therefore reverse.IPetitioner C. Elvin Feltner owns Krypton InternationalCorporation, which in 1990 acquired three television stationsin the southeastern United States.

Despite Columbia's ter-mination, the stations continued broadcasting the programs.Columbia sued Feltner, Krypton, the stations, variousKrypton subsidiaries, and certain Krypton officers in FederalDistrict Court alleging, inter alia, copyright infringementarising from the stations' unauthorized broadcasting of theprograms. Columbia sought various forms of relief underthe Copyright Act of 1976 (Copyright Act), 17 U. S.

On Columbia's motion, the District Courtentered partial summary judgment as to liability for Colum-bia on its copyright infringement claims.1Columbia exercised the option afforded by $ 504(c) of theCopyright Act to recover "Statutory Damages" in lieu ofactual damages. In relevant part, $ 504(c) provides:"Statutory Damages--"(1) Except as provided by clause (2) of this subsection, the copyright owner may elect, at any time beforefinal judgment is rendered, to recover, instead of actualdamages and profits, an award of statutory damages forall infringements involved in the action, with respect toany one work, . . . in a sum of not less than $500 or morethan $20,000 as the court considers just. . . ."(2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains theburden of proving, and the court finds, that infringementwas committed willfully, the court in its discretion mayincrease the award of statutory damages to a sum ofnot more than $100,000.

After two days of trial, thetrial judge held that each episode of each series constituteda separate work and that the airing of the same episode bydifferent stations controlled by Feltner constituted separateviolations; accordingly, the trial judge determined that therehad been a total of 440 acts of infringement. The trial judgefurther found that Feltner's infringement was willful andfixed statutory damages at $20,000 per act of infringement.Applying that amount to the number of acts of infringement,the trial judge determined that Columbia was entitled to$8,800,000 in statutory damages, plus costs and attorney'sfees.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in allrelevant respects.Columbia Pictures Television v.

The Court of Appealsfurther concluded that the "Seventh Amendment does notprovide a right to a jury trial on the issue of statutory damages because an award of such damages is equitable in na-ture."Ibid. We granted certiorari. 521 U.

Such a construction is not possible here, for we cannot discern "any congressional intent togrant . . . the right to a jury trial," 481 U. S., at 417, n. 3, onan award of statutory damages.4The language of $ 504(c) does not grant a right to have ajury assess statutory damages. Statutory damages are tobe assessed in an amount that "the court considers just."$ 504(c)(1). Further, in the event that "the court finds" theinfringement was willful or innocent, "the court in its discretion" may, within limits, increase or decrease the amount ofno other case exceed the sum of [$5,000] nor be less than the sum of [$250]. . ." Act of Mar. 4, 1909, $ 25(b), 35 Stat. 1081 (later amended and codifiedat 17 U. S.

These phrases, like the entire statutory provision, make no mention of a right to a jurytrial or, for that matter, to juries at all.The word "court" in this context appears to mean judge,not jury. Cf. F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts,Inc., 344 U. S. 228, 232 (1952) (referring to the "judicial discretion" necessary for "the court's choice between a computed measure of damage and that imputed by" the Copyright Act of 1909 (emphasis added)). In fact, the otherremedies provisions of the Copyright Act use the term"court" in contexts generally thought to confer authority ona judge, rather than a jury. See, e. g., $ 502 ("court . . . may. . . grant temporary and final injunctions"); $ 503(a) ("[T]hecourt may order the impounding . . . of all copies or phonorecords"); $ 503(b) ("As part of a final judgment or decree, thecourt may order the destruction or other reasonable disposition of all copies or phonorecords"); $ 505 ("[T]he court in itsdiscretion may allow the recovery of full costs" of litigation,and "the court may also award a reasonable attorney's fee").In contrast, the Copyright Act does not use the term "court"in the subsection addressing awards of actual damages andprofits, see $ 504(b), which generally are thought to constitute legal relief. See Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S.469, 477 (1962) (action for damages for trademark infringement "subject to cognizance by a court of law"); see alsoArnstein v.

S. 340 (1998)Opinion of the CourtFeltner relies on Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 585(1978), in which we held that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, 29 U. S. C. $ 621et seq., provides a statutory right to a jury trial in an actionfor unpaid wages even though the statute authorizes "thecourt . . . to grant such legal or equitable relief as may beappropriate," $ 626(b). That holding, however, turned ontwo crucial factors: The ADEA's remedial provisions wereexpressly to be enforced in accordance with the Fair LaborStandards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 101et seq.,which had been uniformly interpreted to provide a right toa jury trial, Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S., at 580-581; and thestatute used the word "legal," which we found to be a "termof art" used in cases "in which legal relief is available andlegal rights are determined" by juries,id., at 583. Section504(c), in contrast, does not make explicit reference to another statute that has been uniformly interpreted to providea right to jury trial and does not use the word "legal" orother language denoting legal relief or rights.5We thus discern no statutory right to a jury trial when acopyright owner elects to recover statutory damages. Ac-cordingly, we must reach the constitutional question.IIIThe Seventh Amendment provides that "[i]n Suits at com-mon law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twentydollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. . . ."U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. Since Justice Story's time, the Court5 In addition, a copyright plaintiff may elect statutory damages "at anytime before final judgment is rendered." $ 504(c)(1). The parties agree,and we have found no indication to the contrary, that election may occureven after a jury has returned a verdict on liability and an award of actualdamages. It is at least unlikely that Congress intended that a jury, having already made a determination of actual damages, should be reconvenedto make a determination of statutory damages.523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN348 FELTNER v. COLUMBIA PICTURES TELEVISION, INC.Opinion of the Courthas understood "Suits at common law" to refer "not merely[to] suits, which the common law recognized among its oldand settled proceedings, but [to] suits in which legal rightswere to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to those where equitable rights alone were recognized,and equitable remedies were administered." Parsons v.Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 447 (1830) (emphasis in original). TheSeventh Amendment thus applies not only to common-lawcauses of action, but also to "actions brought to enforce statutory rights that are analogous to common-law causes of action ordinarily decided in English law courts in the late 18thcentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by courts ofequity or admiralty." Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg,492 U. S. 33, 42 (1989) (citing Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S.,at 193). To determine whether a statutory action is moreanalogous to cases tried in courts of law than to suits triedin courts of equity or admiralty, we examine both the natureof the statutory action and the remedy sought. See 492U. S., at 42.Unlike many of our recent Seventh Amendment cases,which have involved modern statutory rights unknown to18th-century England, see, e. g., Wooddell v. ElectricalWorkers, 502 U. S. 93 (1991) (alleged violations of union'sduties under Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, andLabor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959);Granfinanciera v. Nordberg, supra (action to rescind fraudulent preference under Bankruptcy Act); Tull v. UnitedStates, 481 U. S. 412 (1987) (Government's claim for civil penalties under Clean Water Act); Curtis v. Loether, supra(claim under Title VIII of Civil Rights Act of 1968), in thiscase there are close analogues to actions seeking statutorydamages under $ 504(c). Before the adoption of the SeventhAmendment, the common law and statutes in England andthis country granted copyright owners causes of action forinfringement.

S. 340 (1998)Opinion of the Courttary damages were tried in courts of law, and thus beforejuries.By the middle of the 17th century, the common law recognized an author's right to prevent the unauthorized publication of his manuscript. See, e. g., Stationers Co. v. Patentees, Carter's Rep. 89, 124 Eng. Rep. 842 (C. P. 1666). Thisprotection derived from the principle that the manuscriptwas the product of intellectual labor and was as much theauthor's property as the material on which it was written.See Millar v. Taylor, 4 Burr. 2303, 2398, 98 Eng. Rep. 201,252 (K. B. 1769) (opinion of Mansfield, C. J.) (common-lawcopyright derived from principle that "it is just, that an Author should reap the pecuniary Profits of his own ingenuity and Labour"); 1 W. Patry, Copyright Law and Practice3 (1994). Actions seeking damages for infringement ofcommon-law copyright, like actions seeking damages for invasions of other property rights, were tried in courts of lawin actions on the case. See Millar v. Taylor, supra, at 2396-2397, 98 Eng. Rep., at 251. Actions on the case, like otheractions at law, were tried before juries. See McClenachanv. McCarty, 1 Dall. 375, 378 (C. P. Phila. Cty. 1788); 5 J.Moore, Moore's Federal Practice ||38.11[5] (2d ed. 1996); 1J. Chitty, Treatise on Pleading and Parties to Actions 164(1892).In 1710, the first English copyright statute, the Statute ofAnne, was enacted to protect published books. 8 Anne ch.19 (1710). Under the Statute of Anne, damages for infringement were set at "one Penny for every Sheet which shall befound in [the infringer's] custody, either printed or printing,published, or exposed to Sale," half ("one Moiety") to go tothe Crown and half to the copyright owner, and were "to berecovered . . . by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information."$ 1. Like the earlier practice with regard to common-lawcopyright claims for damages, actions seeking damagesunder the Statute of Anne were tried in courts of law. See523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN350 FELTNER v. COLUMBIA PICTURES TELEVISION, INC.Opinion of the CourtBeckford v. Hood, 7 T. R. 621, 627, 101 Eng. Rep. 1164, 1167(K. B. 1798) (opinion of Kenyon, C. J.) ("[T]he statute havingvested that right in the author, the common law gives theremedy by action on the case for the violation of it").The practice of trying copyright damages actions at lawbefore juries was followed in this country, where statutorycopyright protections were enacted even before adoption ofthe Constitution. In 1783, the Continental Congress passeda resolution recommending that the States secure copyrightprotections for authors. See U. S. Copyright Office, Copyright Enactments: Laws Passed in the United States Since1783 Relating to Copyright, Bulletin No. 3, p. 1 (rev. ed. 1963)(hereinafter Copyright Enactments). Twelve States (all except Delaware) responded by enacting copyright statutes,each of which provided a cause of action for damages, andnone of which made any reference to equity jurisdiction. Atleast three of these state statutes expressly stated that damages were to be recovered through actions at law, see id., at2 (in Connecticut, damages for double the value of the infringed copy "to be recovered . . . in any court of law in thisState"); id., at 17 (in Georgia, similar damages enforceable"in due course of law"); id., at 19 (in New York, similar damages enforceable in "any court of law"), while four othersprovided that damages would be recovered in an "action ofdebt," a prototypical action brought in a court of law beforea jury. See F. Maitland, Forms of Action at Common Law357 (1929) (hereinafter Maitland); see Copyright Enactments4-9 (in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island,damages enforceable by "action of debt"); id., at 12 (in SouthCarolina, damages of one shilling per sheet enforceable by"debt, bill, plaint or information"). Although these statuteswere short-lived, and hence few courts had occasion to interpret them, the available evidence suggests that the practicewas for copyright actions seeking damages to be tried to ajury. See Hudson & Goodwin v. Patten, 1 Root 133, 134523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN351Cite as: 523 U. S. 340 (1998)Opinion of the Court(Conn. Super. Ct. 1789) ( jury awarded copyright owner #100under Connecticut copyright statute).Moreover, three of the state statutes specifically author-ized an award of damages from a statutory range, just as$ 504(c) does today. See Copyright Enactments 4 (in Massachusetts, damages of not less than #5 and not more than#3,000);id., at 8 (in New Hampshire, damages of not lessthan #5 and not more than #1,000); id., at 9 (in Rhode Island,damages of not less than #5 and not more than #3,000). Although we have found no direct evidence of the practiceunder these statutes, there is no reason to suppose that suchactions were intended to deviate from the traditional practice: The damages were to be recovered by an "action ofdebt," see id., at 4-9, which was an action at law, see Maitland 357.In 1790, Congress passed the first federal copyright statute, the Copyright Act of 1790, which similarly authorizedthe awarding of damages for copyright infringements. Actof May 31, 1790, ch. 15, $$ 2, 6, 1 Stat. 124, 125. The Copyright Act of 1790 provided that damages for copyright infringement of published works would be "the sum of fiftycents for every sheet which shall be found in [the infringer's]possession, . . . to be recovered by action of debt in any courtof record in the United States, wherein the same is cognizable." $ 2. Like the Statute of Anne, the Copyright Act of1790 provided that half ("one moiety") of such damages wereto go to the copyright owner and half to the United States.For infringement of an unpublished manuscript, the statuteentitled a copyright owner to "all damages occasioned bysuch injury, to be recovered by a special action on the casefounded upon this act, in any court having cognizancethereof." $ 6.There is no evidence that the Copyright Act of 1790changed the practice of trying copyright actions for damagesin courts of law before juries. As we have noted, actions onthe case and actions of debt were actions at law for which a523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN352 FELTNER v. COLUMBIA PICTURES TELEVISION, INC.Opinion of the Courtjury was required. See supra, at 349, 350.6 Moreover, actions to recover damages under the Copyright Act of 1831--which differed from the Copyright Act of 1790 only in theamount (increased to $1 from 50 cents) authorized to be recovered for certain infringing sheets--were consistentlytried to juries. See, e. g., Backus v. Gould, 7 How. 798, 802(1849) ( jury awarded damages of $2,069.75); Reed v. Carusi,20 F. Cas. 431, 432 (No. 11,642) (CC Md. 1845) ( jury awardeddamages of $200); Millett v. Snowden, 17 F. Cas. 374, 375(No. 9,600) (SDNY 1844) ( jury awarded damages of $625);Dwight v. Appleton, 8 F. Cas. 183, 185 (No. 4,215) (SDNY1843) ( jury awarded damages of $2,000).Columbia does not dispute this historical evidence. Infact, Columbia makes no attempt to draw an analogy between an action for statutory damages under $ 504(c) and anyhistorical cause of action--including those actions for monetary relief that we have characterized as equitable, such asactions for disgorgement of improper profits. See Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S. 558, 570-571 (1990); Tull v. UnitedStates, 481 U. S., at 424. Rather, Columbia merely contendsthat statutory damages are clearly equitable in nature.We are not persuaded. We have recognized the "generalrule" that monetary relief is legal, Teamsters v. Terry, supra,at 570, and an award of statutory damages may serve purposes traditionally associated with legal relief, such as compensation and punishment. See Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S.,at 196 (actual damages are "traditional form of relief offeredin the courts of law"); Tull v. United States, 481 U. S., at 4226 The Copyright Act of 1790 did not provide for equitable remedies atall, and in Stevens v. Gladding, 17 How. 447 (1855), we held that, evenafter Congress had provided for equity jurisdiction under the CopyrightAct, see Act of Feb. 15, 1819, ch. 19, 3 Stat. 481, the statute's damagesprovision could not be enforced through a suit in equity. 17 How., at 455;see also Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617, 663 (1888) (Stevens v. Gladdingdetermined that "the penalties given by $ 7 of the copyright act of 1831cannot be enforced in a suit in equity").523US1 Unit: $U47 [04-29-00 21:09:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 523 U. S. 340 (1998)Opinion of the Court("Remedies intended to punish culpable individuals . . . wereissued by courts of law, not courts of equity"). Nor, as wehave previously stated, is a monetary remedy rendered equi-table simply because it is "not fixed or readily calculablefrom a fixed formula." Id., at 422, n. 7. And there is historical evidence that cases involving discretionary monetary re-lief were tried before juries. See,e. g., Coryell v. Colbaugh,1 N. J. L. 77 (1791) ( jury award of "exemplary damages" inan action on a promise of marriage). Accordingly, we mustconclude that the Seventh Amendment provides a right to ajury trial where the copyright owner elects to recover statutory damages.The right to a jury trial includes the right to have a jurydetermine the amount of statutory damages, if any, awardedto the copyright owner. It has long been recognized that"by the law the jury are judges of the damages." LordTownshend v. Hughes, 2 Mod. 150, 151, 86 Eng. Rep. 994,994-995 (C. P. 1677). Thus in Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S.474 (1935), the Court stated that "the common law rule as itexisted at the time of the adoption of the Constitution" wasthat "in cases where the amount of damages was uncertain[,]their assessment was a matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury that the Court should not alter it." Id., at480 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Andthere is overwhelming evidence that the consistent practiceat common law was for juries to award damages. See, e. g.,Duke of York v. Pilkington, 2 Show. 246, 89 Eng. Rep. 918(K. B. 1760) ( jury award of #100,000 in a slander action);Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 19, 98 Eng. Rep. 489, 499 (C. P. 1763)( jury award of #1,000 in an action of trespass); Huckle v.Money, 2 Wils. 205, 95 Eng. Rep. 768 (C. P. 1763) (upholdingjury award of #300 in an action for trespass, assault and imprisonment); Genay v. Norris, 1 S. C. L. 6, 7 (1784) ( juryaward of #400); Coryell v.

COLUMBIA PICTURES TELEVISION, INC.Opinion of the Courtages $ 2.2, p. 27 (1980) (describing "primacy of the jury in theawarding of damages").More specifically, this was the consistent practice in copy-right cases. InHudson & Goodwin v. Patten, 1 Root, at134, for example, a jury awarded a copyright owner #100under the Connecticut copyright statute, which permitteddamages in an amount double the value of the infringed copy.In addition, juries assessed the amount of damages under theCopyright Act of 1831, even though that statute, like theCopyright Act of 1790, fixed damages at a set amount perinfringing sheet. SeeBackus v. Gould, supra, at 802 ( juryawarded damages of $2,069.75); Reed v. Carusi, supra, at 432(same, but $200);Dwight v. Appleton, supra, at 185 (same,but $2,000); Millett v. Snowden, supra, at 375 (same, but$625).Relying onTull v. United States, supra, Columbia contends that the Seventh Amendment does not provide a rightto a jury determination of the amount of the award. InTull, we held that the Seventh Amendment grants a right toa jury trial on all issues relating to liability for civil penaltiesunder the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. $$ 1251, 1319(d),7 see481 U. S., at 425, but then went on to decide that Congresscould constitutionally authorize trial judges to assess theamount of the civil penalties, seeid., at 426-427.8 Accordingto Columbia, Tull demonstrates that a jury determination ofthe amount of statutory damages is not necessary "to preserve `the substance of the common-law right of trial byjury.'

S. 340 (1998)Scalia, J., concurring in judgmentIn Tull, however, we were presented with no evidence thatjuries historically had determined the amount of civil penalties to be paid to the Government.9 Moreover, the awardingof civil penalties to the Government could be viewed as analogous to sentencing in a criminal proceeding. See 481 U. S.,at 428 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart).10 Here, of course, there is no similar analogy, andthere is clear and direct historical evidence that juries, bothas a general matter and in copyright cases, set the amountof damages awarded to a successful plaintiff.
