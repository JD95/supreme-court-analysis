This case requires us to clarify the relationship betweenthe rights of employees under $ 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act), 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29U. S. C. $ 157, and the property rights of their employers.IThis case stems from the efforts of Local 919 of the UnitedFood and Commercial Workers Union, AFL-CIO, to organize employees at a retail store in Newington, Connecticut,owned and operated by petitioner Lechmere, Inc. The storeis located in the Lechmere Shopping Plaza, which occupies aroughly rectangular tract measuring approximately 880 feetfrom north to south and 740 feet from east to west. Lechmere's store is situated at the Plaza's south end, with themain parking lot to its north. A strip of 13 smaller "satellitestores" not owned by Lechmere runs along the west side ofthe Plaza, facing the parking lot. To the Plaza's east (wherethe main entrance is located) runs the Berlin Turnpike, afour-lane divided highway. The parking lot, however, doesnot abut the Turnpike; they are separated by a 46-foot-widegrassy strip, broken only by the Plaza's entrance. The parking lot is owned jointly by Lechmere and the developer ofthe satellite stores. The grassy strip is public property (except for a 4-foot-wide band adjoining the parking lot, whichbelongs to Lechmere).The union began its campaign to organize the store's 200employees, none of whom was represented by a union, inJune 1987. After a full-page advertisement in a local newspaper drew little response, nonemployee union organizersentered Lechmere's parking lot and began placing handbillson the windshields of cars parked in a corner of the lot usedmostly by employees.

NLRBOpinion of the Courtconfronted the organizers, informed them that Lechmereprohibited solicitation or handbill distribution of any kind onits property,1 and asked them to leave. They did so, andLechmere personnel removed the handbills. The union organizers renewed this handbilling effort in the parking loton several subsequent occasions; each time they were askedto leave and the handbills were removed. The organizersthen relocated to the public grassy strip, from where theyattempted to pass out handbills to cars entering the lot during hours (before opening and after closing) when the driverswere assumed to be primarily store employees. For onemonth, the union organizers returned daily to the grassystrip to picket Lechmere; after that, they picketed intermittently for another six months. They also recorded the license plate numbers of cars parked in the employee parkingarea; with the cooperation of the Connecticut Department ofMotor Vehicles, they thus secured the names and addressesof some 41 nonsupervisory employees (roughly 20% of thestore's total). The union sent four mailings to these employees; it also made some attempts to contact them by phone orhome visits. These mailings and visits resulted in onesigned union authorization card.1 Lechmere had established this policy several years prior to the union'sorganizing efforts. The store's official policy statement provided, in relevant part:"Non-associates [i. e., nonemployees] are prohibited from soliciting and distributing literature at all times anywhere on Company property, includingparking lots. Non-associates have no right of access to the non-workingareas and only to the public and selling areas of the store in connectionwith its public use." Brief for Petitioner 7.On each door to the store Lechmere had posted a 6- by 8-inch sign reading:"TO THE PUBLIC. No Soliciting, Canvassing, Distribution of Literature or Trespassing by Non-Employees in or on Premises." App. 115-116. Lechmere consistently enforced this policy inside the store as wellas on the parking lot (against, among others, the Salvation Army and theGirl Scouts).502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT531Cite as: 502 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAlleging that Lechmere had violated the NLRA by bar-ring the nonemployee organizers from its property, the unionfiled an unfair labor practice charge with respondent Na-tional Labor Relations Board (Board). Applying the criteria set forth by the Board in Fairmont Hotel Co., 282N. L. R. B. 139 (1986), an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)ruled in the union's favor. Lechmere, Inc., 295 N. L. R. B. 94(1988). He recommended that Lechmere be ordered, amongother things, to cease and desist from barring the union orga-nizers from the parking lot and to post in conspicuous placesin the store signs proclaiming in part:"WE WILL NOT prohibit representatives of Local 919,United Food and Commercial Workers, AFL-CIO (`theUnion') or any other labor organization, from distribut-ing union literature to our employees in the parking lotadjacent to our store in Newington, Connecticut, norwill we attempt to cause them to be removed from ourparking lot for attempting to do so." Ibid.The Board affirmed the ALJ's judgment and adopted the rec-ommended order, applying the analysis set forth in its opinion in Jean Country, 291 N. L. R. B. 11 (1988), which had bythen replaced the short-lived Fairmont Hotel approach.295 N. L. R. B. 92 (1989). A divided panel of the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Lechmere's petition for review and enforced the Board's order.914 F. 2d 313 (1990). This Court granted certiorari, 499U. S. 918 (1991). IIASection 7 of the NLRA provides in relevant part that"[e]mployees shall have the right to self-organization, toform, join, or assist labor organizations." 29 U. S. C. $ 157.Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, in turn, makes it an unfair laborpractice for an employer "to interfere with, restrain, or co-erce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT532 LECHMERE, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Court[$ 7]." 29 U. S. C. $ 158(a)(1). By its plain terms, thus, theNLRA confers rights only onemployees, not on unions ortheir nonemployee organizers. In NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 (1956), however, we recognized thatinsofar as the employees' "right of self-organization dependsin some measure on [their] ability . . . to learn the advantagesof self-organization from others,"id., at 113, $ 7 of the NLRAmay, in certain limited circumstances, restrict an employer'sright to exclude nonemployee union organizers from hisproperty. It is the nature of those circumstances that weexplore today.Babcock arose out of union attempts to organize employeesat a factory located on an isolated 100-acre tract. The company had a policy against solicitation and distribution of literature on its property, which it enforced against all groups.About 40% of the company's employees lived in a town ofsome 21,000 persons near the factory; the remainder werescattered over a 30-mile radius. Almost all employees droveto work in private cars and parked in a company lot thatadjoined the fenced-in plant area. The parking lot could bereached only by a 100-yard-long driveway connecting it to apublic highway. This driveway was mostly on companyowned land, except where it crossed a 31-foot-wide publicright-of-way adjoining the highway. Union organizers attempted to distribute literature from this right-of-way. Theunion also secured the names and addresses of some 100 employees (20% of the total) and sent them three mailings.Still other employees were contacted by telephone or homevisit.The union successfully challenged the company's refusal toallow nonemployee organizers onto its property before theBoard. While acknowledging that there were alternative,nontrespassory means whereby the union could communicatewith employees, the Board held that contact at the workplacewas preferable. The Babcock & Wilcox Co., 109 N. L. R. B.485, 493-494 (1954). "[T]he right to distribute is not ab502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT533Cite as: 502 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the Courtsolute, but must be accommodated to the circumstances.Where it is impossible or unreasonably difficult for a unionto distribute organizational literature to employees entirelyoff of the employer's premises, distribution on a nonworkingarea, such as the parking lot and the walkways between theparking lot and the gate, may be warranted." Id., at 493.Concluding that traffic on the highway made it unsafe for theunion organizers to distribute leaflets from the right-of-wayand that contacts through the mails, on the streets, at employees' homes, and over the telephone would be ineffective,the Board ordered the company to allow the organizers todistribute literature on the company's parking lot and exterior walkways. Id., at 486-487.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused to enforce the Board's order, NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 222F. 2d 316 (1955), and this Court affirmed. While recognizingthat "the Board has the responsibility of `applying the Act'sgeneral prohibitory language in the light of the infinite combinations of events which might be charged as violative ofits terms,' " 351 U. S., at 111-112 (quoting NLRB v. StoweSpinning Co., 336 U. S. 226, 231 (1949)), we explained thatthe Board had erred by failing to make the critical distinction between the organizing activities of employees (to whom$ 7 guarantees the right of self-organization) and nonemployees (to whom $ 7 applies only derivatively). Thus, while"[n]o restriction may be placed on the employees' right todiscuss self-organization among themselves, unless the employer can demonstrate that a restriction is necessary tomaintain production or discipline," 351 U. S., at 113 (emphasis added) (citing Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324U. S. 793, 803 (1945)), "no such obligation is owed nonemployee organizers," 351 U. S., at 113. As a rule, then, anemployer cannot be compelled to allow distribution of unionliterature by nonemployee organizers on his property. Aswith many other rules, however, we recognized an exception.Where "the location of a plant and the living quarters of the502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT534 LECHMERE, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Courtemployees place the employees beyond the reach of reason-able union efforts to communicate with them,"ibid., employers' property rights may be "required to yield to the extentneeded to permit communication of information on the rightto organize," id., at 112.Although we have not had occasion to apply Babcock'sanalysis in the ensuing decades, we have described it in casesarising in related contexts. Two such cases, Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 (1972), and Hudgens v.NLRB, 424 U. S. 507 (1976), involved activity by union sup-porters on employer-owned property. The principal issuein both cases was whether, based upon Food Employeesv. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U. S. 308 (1968), the FirstAmendment protected such activities. In both cases we rejected the First Amendment claims, and in Hudgens wemade it clear that Logan Valley was overruled. Having decided the cases on constitutional grounds, we remanded themto the Board for consideration of the union supporters' $ 7claims under Babcock. In both cases, we quoted approvingly Babcock's admonition that accommodation betweenemployees' $ 7 rights and employers' property rights "mustbe obtained with as little destruction of one as is consistentwith the maintenance of the other," 351 U. S., at 112. SeeCentral Hardware, supra, at 544; Hudgens, supra, at 521,522. There is no hint in Hudgens and Central Hardware,however, that our invocation of Babcock's language of "accommodation" was intended to repudiate or modify Babcock's holding that an employer need not accommodate nonemployee organizers unless the employees are otherwiseinaccessible. Indeed, in Central Hardware we expresslynoted that nonemployee organizers cannot claim even a limited right of access to a nonconsenting employer's propertyuntil "[a]fter the requisite need for access to the employer'sproperty has been shown." 407 U. S., at 545.If there was any question whether Central Hardware andHudgens changed $ 7 law, it should have been laid to rest by502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT535Cite as: 502 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the CourtSears, Roebuck & Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U. S. 180 (1978). Asin Central Hardware and Hudgens, the substantive $ 7 issuein Sears was a subsidiary one; the case's primary focus wason the circumstances under which the NLRA pre-emptsstate law. Among other things, we held in Sears that argu-able $ 7 claims do not pre-empt state trespass law, in largepart because the trespasses of nonemployee union organizersare "far more likely to be unprotected than protected," 436U. S., at 205; permitting state courts to evaluate such claims,therefore, does not "create an unacceptable risk of interference with conduct which the Board, and a court reviewingthe Board's decision, would find protected,"ibid. This hold-ing was based upon the following interpretation ofBabcock:"While Babcock indicates that an employer may not al-ways bar nonemployee union organizers from his property, his right to do so remains the general rule. Togain access,the union has the burden of showing thatno other reasonable means of communicating its organizational message to the employees exists or thatthe employer's access rules discriminate against unionsolicitation. That the burden imposed on the union isa heavy one is evidenced by the fact that the balancestruck by the Board and the courts under the Babcockaccommodation principle has rarely been in favor oftrespassory organizational activity." 436 U. S., at 205(emphasis added; footnotes omitted).We further noted that, in practice, nonemployee organi-zational trespassing had generally been prohibited exceptwhere "unique obstacles" prevented nontrespassory methodsof communication with the employees.Id., at 205-206, n. 41.BJean Country, as noted above, represents the Board'slatest attempt to implement the rights guaranteed by $ 7.It sets forth a three-factor balancing test:502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT536 LECHMERE, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Court"[I]n all access cases our essential concern will be [1]the degree of impairment of the Section 7 right if accessshould be denied, as it balances against [2] the degreeof impairment of the private property right if accessshould be granted. We view the consideration of [3] theavailability of reasonably effective alternative meansas especially significant in this balancing process." 291N. L. R. B., at 14.The Board conceded that this analysis was unlikely to fostercertainty and predictability in this corner of the law, butdeclared that "as with other legal questions involving multi-ple factors, the `nature of the problem, as revealed by unfolding variant situations, inevitably involves an evolutionaryprocess for its rational response, not a quick, definitive formula as a comprehensive answer.' " Ibid. (quoting Electrical Workers v. NLRB, 366 U. S. 667, 674 (1961)).Citing its role "as the agency with responsibility for implementing national labor policy," the Board maintains in thiscase thatJean Country is a reasonable interpretation of theNLRA entitled to judicial deference. Brief for Respondent18, and n. 8; Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. It is certainly true, and wehave long recognized, that the Board has the "special function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the com-plexities of industrial life."NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp.,373 U. S. 221, 236 (1963); see also Phelps Dodge Corp. v.NLRB, 313 U. S. 177, 196-197 (1941). Like other adminis-trative agencies, the NLRB is entitled to judicial deferencewhen it interprets an ambiguous provision of a statute thatit administers. See, e. g., NLRB v. Food & CommercialWorkers, 484 U. S. 112, 123 (1987); cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,842-843 (1984).Before we reach any issue of deference to the Board, how-ever, we must first determine whether Jean Country--atleast as applied to nonemployee organizational trespassing--is consistent with our past interpretation of $ 7. "Once we502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT537Cite as: 502 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the Courthave determined a statute's clear meaning, we adhere to thatdetermination under the doctrine ofstare decisis, and wejudge an agency's later interpretation of the statute againstour prior determination of the statute's meaning."MaislinIndustries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116,131 (1990).InBabcock, as explained above, we held that the Act drewa distinction "of substance," 351 U. S., at 113, between theunion activities of employees and nonemployees. In casesinvolving employee activities, we noted with approval, theBoard "balanced the conflicting interests of employees to receive information on self-organization on the company's property from fellow employees during nonworking time, withthe employer's right to control the use of his property." Id.,at 109-110. In cases involving nonemployee activities (likethose at issue in Babcock itself), however, the Board was notpermitted to engage in that same balancing (and we reversedthe Board for having done so). By reversing the Board'sinterpretation of the statute for failing to distinguish between the organizing activities of employees and nonemployees, we were saying, in Chevron terms, that $ 7 speaks tothe issue of nonemployee access to an employer's property.Babcock's teaching is straightforward: $ 7 simply does notprotect nonemployee union organizers except in the rare casewhere "the inaccessibility of employees makes ineffective thereasonable attempts by nonemployees to communicate withthem through the usual channels," 351 U. S., at 112. Ourreference to "reasonable" attempts was nothing more thana commonsense recognition that unions need not engage inextraordinary feats to communicate with inaccessible employees--not an endorsement of the view (which we expressly rejected) that the Act protects "reasonable" trespasses. Where reasonable alternative means of access exist,$ 7's guarantees do not authorize trespasses by nonemployeeorganizers, even (as we noted in Babcock, ibid.) "under . . .reasonable regulations" established by the Board.502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT538 LECHMERE, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the CourtJean Country, which applies broadly to "all access cases,"291 N. L. R. B., at 14, misapprehends this critical point. Itsprincipal inspiration derives not from Babcock, but from thefollowing sentence in Hudgens: "[T]he locus of th[e] accommodation [between $ 7 rights and private property rights]may fall at differing points along the spectrum depending onthe nature and strength of the respective $ 7 rights and private property rights asserted in any given context." 424U. S., at 522. From this sentence the Board concluded thatit was appropriate to approach every case by balancing $ 7rights against property rights, with alternative means of access thrown in as nothing more than an "especially significant" consideration. As explained above, however, Hudgens did not purport to modify Babcock, much less to alterit fundamentally in the way Jean Country suggests. To saythat our cases require accommodation between employees'and employers' rights is a true but incomplete statement,for the cases also go far in establishing the locus of thataccommodation where nonemployee organizing is at issue.So long as nonemployee union organizers have reasonableaccess to employees outside an employer's property, the requisite accommodation has taken place. It is only where suchaccess is infeasible that it becomes necessary and proper totake the accommodation inquiry to a second level, balancingthe employees' and employers' rights as described in theHudgens dictum. See Sears, 436 U. S., at 205; CentralHardware, 407 U. S., at 545. At least as applied to nonemployees, Jean Country impermissibly conflates these twostages of the inquiry--thereby significantly eroding Babcock's general rule that "an employer may validly post hisproperty against nonemployee distribution of union literature," 351 U. S., at 112. We reaffirm that general rule today,and reject the Board's attempt to recast it as a multifactorbalancing test.502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT539Cite as: 502 U. S. 527 (1992)Opinion of the CourtCThe threshold inquiry in this case, then, is whether thefacts here justify application ofBabcock's inaccessibility ex-ception. The ALJ below observed that "the facts hereinconvince me that reasonable alternative means [of communi-cating with Lechmere's employees] were available to theUnion," 295 N. L. R. B., at 99 (emphasis added).2 Reviewingthe ALJ's decision underJean Country, however, the Boardreached a different conclusion on this point, asserting that"there was no reasonable, effective alternative means available for the Union to communicate its message to [Lechmere's] employees." Id., at 93.We cannot accept the Board's conclusion, because it "rest[s]on erroneous legal foundations," Babcock, supra, at 112; seealsoNLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278, 290-292 (1965). As wehave explained, the exception to Babcock's rule is a narrowone. It does not apply wherever nontrespassory access toemployees may be cumbersome or less-than-ideally effective,but only where "thelocation of a plant and the living quarters of the employees place the employees beyond the reachof reasonable union efforts to communicate with them," 351U. S., at 113 (emphasis added). Classic examples includelogging camps, see NLRB v. Lake Superior Lumber Corp.,167 F. 2d 147 (CA6 1948); mining camps, seeAlaska BariteCo., 197 N. L. R. B. 1023 (1972), enforced mem., 83 LRRM2992 (CA9), cert. denied, 414 U. S. 1025 (1973); and mountainresort hotels, see NLRB v. S & H Grossinger's Inc., 372 F. 2d2 Under the (pre-Jean Country) Fairmont Hotel analysis applied by theALJ, it was only where the employees' $ 7 rights and an employer's property rights were deemed "relatively equal in strength," Fairmont HotelCo., 282 N. L. R. B. 139, 142 (1986), that the adequacy of nontrespassorymeans of communication became relevant. Because the ALJ found thatthe $ 7 rights involved here outweighed Lechmere's property rights, hehad no need to address the latter issue. He did so, he explained, onlybecause of the possibility that his evaluation of the relative weights of therights might not be upheld. 295 N. L. R. B. 94, 99 (1988).502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT540 LECHMERE, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Court26 (CA2 1967). Babcock's exception was crafted preciselyto protect the $ 7 rights of those employees who, by virtueof their employment, are isolated from the ordinary flow ofinformation that characterizes our society. The union's burden of establishing such isolation is, as we have explained,"a heavy one," Sears, supra, at 205, and one not satisfied bymere conjecture or the expression of doubts concerning theeffectiveness of nontrespassory means of communication.The Board's conclusion in this case that the union had noreasonable means short of trespass to make Lechmere's em-ployees aware of its organizational efforts is based on a misunderstanding of the limited scope of this exception. Because the employees do not reside on Lechmere's property,they are presumptively not "beyond the reach," Babcock, 351U. S., at 113, of the union's message. Although the employees live in a large metropolitan area (Greater Hartford), thatfact does not in itself render them "inaccessible" in the sensecontemplated by Babcock. See Monogram Models, Inc., 192N. L. R. B. 705, 706 (1971). Their accessibility is suggestedby the union's success in contacting a substantial percentageof them directly, via mailings, phone calls, and home visits.Such direct contact, of course, is not a necessary element of"reasonably effective" communication; signs or advertisingalso may suffice. In this case, the union tried advertising inlocal newspapers; the Board said that this was not reasonably effective because it was expensive and might not reachthe employees. 295 N. L. R. B., at 93. Whatever the meritsof that conclusion, other alternative means of communicationwere readily available. Thus, signs (displayed, for example,from the public grassy strip adjoining Lechmere's parkinglot) would have informed the employees about the union'sorganizational efforts. (Indeed, union organizers picketedthe shopping center's main entrance for months as employeescame and went every day.) Access to employees, not success in winning them over, is the critical issue--althoughsuccess, or lack thereof, may be relevant in determining502us2$31N 09-08-95 14:44:54 PAGES OPINPGT541Cite as: 502 U. S. 527 (1992)White, J., dissentingwhether reasonable access exists. Because the union in thiscase failed to establish the existence of any "unique obstacles," Sears, 436 U. S., at 205-206, n. 41, that frustrated ac-cess to Lechmere's employees, the Board erred in concludingthat Lechmere committed an unfair labor practice by barringthe nonemployee organizers from its property.The judgment of the First Circuit is therefore reversed,and enforcement of the Board's order is denied.
