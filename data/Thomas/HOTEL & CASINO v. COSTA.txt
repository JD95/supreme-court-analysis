The question before us in this case is whether a plaintiffmust present direct evidence of discrimination in order toobtain a mixed-motive instruction under Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Civil RightsAct of 1991 (1991 Act). We hold that direct evidence is notrequired.IASince 1964, Title VII has made it an "unlawful employmentpractice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any indi*Ann Elizabeth Reesman, Katherine Y.

In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,490 U. S. 228 (1989), the Court considered whether an employment decision is made "because of " sex in a "mixed-motive" case,i. e., where both legitimate and illegitimatereasons motivated the decision. The Court concluded that,under $ 2000e-2(a)(1), an employer could "avoid a finding ofliability . . . by proving that it would have made the samedecision even if it had not allowed gender to play such arole."Id., at 244; see id., at 261, n. (White, J., concurring injudgment); id., at 261 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The Court was divided, however, over the predicatequestion of when the burden of proof may be shifted to anemployer to prove the affirmative defense.Justice Brennan, writing for a plurality of four Justices,would have held that "when a plaintiff . . . proves that hergender played a motivating part in an employment decision,the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by provingby a preponderance of the evidence that it would have madethe same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff 's gender into account." Id., at 258 (emphasis added). The plurality did not, however, "suggest a limitation on the possibleways of proving that [gender] stereotyping played a motivating role in an employment decision." Id., at 251-252.Justice White and Justice O'Connor both concurred inthe judgment. Justice White would have held that the casewas governed by Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429U. S. 274 (1977), and would have shifted the burden to theemployer only when a plaintiff "show[ed] that the unlawfulmotive was a substantial factor in the adverse employmentaction." Price Waterhouse, supra, at 259. Justice O'Connor, like Justice White, would have required the plaintiff toshow that an illegitimate consideration was a "substantialfactor" in the employment decision. 490 U. S., at 276. But,under Justice O'Connor's view, "the burden on the issue539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN94 DESERT PALACE, INC. v. COSTAOpinion of the Courtof causation" would shift to the employer only where "adisparate treatment plaintiff [could] show bydirect evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factorin the decision."Ibid. (emphasis added).Two years after Price Waterhouse, Congress passed the1991 Act "in large part [as] a response to a series of decisionsof this Court interpreting the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and1964." Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 250(1994). In particular, $ 107 of the 1991 Act, which is at issuein this case, "respond[ed]" to Price Waterhouse by "settingforth standards applicable in `mixed motive' cases" in twonew statutory provisions.1 511 U. S., at 251. The first es-tablishes an alternative for proving that an "unlawful employment practice" has occurred:"Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, anunlawful employment practice is established when thecomplaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor forany employment practice, even though other factors alsomotivated the practice." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(m).The second provides that, with respect to "a claim in whichan individual proves a violation under section 2000e-2(m),"the employer has a limited affirmative defense that does notabsolve it of liability, but restricts the remedies available toa plaintiff. The available remedies include only declaratoryrelief, certain types of injunctive relief, and attorney's feesand costs. $ 2000e-5(g)(2)(B).2 In order to avail itself of1 This case does not require us to decide when, if ever, $ 107 appliesoutside of the mixed-motive context.2 Title 42 U.

S. 90 (2003)Opinion of the Courtthe affirmative defense, the employer must "demonstrat[e]that [it] would have taken the same action in the absence ofthe impermissible motivating factor." Ibid.Since the passage of the 1991 Act, the Courts of Appealshave divided over whether a plaintiff must prove by directevidence that an impermissible consideration was a "motivating factor" in an adverse employment action. See 42U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(m). Relying primarily onJustice O'Connor's concurrence in Price Waterhouse, a number of courtshave held that direct evidence is required to establish liability under $ 2000e-2(m). See, e. g., Mohr v. Dustrol, Inc., 306F. 3d 636, 640-641 (CA8 2002);Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Ma-sonry, Inc., 199 F. 3d 572, 580 (CA1 1999); Trotter v. Boardof Trustees of Univ. of Ala., 91 F. 3d 1449, 1453-1454 (CA111996); Fuller v. Phipps, 67 F. 3d 1137, 1142 (CA4 1995). Inthe decision below, however, the Ninth Circuit concluded oth-erwise. See infra, at 97-98.BPetitioner Desert Palace, Inc., dba Caesar's Palace Hotel &Casino of Las Vegas, Nevada, employed respondent Catharina Costa as a warehouse worker and heavy equipment op-erator. Respondent was the only woman in this job and inher local Teamsters bargaining unit.Respondent experienced a number of problems with management and her co-workers that led to an escalating seriesof disciplinary sanctions, including informal rebukes, a denialof privileges, and suspension. Petitioner finally terminatedrespondent after she was involved in a physical altercationin a warehouse elevator with fellow Teamsters member Her-bert Gerber. Petitioner disciplined both employees becausethe facts surrounding the incident were in dispute, butattributable only to the pursuit of a claim under section 2000e-2(m) of thistitle; and"(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order requiring any admission,reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment, described in subparagraph(A)."539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN96 DESERT PALACE, INC. v. COSTAOpinion of the CourtGerber, who had a clean disciplinary record, received only a5-day suspension.Respondent subsequently filed this lawsuit against peti-tioner in the United States District Court for the District ofNevada, asserting claims of sex discrimination and sexualharassment under Title VII. The District Court dismissedthe sexual harassment claim, but allowed the claim for sexdiscrimination to go to the jury. At trial, respondent presented evidence that (1) she was singled out for "intense`stalking' " by one of her supervisors, (2) she receivedharsher discipline than men for the same conduct, (3) shewas treated less favorably than men in the assignment ofovertime, and (4) supervisors repeatedly "stack[ed]" her dis-ciplinary record and "frequently used or tolerated" sex-basedslurs against her. 299 F. 3d 838, 845-846 (CA9 2002).Based on this evidence, the District Court denied petitioner's motion for judgment as a matter of law, and submittedthe case to the jury with instructions, two of which are relevant here. First, without objection from petitioner, the Dis-trict Court instructed the jury that " `[t]he plaintiff has theburden of proving . . . by a preponderance of the evidence' "that she " `suffered adverse work conditions' " and that hersex " `was a motivating factor in any such work conditionsimposed upon her.' " Id., at 858.Second, the District Court gave the jury the followingmixed-motive instruction:" `You have heard evidence that the defendant's treat-ment of the plaintiff was motivated by the plaintiff 's sexand also by other lawful reasons. If you find that theplaintiff 's sex was a motivating factor in the defendant'streatment of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to yourverdict, even if you find that the defendant's conduct wasalso motivated by a lawful reason." `However, if you find that the defendant's treatment ofthe plaintiff was motivated by both gender and lawfulreasons, you must decide whether the plaintiff is entitled539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN97Cite as: 539 U. S. 90 (2003)Opinion of the Courtto damages. The plaintiff is entitled to damages unlessthe defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant would have treated plaintiffsimilarly even if the plaintiff 's gender had played no rolein the employment decision.' " Ibid.Petitioner unsuccessfully objected to this instruction, claim-ing that respondent had failed to adduce "direct evidence"that sex was a motivating factor in her dismissal or in anyof the other adverse employment actions taken against her.The jury rendered a verdict for respondent, awarding back-pay, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. TheDistrict Court denied petitioner's renewed motion for judg-ment as a matter of law.The Court of Appeals initially vacated and remanded,holding that the District Court had erred in giving themixed-motive instruction because respondent had failed topresent "substantial evidence of conduct or statements bythe employer directly reflecting discriminatory animus."268 F. 3d 882, 884 (CA9 2001). In addition, the panel concluded that petitioner was entitled to judgment as a matterof law on the termination claim because the evidence wasinsufficient to prove that respondent was "terminated be-cause she was a woman." Id., at 890.The Court of Appeals reinstated the District Court's judg-ment after rehearing the case en banc. 299 F. 3d 838 (CA92002). The en banc court saw no need to decide whetherJustice O'Connor's concurrence in Price Waterhouse con-trolled because it concluded thatJustice O'Connor's refer-ences to "direct evidence" had been "wholly abrogated" bythe 1991 Act. 299 F. 3d, at 850. And, turning "to the lan-guage" of $ 2000e-2(m), the court observed that the statute"imposes no special [evidentiary] requirement and does notreference `direct evidence.' "Id., at 853. Accordingly, thecourt concluded that a "plaintiff . . . may establish a violationthrough a preponderance of evidence (whether direct or cir-cumstantial) that a protected characteristic played `a moti539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN98 DESERT PALACE, INC. v. COSTAOpinion of the Courtvating factor.' " Id., at 853-854 (footnote omitted). Basedon that standard, the Court of Appeals held that respondent's evidence was sufficient to warrant a mixed-motive in-struction and that a reasonable jury could have found thatrespondent's sex was a "motivating factor in her treatment."Id., at 859. Four judges of the en banc panel dissented, relying in large part on "the reasoning of the prior opinion ofthe three-judge panel."Id., at 866.We granted certiorari. 537 U. S. 1099 (2003).IIThis case provides us with the first opportunity to considerthe effects of the 1991 Act on jury instructions in mixedmotive cases. Specifically, we must decide whether a plain-tiff must present direct evidence of discrimination in orderto obtain a mixed-motive instruction under 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e-2(m). Petitioner's argument on this point proceedsin three steps: (1) Justice O'Connor's opinion is the holdingof Price Waterhouse; (2)Justice O'Connor's Price Waterhouse opinion requires direct evidence of discrimination be-fore a mixed-motive instruction can be given; and (3) the1991 Act does nothing to abrogate that holding. Like theCourt of Appeals, we see no need to address which of theopinions in Price Waterhouse is controlling: the third stepof petitioner's argument is flawed, primarily because it isinconsistent with the text of $ 2000e-2(m).Our precedents make clear that the starting point for ouranalysis is the statutory text. See Connecticut Nat. Bankv.Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1992). And where, ashere, the words of the statute are unambiguous, the " `judicial inquiry is complete.' " Id., at 254 (quoting Rubin v.United States, 449 U. S. 424, 430 (1981)). Section 2000e-2(m) unambiguously states that a plaintiff need only "demon-strat[e]" that an employer used a forbidden considerationwith respect to "any employment practice." On its face, thestatute does not mention, much less require, that a plaintiff539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN99Cite as: 539 U. S. 90 (2003)Opinion of the Courtmake a heightened showing through direct evidence. In-deed, petitioner concedes as much. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.Moreover, Congress explicitly defined the term "demon-strates" in the 1991 Act, leaving little doubt that no specialevidentiary showing is required. Title VII defines the term" `demonstrates' " as to "mee[t] the burdens of production andpersuasion." $ 2000e(m). If Congress intended the term" `demonstrates' " to require that the "burdens of productionand persuasion" be met by direct evidence or some otherheightened showing, it could have made that intent clear byincluding language to that effect in $ 2000e(m). Its failureto do so is significant, for Congress has been unequivocalwhen imposing heightened proof requirements in other circumstances, including in other provisions of Title 42. See,e. g., 8 U. S. C. $ 1158(a)(2)(B) (stating that an asylum application may not be filed unless an alien "demonstrates by clearand convincing evidence" that the application was filedwithin one year of the alien's arrival in the United States);42 U. S. C. $ 5851(b)(3)(D) (providing that "[r]elief may not beordered" against an employer in retaliation cases involvingwhistleblowers under the Atomic Energy Act where the employer is able to "demonstrat[e] by clear and convincingevidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of such behavior" (emphasisadded)); cf. Price Waterhouse, 490 U. S., at 253 (pluralityopinion) ("Only rarely have we required clear and convincingproof where the action defended against seeks only conventional relief ").In addition, Title VII's silence with respect to the type ofevidence required in mixed-motive cases also suggests thatwe should not depart from the "[c]onventional rul[e] of civillitigation [that] generally appl[ies] in Title VII cases." Ibid.That rule requires a plaintiff to prove his case "by a preponderance of the evidence," ibid., using "direct or circumstantial evidence," Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,460 U. S. 711, 714, n. 3 (1983). We have often acknowledged539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN100 DESERT PALACE, INC. v. COSTAOpinion of the Courtthe utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases.For instance, inReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products,Inc., 530 U. S. 133 (2000), we recognized that evidence that adefendant's explanation for an employment practice is "unworthy of credence" is "one form of circumstantial evidencethat is probative of intentional discrimination."Id., at 147(emphasis added). The reason for treating circumstantialand direct evidence alike is both clear and deep rooted: "Cir-cumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also bemore certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evi-dence."Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500,508, n. 17 (1957).The adequacy of circumstantial evidence also extends beyond civil cases; we have never questioned the sufficiency ofcircumstantial evidence in support of a criminal conviction,even though proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required.See Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121, 140 (1954)(observing that, in criminal cases, circumstantial evidenceis "intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence").And juries are routinely instructed that "[t]he law makesno distinction between the weight or value to be given toeither direct or circumstantial evidence." 1A K. O'Malley,J. Grenig, & W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions,Criminal $ 12.04 (5th ed. 2000); see also 4 L. Sand, J. Siffert,W. Loughlin, S. Reiss, & N. Batterman, Modern Federal JuryInstructions || 74.01 (2002) (model instruction 74-2). It isnot surprising, therefore, that neither petitioner nor itsamici curiae can point to any other circumstance in whichwe have restricted a litigant to the presentation of directevidence absent some affirmative directive in a statute. Tr.of Oral Arg. 13.Finally, the use of the term "demonstrates" in other provisions of Title VII tends to show further that $ 2000e-2(m)does not incorporate a direct evidence requirement. See,e. g., 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i), 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Forinstance, $ 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) requires an employer to "demon539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN101Cite as: 539 U. S. 90 (2003)Opinion of the Courtstrat[e] that [it] would have taken the same action in theabsence of the impermissible motivating factor" in orderto take advantage of the partial affirmative defense. Dueto the similarity in structure between that provision and$ 2000e-2(m), it would be logical to assume that the term"demonstrates" would carry the same meaning with respectto both provisions. But when pressed at oral argumentabout whether direct evidence is required before the partialaffirmative defense can be invoked, petitioner did not "agreethat . . . the defendant or the employer has any heightenedstandard" to satisfy. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Absent some con-gressional indication to the contrary, we decline to give thesame term in the same Act a different meaning dependingon whether the rights of the plaintiff or the defendant are atissue. See Commissioner v. Lundy, 516 U. S. 235, 250 (1996)("The interrelationship and close proximity of these provisions of the statute `presents a classic case for application ofthe "normal rule of statutory construction that identicalwords used in different parts of the same act are intendedto have the same meaning" ' " (quoting Sullivan v. Stroop,496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990))).For the reasons stated above, we agree with the Courtof Appeals that no heightened showing is required under$ 2000e-2(m).3* * *In order to obtain an instruction under $ 2000e-2(m), aplaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence,that "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice." Because directevidence of discrimination is not required in mixed-motive3 Of course, in light of our conclusion that direct evidence is not requiredunder $ 2000e-2(m), we need not address the second question on which wegranted certiorari: "What are the appropriate standards for lower courtsto follow in making a direct evidence determination in `mixed-motive'cases under Title VII?"

COSTAO'Connor, J., concurringcases, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Dis-trict Court did not abuse its discretion in giving a mixedmotive instruction to the jury. Accordingly, the judgmentof the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
