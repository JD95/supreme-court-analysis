Petitioner is accordingly pro-hibited as a matter of law from obtaining a lesser includedoffense instruction on the offense described by $ 2113(b).IOn September 9, 1997, petitioner Floyd J. Carter donneda ski mask and entered the Collective Federal Savings Bankin Hamilton Township, New Jersey. Carter confronted acustomer who was exiting the bank and pushed her backinside. She screamed, startling others in the bank. Unde-terred, Carter ran into the bank and leaped over the customer service counter and through one of the teller windows.One of the tellers rushed into the manager's office. Meanwhile, Carter opened several teller drawers and emptied themoney into a bag. After having removed almost $16,000 incurrency, Carter jumped back over the counter and fled fromthe scene. Later that day, the police apprehended him.A grand jury indicted Carter, charging him with violat-ing $ 2113(a). While not contesting the basic facts of theepisode, Carter pleaded not guilty on the theory that hehad not taken the bank's money "by force and violence,or by intimidation," as $ 2113(a) requires. Before trial, Carter moved that the court instruct the jury on the offensedescribed by $ 2113(b) as a lesser included offense of the offense described by $ 2113(a). The District Court, relying530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN260 CARTER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courton United States v. Mosley, 126 F. 3d 200 (CA3 1997),1 de-nied the motion in a preliminary ruling. At the close of theGovernment's case, the District Court denied Carter's mo-tion for a judgment of acquittal and indicated that the preliminary ruling denying the lesser included offense instruc-tion would stand. The jury, instructed on $ 2113(a) alone,returned a guilty verdict, and the District Court enteredjudgment pursuant to that verdict.The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in anunpublished opinion, relying on its earlier decision inMosley.Judgment order reported at 185 F. 3d 863 (1999). While theNinth Circuit agrees with the Third that a lesser offenseinstruction is precluded in this context, see United States v.Gregory, 891 F. 2d 732, 734 (CA9 1989), other Circuits haveheld to the contrary, see United States v. Walker, 75 F. 3d178, 180 (CA4 1996); United States v. Brittain, 41 F. 3d 1409,1410 (CA10 1994). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 528 U. S. 1060 (1999), and now affirm.IIIn Schmuck, supra, we were called upon to interpretFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(c)'s provision that"[t]he defendant may be found guilty of an offense neces-sarily included in the offense charged." We held that thisprovision requires application of an elements test, underwhich "one offense is not `necessarily included' in anotherunless the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of theelements of the charged offense." 489 U.

When the elements of such a "lesser offense" are a subsetof the elements of the charged offense, the "lesser offense" attains thestatus of a "lesser included offense."530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN261Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)Opinion of the Courtelements test requires "a textual comparison of criminalstatutes," an approach that, we explained, lends itself to"certain and predictable" outcomes. Id., at 720.3Applying the test, we held that the offense of tamperingwith an odometer, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1984 and 1990c(a) (1982 ed.),is not a lesser included offense of mail fraud, 18 U. S. C.$ 1341. We explained that mail fraud requires two ele-ments--(1) having devised or intending to devise a schemeto defraud (or to perform specified fraudulent acts), and(2) use of the mail for the purpose of executing, or attemptingto execute, the scheme (or specified fraudulent acts). Thelesser offense of odometer tampering, however, requires theelement of knowingly and willfully causing an odometer tobe altered, an element that is absent from the offense of mailfraud. Accordingly, the elements of odometer tamperingare not a subset of the elements of mail fraud, and a defendant charged with the latter is not entitled to an in-struction on the former under Rule 31(c).Schmuck, supra,at 721-722.Turning to the instant case, the Government contendsthat three elements required by $ 2113(b)'s first paragraphare not required by $ 2113(a): (1) specific intent to steal; (2)asportation; and (3) valuation exceeding $1,000. The statute provides:"$ 2113. Bank robbery and incidental crimes"(a) Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person orpresence of another, or obtains or attempts to obtainby extortion any property or money or any other thingof value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control,3 A defendant must also satisfy the "independent prerequisite . . . thatthe evidence at trial . . . be such that a jury could rationally find thedefendant guilty of the lesser offense, yet acquit him of the greater."Schmuck, 489 U. S., at 716, n. 8 (citing Keeble v. United States, 412 U. S.205, 208 (1973)). In light of our holding that petitioner fails to satisfy theelements test, we need not address the latter requirement in this case.530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN262 CARTER v.

First, whereassubsection (b) requires that the defendant act "with in-tent to steal or purloin," subsection (a) contains no similar requirement. Second, whereas subsection (b) requiresthat the defendant "tak[e] and carr[y] away" the property,subsection (a) only requires that the defendant "tak[e]"the property. Third, whereas the first paragraph of subsection (b) requires that the property have a "value ex-ceeding $1,000," subsection (a) contains no valuation requirement. These extra clauses in subsection (b) "cannot beregarded as mere surplusage; [they] mea[n] something."Potter v. United States, 155 U. S. 438, 446 (1894).Carter urges that the foregoing application ofSchmuck'selements test is too rigid and submits that ordinary principles of statutory interpretation are relevant to the Schmuckinquiry. We do not dispute the latter proposition. The530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN263Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)Opinion of the CourtSchmuck test, after all, requires an exercise in statutoryinterpretation before the comparison of elements may bemade, and it is only sensible that normal principles of statu-tory construction apply. We disagree, however, with petitioner's conclusion that such principles counsel a departurein this case from what is indicated by a straightforward reading of the text. IIIWe begin with the arguments pertinent to the general re-lationship between $$ 2113(a) and (b). Carter first contendsthat the structure of $ 2113 supports the view that subsec-tion (b) is a lesser included offense of subsection (a). Hepoints to subsection (c) of $ 2113, which imposes criminalliability on a person who knowingly "receives, possesses,conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of, any propertyor money or other thing of value which has been taken orstolen from a bank . . . in violation of subsection (b)." (Em-phasis added.) It would be anomalous, posits Carter, forsubsection (c) to apply--as its text plainly provides--only tothe fence who receives property from a violator of subsection (b) but not to the fence who receives property froma violator of subsection (a). The anomaly disappears, heconcludes, only if subsection (b) is always violated whensubsection (a) is violated--i. e., only if subsection (b) is alesser included offense of subsection (a).But Carter's anomaly--even if it truly exists--is only ananomaly. Petitioner does not claim, and we tend to doubt,that it rises to the level of absurdity. Cf. Green v. BockLaundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 509-511 (1989); id., at527 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). For example, itmay be that violators of subsection (a) generally act alone,while violators of subsection (b) are commonly assisted byfences. In such a state of affairs, a sensible Congress mayhave thought it necessary to punish only the fences of prop-erty taken in violation of subsection (b). Or Congress mayhave thought that a defendant who violates subsection (a)530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN264 CARTER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtusually--if not inevitably--also violates subsection (b), sothat the fence may be punished by reference to that latterviolation. In any event, nothing in subsection (c) purportsto redefine the elements required by the text of subsections(a) and (b).Carter's second argument is more substantial. He submits that, insofar as subsections (a) and (b) are similar tothe common-law crimes of robbery and larceny, we must assume that subsections (a) and (b) require the same elementsas their common-law predecessors, at least absent Congress'affirmative indication (whether in text or legislative history)of an intent to displace the common-law scheme. While we(and the Government) agree that the statutory crimes atissue here bear a close resemblance to the common-lawcrimes of robbery and larceny, see Brief for United States 29(citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *229, *232); accord,post, at 278-279, that observation is beside the point. Thecanon on imputing common-law meaning applies only whenCongress makes use of a statutory term with establishedmeaning at common law, and Carter does not point to anysuch term in the text of the statute.This limited scope of the canon on imputing common-lawmeaning has long been understood. In Morissette v. UnitedStates, 342 U. S. 246 (1952), for example, we articulated thecanon in this way:"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which areaccumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts thecluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowedword in the body of learning from which it was takenand the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mindunless otherwise instructed. In such case, absence ofcontrary direction may be taken as satisfaction withwidely accepted definitions, not as a departure fromthem." Id., at 263 (emphasis added).530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN265Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIn other words, a "cluster of ideas" from the common lawshould be imported into statutory text only when Congressemploys a common-law term, and not when, as here, Con-gress simply describes an offense analogous to a commonlaw crime without using common-law terms.We made this clear in United States v. Wells, 519 U. S.482 (1997). At issue was whether 18 U. S. C. $ 1014--whichpunishes a person who "knowingly makes any false statement or report . . . for the purpose of influencing in anyway the action" of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationinsured bank "upon any application, advance, . . . commit-ment, or loan"--requires proof of the materiality of the "falsestatement." The defendants contended that since material-ity was a required element of "false statement"-type offensesat common law, it must also be required by $ 1014. AlthoughJustice Stevens in dissent thought the argument to bemeritorious, we rejected it:"[F]undamentally, we disagree with our colleague'sapparent view that any term that is an element of acommon-law crime carries with it every other aspect ofthat common-law crime when the term is used in a statute. Justice Stevens seems to assume that because`false statement' is an element of perjury, and perjurycriminalizes only material statements, a statute crimi-nalizing `false statements' covers only material statements. By a parity of reasoning, because common-lawperjury involved statements under oath, a statute criminalizing a false statement would reach only statementsunder oath. It is impossible to believe that Congressintended to impose such restrictions sub silentio, how-ever, and soour rule on imputing common-law mean-ing to statutory terms does not sweep so broadly." 519U. S., at 492, n. 10 (emphasis added; citation omitted).44 The dissent claims that our decision in United States v. Wells, 519 U. S.482 (1997), is not in point because we went on in Wells to discuss theevolution of the statute (specifically, a recodification of numerous sections),530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN266 CARTER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtSimilarly, in United States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407 (1957),we declined to look to the analogous common-law crime because the statutory term at issue--"stolen"--had no meaning at common law. See id., at 411-412 ("[W]hile `stolen'is constantly identified with larceny, the term was never atcommon law equated or exclusively dedicated to larceny"(internal quotation marks omitted)).By contrast, we have not hesitated to turn to the commonlaw for guidance when the relevant statutory text does contain a term with an established meaning at common law. InNeder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999), for example, weaddressed whether materiality is required by federal statutes punishing a "scheme or artifice to defraud." Id., at 20,and 20-21, nn. 3-4 (citing 18 U. S. C. $$ 1341, 1343, 1344).Unlike the statute in Wells, which contained no commonlaw term, these statutes did include a common-law term--"defraud." 527 U. S., at 22. Because common-law fraud required proof of materiality, we applied the canon to hold thatthese federal statutes implicitly contain a materiality requirement as well. Id., at 23. Similarly, in Evans v. UnitedStates, 504 U. S. 255, 261-264 (1992), we observed that "extortion" in 18 U. S. C. $ 1951 was a common-law term, andproceeded to interpret this term by reference to its meaningat common law.Here, it is undisputed that "robbery" and "larceny" areterms with established meanings at common law. But neiwhich revealed Congress' apparent care in retaining a materiality requirement in certain sections while omitting it in others, such as the one beforeus in Wells. According to the dissent, a similar statutory evolution is notpresent here. See post, at 286. But, even assuming the dissent is correctin this latter regard, the holding in Wells simply cannot be deemed torest on our discussion of the statute's evolution. Rather, we characterizedthat discussion as supporting a result we had already reached on textualgrounds. See 519 U. S., at 492 ("Statutory history confirms the naturalreading").530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN267Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)Opinion of the Courtther term appears in the text of $ 2113(a) or $ 2113(b).5While the term "robbery" does appear in $ 2113's title, thetitle of a statute " `[is] of use only when [it] shed[s] light onsome ambiguous word or phrase' " in the statute itself.Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206,212 (1998) (quoting Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,331 U. S. 519, 528-529 (1947) (modifications in original)).And Carter does not claim that this title illuminates anysuch ambiguous language. Accordingly, the canon on im-puting common-law meaning has no bearing on this case.IVWe turn now to Carter's more specific arguments con-cerning the "extra" elements of $ 2113(b). While concedingthe absence of three of $ 2113(b)'s requirements from thetext of $ 2113(a)--(1) "intent to steal or purloin"; (2) "takesand carries away," i. e., asportation; and (3) "value exceed-ing $1,000" (first paragraph)--Carter claims that the firsttwo should be deemed implicit in $ 2113(a), and that the thirdis not an element at all.AAs to "intent to steal or purloin," it will be recalled thatthe text of subsection (b) requires a specific "intent tosteal or purloin," whereas subsection (a) contains no explicitmens rea requirement of any kind. Carter nevertheless ar-gues that such a specific intent requirement must be deemedimplicitly present in $ 2113(a) by virtue of "our cases in-terpreting criminal statutes to include broadly applicablescienter requirements, even where the statute by its terms5 Congress could have simply punished "robbery" or "larceny" as someStates have done (and as Congress itself has done elsewhere, see, e. g.,18 U. S. C. $$ 2112, 2114, 2115), thereby leaving the definition of theseterms to the common law, but Congress instead followed the more prevalent legislative practice of spelling out elements of these crimes. See 2W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 8.11, p. 438, n. 6 (1986).530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN268 CARTER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdoes not contain them." United States v. X-Citement Video,Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 70 (1994).6 Properly applied to $ 2113,however, the presumption in favor of scienter demands onlythat we read subsection (a) as requiring proof of generalintent--that is, that the defendant possessed knowledgewith respect to the actus reus of the crime (here, the takingof property of another by force and violence or intimidation).Before explaining why this is so under our cases, an example, United States v. Lewis, 628 F. 2d 1276, 1279 (CA10 1980),cert. denied, 450 U. S. 924 (1981), will help to make the distinction between "general" and "specific" intent less esoteric.In Lewis, a person entered a bank and took money from ateller at gunpoint, but deliberately failed to make a quickgetaway from the bank in the hope of being arrested so thathe would be returned to prison and treated for alcoholism.Though this defendant knowingly engaged in the acts ofusing force and taking money (satisfying "general intent"),he did not intend permanently to deprive the bank of itspossession of the money (failing to satisfy "specific intent").7See generally 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal6 This interpretive principle exists quite apart from the canon on imputing common-law meaning. See, e. g., X-Citement Video, 513 U. S., at70 (applying presumption in favor of scienter to statute proscribing theshipping or receiving of visual depictions of minors engaging in sexuallyexplicit conduct, without first inquiring as to the existence of a commonlaw antecedent to this offense); Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600(1994) (similar).7 The dissent claims that the Lewis court determined that the jury couldhave found specific intent to steal on the facts presented, and thus disputesour characterization of the case as illustrating a situation where a defendant acts only with general intent. Post, at 283-284 (citing Lewis, 628F. 2d, at 1279). The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, that the Lewiscourt made this determination only because some evidence suggested that,if the defendant had not been arrested, he would have kept the stolenmoney. Ibid. The Lewis court, implicitly acknowledging the possibilitythat some defendant (if not Lewis) might unconditionally intend to turnhimself in after completing a bank theft, proceeded to hold, in the alternative, that $ 2113(a) covers a defendant who acts only with general intent.See ibid.530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN269Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)Opinion of the CourtLaw $ 3.5, p. 315 (1986) (distinguishing general from specificintent).The presumption in favor of scienter requires a court toread into a statute only that mens rea which is necessaryto separate wrongful conduct from "otherwise innocentconduct." X-Citement Video, supra, at 72. In Staples v.United States, 511 U. S. 600 (1994), for example, to avoidcriminalizing the innocent activity of gun ownership, weinterpreted a federal firearms statute to require proof thatthe defendant knew that the weapon he possessed had thecharacteristics bringing it within the scope of the statute.Id., at 611-612. See also, e. g., Liparota v. United States,471 U. S. 419, 426 (1985); Morissette, 342 U. S., at 270-271.By contrast, some situations may call for implying a specificintent requirement into statutory text. Suppose, for example, a statute identical to $ 2113(b) but without the words"intent to steal or purloin." Such a statute would run therisk of punishing seemingly innocent conduct in the case ofa defendant who peaceably takes money believing it to behis. Reading the statute to require that the defendant possess general intent with respect to the actus reus--i. e., thathe know that he is physically taking the money--would failto protect the innocent actor. The statute therefore wouldneed to be read to require not only general intent, but alsospecific intent--i. e., that the defendant take the money with"intent to steal or purloin."In this case, as in Staples, a general intent requirementsuffices to separate wrongful from "otherwise innocent" conduct. Section 2113(a) certainly should not be interpretedto apply to the hypothetical person who engages in forcefultaking of money while sleepwalking (innocent, if aberrantactivity), but this result is accomplished simply by requiring, as Staples did, general intent--i. e., proof of knowledgewith respect to the actus reus of the crime. And once thismental state and actus reus are shown, the concerns underlying the presumption in favor of scienter are fully satis530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN270 CARTER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfied, for a forceful taking--even by a defendant who takesunder a good-faith claim of right--falls outside the realm ofthe "otherwise innocent." Thus, the presumption in favorof scienter does not justify reading a specific intent requirement--"intent to steal or purloin"--into $ 2113(a).8Independent of his reliance upon the presumption in favorof scienter, Carter argues that the legislative history of $ 2113supports the notion that an "intent to steal" requirementshould be read into $ 2113(a). Carter points out that, in1934, Congress enacted what is now $ 2113(a), but with theadverb "feloniously" (which all agree is equivalent to "intentto steal") modifying the verb "takes." Act of May 18, 1934,ch. 304, $ 2(a), 48 Stat. 783. In 1937, Congress added whatis now $ 2113(b). Act of Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 747, 50 Stat. 749.Finally, in 1948, Congress made two changes to $ 2113, deleting "feloniously" from what is now $ 2113(a) and dividingthe "robbery" and "larceny" offenses into their own separatesubsections. 62 Stat. 796.Carter concludes that the 1948 deletion of "feloniously"was merely a stylistic change, and that Congress had nointention, in deleting that word, to drop the requirementthat the defendant "feloniously" take the property--that is,with intent to steal.9 Such reasoning, however, misunder8 Numerous Courts of Appeals agree. While holding that $ 2113(a)'sversion of bank robbery is not a specific intent crime, these courts haveconstrued the statute to contain a general intent requirement. SeeUnited States v. Gonyea, 140 F. 3d 649, 653-654, and n. 10 (CA6 1998)(collecting cases).9 Relatedly, Carter argues that, even if a sensible Congress might havedeleted "feloniously," the 1948 Congress did not adequately explain anintention to do so in the legislative history to the 1948 Act. He pointsto the House Report, which states that Congress intended only to make"changes in phraseology." H. R. Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A135(1947). Carter further suggests that the phraseology concern with "feloniously" was that Congress in the 1948 codification generally desired todelete references to felonies and misdemeanors in view of the statutorydefinition of those terms in the former 18 U. S. C. $ 1. Carter fails, how530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN271Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)Opinion of the Courtstands our approach to statutory interpretation. In ana-lyzing a statute, we begin by examining the text, see, e. g.,Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475(1992), not by "psychoanalyzing those who enacted it," BankOne Chicago, N. A. v. Midwest Bank & Trust Co., 516 U. S.264, 279 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment). While "feloniously" no doubt would besufficient to convey a specific intent requirement akin to theone spelled out in subsection (b), the word simply does notappear in subsection (a).Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 283-284, thisreading is not a fanciful one. The absence of a specific intentrequirement from subsection (a), for example, permits thestatute to reach cases like Lewis, see supra, at 268, wherean ex-convict robs a bank because he wants to be apprehended and returned to prison. (The Government repre-sents that indictments on this same fact pattern (which invariably plead out and hence do not result in reporteddecisions) are brought "as often as every year," Brief forUnited States 22, n. 13.) It can hardly be said, therefore,that it would have been absurd to delete "feloniously" inorder to reach such defendants. And once we have madethat determination, our inquiry into legislative motivationis at an end. Cf.Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S., at510-511.10ever, to acknowledge that the House Report does not give that reason forthe deletion of "feloniously" from $ 2113, even though it explicitly does soin connection with the simultaneous elimination of similar language fromother sections. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 304, supra, at A67 ("Referencesto offenses as felonies or misdemeanors were omitted in view of definitivesection 1 of this title") (explaining revisions to 18 U. S. C. $ 751). As isoften the case, the legislative history, even if it is relevant, supports conflicting inferences and provides scant illumination.10 Carter claims further support in Prince v. United States, 352 U. S. 322(1957), for his view that $ 2113(a) implicitly requires a specific "intent tosteal." But Prince did not discuss the elements of that subsection, letalone compare them to the elements of subsection (b).530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN272 CARTER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtBTurning to the second element in dispute, it will be recalled that, whereas subsection (b) requires that the defendant "tak[e] and carr[y] away the property," subsection(a) requires only that the defendant "tak[e]" the property.Carter contends that the "takes" in subsection (a) is equivalent to "takes and carries away" in subsection (b). WhileCarter seems to acknowledge that the argument is at warwith the text of the statute, he urges that text should not bedispositive here because nothing in the evolution of $ 2113(a)suggests that Congress sought to discard the asportationrequirement from that subsection.But, again, our inquiry focuses on an analysis of the textualproduct of Congress' efforts, not on speculation as to theinternal thought processes of its Members. Congress is certainly free to outlaw bank theft that does not involve asportation, and it hardly would have been absurd for Congressto do so, since the taking-without-asportation scenario is noimagined hypothetical. See, e. g., State v. Boyle, 970 S. W.2d 835, 836, 838-839 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998) (construing statestatutory codification of common-law robbery to apply to defendant who, after taking money by threat of force, droppedthe money on the spot). Indeed, a leading treatise applaudsthe deletion of the asportation requirement from the elements of robbery. See 2 LaFave & Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 8.11, at 439. No doubt the common law's decisionto require asportation also has its virtues. But Congressadopted a different view in $ 2113(a), and it is not for us toquestion that choice.CThere remains the requirement in $ 2113(b)'s first paragraph that the property taken have a "value exceeding$1,000"--a requirement notably absent from $ 2113(a). Carter, shifting gears from his previous arguments, concedesthe textual point but claims that the valuation require530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN273Cite as: 530 U. S. 255 (2000)Opinion of the Courtment does not affect the Schmuck elements analysis becauseit is asentencing factor, not an element. We disagree. Thestructure of subsection (b) strongly suggests that its twoparagraphs--the first of which requires that the propertytaken have "value exceeding $1,000," the second of whichrefers to property of "value not exceeding $1,000"--describedistinct offenses. Each begins with the word "[w]hoever,"proceeds to describe identically (apart from the differingvaluation requirements) the elements of the offense, andconcludes by stating the prescribed punishment. That theseprovisions "stand on their own grammatical feet" stronglysuggests that Congress intended the valuation requirementto be an element of each paragraph's offense, rather than asentencing factor of some base $ 2113(b) offense. Jones v.United States, 526 U. S. 227, 234 (1999). Even aside fromthe statute's structure, the "steeply higher penalties"--anenhancement from a 1-year to a 10-year maximum penaltyon proof of valuation exceeding $1,000--leads us to concludethat the valuation requirement is an element of the firstparagraph of subsection (b). See Castillo v. United States,ante, at 127; Jones, 526 U. S., at 233. Finally, the constitutional questions that would be raised by interpreting the valuation requirement to be a sentencing factor persuade us toadopt the view that the valuation requirement is an element.See id., at 239-252.The dissent agrees that the valuation requirement ofsubsection (b)'s first paragraph is an element, but nonetheless would hold that subsection (b) is a lesser included offense of subsection (a). Post, at 287-289. The dissent reasons that the "value not exceeding $1,000" component of$ 2113(b)'s second paragraph is not an element of the offensedescribed in that paragraph. Hence, the matter of valuedoes not prevent $ 2113(b)'s second paragraph from beinga lesser included offense of $ 2113(a). And if a defendantwishes to receive an instruction on the first paragraph of$ 2113(b)--which entails more severe penalties than the sec530US1 Unit: $U73 [11-21-01 13:56:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 CARTER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtond paragraph, but is a more realistic option from the jury'sstandpoint in a case such as this one where the value of theproperty clearly exceeds $1,000--the dissent sees no reasonto bar him from making that election, even though the "valueexceeding $1,000" element of $ 2113(b)'s first paragraph isclearly absent from $ 2113(a).This novel maneuver creates a problem, however. Sincesubsection (a) contains no valuation requirement, a defendant indicted for violating that subsection who requests aninstruction under subsection (b)'s first paragraph would effectively "waive . . . his [Fifth Amendment] right to noticeby indictment of the `value exceeding $1,000' element."Post, at 289. But this same course would not be availableto the prosecutor who seeks the insurance policy of a lesserincluded offense instruction under that same paragraph afterdetermining that his case may have fallen short of provingthe elements of subsection (a). For, whatever authority de-fense counsel may possess to waive a defendant's constitutional rights, see generally New York v. Hill, 528 U. S. 110(2000), a prosecutor has no such power. Thus, the prosecutor would be disabled from obtaining a lesser included of-fense instruction under Rule 31(c), a result plainly contraryto Schmuck, in which we explicitly rejected an interpretiveapproach to the Rule that would have permitted "the defendant, by in effect waiving his right to notice, . . . [to] ob-tain a lesser [included] offense instruction in circumstanceswhere the constitutional restraint of notice to the defend-ant would prevent the prosecutor from seeking an identicalinstruction," 489 U. S., at 718.* * *We hold that $ 2113(b) is not a lesser included offense of$ 2113(a), and therefore that petitioner is not entitled to ajury instruction on $ 2113(b). The judgment of the ThirdCircuit is affirmed.
