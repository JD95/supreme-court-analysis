IIn the early morning hours of March 29, 1980, police re-ceived an emergency call from the Religious Society ofFriends meetinghouse in Lincoln, Nebraska. Responding tothe call, they found Janet Mesner, the live-in caretaker, lyingon the floor in the rear of the house with seven stab woundsin her chest. When an officer asked who had stabbed her,Mesner gave respondent's name. The officers then went toan upstairs bedroom and found the partially clad dead bodyof Victoria Lamm, a friend of Mesner who had been visitingthe meetinghouse. She had been stabbed twice, the firstblow penetrating the main pulmonary artery of her heartand the second her liver. A billfold containing respondent'sidentification was lying near Lamm's body. The police foundunderwear, later identified as respondent's, in the middle ofthe blood-soaked sheets of the bed; subsequent examinationof the underwear revealed semen of respondent's blood type.Near the bed, the police found a serrated kitchen knife withMesner's blood on it. Before dying, Mesner told an officerthat respondent had raped her. Shortly thereafter, the po-lice arrested respondent, who told them that although hecould not remember much about the murders due to severeintoxication, he did recall stabbing and raping Mesner.The State proceeded against respondent for both murderson a felony-murder theory. Under Nebraska law, felonymurder is a form of first-degree murder and is defined asmurder committed "in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate" certain enumerated felonies, including sexual as-sault or attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree.Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 28-303 (1995). When proceeding on such atheory, Nebraska prosecutors do not need to prove a culpablemental state with respect to the murder because intent tokill is conclusively presumed if the State proves intent to524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN92 HOPKINS v. REEVESOpinion of the Courtcommit the underlying felony. State v. Reeves, 216 Neb. 206,217, 344 N. W. 2d 433, 442 (1984). Although a convictionfor felony murder renders a defendant eligible for the deathpenalty, see $ 28-303, the jury is not charged with sentencingthe defendant; under Nebraska law, capital sentencing is ajudicial function, $ 29-2520.At trial, respondent requested that the jury be instructedon both murder in the second degree and manslaughter,which, he argued, were lesser included offenses of felonymurder. App. 6-9.1 The trial court refused on the groundthat the Nebraska Supreme Court consistently has held thatsecond-degree murder and manslaughter are not lesser in-cluded offenses of that crime.Id., at 10. Respondent's jurythus was presented with only the two felony-murder counts.2Although respondent raised an insanity defense, the jury rejected it and convicted him on both counts. A three-judgesentencing panel then convened to consider aggravating andmitigating circumstances. It sentenced respondent to deathon both convictions.After the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed his convictions and sentences, State v. Reeves, 216 Neb. 206, 344 N. W.2d 433, cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1028 (1984), respondent unsuccessfully pursued state collateral relief, State v. Reeves, 234Neb. 711, 453 N. W. 2d 359 (1990). This Court then vacatedthe Nebraska Supreme Court's judgment for further consideration in light of Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738(1990), because respondent's death sentence had been basedin part on an invalid aggravating factor. See Reeves v. Nebraska, 498 U. S. 964 (1990). On remand, the Nebraska Su1 Under Nebraska law, second-degree murder is defined as "caus[ing] thedeath of a person intentionally, but without premeditation," $ 28-304, andmanslaughter as "kill[ing] another without malice, either upon a suddenquarrel, or caus[ing] the death of another unintentionally while in the commission of an unlawful act," $ 28-305.2 Respondent did not request an instruction on sexual assault in thefirst degree.524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN93Cite as: 524 U. S. 88 (1998)Opinion of the Courtpreme Court followed Clemons, independently reweighedthe applicable aggravating and mitigating factors, and reaffirmed respondent's sentences. State v. Reeves, 239 Neb.419, 476 N. W. 2d 829 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 837 (1992).Respondent then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court. He raised 44 claims, includ-ing a claim that the trial court's failure to give his requestedinstructions was unconstitutional under Beck. The DistrictCourt rejected theBeck claim but granted relief on an unrelated ground. 871 F. Supp. 1182, 1202, 1205-1206 (Neb.1994). After the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitreversed the latter determination and remanded the case,76 F. 3d 1424, 1427-1431 (1996), the District Court againgranted respondent's petition, finding a due process violation arising out of the reaffirmance of his sentences by theNebraska Supreme Court. See 928 F. Supp. 941, 959-965(Neb. 1996).On the State's appeal, the Court of Appeals held that although respondent was not entitled to relief on his due process claim, the Nebraska trial court had committed constitutional error in failing to give the requested second-degreemurder and manslaughter instructions. 102 F. 3d 977(1997). The Court of Appeals reasoned that the constitutional error was the same as that in Beck, despite the factthat there are no lesser included homicide offenses to felonymurder under Nebraska law: In both cases, state law "prohibited instructions on noncapital murder charges in caseswhere conviction made the defendant death-eligible." 102F. 3d, at 983 (emphasis in original). Because respondent"could have been convicted and sentenced for either seconddegree murder or manslaughter," the Court of Appeals concluded that he was constitutionally entitled to his proposedinstructions. See id., at 984. It further stated that denialof the instructions could not be justified by the fact that felony murder in Nebraska does not require a culpable mentalstate with respect to the killing, because in Enmund v. Flor524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN94 HOPKINS v. REEVESOpinion of the Courtida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137(1987), this Court held that the death penalty could not beimposed in a felony-murder case if the defendant was a minorparticipant in the crime and neither intended to kill nor hadshown reckless indifference to human life. See 102 F. 3d, at984-985. The Court of Appeals therefore granted respondent's petition and, relying on Circuit precedent holding thatBeck applies only where the defendant is in fact sentencedto death, gave the State the option of retrying respondentor agreeing to modify his sentence to life imprisonment.See 102 F. 3d, at 986.Because the decision below conflicted with a prior decisionof the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seeGreena-walt v. Ricketts, 943 F. 2d 1020 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S.888 (1992), we granted certiorari. 521 U. S. 1151 (1997).3IIThe Court of Appeals erred in concluding that its holdingwas compelled by Beck, as the two cases differ fundamentally. In Beck, the defendant was indicted and convicted ofthe capital offense of " `[r]obbery or attempts thereof whenthe victim is intentionally killed by the defendant.' " 447U. S., at 627 (quoting Ala. Code $ 13-11-2(a)(2) (1975)). Al-though state law recognized the noncapital, lesser includedoffense of felony murder, see 447 U. S., at 628-630, and al-though lesser included offense instructions were generallyavailable to noncapital defendants under state law, the Ala3 One of the questions on which we granted certiorari was whether theCourt of Appeals' holding was a "new rule" under Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989). See Pet. for Cert. i. Because the State raised this argument for the first time in its petition for a writ of certiorari, we choose todecide the case on the merits. Cf. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S. 389, 397,n. 8 (1993) (declining to address whether the Court of Appeals created a"new rule" because the petitioner did not raise a Teague defense in thelower courts or in its petition for certiorari).524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN95Cite as: 524 U. S. 88 (1998)Opinion of the Courtbama death penalty statute prohibited such instructions incapital cases, id., at 628. As a result, Alabama juries hadonly two options: to convict the defendant of the capitalcrime, in which case they were required to impose the deathpenalty,4 or to acquit. Id., at 628-629. We found that thedenial of the third option of convicting the defendant of anoncapital lesser included offense "diminish[ed] the reliability of the guilt determination." Id., at 638. Without suchan option, if the jury believed that the defendant had committed some other serious offense, it might convict him ofthe capital crime rather than acquit him altogether. See id.,at 642-643. We therefore held that Alabama was "constitutionally prohibited from withdrawing that option from thejury in a capital case." See id., at 638.In Nebraska, instructions on offenses that have been determined to be lesser included offenses of the charged crimeare available to defendants when the evidence supportsthem, in capital and noncapital cases alike.5 Respondent'sproposed instructions were refused because the NebraskaSupreme Court has held for over 100 years, in both capitaland noncapital cases, that second-degree murder and manslaughter are not lesser included offenses of felony murder.See, e. g., State v. Price, 252 Neb. 365, 372, 562 N. W. 2d 340,346 (1997); State v. Masters, 246 Neb. 1018, 1025, 524 N. W.2d 342, 348 (1994); State v. Ruyle, 234 Neb. 760, 773, 452N. W. 2d 734, 742-743 (1990); State v. McDonald, 195 Neb.625, 636-637, 240 N. W. 2d 8, 15 (1976); Thompson v. State,4 If the jury imposed the death penalty, the trial judge had the authorityto reduce the sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The jury, however, was not instructed to this effect; rather, it wastold that it was required to impose the death penalty if it found the defendant guilty. See 447 U. S., at 639, n. 15.5 We noted this fact in Beck in distinguishing Alabama's scheme fromthe practices in the rest of the States. See 447 U. S., at 636, n. 12 (citingState v. Hegwood, 202 Neb. 379, 275 N. W. 2d 605 (1979)).524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN96 HOPKINS v. REEVESOpinion of the Court106 Neb. 395, 184 N. W. 68 (1921); Morgan v. State, 51 Neb.672, 695, 71 N. W. 788, 794-795 (1897). If a Nebraska trialcourt gives instructions on those offenses, and the defendantis convicted only of second-degree murder or manslaughter,that conviction must be reversed on appeal. See Thompsonv.State, supra, at 396, 184 N. W., at 68. Thus, as a matterof law, Nebraska prosecutors cannot obtain convictions forsecond-degree murder or manslaughter in a felony-murdertrial.Beck is therefore distinguishable from this case in two crit-ical respects. The Alabama statute prohibited instructionson offenses that state law clearly recognized as lesser in-cluded offenses of the charged crime, and it did so only incapital cases. Alabama thus erected an "artificial barrier"that restricted its juries to a choice between conviction fora capital offense and acquittal. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 20 (citing California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992,1007 (1983)). Here, by contrast, the Nebraska trial courtdid not deny respondent instructions on any existing lesserincluded offense of felony murder; it merely declined to giveinstructions on crimes that are not lesser included offenses.In so doing, the trial court did not create an "artificial barrier" for the jury; nor did it treat capital cases differentlyfrom noncapital cases. Instead, it simply followed theNebraska Supreme Court's interpretation of the relevantoffenses under state law.By ignoring these distinctions, the Court of Appeals lim-ited state sovereignty in a manner more severe than the rulein Beck. Almost all States, including Nebraska, provide in-structions only on those offenses that have been deemed toconstitute lesser included offenses of the charged crime.See n. 5, supra.6 We have never suggested that the Consti6 In determining whether an offense is a lesser included offense of aparticular crime, the States have adopted a variety of approaches. See,e. g., State v. Berlin, 133 Wash. 2d 541, 550-551, 947 P. 2d 700, 704-705524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN97Cite as: 524 U. S. 88 (1998)Opinion of the Courttution requires anything more. The Court of Appeals inthis case, however, required in effect that States createlesser included offenses to all capital crimes, by requiringthat an instruction be given on some other offense--whatcould be called a "lesser related offense"--when no lesserincluded offense exists. Such a requirement is not only unprecedented, but also unworkable. Under such a scheme,there would be no basis for determining the offenses forwhich instructions are warranted. The Court of Appealsapparently would recognize a constitutional right to an instruction on any offense that bears a resemblance to thecharged crime and is supported by the evidence. Such anaffirmative obligation is unquestionably a greater limitationon a State's prerogative to structure its criminal law than isBeck's rule that a State may not erect a capital-specific, arti(1997) (en banc) (comparing statutory elements of the lesser offense todetermine whether all of them are contained in the greater offense); People v. Beach, 429 Mich. 450, 462, 418 N. W. 2d 861, 866-867 (1988) (applyingthe "cognate evidence" approach: a lesser included offense instruction maybe given even though all of the statutory elements of the lesser offense arenot contained in the greater offense, if the "overlapping elements relate tothe common purpose of the statutes" and the specific evidence adducedwould support an instruction on the cognate offense (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted)); State v. Curtis, 130 Idaho 522, 524, 944 P. 2d119, 121-122 (1997) (court looks both to the statutory elements and to theinformation to determine whether it "charges the accused with a crimethe proof of which necessarily includes proof of the acts that constitutethe lesser included offense"). Cf. Schmuck v. United States, 489 U. S. 705(1989) (adopting statutory elements test for federal criminal law).Since the time of respondent's conviction, Nebraska has alternated between use of the statutory elements test and the cognate evidence test; itcurrently employs the former. See State v. Williams, 243 Neb. 959, 963-965, 503 N. W. 2d 561, 564-565 (1993) (readopting statutory elements test),overruling State v. Garza, 236 Neb. 202, 207-208, 459 N. W. 2d 739, 743(1990) (reaffirming cognate evidence test), disapproving State v. Lovelace,212 Neb. 356, 359-360, 322 N. W. 2d 673, 674-675 (1982) (applying statutoryelements test). It has nonetheless consistently reaffirmed its holding thatfelony murder has no lesser included homicide offenses.524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN98 HOPKINS v. REEVESOpinion of the Courtficial barrier to the provision of instructions on offenses thatactually are lesser included offenses under state law.The Court of Appeals justified its holding principally onthe ground that respondent had been placed in the same position as the defendant in Beck--that there had been a distortion of the factfinding process because his jury had been" `forced into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murderand innocence.' " 102 F. 3d, at 982 (quoting Spaziano v.Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455 (1984)). In so doing, the Courtof Appeals again overlooked significant distinctions betweenthis case and Beck. In Beck, the death penalty was automatically tied to conviction, and Beck's jury was told that ifit convicted the defendant of the charged offense, it was required to impose the death penalty. See Beck v. Alabama,447 U. S., at 639, n. 15. This threatened to make the issueat trial whether the defendant should be executed or not,rather than "whether the State ha[d] proved each and everyelement of the capital crime beyond a reasonable doubt."Id., at 643, n. 19. In addition, the distortion of the trial process carried over directly to sentencing, because an Alabamajury unwilling to acquit had no choice but to impose thedeath penalty. There was thus a significant possibility thatthe death penalty would be imposed upon defendants whoseconduct did not merit it, simply because their juries mightbe convinced that they had committed some serious crimeand should not escape punishment entirely.These factors are not present here. Respondent's jury didnot have the burden of imposing a sentence. Indeed, withrespect to respondent's insanity defense, it was specificallyinstructed that it had "no right to take into considerationwhat punishment or disposition he may or may not receivein the event of his conviction or . . . acquittal by reason ofinsanity." App. 24. In addition, the three-judge panel thatimposed the death penalty did not have to consider the dilemma faced by Beck's jury; its alternative to death was not524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN99Cite as: 524 U. S. 88 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsetting respondent free, but rather sentencing him to lifeimprisonment.7Moreover, respondent's proposed instructions would haveintroduced another kind of distortion at trial. Nebraskaproceeded against respondent only on a theory of felony mur-der, a crime that under state law has no lesser included homicide offenses. The State therefore assumed the obligationof proving only that crime, as well as any lesser includedoffenses that existed under state law and were supported bythe evidence; its entire case focused solely on that obligation.To allow respondent to be convicted of homicide offenses thatare not lesser included offenses of felony murder, therefore,would be to allow his jury to find beyond a reasonable doubtelements that the State had not attempted to prove, and indeed that it had ignored during the course of trial. This canhardly be said to be a reliable result: "Where no lesser included offense exists, a lesser included offense instructiondetracts from, rather than enhances, the rationality of theprocess." Spaziano v. Florida, supra, at 455.The Court of Appeals also erroneously relied upon our decisions in Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987), and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982), to support its holding.It reasoned that because those cases require proof of a culpable mental state with respect to the killing before the deathpenalty may be imposed for felony murder, Nebraska couldnot refuse lesser included offense instructions on the groundthat the only intent required for a felony-murder convictionis the intent to commit the underlying felony. See 102 F. 3d,at 984. In so doing, the Court of Appeals read Tison and7 We are not, of course, presented with a case that differs from Beckonly in that the jury is not the sentencer, and we express no opinionhere whether that difference alone would render Beck inapplicable. Thecrucial distinction between Beck and this case, as noted, is the distinctionbetween a State's prohibiting instructions on offenses that state law recognizes as lesser included, and a State's refusing to instruct on offenses thatstate law does not recognize as lesser included.524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN100 HOPKINS v. REEVESOpinion of the CourtEnmund as essentially requiring the States to alter theirdefinitions of felony murder to include a mens rea requirement with respect to the killing.8 In Cabana v. Bullock, 474U. S. 376 (1986), however, we rejected precisely such a reading and stated that "our ruling in Enmund does not concernthe guilt or innocence of the defendant--it establishes nonew elements of the crime of murder that must be found bythe jury" and "does not affect the state's definition of anysubstantive offense." Id., at 385 (internal quotation marksand citation omitted). For this reason, we held that a Statecould comply with Enmund's requirement at sentencing oreven on appeal. See 474 U. S., at 392. Accordingly,TisonandEnmund do not affect the showing that a State mustmake at a defendant's trial for felony murder, so long as theirrequirement is satisfied at some point thereafter. As such,these cases cannot override state-law determinations ofwhen instructions on lesser included offenses are permissibleand when they are not.Finally, respondent argues that the Nebraska SupremeCourt's longstanding interpretation that felony murder hasno lesser included homicide offenses is arbitrary because, inhis view, it is based only on recitations from prior cases,rather than on application of the lesser included offense testsin place since his conviction. See Brief for Respondent 40-43. This contention is certainly strained with respect to thecrime of second-degree murder, which requires proof ofintent to kill, while felony murder does not. See Neb. Rev.Stat. $$ 28-303, 28-304 (1995). It appears that the Nebraska Supreme Court has not undertaken respondent's sug-gested analysis with respect to unlawful act manslaughter--unintentional killing, committed in the perpetration of anunlawful act. See $ 28-305. On his direct appeal, however,respondent did not challenge the Nebraska Supreme Court's8 The dissent also appears to be of this view, contending that Nebraska'sjustification for not providing an instruction on second-degree murder isinapplicable when the death penalty is sought.

" Reply Brief for Appellant inNo. 81-706 (Neb. Sup. Ct.), p. 11. We will not second-guessthe Nebraska Supreme Court's 100-year-old interpretationof state law when respondent failed to present his challengeto that court in the first instance.For the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgmentgranting respondent a conditional writ of habeas corpus isreversed. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, dissenting.As a matter of Nebraska law, second-degree murder isnot ordinarily a lesser included offense of felony murder.1Based in part on this fact, the Court holds that it was notnecessary for the trial judge to grant respondent's requestfor an instruction authorizing the jury to find respondentguilty of that offense. The Court's logic would be unassail-able if the State had not sought the death penalty.The reason that Nebraska generally does not considersecond-degree murder a lesser included offense of felonymurder is that it requires evidence of an intent to cause thedeath of the victim, whereas felony murder does not. Butin this case the State sought to impose the death penalty onrespondent for the offense of felony murder. As a matter offederal constitutional law, underEnmund v. Florida, 458U. S. 782 (1982), it could not do so without proving that re1 See, e. g., State v. Price, 252 Neb. 365, 373, 562 N. W. 2d 340, 346 (1997);State v. Masters, 246 Neb. 1018, 1025, 524 N.

S. 137 (1987), that he had the moral equivalentof such an intent. The rationale for Nebraska's general rulethat second-degree murder is not a lesser included offense offelony murder does not, therefore, apply to this case.2 Tobe faithful to the teaching of Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625(1980), the Court should therefore hold that respondent wasentitled to the requested instruction.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.2 Moreover, a recent Nebraska Supreme Court decision suggests thatNebraska law may be in flux on the question whether second-degree murder is a lesser included offense of felony murder. Only a few weeks ago,the Nebraska Supreme Court held that a jury verdict finding a defendantguilty of second-degree murder constituted an implied acquittal of thecrime of first-degree murder, as defined in $ 28-303 of Nebraska's criminalcode, and therefore barred a second prosecution under that section foreither felony murder or premeditated murder. Nebraska v. White, 254Neb. 566, 577 N. W. 2d 741 (1998). In reaching that holding the Courtexplained: "The conduct prohibited by $ 28-303 is first degree murder.Premeditated murder and felony murder are not denominated in Nebraska's statutes as separate and independent offenses, but only ways in whichcriminal liability for first degree murder may be charged and prosecuted."Id., at 577, 577 N. W. 2d, at 748. The difference between a charge ofpremeditated murder and a charge of felony murder "is a difference in theState's theory of how [the defendant] committed the single offense of firstdegree murder. . . . Therefore, we hold that the crime of first degree murder, as defined in $ 28-303, constitutes one offense even though there maybe alternate theories by which criminal liability for first degree murdermay be charged and prosecuted in Nebraska." Ibid. Given this holding,the Nebraska Supreme Court may conclude that second-degree murder isa lesser included offense of both premeditated and felony murder, as theyare both part of the "one offense" of first-degree murder.524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN103OCTOBER TERM, 1997SyllabusCASS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, et al. v. LEECH LAKEBAND OF CHIPPEWA INDIANScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuitNo. 97-174. Argued February 24, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998During the late 19th century, the Federal Government instituted a policyof removing portions of reservation land from tribal ownership and federal protection, allotting some parcels to individual Indians in fee simpleand providing for other parcels to be sold to non-Indians. Most allotments were implemented pursuant to the General Allotment Act (GAA),which provided that land would be patented to individual Indians andheld in trust for 25 years, after which title would be conveyed in feesimple, $ 5, and that Indian allottees were subject to plenary state jurisdiction, $ 6. The Burke Act amended $ 6 to provide that state jurisdiction did not attach until the end of the trust period, and contained aproviso to the effect that the Secretary of the Interior could issue a feesimple patent before the trust period's end and thereafter restrictions asto, inter alia, taxation would be removed. Allotment of the Minnesotareservation lands of respondent Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians(Band) was implemented through the Nelson Act of 1889, which provided for the reservation land to be alienated from tribal ownership inthree ways: under $ 3, parcels were allotted to individual Indians asprovided by the GAA; under $$ 4 and 5, pine lands were sold at publicauction to non-Indians; and under $ 6, agricultural lands were sold tonon-Indian settlers as homesteads. After Congress ended the allotment practice, the Band began purchasing back parcels of reservationland that had been allotted to individual Indians or sold to non-Indians.Based on this Court's decision, in County of Yakima v.

Thirteen ofthe parcels had been allotted to Indians and the remaining eight hadbeen sold to non-Indians. The Band paid the taxes, interest, and penalties under protest and filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that thecounty could not tax the parcels. The District Court granted thecounty summary judgment, holding that the parcels were taxable be524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN104 CASS COUNTY v.

The Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the parcels allotted to Indians could betaxed if patented under the Burke Act proviso, which made "unmistakably clear" Congress' intent to allow such taxation, but that the eightparcels sold to non-Indians could not. Only those eight parcels are atissue here.Held: State and local governments may impose ad valorem taxes on reservation land that was made alienable by Congress and sold to nonIndians, but was later repurchased by the tribe. Pp. 110-115.(a) Congress' intent to authorize state and local taxation of Indianreservation land must be " `unmistakably clear.' " Yakima, supra, at258. Congress has manifested such an intent when it has authorizedreservation lands to be allotted in fee to individual Indians, making thelands freely alienable and withdrawing them from federal protection.This was the case in both Yakima and Goudy v. Meath, 203 U. S. 146.The Goudy Court concluded that, because it would be unreasonable forCongress to withdraw federal protection and permit an Indian to dispose of his lands as he pleased, while releasing the lands from taxation,Congress would have to "clearly manifest" such a contrary purpose inorder to counteract the consequence of taxability that ordinarily flowsfrom alienability. Id., at 149. The Yakima Court found that both theBurke Act proviso and $ 5 of the GAA manifested an unmistakably clearintent to allow state and local taxation of allotted land. The EighthCircuit thus erred in concluding that Yakima turned on the Burke Actproviso's express reference to taxability. Both it and Goudy stand forthe proposition that when Congress makes reservation lands freelyalienable, it is unmistakably clear that Congress intends that land to betaxable by state and local governments, unless a contrary intent is"clearly manifested." Yakima, supra, at 259. Pp. 110-113.(b) The foregoing principle controls the disposition of this case. Byproviding for the public sale of reservation land to non-Indians in theNelson Act, Congress removed that land from federal protection andmade it fully alienable. Under Yakima and Goudy, therefore, it is taxable. The Eighth Circuit's contrary holding attributes to Congress theodd intent that parcels conveyed to Indians are taxable, while parcelssold to the general public remain tax exempt. Contrary to the Band'sargument, a tribe's subsequent repurchase of alienable reservation landdoes not manifest any congressional intent to reassume federal protection of the land and to oust state taxing authority, particularly whenCongress relinquished such protection many years before.

LEECH LAKE BAND OFCHIPPEWA INDIANSOpinion of the CourtJustice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.We granted certiorari in this case to resolve whether stateand local governments may tax reservation land that wasmade alienable by Congress and sold to non-Indians by theFederal Government, but was later repurchased by a tribe.We hold that ad valorem taxes may be imposed upon suchland because, under the test established by our precedents,Congress has made "unmistakably clear" its intent to allowsuch taxation.IThe Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians is a federallyrecognized Indian tribe. The Leech Lake Reservation,which today encompasses 588,684 acres within the northernMinnesota counties of Cass, Itasca, and Beltrami, was established by federal treaty in 1855 and was augmented by sub-sequent treaties and Executive Orders.During the late 19th century, the Federal Governmentchanged its policy of setting aside reservation lands exclusively for Indian tribes under federal supervision. The new"allotment" policy removed significant portions of reservation land from tribal ownership and federal protection, allot-ting some parcels to individual Indians and providing forother parcels to be sold to non-Indians. See County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,502 U. S. 251, 253-254 (1992); F. Cohen, Handbook of FederalIndian Law 127-138 (1982). The purpose of the policy wasto assimilate Indians into American society and to open reservation lands to ownership by non-Indians.

LEECH LAKE BAND OFCHIPPEWA INDIANSOpinion of the CourtFor the Leech Lake Band and other Chippewa Tribes inMinnesota, the allotment policy was implemented throughthe Nelson Act of 1889. 25 Stat. 642. The Nelson Act pro-vided for the "complete cession and relinquishment" of tribaltitle to all reservation land in the State of Minnesota, exceptfor parts of two reservations, to the United States. Aftersuch "complete cession and relinquishment," which "operate[d] as a complete extinguishment of Indian title," thelands were to be disposed of in one of three ways: under$ 3, the United States would allot parcels to individual tribemembers as provided in the GAA; under $$ 4 and 5, so-called"pine lands" (surveyed 40-acre lots with standing or growingpine timber) were to be sold by the United States at publicauction to the highest bidder; and under $ 6, the remainderof the reservation land (called "agricultural lands") was to besold by the United States to non-Indian settlers under theprovisions of the Homestead Act of 1862, 12 Stat. 392.In 1934, federal Indian policy shifted dramatically whenCongress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat.984, 25 U. S. C. $ 461 et seq., which ended the practice of making federal allotments to individual Indians. Although theReorganization Act did not repeal allotment statutes such asthe Nelson Act, it extended the trust period for lands alreadyallotted but not yet fee patented, provided that unallottedsurplus lands would be restored to tribal ownership, and allowed additional lands "within or without existing reservations" to be acquired by the Federal Government for thetribes. See $$ 461, 462, 463, 465.In 1977, the Leech Lake Band and individual Band members owned only about 27,000 acres--less than five percent--of Leech Lake Reservation land. See State v. Forge, 262N. W. 2d 341, 343, and n. 1 (Minn. 1977). Since then, theLeech Lake Band has sought to reestablish its land base bypurchasing back parcels of reservation land that were allotted to individual Indians or sold to non-Indians during theallotment period.524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN109Cite as: 524 U. S. 103 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIn 1992, we held in County of Yakima v. ConfederatedTribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, supra, that a countycould assess ad valorem taxes on reservation land owned infee by individual Indians or the tribe and originally madealienable when patented in fee simple under the GAA.In 1993, Cass County began assessing ad valorem taxes on21 parcels of reservation land that had been alienated fromtribal control under the various provisions of the Nelson Actand later reacquired by the Leech Lake Band. Thirteen ofthe parcels had been allotted to individual Indians under $ 3;seven had been sold to non-Indians as pine lands under $$ 4and 5 for commercial timber harvest; and one parcel hadbeen distributed to a non-Indian under $ 6 as a homesteadplot. Under protest and to avoid foreclosure, the LeechLake Band paid more than $64,000 in taxes, interest, andpenalties.In 1995, the Band filed suit in federal court seeking a de-claratory judgment that Cass County could not tax the 21parcels.1 The District Court granted summary judgment infavor of Cass County, holding that all of the land that hadbeen alienated from tribal ownership under the Nelson Actwas taxable. 908 F. Supp. 689 (Minn. 1995). The DistrictCourt interpreted our decision in Yakima to mean that "ifCongress has made Indian land freely alienable, states maytax the land"--that is, "alienability equals taxability." 908F.

Id., at 829.Judge Magill concurred with the majority on the taxabilityof the 13 allotted parcels, but he dissented from the holdingthat the remaining 8 parcels were not also taxable. In hisview, Yakima propounded "the clear rule . . . that alienabilityallows taxation." 108 F. 3d, at 831.We granted certiorari, 522 U.

S. 103 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsuch an intent when it has authorized reservation lands tobe allotted in fee to individual Indians, thus making the landsfreely alienable and withdrawing them from federal protec-tion. This was the case in both Yakima and Goudy v.Meath, 203 U. S. 146 (1906), in which this Court held thatland, allotted and patented in fee to individual Indians andthus rendered freely alienable after the expiration of federaltrust status, was subject to county ad valorem taxes eventhough it was within a reservation and held by either indi-vidual Indians or a tribe.In Goudy, Congress had made reservation land alienableby authorizing the President to issue patents to individualmembers of the Puyallup Tribe. The President issued sucha patent to the plaintiff shortly before Washington became aState. The treaty of March 16, 1854, between the UnitedStates and the Puyallup Tribe, 10 Stat. 1043, provided thatsuch fee-patented land "shall be exempt from levy, sale, orforfeiture" until a state constitution was adopted and thestate legislature removed the restrictions with Congress'consent. When Washington became a State, its legislaturepassed a law authorizing the sale of reservation lands;shortly thereafter, Congress authorized the appointment ofa commission with the power to superintend the sale of thoselands, with the proviso that "the Indian allottees shall nothave power of alienation of the allotted lands not selectedfor sale by said Commission for a period of ten years fromthe date of the passage of this act." 27 Stat. 633 (1893).When the 10-year period expired, the county levied an advalorem tax on the land. This Court held that the tax waspermissible because the land was freely alienable. Goudy v.Meath, 203 U. S., at 149-150. Although the Indian patentowner argued that there had been no express repeal of theexemption provided by the 1854 treaty, this Court statedthat such an express repeal was unnecessary:"That Congress may grant the power of voluntary sale,while withholding the land from taxation or forced alien524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN112 CASS COUNTY v. LEECH LAKE BAND OFCHIPPEWA INDIANSOpinion of the Courtation may be conceded. . . . But while Congress maymake such provision, its intent to do so should be clearlymanifested." Id, at 149.The Goudy Court concluded that it would "seem strange [forCongress] to withdraw [federal] protection and permit theIndian to dispose of his lands as he pleases, while at the sametime releasing [the lands] from taxation."Ibid. Indeed,because such congressional purpose would be unreasonable,Congress would have to "clearly manifest" such a contrarypurpose in order to counteract the consequence of taxabilitythat ordinarily flows from alienability. Ibid.InYakima, we considered whether the GAA manifestedan unmistakably clear intent to allow state and local taxationof reservation lands allotted under the GAA and owned infee by either the Yakima Indian Nation or individual Indians.3 In holding that the lands could be taxed, we notedthat the Burke Act proviso clearly manifested such an intentby expressly addressing the taxability of fee-patented land.502 U. S., at 259. We also indicated that the alienability ofallotted lands itself, as provided by $ 5 of the GAA, similarlymanifested an unmistakably clear intent to allow taxation.4We reasoned that Goudy, "without even mentioning the3 We are concerned here only with Yakima's holding with respect to advalorem taxes such as those at issue in this case. Yakima also held thatthe GAA did not authorize the county to impose an excise tax on the saleof land held by individual Indians or by the tribe, because such a tax didnot constitute the "taxation of land." See County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 268-269 (1992).That holding, however, is not relevant to this case, which involves only anad valorem tax on land itself, rather than an excise tax on a transaction.4 The Burke Act proviso, as noted, see supra, at 107, did not itself authorize taxation of fee-patented land; it merely altered the result of In re Heff,197 U. S. 488 (1905), as to when parcels allotted to the Indians could bealienated and taxed. In re Heff had held this occurred as soon as allottedlands were patented to the Indians in trust (during which the land wouldstill be under the protection of the Federal Government); the Burke Actproviso stated that this did not occur until the lands were patented in fee.524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN113Cite as: 524 U. S. 103 (1998)Opinion of the CourtBurke Act proviso," 502 U. S., at 259, had held that state taxlaws applied to the Indian allottee at the expiration of thetrust period: "[I]t was the alienability of the allotted lands. . . that the[Goudy] Court found of central significance."Id., at 263 (emphasis deleted). And we reiterated Goudy'spoint that, although it is possible for Congress to render res-ervation land alienable and still forbid States to tax it, thisunlikely arrangement would not be presumed unless Con-gress "clearly manifested" such an intent. 502 U. S., at 263(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).The Court of Appeals thus erred in concluding that ourholding in Yakima turned on the Burke Act proviso's expressreference to taxability. Yakima, like Goudy, stands for theproposition that when Congress makes reservation landsfreely alienable, it is "unmistakably clear" that Congress intends that land to be taxable by state and local governments,unless a contrary intent is "clearly manifested." 502 U. S.,at 263.The foregoing principle controls the disposition of thiscase. In $$ 5 and 6 of the Nelson Act, Congress provided forthe public sale of pine lands and agricultural "homestead"lands by the Federal Government to non-Indians. Congressthereby removed that reservation land from federal protection and made it fully alienable. Under Goudy and Yakima,therefore, it is taxable. Indeed, this conclusion flows a fortiori from Goudy and Yakima: Those cases establish that Congress clearly intended reservation lands conveyed in fee toIndians to be subject to taxation; hence Congress surely intended reservation lands conveyed in fee to non-Indians alsoto be taxable. The Court of Appeals' contrary holding attributes to Congress the odd intent that parcels conveyed toIndians are to assume taxable status, while parcels sold tothe general public are to remain tax exempt.The Band essentially argues that, although its tax immunity lay dormant during the period when the eight parcelswere held by non-Indians, its reacquisition of the lands in524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN114 CASS COUNTY v. LEECH LAKE BAND OFCHIPPEWA INDIANSOpinion of the Courtfee rendered them nontaxable once again. We reject thiscontention. As explained, once Congress has demonstrated(as it has here) a clear intent to subject the land to taxationby making it alienable, Congress must make an unmistakably clear statement in order to render it nontaxable. SeeCounty of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands ofYakima Nation, 502 U. S., at 263 (citing Goudy v. Meath,supra, at 149). The subsequent repurchase of reservationland by a tribe does not manifest any congressional intent toreassume federal protection of that land and to oust statetaxing authority--particularly when Congress explicitly relinquished such protection many years before.Further, if we were to accept the Leech Lake Band's argument, it would render partially superfluous $ 465 of the Indian Reorganization Act. That section grants the Secretaryof the Interior authority to place land in trust, to be held bythe Federal Government for the benefit of the Indians andto be exempt from state and local taxation after assumingsuch status:"The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in hisdiscretion, to acquire, through purchase, relinquishment,gift, exchange, or assignment, and interest in lands . . .within or without existing reservations . . . for the pur-pose of providing land for Indians. . . ."Title to any lands . . . shall be taken in the name ofthe United States in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired, and such lands. . . shall be exempt from State and local taxation." 25U. S. C. $ 465.In $ 465, therefore, Congress has explicitly set forth a procedure by which lands held by Indian tribes may become taxexempt. It would render this procedure unnecessary, as faras exemption from taxation is concerned, if we held that taxexempt status automatically attaches when a tribe acquiresreservation land. The Leech Lake Band apparently realizes524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN115Cite as: 524 U. S. 103 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthis, because in 1995 it successfully applied to the Secretaryof the Interior under $ 465 to restore federal trust status toseven of the eight parcels at issue here.

No. 5-95-99, || V (DCMinn.); Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.5* * *When Congress makes Indian reservation land freelyalienable, it manifests an unmistakably clear intent to rendersuch land subject to state and local taxation. The re-purchase of such land by an Indian tribe does not cause theland to reassume tax-exempt status. The eight parcels atissue here were therefore taxable unless and until they wererestored to federal trust protection under $ 465. The judg-ment of the Court of Appeals with respect to those landsis reversed. It is so ordered.5 The Leech Lake Band and the United States, as amicus, also arguethat the parcels at issue here are not alienable--and therefore not taxable--under the terms of the Indian Nonintercourse Act, which provides:"No purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands . . . from anyIndian nation or tribe . . . shall be of any validity in law or equity, unlessthe same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to theConstitution." 25 U.

KOREAN AIRLINES CO., LTD.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuitNo. 97-704. Argued April 27, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998The Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA or Act) allows certain relativesof a decedent to sue for their own pecuniary losses, but does not authorize recovery for the decedent's pre-death pain and suffering. Petitioners, personal representatives of three passengers killed when KoreanAir Lines Flight KE007 was shot down over the Sea of Japan, suedrespondent airline (KAL) for, inter alia, damages for their decedents'pre-death pain and suffering. While their suit was pending, this Courtdecided in Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217--whicharose out of the same disaster--that the Warsaw Convention permitscompensation only for legally cognizable harm, but leaves the specification of what constitutes such harm to applicable domestic law, id., at231; that DOHSA supplies the applicable United States law where anairplane crashes on the high seas, ibid.; and that where DOHSA applies,neither state nor general maritime law can permit recovery of loss-ofsociety damages, id., at 230. Subsequently, the District Court in thiscase granted KAL's motion to dismiss petitioners' nonpecuniary damages claims on the ground that DOHSA does not permit recovery forsuch damages, including damages for a decedent's pre-death pain andsuffering. In affirming, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' argument that general maritime law provides a survival action for painand suffering damages, holding that Congress has decided who may sueand for what in cases of death on the high seas.Held: Because Congress has chosen not to authorize a survival action fora decedent's pre-death pain and suffering in a case of death on the highseas, there can be no general maritime survival action for such damages.Before Congress enacted DOHSA, admiralty law did not permit an action to recover damages for a person's death. In DOHSA, Congressauthorized such a cause of action for certain surviving relatives in casesof death on the high seas, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 761, but limited recovery tothe survivors' own pecuniary losses, $ 762. DOHSA's limited survivalprovision also restricts recovery to the survivors' pecuniary losses.$ 765. In Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, this Court524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN117Cite as: 524 U. S. 116 (1998)Syllabusheld that, in a case of death on the high seas, a decedent's survivorscould not recover damages under general maritime law for their loss ofsociety, reasoning that, since DOHSA announced Congress' consideredjudgment on, inter alia, beneficiaries, survival, and damages, id., at 625,the Court had no authority to substitute its views for those expressedby Congress, id., at 626. Because Higginbotham involved only thescope of the remedies available in a wrongful-death action, it did notaddress the availability of other causes of action. However, petitionerserr in contending that DOHSA is a wrongful-death statute with no bearing on the availability of a survival action. By authorizing only certainsurviving relatives to recover damages, and by limiting damages tothose relatives' pecuniary losses, Congress provided the exclusive recovery for deaths on the high seas. Petitioners concede that their actionwould expand the class of beneficiaries entitled to recovery and the recoverable damages; but Congress has already decided these issues and,thus, has precluded the judiciary from expanding either category.DOHSA's survival provision confirms the Act's comprehensive scope byexpressing Congress' considered judgment on the availability and contours of a survival action in cases of death on the high seas. Congresshas simply chosen to adopt a more limited survival provision than thaturged by petitioners. Indeed, Congress did so in the same year that itincorporated a survival action similar to the one petitioners seek intothe Jones Act, permitting seamen to recover damages for their owninjuries. In the exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction, the Court willnot upset the balance Congress struck by authorizing a cause of actionwith which Congress was certainly familiar but nonetheless declined toadopt.

KOREAN AIR LINES CO.Opinion of the CourtJustice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.In a case of death on the high seas, the Death on the HighSeas Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 761et seq., allows certain rela-tives of the decedent to sue for their pecuniary losses, butdoes not authorize recovery for the decedent's pre-death painand suffering. This case presents the question whetherthose relatives may nevertheless recover such damagesthrough a survival action under general maritime law. Wehold that they may not. IOn September 1, 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight KE007,en route from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul, South Korea,strayed into the airspace of the former Soviet Union and wasshot down over the Sea of Japan. All 269 people on boardwere killed.Petitioners, the personal representatives of three of thepassengers, brought lawsuits against respondent Korean AirLines Co., Ltd. (KAL), in the United States District Courtfor the District of Columbia. These cases were consolidatedin that court, along with the other federal actions arisingout of the crash. After trial, a jury found that KAL hadcommitted "willful misconduct," thus removing the WarsawConvention's $75,000 cap on damages, and in a subsequentverdict awarded $50 million in punitive damages. TheCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheldthe finding of willful misconduct, but vacated the punitivedamages award on the ground that the Warsaw Conventiondoes not permit the recovery of punitive damages.In reKorean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 932 F. 2d 1475,cert. denied, 502 U. S. 994 (1991).The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation thereafterremanded, for damages trials, all of the individual cases tothe District Courts in which they had been filed. In petitioners' cases, KAL moved for a pretrial determination thatthe Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA or Act), 46 U. S. C.524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN119Cite as: 524 U. S. 116 (1998)Opinion of the CourtApp. $ 761 et seq., provides the exclusive source of recover-able damages. DOHSA provides, in relevant part:"Whenever the death of a person shall be caused bywrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the highseas beyond a marine league from the shore of anyState, or the District of Columbia, or the Territories ordependencies of the United States, the personal repre-sentative of the decedent may maintain a suit for damages in the district courts of the United States, in admi-ralty, for the exclusive benefit of the decedent's wife,husband, parent, child, or dependent relative . . . ."$ 761."The recovery in such suit shall be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the per-sons for whose benefit the suit is brought . . . ." $ 762.KAL argued that, in a case of death on the high seas,DOHSA provides the exclusive cause of action and does notpermit damages for loss of society, survivors' grief, and dece-dents' pre-death pain and suffering. The District Court forthe District of Columbia disagreed, holding that becausepetitioners' claims were brought pursuant to the WarsawConvention, DOHSA could not limit the recoverable damages. The court determined that Article 17 of the WarsawConvention "allows for the recovery of all `damages sustained,' " meaning any "actual harm" that any party "experienced" as a result of the crash. App. 59.While petitioners' cases were awaiting damages trials, wereached a different conclusion in Zicherman v. Korean AirLines Co., 516 U. S. 217 (1996), another case arising out ofthe downing of Flight KE007. In Zicherman, we held thatthe Warsaw Convention "permit[s] compensation only for legally cognizable harm, but leave[s] the specification of whatharm is legally cognizable to the domestic law applicableunder the forum's choice-of-law rules," and that where "an524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN120 DOOLEY v. KOREAN AIR LINES CO.Opinion of the Courtairplane crash occurs on the high seas, DOHSA supplies thesubstantive United States law." Id., at 231. Accordingly,the petitioners could not recover damages for loss of society:"[W]here DOHSA applies, neither state law, see OffshoreLogistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, 232-233 (1986), norgeneral maritime law, seeMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham,436 U. S. 618, 625-626 (1978), can provide a basis for recoveryof loss-of-society damages." Id., at 230. We did not decide,however, whether the petitioners in Zicherman could recover for their decedents' pre-death pain and suffering, asKAL had not raised this issue in its petition for certiorari.See id., at 230, n. 4.After theZicherman decision, KAL again moved to dis-miss all of petitioners' claims for nonpecuniary damages.The District Court granted this motion, holding that UnitedStates law (not South Korean law) governed these cases; thatDOHSA provides the applicable United States law; and thatDOHSA does not permit the recovery of nonpecuniary damages--including petitioners' claims for their decedents' pre-death pain and suffering.In re Korean Air Lines Disasterof Sept. 1, 1983, 935 F. Supp. 10, 12-15 (1996).On appeal, petitioners argued that, although DOHSA doesnot itself permit recovery for a decedent's pre-death pain andsuffering, general maritime law provides a survival actionthat allows a decedent's estate to recover for injuries (including pre-death pain and suffering) suffered by the decedent.The Court of Appeals rejected this argument and affirmed.In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 117 F. 3d1477 (CADC 1997). Assuming,arguendo, that there is asurvival cause of action under general maritime law, thecourt held that such an action is unavailable when the deathis on the high seas:"For deaths on the high seas, Congress decided who maysue and for what. Judge-made general maritime lawmay not override such congressional judgments, how-ever ancient those judgments may happen to be.

Id., at 1481.We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1038 (1998), to resolve aCircuit split concerning the availability of a general maritimesurvival action in cases of death on the high seas. Compare,e. g., In re Korean Air Lines Disaster, 117 F. 3d, at 1481,with Gray v. Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., 125 F. 3d1371, 1385 (CA11 1997).IIBefore Congress enacted DOHSA in 1920, the general lawof admiralty permitted a person injured by tortious conductto sue for damages, but did not permit an action to bebrought when the person was killed by that conduct. Seegenerally R. Hughes, Handbook of Admiralty Law 222-223(2d ed. 1920). This rule stemmed from the theory that aright of action was personal to the victim and thus expiredwhen the victim died. Accordingly, in the absence of an Actof Congress or state statute providing a right of action, asuit in admiralty could not be maintained in the courts of theUnited States to recover damages for a person's death. SeeThe Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199, 213 (1886); The Alaska, 130U. S. 201, 209 (1889).1Congress passed such a statute, and thus authorized re-covery for deaths on the high seas, with its enactment ofDOHSA. DOHSA provides a cause of action for "the deathof a person . . . caused by wrongful act, neglect, or defaultoccurring on the high seas," $ 761; this action must bebrought by the decedent's personal representative "for theexclusive benefit of the decedent's wife, husband, parent,1 We later rejected this rule in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.,398 U. S. 375, 408-409 (1970), by overruling The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199(1886), and holding that a federal remedy for wrongful death exists undergeneral maritime law. In Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, 414 U. S.573, 574 (1974), we further held that such wrongful-death awards couldinclude compensation for loss of support and services and for loss ofsociety.524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN122 DOOLEY v. KOREAN AIR LINES CO.Opinion of the Courtchild, or dependent relative," ibid. The Act limits recoveryin such a suit to "a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suitis sought." $ 762. DOHSA also includes a limited survivalprovision: In situations in which a person injured on the highseas sues for his injuries and then dies prior to completionof the suit, "the personal representative of the decedent maybe substituted as a party and the suit may proceed as a suitunder this chapter for the recovery of the compensationprovided in section 762." $ 765. Other sections establish alimitations period, $ 763a, govern actions under foreign law,$ 764, bar contributory negligence as a complete defense,$ 766, exempt the Great Lakes, navigable waters in the Panama Canal Zone, and state territorial waters from the Act'scoverage, $ 767, and preserve certain state-law remedies andstate-court jurisdiction, ibid. DOHSA does not authorizerecovery for the decedent's own losses, nor does it allowdamages for nonpecuniary losses.In Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618 (1978),we considered whether, in a case of death on the high seas,a decedent's survivors could recover damages under generalmaritime law for their loss of society. We held that theycould not, and thus limited to territorial waters those casesin which we had permitted loss of society damages undergeneral maritime law. Id., at 622-624; see n. 1, supra. Fordeaths on the high seas, DOHSA "announces Congress'considered judgment on such issues as the beneficiaries, thelimitations period, contributory negligence, survival, anddamages." 436 U. S., at 625. We thus noted that whilewe could "fil[l] a gap left by Congress' silence," we werenot free to "rewrit[e] rules that Congress has affirmativelyand specifically enacted." Ibid. Because "Congress ha[d]struck the balance for us" in DOHSA by limiting the available recovery to pecuniary losses suffered by surviving relatives, id., at 623, we had "no authority to substitute ourviews for those expressed by Congress," id., at 626. Hig524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN123Cite as: 524 U. S. 116 (1998)Opinion of the Courtginbotham, however, involved only the scope of the remediesavailable in a wrongful-death action, and thus did not address the availability of other causes of action.Conceding that DOHSA does not authorize recovery for adecedent's pre-death pain and suffering, petitioners seek torecover such damages through a general maritime survivalaction. Petitioners argue that general maritime law recognizes a survival action, which permits a decedent's estateto recover damages that the decedent would have beenable to recover but for his death, including pre-death painand suffering. And, they contend, because DOHSA is awrongful-death statute--giving surviving relatives a causeof action for losses they suffered as a result of the decedent'sdeath--it has no bearing on the availability of a survivalaction.We disagree. DOHSA expresses Congress' judgmentthat there should be no such cause of action in cases of deathon the high seas. By authorizing only certain surviving relatives to recover damages, and by limiting damages to thepecuniary losses sustained by those relatives, Congress provided the exclusive recovery for deaths that occur on thehigh seas. Petitioners concede that their proposed survivalaction would necessarily expand the class of beneficiaries incases of death on the high seas by permitting decedents' estates (and their various beneficiaries) to recover compensation. They further concede that their cause of action wouldexpand the recoverable damages for deaths on the high seasby permitting the recovery of nonpecuniary losses, such aspre-death pain and suffering. Because Congress has already decided these issues, it has precluded the judiciaryfrom enlarging either the class of beneficiaries or the recoverable damages. As we noted in Higginbotham, "Congressdid not limit DOHSA beneficiaries to recovery of their pecuniary losses in order to encourage the creation of nonpecuniary supplements." Id., at 625.524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN124 DOOLEY v. KOREAN AIR LINES CO.Opinion of the CourtThe comprehensive scope of DOHSA is confirmed by itssurvival provision, see supra, at 122, which limits the recovery in such cases to the pecuniary losses suffered by surviv-ing relatives. The Act thus expresses Congress' "considered judgment," Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, supra, at625, on the availability and contours of a survival action incases of death on the high seas. For this reason, it cannot becontended that DOHSA has no bearing on survival actions;rather, Congress has simply chosen to adopt a more limitedsurvival provision. Indeed, Congress did so in the sameyear that it incorporated into the Jones Act, which permitsseamen injured in the course of their employment to recoverdamages for their injuries, a survival action similar to theone petitioners seek here. See Act of June 5, 1920, $ 33, 41Stat. 1007 (incorporating survival action of the Federal Em-ployers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. $ 59). Even in the exerciseof our admiralty jurisdiction, we will not upset the balancestruck by Congress by authorizing a cause of action withwhich Congress was certainly familiar but nonetheless de-clined to adopt.In sum, Congress has spoken on the availability of a sur-vival action, the losses to be recovered, and the beneficiaries,in cases of death on the high seas. Because Congress haschosen not to authorize a survival action for a decedent'spre-death pain and suffering, there can be no general mari-time survival action for such damages.2 The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is
