Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Crimi-nal Procedure 11(e)(6) provide that statements made in thecourse of plea discussions between a criminal defendant anda prosecutor are inadmissible against the defendant. Thecourt below held that these exclusionary provisions may notbe waived by the defendant. We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals, and we nowreverse.IOn August 1, 1991, San Diego Narcotics Task Force agentsarrested Gordon Shuster after discovering a methamphetamine laboratory at his residence in Rainbow, California.Shuster agreed to cooperate with the agents, and a few hours*John J. Cleary filed a brief for the National Association of CriminalDefense Lawyers et al. as amici curiae urging affirmance.513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:27 PAGES OPINPGT198 UNITED STATES v. MEZZANATTOOpinion of the Courtafter his arrest he placed a call to respondent's pager.When respondent returned the call, Shuster told him that afriend wanted to purchase a pound of methamphetamine for$13,000. Shuster arranged to meet respondent later thatday.At their meeting, Shuster introduced an undercover officeras his "friend." The officer asked respondent if he had"brought the stuff with him," and respondent told the officerit was in his car. The two proceeded to the car, where respondent produced a brown paper package containing ap-proximately one pound of methamphetamine. Respondentthen presented a glass pipe (later found to contain methamphetamine residue) and asked the officer if he wanted to takea "hit." The officer indicated that he would first get respondent the money; as the officer left the car, he gave aprearranged arrest signal. Respondent was arrested andcharged with possession of methamphetamine with intent todistribute, in violation of 84 Stat. 1260, as amended, 21U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1).On October 17, 1991, respondent and his attorney asked tomeet with the prosecutor to discuss the possibility of cooperating with the Government. The prosecutor agreed to meetlater that day. At the beginning of the meeting, the prosecutor informed respondent that he had no obligation to talk,but that if he wanted to cooperate he would have to be completely truthful. As a condition to proceeding with the discussion, the prosecutor indicated that respondent would haveto agree that any statements he made during the meetingcould be used to impeach any contradictory testimony hemight give at trial if the case proceeded that far. Respondent conferred with his counsel and agreed to proceed underthe prosecutor's terms.Respondent then admitted knowing that the package hehad attempted to sell to the undercover police officer contained methamphetamine, but insisted that he had dealt onlyin "ounce" quantities of methamphetamine prior to his ar513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT199Cite as: 513 U. S. 196 (1995)Opinion of the Courtrest. Initially, respondent also claimed that he was actingmerely as a broker for Shuster and did not know that Shuster was manufacturing methamphetamine at his residence,but he later conceded that he knew about Shuster's laboratory. Respondent attempted to minimize his role in Shuster's operation by claiming that he had not visited Shuster'sresidence for at least a week before his arrest. At thispoint, the Government confronted respondent with surveillance evidence showing that his car was on Shuster's property the day before the arrest, and terminated the meetingon the basis of respondent's failure to provide completelytruthful information.Respondent eventually was tried on the methamphetamine charge and took the stand in his own defense. Hemaintained that he was not involved in methamphetaminetrafficking and that he had thought Shuster used his homelaboratory to manufacture plastic explosives for the CIA.He also denied knowing that the package he delivered tothe undercover officer contained methamphetamine. Overdefense counsel's objection, the prosecutor cross-examinedrespondent about the inconsistent statements he had madeduring the October 17 meeting. Respondent denied havingmade certain statements, and the prosecutor called one ofthe agents who had attended the meeting to recount theprior statements. The jury found respondent guilty, and theDistrict Court sentenced him to 170 months in prison.A panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, over the dissentof Chief Judge Wallace. 998 F. 2d 1452 (1993). The NinthCircuit held that respondent's agreement to allow admissionof his plea statements for purposes of impeachment was unenforceable and that the District Court therefore erred inadmitting the statements for that purpose. We granted certiorari because the Ninth Circuit's decision conflicts with theSeventh Circuit's decision in United States v. Dortch, 5 F. 3d1056, 1067-1068 (1993).513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT200 UNITED STATES v. MEZZANATTOOpinion of the CourtIIFederal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Crimi-nal Procedure 11(e)(6) (Rules or plea-statement Rules) aresubstantively identical. Rule 410 provides:"Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence ofthe following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding,admissible against the defendant who . . . was a partici-pant in the plea discussions: . . . (4) any statement madein the course of plea discussions with an attorney for theprosecuting authority which do not result in a plea ofguilty . . . ."The Ninth Circuit noted that these Rules are subject to onlytwo express exceptions,1 neither of which says anythingabout waiver, and thus concluded that Congress must havemeant to preclude waiver agreements such as respondent's.998 F. 2d, at 1454-1456. In light of the "precision withwhich these rules are generally phrased," the Ninth Circuitdeclined to "write in a waiver in a waiverless rule." Id.,at 1456.2The Ninth Circuit's analysis is directly contrary to the ap-proach we have taken in the context of a broad array of constitutional and statutory provisions. Rather than deemingwaiver presumptively unavailable absent some sort of ex1 A statement made by a criminal defendant in the course of plea discussions is "admissible (i) in any proceeding wherein another statement madein the course of the same . . . plea discussions has been introduced and thestatement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or(ii) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statementwas made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the presenceof counsel."

Proc. 11(e)(6).2 Respondent also goes to great lengths to establish a proposition thatis not at issue in this case: that the plea-statement Rules do not contain ablanket "impeachment" exception. We certainly agree that the Rulesgive a defendant the right not to be impeached by statements made duringplea discussions, but that conclusion says nothing about whether the defendant may relinquish that right by voluntary agreement.513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT201Cite as: 513 U. S. 196 (1995)Opinion of the Courtpress enabling clause, we instead have adhered to the oppo-site presumption. SeeShutte v. Thompson, 15 Wall. 151,159 (1873) ("A party may waive any provision, either of acontract or of a statute, intended for his benefit");Peretz v.United States, 501 U. S. 923, 936 (1991) ("The most basicrights of criminal defendants are . . . subject to waiver"). Acriminal defendant may knowingly and voluntarily waivemany of the most fundamental protections afforded by theConstitution. See,e. g., Ricketts v. Adamson, 483 U. S. 1, 10(1987) (double jeopardy defense waivable by pretrial agree-ment);Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243 (1969) (knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, right to jury trial, and right toconfront one's accusers); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 465(1938) (Sixth Amendment right to counsel may be waived).Likewise, absent some affirmative indication of Congress'intent to preclude waiver, we have presumed that statutoryprovisions are subject to waiver by voluntary agreement ofthe parties. See, e. g., Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U. S. 717, 730-732 (1986) (prevailing party in civil-rights action may waiveits statutory eligibility for attorney's fees).Our cases interpreting the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are consistent with this approach. The provisions ofthose Rules are presumptively waivable, though an expresswaiver clause may suggest that Congress intended to occupythe field and to preclude waiver under other, unstated circumstances. See Crosby v. United States, 506 U. S. 255(1993); Smith v. United States, 360 U. S. 1 (1959). In Crosby,for example, we held that a defendant's failure to appear forany part of his trial did not constitute a valid waiver of hisright to be present under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43. We noted that the specific right codified in Rule43 "was considered unwaivable in felony cases" at commonlaw, and that Rule 43 expressly recognized only one exception to the common-law rule. 506 U. S., at 259. In light ofthe specific common-law history behind Rule 43 and the ex513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT202 UNITED STATES v. MEZZANATTOOpinion of the Courtpress waiver provision in the Rule, we declined to concludethat "the drafters intended the Rule to go further." Id., at260. Our decision in Smith followed a similar line of reasoning. It held that waiver of the indictment requirement embodied in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(a) is confinedto the specific circumstances outlined in the Rule's text:"Rule 7(a) recognizes that this safeguard may be waived, butonly in those proceedings which are noncapital." 360 U. S.,at 9. Unlike Rules 43 and 7(a), however, the plea-statementRules make no mention of waiver, and so Crosby and Smithprovide no basis for setting aside the usual presumption.The presumption of waivability has found specific application in the context of evidentiary rules. Absent some "overriding procedural consideration that prevents enforcementof the contract," courts have held that agreements to waiveevidentiary rules are generally enforceable even over aparty's subsequent objections. 21 C. Wright & K. Graham,Federal Practice and Procedure $ 5039, pp. 207-208 (1977)(hereinafter Wright & Graham). Courts have "liberallyenforced" agreements to waive various exclusionary rules ofevidence. Note, Contracts to Alter the Rules of Evidence,46 Harv. L. Rev. 138, 139-140 (1933). Thus, at the time ofthe adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence, agreementsas to the admissibility of documentary evidence were routinely enforced and held to preclude subsequent objectionsas to authenticity. See, e. g., Tupman Thurlow Co. v. S. S.Cap Castillo, 490 F. 2d 302, 309 (CA2 1974); United States v.Wing, 450 F. 2d 806, 811 (CA9 1971). And although hearsayis inadmissible except under certain specific exceptions, wehave held that agreements to waive hearsay objections areenforceable. See Sac and Fox Indians of Miss. in Iowa v.Sac and Fox Indians of Miss. in Okla., 220 U. S. 481, 488-489 (1911); see also United States v. Bonnett, 877 F. 2d 1450,1458-1459 (CA10 1989) (party's stipulation to admissibility ofdocument precluded hearsay objection at trial).513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 513 U. S. 196 (1995)Opinion of the CourtIndeed, evidentiary stipulations are a valuable and inte-gral part of everyday trial practice. Prior to trial, partiesoften agree in writing to the admission of otherwise objec-tionable evidence, either in exchange for stipulations fromopposing counsel or for other strategic purposes. Both theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules ofCriminal Procedure appear to contemplate that the partieswill enter into evidentiary agreements during a pretrial conference. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 16(c)(3); Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 17.1. During the course of trial, parties frequently decide to waive evidentiary objections, and such tactics areroutinely honored by trial judges. See 21 Wright & Graham$ 5032, at 161 ("It is left to the parties, in the first instance,to decide whether or not the rules are to be enforced. . . .It is only in rare cases that the trial judge will . . . excludeevidence they are content to see admitted"); see also UnitedStates v. Coonan, 938 F. 2d 1553, 1561 (CA2 1991) (criminaldefendant not entitled "to evade the consequences of an unsuccessful tactical decision" made in welcoming admission ofotherwise inadmissible evidence).3IIIBecause the plea-statement Rules were enacted againsta background presumption that legal rights generally, andevidentiary provisions specifically, are subject to waiver byvoluntary agreement of the parties, we will not interpret3 Respondent contends that a pretrial agreement to waive the exclusionary provisions of the plea-statement Rules is unlike a typical stipulation,which is entered into while the case is in progress, and is more like anextrajudicial agreement made outside the context of litigation. Brief forRespondent 39. While it may be true that extrajudicial contracts madeprior to litigation trigger closer judicial scrutiny than stipulations madewithin the context of litigation, see 21 Wright & Graham $ 5039, at 206,there is nothing extrajudicial about the waiver agreement at issue here.The agreement was made in the course of a plea discussion aimed atresolving the specific criminal case that was "in progress" againstrespondent.513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT204 UNITED STATES v. MEZZANATTOOpinion of the CourtCongress' silence as an implicit rejection of waivability. Re-spondent bears the responsibility of identifying some affirmative basis for concluding that the plea-statement Rulesdepart from the presumption of waivability.Respondent offers three potential bases for concludingthat the Rules should be placed beyond the control of theparties. We find none of them persuasive.ARespondent first suggests that the plea-statement Rulesestablish a "guarantee [to] fair procedure" that cannot bewaived. Brief for Respondent 12. We agree with respond-ent's basic premise: There may be some evidentiary provisions that are so fundamental to the reliability of thefactfinding process that they may never be waived withoutirreparably "discredit[ing] the federal courts." See 21Wright & Graham $ 5039, at 207-208; see alsoWheat v.United States, 486 U. S. 153, 162 (1988) (court may decline adefendant's waiver of his right to conflict-free counsel);United States v. Josefik, 753 F. 2d 585, 588 (CA7 1985) ("Nodoubt there are limits to waiver; if the parties stipulated totrial by 12 orangutans the defendant's conviction would beinvalid notwithstanding his consent, because some minimumof civilized procedure is required by community feelingregardless of what the defendant wants or is willing toaccept"). But enforcement of agreements like respondent'splainly will not have that effect. The admission of pleastatements for impeachment purposesenhances the truth-seeking function of trials and will result in more accurateverdicts. Cf. Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 238 (1980)(once a defendant decides to testify, he may be required toface impeachment on cross-examination, which furthers the" `function of the courts of justice to ascertain the truth' ")(quoting Brown v. United States, 356 U. S. 148, 156 (1958));Note, 46 Harv. L. Rev., at 142-143 ("[A] contract to deprivethe court of relevant testimony . . . stands on a different513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 513 U. S. 196 (1995)Opinion of the Courtground than one admitting evidence that would otherwisehave been barred by an exclusionary rule. One contract isan impediment to ascertaining the facts, the other aids in thefinal determination of the true situation") (footnote omitted).Under any view of the evidence, the defendant has made afalse statement, either to the prosecutor during the plea dis-cussion or to the jury at trial; making the jury aware of theinconsistency will tend to increase the reliability of the ver-dict without risking institutional harm to the federal courts.Respondent nevertheless urges that the plea-statementRules are analogous to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure24(c), which provides that "[a]n alternate juror who does notreplace a regular juror shall be discharged after the juryretires to consider its verdict." Justice Kennedy's concurrence in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 741 (1993),suggested that the guarantees of Rule 24(c) may never bewaived by an agreement to permit alternate jurors to sit inon jury deliberations, and respondent asks us to extend thatlogic to the plea-statement Rules. But even if we assumethat the requirements of Rule 24(c) are "the product of ajudgment that our jury system should be given a stable andconstant structure, one that cannot be varied by a court withor without the consent of the parties," id., at 742, the pleastatement Rules plainly do not satisfy this standard. Rules410 and 11(e)(6) "creat[e], in effect, a privilege of the defendant," 2 J. Weinstein & M. Berger, Weinstein's Evidence|| 410[05], p. 410-43 (1994), and, like other evidentiary privileges, this one may be waived or varied at the defendant'srequest. The Rules provide that statements made in thecourse of plea discussions are inadmissible "against" the defendant, and thus leave open the possibility that a defendantmay offer such statements into evidence for his own tacticaladvantage. Indeed, the Rules contemplate this result inpermitting admission of statements made "in any proceedingwherein another statement made in the course of the same. . . plea discussions has been introduced and the statement513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT206 UNITED STATES v. MEZZANATTOOpinion of the Courtought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it."Fed. Rule Evid. 410(i) (emphasis added); accord, Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 11(e)(6)(i). Thus, the plea-statement Rules ex-pressly contemplate a degree of party control that is consonant with the background presumption of waivability.4BRespondent also contends that waiver is fundamentallyinconsistent with the Rules' goal of encouraging voluntarysettlement. See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. RuleEvid. 410 (purpose of Rule is "promotion of disposition ofcriminal cases by compromise"). Because the prospect ofwaiver may make defendants "think twice" before enteringinto any plea negotiation, respondent suggests that enforce-ment of waiver agreements acts "as a brake, not as a facilitator, to the plea-bargain process." Brief for Respondent 23,n. 17. The Ninth Circuit expressed similar concerns, notingthat Rules 410 and 11(e)(6) "aid in obtaining th[e] cooperation" that is often necessary to identify and prosecute theleaders of a criminal conspiracy and that waiver of the protections of the Rules "could easily have a chilling effect onthe entire plea bargaining process." 998 F. 2d, at 1455. According to the Ninth Circuit, the plea-statement Rules "permit the plea bargainer to maximize what he has `to sell' " bypreserving "the ability to withdraw from the bargain proposed by the prosecutor without being harmed by any of his4 The Ninth Circuit relied on Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O'Neil, 324 U. S.697 (1945), but that case is easily distinguishable in this regard. BrooklynSavings Bank held that certain statutory entitlements guaranteed to employees by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 were unwaivable becausethe structure and legislative history of the Act evinced a specific "legislative policy" of "prevent[ing] private contracts" on such matters. Id., at706. Respondent has identified nothing in the structure or history of theplea-statement Rules that suggests that they were aimed at preventingprivate bargaining; in fact, the above discussion suggests that the Rulesadopt a contrary view.513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT207Cite as: 513 U. S. 196 (1995)Opinion of the Courtstatements made in the course of an aborted plea bargainingsession."Ibid.We need not decide whether and under what circum-stances substantial "public policy" interests may permit theinference that Congress intended to override the presumption of waivability, for in this case there is no basis forconcluding that waiver will interfere with the Rules' goalof encouraging plea bargaining. The court below focusedentirely on thedefendant's incentives and completely ignored the other essential party to the transaction: the prose-cutor. Thus, although the availability of waiver may discourage some defendants from negotiating, it is also true thatprosecutors may be unwilling to proceed without it.Prosecutors may be especially reluctant to negotiate without a waiver agreement during the early stages of a criminalinvestigation, when prosecutors are searching for leads andsuspects may be willing to offer information in exchange forsome form of immunity or leniency in sentencing. In this"cooperation" context, prosecutors face "painfully delicate"choices as to "whether to proceed and prosecute those suspects against whom the already produced evidence makes acase or whether to extend leniency or full immunity to somesuspects in order to procure testimony against other, moredangerous suspects against whom existing evidence is flimsyor nonexistent." Hughes, Agreements for Cooperation inCriminal Cases, 45 Vand. L. Rev. 1, 15 (1992). Becauseprosecutors have limited resources and must be able toanswer "sensitive questions about the credibility of thetestimony" they receive before entering into any sort of cooperation agreement, id., at 10, prosecutors may conditioncooperation discussions on an agreement that the testimonyprovided may be used for impeachment purposes. SeeThompson & Sumner, Structuring Informal Immunity, 8Crim. Just. 16, 19 (spring 1993). If prosecutors were precluded from securing such agreements, they might well decline to enter into cooperation discussions in the first place513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT208 UNITED STATES v. MEZZANATTOOpinion of the Courtand might never take this potential first step toward a pleabargain.5Indeed, as a logical matter, it simply makes no sense toconclude that mutual settlement will be encouraged by precluding negotiation over an issue that may be particularlyimportant to one of the parties to the transaction. Asounder way to encourage settlement is to permit the inter-ested parties to enter into knowing and voluntary negotiations without any arbitrary limits on their bargaining chips.To use the Ninth Circuit's metaphor, if the prosecutor isinterested in "buying" the reliability assurance that ac-companies a waiver agreement, then precluding waiver canonly stifle the market for plea bargains. A defendant can"maximize" what he has to "sell" only if he is permitted tooffer what the prosecutor is most interested in buying. Andwhile it is certainly true that prosecutors often need helpfrom the small fish in a conspiracy in order to catch the bigones, that is no reason to preclude waiver altogether. Ifprosecutors decide that certain crucial information will begained only by preserving the inadmissibility of plea statements, they will agree to leave intact the exclusionary provi-sions of the plea-statement Rules.5 We cannot agree with the dissent's conclusion that the policies expressed in the Advisory Committee's Notes to the plea-statement Rulesindicate congressional animosity toward waivability. The Advisory Committee's Notes always provide some policy justification for the exclusionary provisions in the Rules, yet those policies merely justify the defaultrule of exclusion; they do not mean that the parties can never waive thedefault rule. Indeed, the dissent is unwilling to accept the logical resultof its approach, which would require a wholesale rejection of the background presumption of party control over evidentiary provisions. Hearsay, for example, is generally excluded because it tends to lack "trustworthiness," see Advisory Committee's Notes on Article VIII of the Fed.Rules of Evid., 28 U. S. C. App., p. 770, yet even the dissent concedes thatthe hearsay rules are "waivable beyond any question," post, at 212.Thus, the mere existence of a policy justification for the plea-statementRules cannot provide a sound basis for rejecting the background presumption of waivability.513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT209Cite as: 513 U. S. 196 (1995)Opinion of the CourtIn sum, there is no reason to believe that allowing nego-tiation as to waiver of the plea-statement Rules will bringplea bargaining to a grinding halt; it may well have the oppo-site effect.6 Respondent's unfounded policy argument thusprovides no basis for concluding that Congress intended toprevent criminal defendants from offering to waive theplea-statement Rules during plea negotiation.CFinally, respondent contends that waiver agreementsshould be forbidden because they invite prosecutorial overreaching and abuse. Respondent asserts that there is a"gross disparity" in the relative bargaining power of the parties to a plea agreement and suggests that a waiver agree-ment is "inherently unfair and coercive." Brief for Respondent 26. Because the prosecutor retains the discretionto "reward defendants for their substantial assistance" underthe Sentencing Guidelines, respondent argues that defend-ants face an " `incredible dilemma' " when they are asked toaccept waiver as the price of entering plea discussions.Ibid. (quoting Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 193(1957)).The dilemma flagged by respondent is indistinguishablefrom any of a number of difficult choices that criminal defendants face every day. The plea bargaining process neces6 Respondent has failed to offer any empirical support for his apocalypticpredictions, and data compiled by the Administrative Office of the UnitedStates Courts appear to contradict them. Prior to the Ninth Circuit'sdecision in this case (when, according to the Solicitor General, federalprosecutors in that Circuit used waiver agreements like the one invalidated by the court below, see Pet. for Cert. 10-11), approximately 92.2%of the convictions in the Ninth Circuit were secured through pleas ofguilty or nolo contendere. Annual Report of the Director, AdministrativeOffice of the United States Courts, Judicial Business of the United StatesCourts 278 (1992) (Table D-7). During that same period, about 88.8% ofthe convictions in all federal courts were secured by voluntary pleas. Id.,at 276.513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT210 UNITED STATES v. MEZZANATTOOpinion of the Courtsarily exerts pressure on defendants to plead guilty and toabandon a series of fundamental rights, but we have repeatedly held that the government "may encourage a guilty pleaby offering substantial benefits in return for the plea."Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 U. S. 212, 219 (1978). "While con-fronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment clearly may have a `discouraging effect on the de-fendant's assertion of his trial rights, the imposition ofthese difficult choices [is] an inevitable'--and permissible--`attribute of any legitimate system which tolerates andencourages the negotiation of pleas.' " Bordenkircher v.Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 364 (1978) (quoting Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17, 31 (1973)).The mere potential for abuse of prosecutorial bargainingpower is an insufficient basis for foreclosing negotiation alto-gether. "Rather, tradition and experience justify our beliefthat the great majority of prosecutors will be faithful to theirduty." Newton v. Rumery, 480 U. S. 386, 397 (1987) (plurality opinion); see also United States v. Chemical Foundation,Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1926) ("[I]n the absence of clear evi-dence to the contrary, courts presume that [public officers]have properly discharged their official duties"). Thus, al-though some waiver agreements "may not be the product ofan informed and voluntary decision," this possibility "doesnot justify invalidating all such agreements." Newton,supra, at 393 (majority opinion). Instead, the appropriateresponse to respondent's predictions of abuse is to permitcase-by-case inquiries into whether waiver agreements arethe product of fraud or coercion. We hold that absent someaffirmative indication that the agreement was entered intounknowingly or involuntarily, an agreement to waive the exclusionary provisions of the plea-statement Rules is validand enforceable.IVRespondent conferred with his lawyer after the prosecutorproposed waiver as a condition of proceeding with the plea513us1$15N 03-30-98 08:23:28 PAGES OPINPGT211Cite as: 513 U.
