In this case, we must decide whether approximately 1.8million acres of land in northern Alaska, owned in fee simpleby the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government pursu-ant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, is "Indiancountry." We conclude that it is not, and we therefore re-verse the judgment below.IThe Village of Venetie, which is located in Alaska abovethe Arctic Circle, is home to the Neets'aii Gwich'in Indians.In 1943, the Secretary of the Interior created a reservationfor the Neets'aii Gwich'in out of the land surrounding Venetie and another nearby tribal village, Arctic Village. SeeApp. to Pet. for Cert. 2a. This land, which is about thesize of Delaware, remained a reservation until 1971, whenCongress enacted the Alaska Native Claims SettlementAct (ANCSA), a comprehensive statute designed to settleall land claims by Alaska Natives.

ANCSA's text states that thesettlement of the land claims was to be accomplished"without litigation, with maximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their rights and property,without establishing any permanent racially defined institutions, rights, privileges, or obligations, [and] without creating a reservation system or lengthy wardshipor trusteeship." $ 1601(b) (emphasis added).To this end, ANCSA revoked "the various reserves setaside . . . for Native use" by legislative or Executive action,except for the Annette Island Reserve inhabited by the Metlakatla Indians, and completely extinguished all aboriginalclaims to Alaska land. $$ 1603, 1618(a). In return, Congress authorized the transfer of $962.5 million in state andfederal funds and approximately 44 million acres of Alaskaland to state-chartered private business corporations thatwere to be formed pursuant to the statute; all of the shareholders of these corporations were required to be Alaska Natives. $$ 1605, 1607, 1613. The ANCSA corporations received title to the transferred land in fee simple, and nofederal restrictions applied to subsequent land transfers bythem.Pursuant to ANCSA, two Native corporations were established for the Neets'aii Gwich'in, one in Venetie, and one inArctic Village. In 1973, those corporations elected to makeuse of a provision in ANCSA allowing Native corporationsto take title to former reservation lands set aside for Indiansprior to 1971, in return for forgoing the statute's monetary payments and transfers of nonreservation land. See$ 1618(b). The United States conveyed fee simple title tothe land constituting the former Venetie Reservation to thetwo corporations as tenants in common; thereafter, the corporations transferred title to the land to the Native Villageof Venetie Tribal Government (Tribe).522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 522 U.

In De-cember 1986, the Tribe notified the contractor that it owedthe Tribe approximately $161,000 in taxes for conductingbusiness activities on the Tribe's land. When both the contractor and the State, which under the joint venture agree-ment was the party responsible for paying the tax, refusedto pay, the Tribe attempted to collect the tax in tribal courtfrom the State, the school district, and the contractor.The State then filed suit in Federal District Court for theDistrict of Alaska and sought to enjoin collection of the tax.The Tribe moved to dismiss the State's complaint, but theDistrict Court denied the motion. It held that the Tribe'sANCSA lands were not Indian country within the meaningof 18 U. S. C. $ 1151(b), which provides that Indian countryincludes all "dependent Indian communities within the bor-ders of the United States"; as a result, "the Trib[e] [did] nothave the power to impose a tax upon non-members of thetribe such as the plaintiffs."Alaska ex rel.

The Court held that a six-factor balancingtest should be used to interpret the term "dependent Indiancommunities" in $ 1151(b), seeid., at 1292-1293, and it sum-marized the requirements of that test as follows:"[A] dependent Indian community requires a showingof federal set aside and federal superintendence. Theserequirements are to be construed broadly and should beinformed in the particular case by a consideration of thefollowing factors:"(1) the nature of the area; (2) the relationship of thearea inhabitants to Indian tribes and the federal govern-ment; (3) the established practice of government agen522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 ALASKA v.

Id., at1294.Applying this test, the Court of Appeals concluded that the"federal set aside" and "federal superintendence" requirements were met and that the Tribe's land was therefore In-dian country.Id., at 1300-1302.Judge Fernandez wrote separately. In his view, ANCSAwas intended to be a departure from traditional Indian pol-icy: "It attempted to preserve Indian tribes, but simultaneously attempted to sever them from the land; it attemptedto leave them as sovereign entities for some purposes, but assovereigns without territorial reach." Id., at 1303. Notingthat the majority's holding called into question the status ofall 44 million acres of land conveyed by ANCSA, he wrotethat "[w]ere we writing on a clean slate, I would eschew thetribe's request and would avoid creating the kind of chaosthat the 92nd Congress wisely sought to avoid."Id., at1304. He nonetheless concluded that Ninth Circuit precedent required him to concur in the result. Ibid.

C. $ 1151.In relevant part, the statute provides:"[T]he term `Indian country' . . . means (a) all landwithin the limits of any Indian reservation under thejurisdiction of the United States Government . . . , (b)all dependent Indian communities within the borders of522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN527Cite as: 522 U. S. 520 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe United States whether within the original or subse-quently acquired territory thereof, and whether withinor without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian allot-ments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through thesame."Although this definition by its terms relates only to federalcriminal jurisdiction, we have recognized that it also generally applies to questions of civil jurisdiction such as the oneat issue here. SeeDeCoteau v. District County Court forTenth Judicial Dist., 420 U. S. 425, 427, n. 2 (1975).1Because ANCSA revoked the Venetie Reservation, andbecause no Indian allotments are at issue, whether theTribe's land is Indian country depends on whether it fallswithin the "dependent Indian communities" prong of thestatute, $ 1151(b).2 Since 18 U. S. C. $ 1151 was enactedin 1948, we have not had an occasion to interpret the term"dependent Indian communities." We now hold that it re-fers to a limited category of Indian lands that are neitherreservations nor allotments, and that satisfy two require-ments--first, they must have been set aside by the Federal Government for the use of the Indians as Indian land;second, they must be under federal superintendence. Ourholding is based on our conclusion that in enacting $ 1151,Congress codified these two requirements, which previouslywe had held necessary for a finding of "Indian country"generally.1 Generally speaking, primary jurisdiction over land that is Indian country rests with the Federal Government and the Indian tribe inhabiting it,and not with the States. See, e. g., South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe,ante, at 343.2 As noted, only one Indian reservation, the Annette Island Reserve,survived ANCSA. Other Indian country exists in Alaska post-ANCSAonly if the land in question meets the requirements of a "dependent Indiancommunit[y]" under our interpretation of $ 1151(b), or if it constitutes"allotments" under $ 1151(c).522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN528 ALASKA v. NATIVE VILLAGE OF VENETIETRIBAL GOVERNMENTOpinion of the CourtBefore $ 1151 was enacted, we held in three cases that Indian lands that were not reservations could be Indian country and that the Federal Government could therefore exercise jurisdiction over them. See United States v. Sandoval,231 U. S. 28 (1913); United States v. Pelican, 232 U. S. 442(1914); United States v. McGowan, 302 U. S. 535 (1938).3The first of these cases, United States v. Sandoval, posed thequestion whether the Federal Government could constitutionally proscribe the introduction of "intoxicating liquor"into the lands of the Pueblo Indians. 231 U. S., at 36. Werejected the contention that federal power could not extendto the Pueblo lands because, unlike Indians living on reservations, the Pueblos owned their lands in fee simple. Id., at48. We indicated that the Pueblos' title was not fee simpletitle in the commonly understood sense of the term. Congress had recognized the Pueblos' title to their ancestrallands by statute, and Executive orders had reserved additional public lands "for the [Pueblos'] use and occupancy."Id., at 39. In addition, Congress had enacted legislationwith respect to the lands "in the exercise of the Government's guardianship over th[e] [Indian] tribes and their affairs," id., at 48, including federal restrictions on the lands'alienation.4 Congress therefore could exercise jurisdictionover the Pueblo lands, under its general power over "alldependent Indian communities within its borders, whetherwithin its original territory or territory subsequently acquired, and whether within or without the limits of a State."Id., at 46.3 We had also held, not surprisingly, that Indian reservations wereIndian country. See, e. g., Donnelly v. United States, 228 U. S. 243, 269(1913).4 One such law was Rev. Stat. $ 2116, 25 U. S. C. $ 177, which renderedinvalid any conveyance of Indian land not made by treaty or conventionentered into pursuant to the Constitution, and which we later held applicable to the Pueblos. See United States v. Candelaria, 271 U. S. 432,441-442 (1926).522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN529Cite as: 522 U. S. 520 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIn United States v. Pelican, we held that Indian allotments--parcels of land created out of a diminished Indianreservation and held in trust by the Federal Government forthe benefit of individual Indians--were Indian country. 232U. S., at 449. We stated that the original reservation wasIndian country "simply because it had been validly set apartfor the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the Government." Ibid. (emphasis added). Afterthe reservation's diminishment, the allotments continued tobe Indian country, as "the lands remained Indian lands setapart for Indians under governmental care; . . . we are unableto find ground for the conclusion that they became other thanIndian country through the distribution into separate holdings, the Government retaining control." Ibid.In United States v. McGowan, we held that the RenoIndian Colony in Reno, Nevada, was Indian country eventhough it was not a reservation. 302 U. S., at 539. We reasoned that, like Indian reservations generally, the colony hadbeen " `validly set apart for the use of the Indians . . . underthe superintendence of the Government.' " Ibid. (quotingUnited States v. Pelican, supra, at 449) (emphasis deleted).We noted that the Federal Government had created the colony by purchasing the land with "funds appropriated by Congress" and that the Federal Government held the colony'sland in trust for the benefit of the Indians residing there.302 U. S., at 537, and n. 4. We also emphasized that theFederal Government possessed the authority to enact "regulations and protective laws respecting th[e] [colony's] territory," id., at 539, which it had exercised in retaining title tothe land and permitting the Indians to live there. For thesereasons, a federal statute requiring the forfeiture of automobiles carrying "intoxicants" into the Indian country appliedto the colony; we noted that the law was an example of theprotections that Congress had extended to all " `dependentIndian communities' " within the territory of the United522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN530 ALASKA v. NATIVE VILLAGE OF VENETIETRIBAL GOVERNMENTOpinion of the CourtStates. Id., at 538 (quoting United States v. Sandoval,supra, at 46) (emphasis deleted).In each of these cases, therefore, we relied upon a findingof both a federal set-aside and federal superintendence inconcluding that the Indian lands in question constituted In-dian country and that it was permissible for the Federal Government to exercise jurisdiction over them. Section 1151does not purport to alter this definition of Indian country, butmerely lists the three different categories of Indian countrymentioned in our prior cases: Indian reservations, seeDon-nelly v. United States, 228 U. S. 243, 269 (1913); dependentIndian communities, see United States v. McGowan, supra,at 538-539;United States v. Sandoval, supra, at 46; and al-lotments, see United States v. Pelican, supra, at 449. Theentire text of $ 1151(b), and not just the term "dependentIndian communities," is taken virtually verbatim from Sandoval, which language we later quoted in McGowan. SeeUnited States v. Sandoval, supra, at 46; United States v. McGowan, supra, at 538. Moreover, the Historical and Revi-sion Notes to the statute that enacted $ 1151 state that$ 1151's definition of Indian country is based "on [the] latestconstruction of the term by the United States SupremeCourt in U. S. v. McGowan . . . following U. S. v. Sandoval.(See alsoDonnelly v. U. S.) . . . . Indian allotments wereincluded in the definition on authority of the case of U. S. v.Pelican." See Notes to 1948 Act, following 18 U. S. C.$ 1151, p. 276 (citations omitted).We therefore must conclude that in enacting $ 1151(b),Congress indicated that a federal set-asideand a federal su-perintendence requirement must be satisfied for a finding ofa "dependent Indian community"--just as those require-ments had to be met for a finding of Indian country before18 U. S. C. $ 1151 was enacted.5 These requirements are re5 In attempting to defend the Court of Appeals' judgment, the Tribeasks us to adopt a different conception of the term "dependent Indiancommunities." Borrowing from Chief Justice Marshall's seminal opinions522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 522 U. S. 520 (1998)Opinion of the Courtflected in the text of $ 1151(b): The federal set-aside requirement ensures that the land in question is occupied by an"Indian community"; 6 the federal superintendence requirement guarantees that the Indian community is sufficiently"dependent" on the Federal Government that the FederalGovernment and the Indians involved, rather than theStates, are to exercise primary jurisdiction over the land inquestion.7in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1 (1831), and Worcester v. Georgia,6 Pet. 515 (1832), the Tribe argues that the term refers to political dependence, and that Indian country exists wherever land is owned by afederally recognized tribe. Federally recognized tribes, the Tribe contends, are "domestic dependent nations," Cherokee Nation v. Georgia,supra, at 17, and thus ipso facto under the superintendence of the FederalGovernment. See Brief for Respondents 23-24.This argument ignores our Indian country precedents, which indicateboth that the Federal Government must take some action setting apartthe land for the use of the Indians "as such," and that it is the land inquestion, and not merely the Indian tribe inhabiting it, that must be underthe superintendence of the Federal Government. See, e. g., United Statesv. McGowan, 302 U. S. 535, 539 (1938) ("The Reno Colony has been validlyset apart for the use of the Indians. It is under the superintendence ofthe Government. The Government retains title to the lands which it permits the Indians to occupy"); United States v. Pelican, 232 U. S. 442, 449(1914) (noting that the Federal Government retained "ultimate control"over the allotments in question).6 The federal set-aside requirement also reflects the fact that becauseCongress has plenary power over Indian affairs, see U. S. Const., Art. I,$ 8, cl. 3, some explicit action by Congress (or the Executive, acting underdelegated authority) must be taken to create or to recognize Indiancountry.7 Although the Court of Appeals majority also reached the conclusionthat $ 1151(b) imposes federal set-aside and federal superintendence requirements, it defined those requirements far differently, by resort to its"textured" six-factor balancing test. See 101 F. 3d 1286, 1293 (CA9 1996).Three of those factors, however, were extremely far removed from therequirements themselves: "the nature of the area"; "the relationship ofthe area inhabitants to Indian tribes and the federal government"; and"the degree of cohesiveness of the area inhabitants." Id., at 1300-1301.The Court of Appeals majority, however, accorded those factors virtually522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 ALASKA v. NATIVE VILLAGE OF VENETIETRIBAL GOVERNMENTOpinion of the CourtBThe Tribe's ANCSA lands do not satisfy either of theserequirements. After the enactment of ANCSA, the Tribe'slands are neither "validly set apart for the use of the Indiansas such," nor are they under the superintendence of the Federal Government.With respect to the federal set-aside requirement, it is significant that ANCSA, far from designating Alaskan lands forIndian use, revoked the existing Venetie Reservation, andindeed revoked all existing reservations in Alaska "set asideby legislation or by Executive or Secretarial Order for Native use," save one. 43 U. S. C. $ 1618(a) (emphasis added).In no clearer fashion could Congress have departed from itstraditional practice of setting aside Indian lands. Cf. Hagenv. Utah, 510 U. S. 399, 401 (1994) (holding that by diminishinga reservation and opening the diminished lands to settlementby non-Indians, Congress had extinguished Indian countryon the diminished lands).The Tribe argues--and the Court of Appeals majorityagreed, see 101 F. 3d, at 1301-1302--that the ANCSA landswere set apart for the use of the Neets'aii Gwich'in, "assuch," because the Neets'aii Gwich'in acquired the lands pur-suant to an ANCSA provision allowing Natives to take titleto former reservation lands in return for forgoing all otherANCSA transfers. Brief for Respondents 40-41 (citing 43U. S. C. $ 1618(b)). The difficulty with this contention is thatANCSA transferred reservation lands to private, statechartered Native corporations, without any restraints onalienation or significant use restrictions, and with the goal ofavoiding "any permanent racially defined institutions, rights,the same weight as other, more relevant ones: "the degree of federal ownership of and control over the area," and "the extent to which the areawas set aside for the use, occupancy, and protection of dependent Indianpeoples." Id., at 1301. By balancing these "factors" against one another,the Court of Appeals reduced the federal set-aside and superintendencerequirements to mere considerations.522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN533Cite as: 522 U. S. 520 (1998)Opinion of the Courtprivileges, or obligations." $ 1601(b); see also $$ 1607, 1613.By ANCSA's very design, Native corporations can immediately convey former reservation lands to non-Natives,and such corporations are not restricted to using those landsfor Indian purposes. Because Congress contemplated thatnon-Natives could own the former Venetie Reservation, andbecause the Tribe is free to use it for non-Indian purposes,we must conclude that the federal set-aside requirement isnot met. Cf.United States v. McGowan, 302 U. S., at 538(noting that the land constituting the Reno Indian Colonywas held in trust by the Federal Government for the benefitof the Indians); see also United States v. Pelican, 232 U. S.,at 447 (noting federal restraints on the alienation of the allotments in question).Equally clearly, ANCSA ended federal superintendenceover the Tribe's lands. As noted above, ANCSA revokedthe Venetie Reservation along with every other reservationin Alaska but one, see 43 U. S. C. $ 1618(a), and Congressstated explicitly that ANCSA's settlement provisions wereintended to avoid a "lengthy wardship or trusteeship."$ 1601(b). After ANCSA, federal protection of the Tribe'sland is essentially limited to a statutory declaration that theland is exempt from adverse possession claims, real propertytaxes, and certain judgments as long as it has not been sold,leased, or developed. See $ 1636(d). These protections, ifthey can be called that, simply do not approach the level ofsuperintendence over the Indians' land that existed in ourprior cases. In each of those cases, the Federal Governmentactively controlled the lands in question, effectively acting asa guardian for the Indians. See United States v. McGowan,supra, at 537-539 (emphasizing that the Federal Governmenthad retained title to the land to protect the Indians livingthere); United States v. Pelican, supra, at 447 (stating thatthe allotments were "under the jurisdiction and control ofCongress for all governmental purposes, relating to theguardianship and protection of the Indians"); United States522US2 Unit: $U29 [01-28-00 17:41:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN534 ALASKA v. NATIVE VILLAGE OF VENETIETRIBAL GOVERNMENTOpinion of the Courtv. Sandoval, 231 U. S., at 37, n. 1 (citing federal statute plac-ing the Pueblos' land under the " `absolute jurisdiction andcontrol of the Congress of the United States' "). Finally, itis worth noting that Congress conveyed ANCSA lands tostate-chartered and state-regulated private business corporations, hardly a choice that comports with a desire to retainfederal superintendence over the land.The Tribe contends that the requisite federal superintend-ence is present because the Federal Government provides"desperately needed health, social, welfare, and economicprograms" to the Tribe. Brief for Respondents 28. TheCourt of Appeals majority found this argument persuasive.101 F. 3d, at 1301. Our Indian country precedents, however,do not suggest that the mere provision of "desperatelyneeded" social programs can support a finding of Indiancountry. Such health, education, and welfare benefits aremerely forms of general federal aid; considered either aloneor in tandem with ANCSA's minimal land-related protections, they are not indicia of active federal control overthe Tribe's land sufficient to support a finding of federalsuperintendence.The Tribe's federal superintendence argument, moreover,is severely undercut by its view of ANCSA's primary purposes, namely, to effect Native self-determination and to endpaternalism in federal Indian relations. See, e. g., Brief forRespondents 44 (noting that ANCSA's land transfers "foster[ed] greater tribal self-determination" and "renounc[ed][Bureau of Indian Affairs] paternalism"). The broad federalsuperintendence requirement for Indian country cuts againstthese objectives, but we are not free to ignore that requirement as codified in 18 U. S. C. $ 1151. Whether the conceptof Indian country should be modified is a question entirelyfor Congress.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
