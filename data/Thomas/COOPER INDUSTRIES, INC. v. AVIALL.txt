We hold that it may not.IUnder CERCLA, 94 Stat. 2767, the Federal Governmentmay clean up a contaminated area itself, see $ 104, or it maycompel responsible parties to perform the cleanup, see$ 106(a). SeeKey Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U. S.809, 814 (1994). In either case, the Government may recover its response costs under $ 107, 42 U. S. C. $ 9607 (2000ed. and Supp. I), the "cost recovery" section of CERCLA.Section 107(a) lists four classes of potentially responsiblepersons (PRPs) and provides that they "shall be liable" for,among other things, "all costs of removal or remedial actionincurred by the United States Government . . . not inconsistent with the national contingency plan." $ 107(a)(4)(A).2Section 107(a) further provides that PRPs shall be liable for"any other necessary costs of response incurred by any otherperson consistent with the national contingency plan. "$ 107(a)(4)(B).After CERCLA's enactment in 1980, litigation arose overwhether $ 107, in addition to allowing the Government andcertain private parties to recover costs from PRPs, also allowed a PRP that had incurred response costs to recovercosts from other PRPs. More specifically, the question waswhether a private party that had incurred response costs,but that had done so voluntarily and was not itself subjectto suit, had a cause of action for cost recovery against otherPRPs. Various courts held that $ 107(a)(4)(B) and its predecessors authorized such a cause of action. See, e. g., Wickland Oil Terminals v. Asarco, Inc., 792 F. 2d 887, 890-8922 The national contingency plan specifies procedures for preparing andresponding to contaminations and was promulgated by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) pursuant to CERCLA $ 105, 42 U.

Supp. 1135, 1140-1143 (ED Pa. 1982).After CERCLA's passage, litigation also ensued over theseparate question whether a private entity that had beensued in a cost recovery action (by the Government or byanother PRP) could obtain contribution from other PRPs.As originally enacted in 1980, CERCLA contained no provision expressly providing for a right of action for contribution. A number of District Courts nonetheless held that,although CERCLA did not mention the word "contribution,"such a right arose either impliedly from provisions of thestatute, or as a matter of federal common law. See, e. g.,United States v. New Castle County, 642 F. Supp. 1258, 1263-1269 (Del. 1986) (contribution right arises under federal common law); Colorado v. ASARCO, Inc., 608 F.

That conclusion was debatable in light of two decisions of this Court that refused torecognize implied or common-law rights to contribution inother federal statutes. See Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 638-647 (1981) (refusingto recognize implied or common-law right to contribution inthe Sherman Act or the Clayton Act); Northwest Airlines,Inc. v.

S. 77, 90-99 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contributionin the Equal Pay Act of 1963 or Title VII of the Civil RightsAct of 1964).Congress subsequently amended CERCLA in the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA),100 Stat. 1613, to provide an express cause of action for contribution, codified as CERCLA $ 113(f)(1):"Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section543US1 Unit: $U10 [03-06-07 13:03:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN163Cite as: 543 U.

Such claims shall be brought in accordancewith this section and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall be governed by Federal law. In resolv-ing contribution claims, the court may allocate responsecosts among liable parties using such equitable factorsas the court determines are appropriate. Nothing inthis subsection shall diminish the right of any person tobring an action for contribution in the absence of a civilaction under section 9606 of this title or section 9607of this title."Id., at 1647, as codified in 42 U. S. C.$ 9613(f )(1).SARA also created a separate express right of contribution,$ 113(f)(3)(B), for "[a] person who has resolved its liability tothe United States or a State for some or all of a responseaction or for some or all of the costs of such action in anadministrative or judicially approved settlement." In short,after SARA, CERCLA provided for a right to cost recoveryin certain circumstances, $ 107(a), and separate rights to con-tribution in other circumstances, $$ 113(f)(1), 113(f)(3)(B).3IIThis case concerns four contaminated aircraft enginemaintenance sites in Texas. Cooper Industries, Inc., ownedand operated those sites until 1981, when it sold them toAviall Services, Inc. Aviall operated the four sites for anumber of years. Ultimately, Aviall discovered that both itand Cooper had contaminated the facilities when petroleum3 In Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U. S. 809 (1994), we observedthat $$ 107 and 113 created "similar and somewhat overlapping" remedies.Id., at 816. The cost recovery remedy of $ 107(a)(4)(B) and the contribution remedy of $ 113(f)(1) are similar at a general level in that they bothallow private parties to recoup costs from other private parties. But thetwo remedies are clearly distinct.543US1 Unit: $U10 [03-06-07 13:03:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN164 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. AVIALL SERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtand other hazardous substances leaked into the ground andground water through underground storage tanks and spills.Aviall notified the Texas Natural Resource ConservationCommission (Commission) of the contamination. The Commission informed Aviall that it was violating state environ-mental laws, directed Aviall to clean up the site, and threatened to pursue an enforcement action if Aviall failed toundertake remediation. Neither the Commission nor theEPA, however, took judicial or administrative measures tocompel cleanup.Aviall cleaned up the properties under the State's supervision, beginning in 1984. Aviall sold the properties to a thirdparty in 1995 and 1996, but remains contractually responsiblefor the cleanup. Aviall has incurred approximately $5 mil-lion in cleanup costs; the total costs may be even greater.In August 1997, Aviall filed this action against Cooper in theUnited States District Court for the Northern District ofTexas, seeking to recover cleanup costs. The original complaint asserted a claim for cost recovery under CERCLA$ 107(a), a separate claim for contribution under CERCLA$ 113(f)(1), and state-law claims. Aviall later amended thecomplaint, combining its two CERCLA claims into a single,joint CERCLA claim. That claim alleged that, pursuant to$ 113(f)(1), Aviall was entitled to seek contribution fromCooper, as a PRP under $ 107(a), for response costs and otherliability Aviall incurred in connection with the Texas facilities.4 Aviall continued to assert state-law claims as well.Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted Cooper's motion. The court held that4 Aviall asserts that it framed its claim in the manner compelled by FifthCircuit precedent holding that a $ 113 claim is a type of $ 107 claim.Geraghty & Miller, Inc. v.

S. 157 (2004)Opinion of the CourtAviall, having abandoned its $ 107 claim, sought contributiononly under $ 113(f)(1). The court held that $ 113(f)(1) reliefwas unavailable to Aviall because it had not been sued underCERCLA $ 106 or $ 107. Having dismissed Aviall's federalclaim, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over thestate-law claims.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-cuit affirmed. 263 F. 3d 134 (2001). The majority, relyingprincipally on the "during or following" language in the firstsentence of $ 113(f )(1), held that "a PRP seeking contributionfrom other PRPs under $ 113(f)(1) must have a pending oradjudged $ 106 administrative order or $ 107(a) cost recoveryaction against it." Id., at 145. The dissent reasoned thatthe final sentence of $ 113(f )(1), the saving clause, clarifiedthat the federal common-law right to contribution survivedthe enactment of $ 113(f)(1), even absent a $ 106 or $ 107(a)civil action. Id., at 148-150 (opinion of Wiener, J.).On rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit reversed by a divided vote, holding that $ 113(f )(1) allows a PRP to obtaincontribution from other PRPs regardless of whether thePRP has been sued under $ 106 or $ 107. 312 F. 3d 677(2002). The court held that "[s]ection 113(f)(1) authorizessuits against PRPs in both its first and last sentence[,] whichstates without qualification that `nothing' in the section shall`diminish' any person's right to bring a contribution action inthe absence of a section 106 or section 107(a) action." Id.,at 681. The court reasoned in part that "may" in $ 113(f)(1)did not mean "may only." Id., at 686-687. Three membersof the en banc court dissented for essentially the reasonsgiven by the panel majority. Id., at 691-693 (opinion ofGarza, J.). We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1099 (2004), andnow reverse.IIIASection 113(f )(1) does not authorize Aviall's suit. The firstsentence, the enabling clause that establishes the right543US1 Unit: $U10 [03-06-07 13:03:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN166 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. AVIALL SERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtof contribution, provides: "Any person may seek contribu-tion . . .during or following any civil action under section9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this title," 42U. S. C. $ 9613(f )(1) (emphasis added). The natural meaningof this sentence is that contribution may only be sought sub-ject to the specified conditions, namely, "during or following"a specified civil action.Aviall answers that "may" should be read permissively,such that "during or following" a civil action is one, but notthe exclusive, instance in which a person may seek contribu-tion. We disagree. First, as just noted, the natural meaning of "may" in the context of the enabling clause is that itauthorizes certain contribution actions--ones that satisfy thesubsequent specified condition--and no others.Second, and relatedly, if $ 113(f)(1) were read to authorizecontribution actions at any time, regardless of the existenceof a $ 106 or $ 107(a) civil action, then Congress need not haveincluded the explicit "during or following" condition. Inother words, Aviall's reading would render part of the statute entirely superfluous, something we are loath to do. See,e. g., Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004). Likewise, if$ 113(f )(1) authorizes contribution actions at any time,$ 113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement, is equally superfluous. There is no reason whyCongress would bother to specify conditions under which aperson may bring a contribution claim, and at the same timeallow contribution actions absent those conditions.The last sentence of $ 113(f )(1), the saving clause, does notchange our conclusion. That sentence provides: "Nothing inthis subsection shall diminish the right of any person tobring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of thistitle." 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f)(1). The sole function of the sentence is to clarify that $ 113(f )(1) does nothing to "diminish"any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of $ 113(f)(1). In other words, the sentence re543US1 Unit: $U10 [03-06-07 13:03:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN167Cite as: 543 U. S. 157 (2004)Opinion of the Courtbuts any presumption that the express right of contributionprovided by the enabling clause is the exclusive cause of action for contribution available to a PRP. The sentence, how-ever, does not itself establish a cause of action; nor doesit expand $ 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions notbrought "during or following" a $ 106 or $ 107(a) civil action;nor does it specify what causes of action for contribution, ifany, exist outside $ 113(f)(1). Reading the saving clause toauthorize $ 113(f)(1) contribution actions not just "during orfollowing" a civil action, but also before such an action,would again violate the settled rule that we must, if possible,construe a statute to give every word some operative effect.See United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,35-36 (1992).Our conclusion follows not simply from $ 113(f )(1) itself,but also from the whole of $ 113. As noted above, $ 113 provides two express avenues for contribution: $ 113(f)(1) ("during or following" specified civil actions) and $ 113(f)(3)(B)(after an administrative or judicially approved settlementthat resolves liability to the United States or a State). Section 113(g)(3) then provides two corresponding 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions, one beginning at thedate of judgment, $ 113(g)(3)(A), and one beginning at thedate of settlement, $ 113(g)(3)(B). Notably absent from$ 113(g)(3) is any provision for starting the limitations periodif a judgment or settlement never occurs, as is the case witha purely voluntary cleanup. The lack of such a provisionsupports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claimunder $ 113(f ), a party must satisfy the conditions of either$ 113(f)(1) or $ 113(f )(3)(B).Each side insists that the purpose of CERCLA bolsters itsreading of $ 113(f)(1). Given the clear meaning of the text,there is no need to resolve this dispute or to consult thepurpose of CERCLA at all. As we have said: "[I]t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principalconcerns of our legislators by which we are governed."

Section 113(f )(1), 100 Stat. 1647, authorizes contribution claims only "during or following" a civil action under$ 106 or $ 107(a), and it is undisputed that Aviall has neverbeen subject to such an action.5 Aviall therefore has no$ 113(f)(1) claim.BAviall and amicus Lockheed Martin contend that, in thealternative to an action for contribution under $ 113(f)(1),Aviall may recover costs under $ 107(a)(4)(B) even though itis a PRP. The dissent would have us so hold. We declineto address the issue. Neither the District Court, nor theFifth Circuit panel, nor the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc considered Aviall's $ 107 claim. In fact, as noted above, Aviallincluded separate $ 107 and $ 113 claims in its original complaint, but then asserted a "combined" $ 107/$ 113 claim in itsamended complaint. The District Court took this consolidated claim to mean that Aviall was relying on $ 107 "notas an independent cause of action," but only "to the extentnecessary to maintain a viable $ 113(f)(1) contribution claim."Civ. Action No. 3:97-CV-1926-D (ND Tex., Jan. 13, 2000),App. to Pet. for Cert. 94a, n. 2. Consequently the court sawno need to address any freestanding $ 107 claim. The FifthCircuit panel likewise concluded that Aviall no longer ad-vanced a stand-alone $ 107 claim. 263 F. 3d, at 137, n. 2.The en banc court found it unnecessary to decide whetherAviall had waived the $ 107 claim, because it held that Aviallcould rely instead on $ 113. 312 F. 3d, at 685, n. 15. Thus,the court did not address the waiver issue, let alone the merits of the $ 107 claim."We ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issuesnot decided below." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta,5 Neither has Aviall been subject to an administrative order under $ 106;thus, we need not decide whether such an order would qualify as a "civilaction under section 9606 . . . or under section 9607(a)" of CERCLA. 42U.

Although we have deviated from this rulein exceptional circumstances, United States v. Mendenhall,446 U. S. 544, 551-552, n. 5 (1980), the circumstances herecut against resolving the $ 107 claim. Both the questionwhether Aviall has waived this claim and the underlying$ 107 question (if it is not waived) may depend in part on therelationship between $$ 107 and 113. That relationship is asignificant issue in its own right. It is also well beyond thescope of the briefing and, indeed, the question presented,which asks simply whether a private party "may bring anaction seeking contribution pursuant to CERCLA Section113(f )(1)." Pet. for Cert. i. The $ 107 claim and the preliminary waiver question merit full consideration by the courtsbelow.Furthermore, the parties cite numerous decisions of theCourts of Appeals as holding that a private party that isitself a PRP may not pursue a $ 107(a) action against otherPRPs for joint and several liability. See, e. g., Bedford Affiliates v. Sills, 156 F. 3d 416, 423-424 (CA2 1998); CenteriorServ. Co. v. Acme Scrap Iron & Metal Corp., 153 F. 3d 344,349-356 (CA6 1998); Pneumo Abex Corp. v.

And we mighthave to consider other issues, also not briefed, such aswhether Aviall, which seeks to recover the share of itscleanup costs fairly chargeable to Cooper, may pursue a $ 107543US1 Unit: $U10 [03-06-07 13:03:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN170 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. AVIALL SERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtcost recovery action for some form of liability other thanjoint and several. We think it more prudent to withholdjudgment on these matters.In view of the importance of the $ 107 issue and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, we arenot prepared--as the dissent would have it--to resolve the$ 107 question solely on the basis of dictum in Key Tronic.We held there that certain attorney's fees were not " `necessary costs of response' " within the meaning of $ 107(a)(4)(B).511 U. S., at 818-821. But we did not address the relevance,if any, of Key Tronic's status as a PRP or confront the relationship between $$ 107 and 113. In discussing $ 107, we didnot even classify it precisely as a right of cost recovery or aright of contribution, as the dissent's descriptions of the decision reveal. Post, at 172 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.) (describing Key Tronic as recognizing a right to " `seek recovery ofcleanup costs' " (quoting 511 U. S., at 818), but in the following paragraph saying that Key Tronic identified a "right tocontribution"). "Questions which merely lurk in the record,neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon,are not to be considered as having been so decided as toconstitute precedents." Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511(1925). Aviall itself recognizes the need for fuller examination of the $ 107 claim; it has simply requested that we remand for consideration of that claim, not that we resolve theclaim in the first instance.CIn addition to leaving open whether Aviall may seek costrecovery under $ 107, Part III-B, supra, we decline to decidewhether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under$ 107. Portions of the Fifth Circuit's opinion below mightbe taken to endorse the latter cause of action, 312 F. 3d, at687; others appear to reserve the question whether such acause of action exists, id., at 685, n. 15.

See Texas Industries,451 U. S., at 638-647; Northwest Airlines, 451 U.

Cf. Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v.Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 19 (1979). Nonetheless, we need not anddo not decide today whether any judicially implied right ofcontribution survived the passage of SARA.* * *We hold only that $ 113(f)(1) does not support Aviall's suit.We therefore reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit andremand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
