This case presents the question whether the competencystandard for pleading guilty or waiving the right to counselis higher than the competency standard for standing trial.We hold that it is not.IOn August 2, 1984, in the early hours of the morning,respondent entered the Red Pearl Saloon in Las Vegas,Nevada, and shot the bartender and a patron four times eachwith an automatic pistol. He then walked behind the barand removed the cash register. Nine days later, respondentarrived at the apartment of his former wife and opened fireon her; five of his seven shots hit their target. Respondentthen shot himself in the abdomen and attempted, withoutsuccess, to slit his wrists. Of the four victims of respond-ent's gunshots, only respondent himself survived. On August 13, respondent summoned police to his hospital bed andconfessed to the killings.After respondent pleaded not guilty to three counts offirst-degree murder, the trial court ordered that he be examined by a pair of psychiatrists, both of whom concluded thathe was competent to stand trial.1 The State thereafter an*Kent S. Scheidegger and Charles L. Hobson filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as amicus curiae urging reversal.Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union et al. by Steven R. Shapiro, Diann Y. Rust-Tierney,John A. Powell, and Bruce J. Winick; for the American Psychiatric Association et al. by James W. Ellis and Barbara E. Bergman; and for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by Jon May.1 One of the psychiatrists stated that there was "not the slightest doubt"that respondent was "in full control of his faculties" insofar as he had the"ability to aid counsel, assist in his own defense, recall evidence and . . .509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:09 PAGES OPINPGT392 GODINEZ v. MORANOpinion of the Courtnounced its intention to seek the death penalty. On Novem-ber 28, 1984, 21/2 months after the psychiatric evaluations,respondent again appeared before the trial court. At thistime respondent informed the court that he wished to discharge his attorneys and change his pleas to guilty. Thereason for the request, according to respondent, was toprevent the presentation of mitigating evidence at hissentencing.On the basis of the psychiatric reports, the trial courtfound that respondent"is competent in that he knew the nature and quality ofhis acts, had the capacity to determine right fromwrong; that he understands the nature of the criminalcharges against him and is able to assist in his defenseof such charges, or against the pronouncement of thejudgment thereafter; that he knows the consequences ofentering a plea of guilty to the charges; and that he canintelligently and knowingly waive his constitutionalright to assistance of an attorney." App. 21.The court advised respondent that he had a right both to theassistance of counsel and to self-representation, warned himof the "dangers and disadvantages" of self-representation,id., at 22, inquired into his understanding of the proceedingsand his awareness of his rights, and asked why he had chosento represent himself. It then accepted respondent's waiverof counsel. The court also accepted respondent's guiltypleas, but not before it had determined that respondent wasnot pleading guilty in response to threats or promises, thathe understood the nature of the charges against him and theconsequences of pleading guilty, that he was aware of thegive testimony if called upon to do so." App. 8. The other psychiatristbelieved that respondent was "knowledgeable of the charges being madeagainst him"; that he had the ability to "assist his attorney, in his owndefense, if he so desire[d]"; and that he was "fully cognizant of the penalties if convicted."

The trial court explicitly found that respondent was "knowingly and intelligently" waiving his right tothe assistance of counsel,ibid., and that his guilty pleas were"freely and voluntarily" given, id., at 64.2On January 21, 1985, a three-judge court sentenced respondent to death for each of the murders. The SupremeCourt of Nevada affirmed respondent's sentences for the RedPearl Saloon murders, but reversed his sentence for the murder of his ex-wife and remanded for imposition of a life sen-tence without the possibility of parole.Moran v. State, 103Nev. 138, 734 P. 2d 712 (1987).On July 30, 1987, respondent filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court. Following an evidentiaryhearing, the trial court rejected respondent's claim that hewas "mentally incompetent to represent himself," concludingthat "the record clearly shows that he was examined by twopsychiatrists both of whom declared [him] competent."App. to Pet. for Cert.

S. 874(1989).Respondent then filed a habeas petition in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Nevada. The District Court denied the petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. 972 F. 2d 263 (1992). The Court of Appeals concluded that the "record in this case" should have led the trialcourt to "entertai[n] a good faith doubt about [respondent's]competency to make a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent2 During the course of this lengthy exchange, the trial court asked respondent whether he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, andrespondent answered as follows: "Just what they give me in, you know,medications."

Rejecting petitioner's argumentthat the trial court's error was "cured by the postconvictionhearing," ibid., and that the competency determination thatfollowed the hearing was entitled to deference under 28U. S. C. $ 2254(d), the Court of Appeals held that "the statecourt's postconviction ruling was premised on the wronglegal standard of competency," 972 F. 2d, at 266. "Compe-tency to waive constitutional rights," according to the Courtof Appeals, "requires a higher level of mental functioningthan that required to stand trial"; while a defendant is competent to stand trial if he has "a rational and factual under-standing of the proceedings and is capable of assisting hiscounsel," a defendant is competent to waive counsel or pleadguilty only if he has "the capacity for `reasoned choice'among the alternatives available to him." Ibid. The Courtof Appeals determined that the trial court had "erroneouslyapplied the standard for evaluating competency to standtrial, instead of the correct `reasoned choice' standard,"id.,at 266-267, and further concluded that when examined "inlight of the correct legal standard," the record did not sup-port a finding that respondent was "mentally capable of thereasoned choice required for a valid waiver of constitutionalrights,"id., at 267.4 The Court of Appeals accordingly in3 The specific features of the record upon which the Court of Appealsrelied were respondent's suicide attempt; his desire to discharge his attorneys so as to prevent the presentation of mitigating evidence at sentencing; his "monosyllabic" responses to the trial court's questions; and thefact that he was on medication at the time he sought to waive his right tocounsel and plead guilty. 972 F. 2d, at 265.4 In holding that respondent was not competent to waive his constitutional rights, the court placed heavy emphasis on the fact that respondentwas on medication at the time he sought to discharge his attorneys andplead guilty.

Id., at 268.Whether the competency standard for pleading guiltyor waiving the right to counsel is higher than the competencystandard for standing trial is a question that has divided theFederal Courts of Appeals 5 and state courts of last re5 While the Ninth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit, seeUnited States v. Masthers, 176 U. S. App. D. C. 242, 247, 539 F. 2d 721, 726(1976), have employed the "reasoned choice" standard for guilty pleas,every other Circuit that has considered the issue has determined that thecompetency standard for pleading guilty is identical to the competencystandard for standing trial. See Allard v. Helgemoe, 572 F. 2d 1, 3-6(CA1), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 858 (1978); United States v. Valentino, 283F. 2d 634, 635 (CA2 1960) (per curiam); United States ex rel.

S. 989 (1993).Three of those same Circuits, however, have indicated that the competencystandard for waiving the right to counsel is "vaguely higher" than thecompetency standard for standing trial, see United States ex rel. Konigsberg v. Vincent, 526 F. 2d 131, 133 (CA2 1975), cert. denied, 426 U. S. 937(1976); United States v. McDowell, 814 F. 2d 245, 250 (CA6), cert. denied,484 U. S. 980 (1987); Blackmon v. Armontrout, 875 F. 2d 164, 166 (CA8),cert. denied, 493 U. S. 939 (1989), and one of them has stated that the twostandards "may not always be coterminous," United States v. Campbell,874 F. 2d 838, 846 (CA1 1989). Only the Ninth Circuit applies the "reasoned choice" standard to waivers of counsel, and only the Seventh Circuit,see United States v. Clark, 943 F. 2d 775, 782 (1991), cert. pending, No.92-6439, has held that the competency standard for waiving counsel isidentical to the competency standard for standing trial. The Fourth Circuit has expressed the view that the two standards are "closely linked."United States v. McGinnis, 384 F. 2d 875, 877 (1967) (per curiam), cert.denied, 390 U.

S. 375, 378 (1966), and he maynot waive his right to counsel or plead guilty unless he doesso "competently and intelligently," Johnson v. Zerbst, 304U. S. 458, 468 (1938); accord,Brady v. United States, 397 U. S.742, 758 (1970). In Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402(1960) (per curiam), we held that the standard for compe-tence to stand trial is whether the defendant has "sufficientpresent ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonabledegree of rational understanding" and has "a rational as wellas factual understanding of the proceedings against him."Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Accord, Drope v.Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171 (1975) ("[A] person whose mentalcondition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand thenature and object of the proceedings against him, to consultwith counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may notbe subjected to a trial"). While we have described thestandard for competence to stand trial, however, we havenever expressly articulated a standard for competence toplead guilty or to waive the right to the assistance of counsel.Relying in large part upon our decision inWestbrook v.Arizona, 384 U. S. 150 (1966) (per curiam), the Ninth Circuitadheres to the view that the competency standard for plead-ing guilty or waiving the right to counsel is higher than thecompetency standard for standing trial. See Sieling v.Eyman, 478 F. 2d 211, 214-215 (1973) (first Ninth Circuit6 Compare, e. g., State v.

S. 389 (1993)Opinion of the Courtdecision applying heightened standard). In Westbrook, atwo-paragraphper curiam opinion, we vacated the lowercourt's judgment affirming the petitioner's conviction, be-cause there had been "a hearing on the issue of [the petitioner's] competence to stand trial," but "no hearing or inquiryinto the issue of his competence to waive his constitutionalright to the assistance of counsel." 384 U. S., at 150. TheNinth Circuit has reasoned that the "clear implication" ofWestbrook is that the Dusky formulation is not "a highenough standard" for determining whether a defendant iscompetent to waive a constitutional right.Sieling, supra,at 214.7 We think the Ninth Circuit has read too much intoWestbrook, and we think it errs in applying two differentcompetency standards.8AThe standard adopted by the Ninth Circuit is whether adefendant who seeks to plead guilty or waive counsel hasthe capacity for "reasoned choice" among the alternativesavailable to him. How this standard is different from (muchless higher than) the Dusky standard--whether the defendant has a "rational understanding" of the proceedings--is notreadily apparent to us. In fact, respondent himself opposedcertiorari on the ground that the difference between the twostandards is merely one of "terminology," Brief in Opposition4, and he devotes little space in his brief on the merits to adefense of the Ninth Circuit's standard, see, e. g., Brief for7 A criminal defendant waives three constitutional rights when he pleadsguilty: the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to a jury trial,and the right to confront one's accusers. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S.238, 243 (1969).8 Although this case comes to us by way of federal habeas corpus, we donot dispose of it on the ground that the heightened competency standard isa "new rule" for purposes of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), becausepetitioner did not raise a Teague defense in the lower courts or in hispetition for certiorari. See Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 26 (1992); Collinsv. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41 (1990).509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT398 GODINEZ v. MORANOpinion of the CourtRespondent 17-18, 27, 32; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 ("Dueprocess does not require [a] higher standard, [it] requires aseparate inquiry").9 But even assuming that there is somemeaningful distinction between the capacity for "reasonedchoice" and a "rational understanding" of the proceedings,we reject the notion that competence to plead guilty or towaive the right to counsel must be measured by a standardthat is higher than (or even different from) theDuskystandard.We begin with the guilty plea. A defendant who standstrial is likely to be presented with choices that entail relinquishment of the same rights that are relinquished by a de-fendant who pleads guilty: He will ordinarily have to decidewhether to waive his "privilege against compulsory self-incrimination,"Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243 (1969),by taking the witness stand; if the option is available, he mayhave to decide whether to waive his "right to trial by jury,"ibid.; and, in consultation with counsel, he may have to decide whether to waive his "right to confront [his] accusers,"ibid., by declining to cross-examine witnesses for the prose-cution. A defendant who pleads not guilty, moreover, facesstill other strategic choices: In consultation with his attor-ney, he may be called upon to decide, among other things,whether (and how) to put on a defense and whether to raiseone or more affirmative defenses. In sum, all criminal defendants--not merely those who plead guilty--may be re-quired to make important decisions once criminal proceedings have been initiated. And while the decision to pleadguilty is undeniably a profound one, it is no more complicatedthan the sum total of decisions that a defendant may becalled upon to make during the course of a trial. (The decision to plead guilty is also made over a shorter period of9 We have used the phrase "rational choice" in describing the competence necessary to withdraw a certiorari petition, Rees v. Peyton, 384 U. S.312, 314 (1966) (per curiam), but there is no indication in that opinion thatthe phrase means something different from "rational understanding."509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT399Cite as: 509 U. S. 389 (1993)Opinion of the Courttime, without the distraction and burden of a trial.) Thisbeing so, we can conceive of no basis for demanding a higherlevel of competence for those defendants who choose to pleadguilty. If theDusky standard is adequate for defendantswho plead not guilty, it is necessarily adequate for those whoplead guilty.Nor do we think that a defendant who waives his right tothe assistance of counsel must be more competent than adefendant who does not, since there is no reason to believethat the decision to waive counsel requires an appreciablyhigher level of mental functioning than the decision to waiveother constitutional rights. Respondent suggests that ahigher competency standard is necessary because a defendant who represents himself " `must have greater powers ofcomprehension, judgment, and reason than would be neces-sary to stand trial with the aid of an attorney.' " Brief forRespondent 26 (quoting Silten & Tullis, Mental Competencyin Criminal Proceedings, 28 Hastings L. J. 1053, 1068 (1977)).Accord, Brief for National Association of Criminal DefenseLawyers as Amicus Curiae 10-12. But this argument hasa flawed premise; the competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to waive the right, not the competence to representhimself.10 In Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975), we10 It is for this reason that the dissent's reliance on Massey v. Moore,348 U. S. 105 (1954), is misplaced. When we said in Massey that "[o]nemight not be insane in the sense of being incapable of standing trial andyet lack the capacity to stand trial without benefit of counsel," id., at 108,we were answering a question that is quite different from the questionpresented in this case. Prior to our decision in Gideon v. Wainwright,372 U. S. 335 (1963), the appointment of counsel was required only in thosestate prosecutions in which "special circumstances" were present, see id.,at 350-351 (Harlan, J., concurring), and the question in Massey waswhether a finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial compels aconclusion that there are no "special circumstances" justifying the appointment of counsel. The question here is not whether a defendant who iscompetent to stand trial has no right to have counsel appointed; it is509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT400 GODINEZ v. MORANOpinion of the Courtheld that a defendant choosing self-representation must doso "competently and intelligently," id., at 835, but we madeit clear that the defendant's "technical legal knowledge"is "not relevant" to the determination whether he is competent to waive his right to counsel, id., at 836, and weemphasized that although the defendant "may conduct hisown defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choicemust be honored,"id., at 834. Thus, while "[i]t is undeniablethat in most criminal prosecutions defendants could betterdefend with counsel's guidance than by their own unskilledefforts," ibid., a criminal defendant's ability to representhimself has no bearing upon his competence to choose selfrepresentation.11 BA finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial,however, is not all that is necessary before he may be permit-ted to plead guilty or waive his right to counsel. In additionto determining that a defendant who seeks to plead guilty orwaive counsel is competent, a trial court must satisfy itselfthat the waiver of his constitutional rights is knowing andvoluntary.Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 28-29 (1992) (guiltyplea); Faretta, supra, at 835 (waiver of counsel). In thiswhether such a defendant is competent to waive the right to counsel that(after Gideon) he under all circumstances has.11 We note also that the prohibition against the trial of incompetent defendants dates back at least to the time of Blackstone, see Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 446 (1992); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172(1975); Youtsey v. United States, 97 F. 937, 940 (CA6 1899) (collecting "common law authorities"), and that "[b]y the common law of that time,it was not representation by counsel but self-representation that wasthe practice in prosecutions for serious crime," Faretta v. California,422 U. S., at 823; accord, id., at 850 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("selfrepresentation was common, if not required, in 18th century English andAmerican prosecutions"). It would therefore be "difficult to say that astandard which was designed to determine whether a defendant was capable of defending himself" is "inadequate when he chooses to conduct hisown defense." People v. Reason, 37 N. Y. 2d, at 354, 334 N. E. 2d, at 574.509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT401Cite as: 509 U. S. 389 (1993)Opinion of the Courtsense there is a "heightened" standard for pleading guiltyand for waiving the right to counsel, but it is not a heightened standard of competence.12This two-part inquiry 13 is what we had in mind in Westbrook. When we distinguished between "competence tostand trial" and "competence to waive [the] constitutionalright to the assistance of counsel," 384 U. S., at 150, we wereusing "competence to waive" as a shorthand for the "intelligent and competent waiver" requirement of Johnson v.Zerbst. This much is clear from the fact that we quoted thatvery language from Zerbst immediately after noting that thetrial court had not determined whether the petitioner wascompetent to waive his right to counsel. See 384 U. S., at150 (" `This protecting duty imposes the serious and weightyresponsibility upon the trial judge of determining whetherthere is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused' ") (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S., at 465).Thus, Westbrook stands only for the unremarkable proposi12 The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant's mental capacity;the question is whether he has the ability to understand the proceedings.See Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 171 (defendant is incompetent if he "lacksthe capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedingsagainst him") (emphasis added). The purpose of the "knowing and voluntary" inquiry, by contrast, is to determine whether the defendant actuallydoes understand the significance and consequences of a particular decisionand whether the decision is uncoerced. See Faretta v. California, supra,at 835 (defendant waiving counsel must be "made aware of the dangersand disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establishthat `he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open' ")(quoting Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 279 (1942));Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S., at 244 (defendant pleading guilty must have"a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence").13 We do not mean to suggest, of course, that a court is required to makea competency determination in every case in which a defendant seeks toplead guilty or to waive his right to counsel. As in any criminal case, acompetency determination is necessary only when a court has reason todoubt the defendant's competence. See Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 180-181; Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 385 (1966).509us2109L 05-09-97 08:15:10 PAGES OPINPGT402 GODINEZ v. MORANOpinion of Kennedy, J.tion that when a defendant seeks to waive his right to coun-sel, a determination that he is competent to stand trial is notenough; the waiver must also be intelligent and voluntarybefore it can be accepted.14IIIRequiring that a criminal defendant be competent has amodest aim: It seeks to ensure that he has the capacity tounderstand the proceedings and to assist counsel. Whilepsychiatrists and scholars may find it useful to classify thevarious kinds and degrees of competence, and while Statesare free to adopt competency standards that are more elaborate than the Dusky formulation, the Due Process Clausedoes not impose these additional requirements. Cf.Medinav.California, 505 U. S. 437, 446-453 (1992). The judgmentof the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
