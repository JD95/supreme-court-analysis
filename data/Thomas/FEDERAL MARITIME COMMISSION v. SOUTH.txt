This case presents the question whether state sovereignimmunity precludes petitioner Federal Maritime Commis-sion (FMC or Commission) from adjudicating a private party's complaint that a state-run port has violated the ShippingAct of 1984, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1701et seq. (1994 ed. andSupp. V). We hold that state sovereign immunity bars suchan adjudicative proceeding.IOn five occasions, South Carolina Maritime Services, Inc.(Maritime Services), asked respondent South Carolina StatePorts Authority (SCSPA) for permission to berth a cruiseship, the M/V Tropic Sea, at the SCSPA's port facilities inCharleston, South Carolina. Maritime Services intended tooffer cruises on the M/V Tropic Sea originating from thePort of Charleston. Some of these cruises would stop in theBahamas while others would merely travel in internationalwaters before returning to Charleston with no interveningports of call. On all of these trips, passengers would be permitted to participate in gambling activities while on board.The SCSPA repeatedly denied Maritime Services' requests, contending that it had an established policy ofdenying berths in the Port of Charleston to vessels whoseprimary purpose was gambling.

SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courtices filed a complaint with the FMC,1 contending that theSCSPA's refusal to provide berthing space to the M/V TropicSea violated the Shipping Act. Maritime Services allegedin its complaint that the SCSPA had implemented its antigambling policy in a discriminatory fashion by providingberthing space in Charleston to two Carnival Cruise Linesvessels even though Carnival offered gambling activities onthese ships. Maritime Services therefore complained thatthe SCSPA had unduly and unreasonably preferred Carnivalover Maritime Services in violation of 46 U. S. C. App.$ 1709(d)(4) (1994 ed., Supp. V),2 and unreasonably refusedto deal or negotiate with Maritime Services in violationof $ 1709(b)(10).3 App. 14-15. It further alleged that theSCSPA's unlawful actions had inflicted upon Maritime Services a "loss of profits, loss of earnings, loss of sales, and lossof business opportunities."Id., at 15.To remedy its injuries, Maritime Services prayed that theFMC: (1) seek a temporary restraining order and prelimi-nary injunction in the United States District Court for theDistrict of South Carolina "enjoining [the SCSPA] from uti-lizing its discriminatory practice to refuse to provide berthing space and passenger services to Maritime Services;" 41 See 46 U.

Id., at 16.Consistent with the FMC's Rules of Practice and Pro-cedure, Maritime Services' complaint was referred to anAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ). See 46 CFR $ 502.223(2001). The SCSPA then filed an answer, maintaining,interalia, that it had adhered to its antigambling policy in a nondiscriminatory manner. It also filed a motion to dismiss,asserting, as relevant, that the SCSPA, as an arm of theState of South Carolina, was "entitled to Eleventh Amend-ment immunity" from Maritime Services' suit. App. 41.The SCSPA argued that "the Constitution prohibits Con-gress from passing a statute authorizing Maritime Servicesto file [this] Complaint before the Commission and, thereby,sue the State of South Carolina for damages and injunctiverelief." Id., at 44.The ALJ agreed, concluding that recent decisions of thisCourt "interpreting the 11th Amendment and State sover-eign immunity fromprivate suits . . . require[d] that [Mari-time Services'] complaint be dismissed."

SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courtstate sovereign immunity, the ALJ reasoned that "[i]f federalcourts that are established under Article III of the Constitution must respect States' 11th Amendment immunity andCongress is powerless to override the States' immunityunder Article I of the Constitution, it is irrational to arguethat an agency like the Commission, created under an ArticleI statute, is free to disregard the 11th Amendment or itsrelated doctrine of State immunity from private suits."App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a (emphasis in original). The ALJnoted, however, that his decision did not deprive the FMCof its "authority to look into [Maritime Services'] allegationsof Shipping Act violations and enforce the Shipping Act."Id., at 60a. For example, the FMC could institute its ownformal investigatory proceeding, see 46 CFR $ 502.282(2001), or refer Maritime Services' allegations to its Bureauof Enforcement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a-61a.While Maritime Services did not appeal the ALJ's dismissal of its complaint, the FMC on its own motion decidedto review the ALJ's ruling to consider whether state sovereign immunity from private suits extends to proceedingsbefore the Commission. Id., at 29a-30a. It concluded that"[t]he doctrine of state sovereign immunity . . . is meant tocover proceedings before judicial tribunals, whether Federalor state, not executive branch administrative agencies likethe Commission." Id., at 33a. As a result, the FMC heldthat sovereign immunity did not bar the Commission fromadjudicating private complaints against state-run ports andreversed the ALJ's decision dismissing Maritime Services'complaint. Id., at 35a.The SCSPA filed a petition for review, and the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.Observing that "any proceeding where a federal officer adjudicates disputes between private parties and unconsentingstates would not have passed muster at the time of the Constitution's passage nor after the ratification of the EleventhAmendment," the Court of Appeals reasoned that "[s]uch an535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN751Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courtadjudication is equally as invalid today, whether the forumbe a state court, a federal court, or a federal administrativeagency." 243 F. 3d 165, 173 (2001). Reviewing the "precisenature" of the procedures employed by the FMC for resolving private complaints, the Court of Appeals concluded thatthe proceeding "walks, talks, and squawks very much likea lawsuit" and that "[i]ts placement within the ExecutiveBranch cannot blind us to the fact that the proceeding istruly an adjudication."Id., at 174. The Court of Appealstherefore held that because the SCSPA is an arm of the Stateof South Carolina,6 sovereign immunity precluded the FMCfrom adjudicating Maritime Services' complaint, and remanded the case with instructions that it be dismissed.Id., at 179.We granted the FMC's petition for certiorari, 534 U. S. 971(2001), and now affirm.IIDual sovereignty is a defining feature of our Nation's constitutional blueprint. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.452, 457 (1991). States, upon ratification of the Constitution,did not consent to become mere appendages of the FederalGovernment. Rather, they entered the Union "with theirsovereignty intact." Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991). An integral component of that"residuary and inviolable sovereignty," The FederalistNo. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison), retained by6 The SCSPA was created by the State of South Carolina "as an instrumentality of the State," for, among other purposes, "develop[ing] and improv[ing] the harbors or seaports of Charleston, Georgetown and PortRoyal for the handling of water-borne commerce from and to any part of[South Carolina] and other states and foreign countries." S. C. Code Ann.$ 54-3-130 (1992). The United States Court of Appeals for the FourthCircuit has ruled that the SCSPA is protected by South Carolina's sovereign immunity because it is an arm of the State, see, e. g., Ristow v. SouthCarolina Ports Authority, 58 F. 3d 1051 (1995), and no party to this casecontests that determination.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN752 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courtthe States is their immunity from private suits. Reflectingthe widespread understanding at the time the Constitutionwas drafted, Alexander Hamilton explained:"It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to beamenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.This is the general sense and the general practice ofmankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes ofsovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of everyState of the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surren-der of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it willremain with the States . . . ." Id., No. 81, at 487-488(emphasis in original).States, in ratifying the Constitution, did surrender aportion of their inherent immunity by consenting to suitsbrought by sister States or by the Federal Government.SeeAlden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 755 (1999). Nevertheless,the Convention did not disturb States' immunity from pri-vate suits, thus firmly enshrining this principle in our constitutional framework. "The leading advocates of the Con-stitution assured the people in no uncertain terms that theConstitution would not strip the States of sovereign immunity." Id., at 716.The States' sovereign immunity, however, fell into peril inthe early days of our Nation's history when this Court heldinChisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), that Article IIIauthorized citizens of one State to sue another State in fed-eral court. The "decision `fell upon the country with a profound shock.' " Alden, supra, at 720 (quoting 1 C. Warren,The Supreme Court in United States History 96 (rev. ed.1926)). In order to overturn Chisholm, Congress quicklypassed the Eleventh Amendment and the States ratified itspeedily. The Amendment clarified that "[t]he Judicialpower of the United States shall not be construed to extendto any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecutedagainst one of the United States by Citizens of another State,535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN753Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courtor by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." We havesince acknowledged that the Chisholm decision was erroneous. See, e. g., Alden, 527 U. S., at 721-722.Instead of explicitly memorializing the full breadth of thesovereign immunity retained by the States when the Consti-tution was ratified, Congress chose in the text of the Eleventh Amendment only to "address the specific provisions ofthe Constitution that had raised concerns during the ratification debates and formed the basis of the Chisholm deci-sion."Id., at 723. As a result, the Eleventh Amendmentdoes not define the scope of the States' sovereign immunity;it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity.Cf. Blatchford, supra, at 779 ("[W]e have understood theEleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says,but for the presupposition of our constitutional structurewhich it confirms"). IIIWe now consider whether the sovereign immunity enjoyedby States as part of our constitutional framework applies toadjudications conducted by the FMC. Petitioner FMC andrespondent United States7 initially maintain that the Courtof Appeals erred because sovereign immunity only shieldsStates from exercises of "judicial power" and FMC adjudications are not judicial proceedings. As support for theirposition, they point to the text of the Eleventh Amendmentand contend that "[t]he Amendment's reference to `judicialPower' and to `any suit in law or equity' clearly mark itas an immunity from judicial process." Brief for UnitedStates 15.7 While the United States is a party to this case and agrees with theFMC that state sovereign immunity does not preclude the Commissionfrom adjudicating Maritime Services' complaint against the SCSPA, it isnonetheless a respondent because it did not seek review of the Court ofAppeals' decision below. See this Court's Rule 12.6. The United Statesinstead opposed the FMC's petition for certiorari. See Brief for UnitedStates in Opposition.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN754 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the CourtFor purposes of this case, we will assume, arguendo, thatin adjudicating complaints filed by private parties under theShipping Act, the FMC does not exercise the judicial powerof the United States. Such an assumption, however, doesnot end our inquiry as this Court has repeatedly held thatthe sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment.8 See,e. g., Alden, supra (holding that sovereign immunity shieldsStates from private suits in state courts pursuant to federalcauses of action); Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak,501 U. S. 775 (1991) (applying state sovereign immunity tosuits by Indian tribes); Principality of Monaco v. Missis-sippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934) (applying state sovereign immunity to suits by foreign nations); Ex parte New York, 256U. S. 490 (1921) (applying state sovereign immunity to admiralty proceedings); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900)(applying state sovereign immunity to suits by federal corporations); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890) (applyingstate sovereign immunity to suits by a State's own citizens under federal-question jurisdiction). Adhering to thatwell-reasoned precedent, see Part II,supra, we must deter-mine whether the sovereign immunity embedded in our constitutional structure and retained by the States when theyjoined the Union extends to FMC adjudicative proceedings.A"[L]ook[ing] first to evidence of the original understand-ing of the Constitution," Alden, 527 U. S., at 741, as well as8 To the extent that Justice Breyer, looking to the text of the Eleventh Amendment, suggests that sovereign immunity only shields Statesfrom "the `[j]udicial power of the United States,' " post, at 777 (dissentingopinion), he "engage[s] in the type of ahistorical literalism we have rejected in interpreting the scope of the States' sovereign immunity sincethe discredited decision in Chisholm," Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 730(1999). Furthermore, it is ironic that Justice Breyer adopts such a textual approach in defending the conduct of an independent agency thatitself lacks any textual basis in the Constitution.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN755Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courtearly congressional practice, see id., at 743-744, we find arelatively barren historical record, from which the partiesdraw radically different conclusions. Petitioner FMC, forinstance, argues that state sovereign immunity should notextend to administrative adjudications because "[t]here is noevidence that state immunity from the adjudication of complaints by executive officers was an established principle atthe time of the adoption of the Constitution." Brief for Peti-tioner 28 (emphasis in original). The SCSPA, on the otherhand, asserts that it is more relevant that "Congress did notattempt to subject the States to private suits before federal administrative tribunals" during the early days of ourRepublic. Brief for Respondent SCSPA 19.In truth, the relevant history does not provide direct guidance for our inquiry. The Framers, who envisioned a limitedFederal Government, could not have anticipated the vastgrowth of the administrative state. See Alden, supra, at807 (Souter, J., dissenting) ("The proliferation of Government, State and Federal, would amaze the Framers, and theadministrative state with its reams of regulations wouldleave them rubbing their eyes"). Because formalized administrative adjudications were all but unheard of in the late18th century and early 19th century, the dearth of specificevidence indicating whether the Framers believed that theStates' sovereign immunity would apply in such proceedingsis unsurprising.This Court, however, has applied a presumption--firstexplicitly stated in Hans v. Louisiana, supra--that the Constitution was not intended to "rais[e] up" any proceedingsagainst the States that were "anomalous and unheard ofwhen the Constitution was adopted." Id., at 18. We therefore attribute great significance to the fact that States werenot subject to private suits in administrative adjudicationsat the time of the founding or for many years thereafter.For instance, while the United States asserts that "stateentities have long been subject to similar administrative535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN756 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courtenforcement proceedings," Reply Brief for United States12, the earliest example it provides did not occur until 1918,see id., at 14 (citing California Canneries Co. v. SouthernPacific Co., 51 I. C. C. 500 (1918)).BTo decide whether the Hans presumption applies here,however, we must examine FMC adjudications to determinewhether they are the type of proceedings from which theFramers would have thought the States possessed immunitywhen they agreed to enter the Union.In another case asking whether an immunity present inthe judicial context also applied to administrative adjudica-tions, this Court considered whether ALJs share the sameabsolute immunity from suit as do Article III judges. SeeButz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978). Examining in thatcase the duties performed by an ALJ, this Court observed:"There can be little doubt that the role of the modernfederal hearing examiner or administrative law judge. . . is `functionally comparable' to that of a judge. Hispowers are often, if not generally, comparable to thoseof a trial judge: He may issue subpoenas, rule on proffersof evidence, regulate the course of the hearing, andmake or recommend decisions. More importantly, theprocess of agency adjudication is currently structuredso as to assure that the hearing examiner exercises hisindependent judgment on the evidence before him, freefrom pressures by the parties or other officials withinthe agency."Id., at 513 (citation omitted).Beyond the similarities between the role of an ALJ and thatof a trial judge, this Court also noted the numerous commonfeatures shared by administrative adjudications and judicialproceedings:"[F]ederal administrative law requires that agency adju-dication contain many of the same safeguards as are535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN757Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courtavailable in the judicial process. The proceedings areadversary in nature. They are conducted before a trierof fact insulated from political influence. A partyis entitled to present his case by oral or documentaryevidence, and the transcript of testimony and exhibitstogether with the pleadings constitute the exclusive record for decision. The parties are entitled to know thefindings and conclusions on all of the issues of fact, law,or discretion presented on the record." Ibid. (citationsomitted).This Court therefore concluded in Butz that ALJs were"entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability fortheir judicial acts." Id., at 514.Turning to FMC adjudications specifically, neither theCommission nor the United States disputes the Court of Ap-peals' characterization below that such a proceeding "walks,talks, and squawks very much like a lawsuit." 243 F. 3d, at174. Nor do they deny that the similarities identified inButz between administrative adjudications and trial courtproceedings are present here. See 46 CFR $ 502.142 (2001).A review of the FMC's Rules of Practice and Procedureconfirms that FMC administrative proceedings bear a remarkably strong resemblance to civil litigation in federalcourts. For example, the FMC's Rules governing pleadings are quite similar to those found in the Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure. A case is commenced by the filing of acomplaint. See 46 CFR $ 502.61 (2001); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.3. The defendant then must file an answer, generally within20 days of the date of service of the complaint, see$ 502.64(a); Rule 12(a)(1), and may also file a motion todismiss, see $ 502.227(b)(1); Rule 12(b). A defendant is alsoallowed to file counterclaims against the plaintiff. See$ 502.64(d); Rule 13. If a defendant fails to respond to acomplaint, default judgment may be entered on behalf ofthe plaintiff. See $ 502.64(b); Rule 55. Intervention is alsoallowed. See $ 502.72; Rule 24.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN758 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the CourtLikewise, discovery in FMC adjudications largely mirrorsdiscovery in federal civil litigation. See 46 U. S. C. App.$ 1711(a)(1) (1994 ed.) (instructing that in FMC adjudicatoryproceedings "discovery procedures . . . , to the extent practicable, shall be in conformity with the rules applicable in civilproceedings in the district courts of the United States"). Inboth types of proceedings, parties may conduct depositions,see, e. g., 46 CFR $ 502.202 (2001); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 28,which are governed by similar requirements. Compare$$ 502.202, 502.203, and 502.204, with Rules 28, 29, 30, and 31.Parties may also discover evidence by: (1) serving writteninterrogatories, see $ 502.205; Rule 33; (2) requesting thatanother party either produce documents, see $ 502.206(a)(1);Rule 34(a)(1), or allow entry on that party's property for thepurpose of inspecting the property or designated objectsthereon, $ 502.206(a)(2); Rule 34(a)(2); and (3) submittingrequests for admissions, $ 502.207; Rule 36. And a partyfailing to obey discovery orders in either type of proceedingis subject to a variety of sanctions, including the entry ofdefault judgment. See $ 502.210(a); Rule 37(b)(2).Not only are discovery procedures virtually indistinguishable, but the role of the ALJ, the impartial officer 9 designated to hear a case, see $ 502.147, is similar to that of anArticle III judge. An ALJ has the authority to "arrangeand give notice of hearing." Ibid. At that hearing, he may"prescribe the order in which evidence shall be presented; dispose of procedural requests or similar matters; hear and rule upon motions; administer oaths andaffirmations; examine witnesses; direct witnesses to testify or produce evidence available to them which will aidin the determination of any question of fact in issue; rule9 See 46 CFR $ 502.224 (2001) (requiring that ALJs be shielded frompolitical influence in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act).535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN759Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courtupon offers of proof . . . and dispose of any other matterthat normally and properly arises in the course of proceedings." Ibid.The ALJ also fixes "the time and manner of filing briefs,"$ 502.221(a), which contain findings of fact as well as legalargument, see $ 502.221(d)(1). After the submission of thesebriefs, the ALJ issues a decision that includes "a statementof findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basistherefor, upon all the material issues presented on the record, and the appropriate rule, order, section, relief, or denialthereof." $ 502.223. Such relief may include an order directing the payment of reparations to an aggrieved party.See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1710(g) (1994 ed., Supp. V); 46 CFR$ 502.251 (2001). The ALJ's ruling subsequently becomesthe final decision of the FMC unless a party, by filing exceptions, appeals to the Commission or the Commission decides to review the ALJ's decision "on its own initiative."$ 502.227(a)(3). In cases where a complainant obtains reparations, an ALJ may also require the losing party to paythe prevailing party's attorney's fees. See 46 U. S. C. App.$ 1710(g); 46 CFR $ 502.254 (2001).In short, the similarities between FMC proceedings andcivil litigation are overwhelming. In fact, to the extent thatsituations arise in the course of FMC adjudications "whichare not covered by a specific Commission rule," the FMC'sown Rules of Practice and Procedure specifically providethat "the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will be followedto the extent that they are consistent with sound administrative practice." 10 $ 502.12.10 In addition, "[u]nless inconsistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and [the FMC's Rules of Practice and Procedure],the Federal Rules of Evidence [are] applicable" in FMC adjudicative proceedings. $ 502.156.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN760 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the CourtCThe preeminent purpose of state sovereign immunity is toaccord States the dignity that is consistent with their statusas sovereign entities. See In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 505(1887). "The founding generation thought it `neither becoming nor convenient that the several States of the Union, invested with that large residuum of sovereignty which hadnot been delegated to the United States, should be summoned as defendants to answer the complaints of privatepersons.' " Alden, 527 U. S., at 748 (quoting In re Ayers,supra, at 505).Given both this interest in protecting States' dignity andthe strong similarities between FMC proceedings and civillitigation, we hold that state sovereign immunity bars theFMC from adjudicating complaints filed by a private partyagainst a nonconsenting State. Simply put, if the Framersthought it an impermissible affront to a State's dignity to berequired to answer the complaints of private parties in federal courts, we cannot imagine that they would have foundit acceptable to compel a State to do exactly the same thingbefore the administrative tribunal of an agency, such as theFMC. Cf. Alden, supra, at 749 ("Private suits against nonconsenting States . . . present `the indignity of subjecting aState to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties,' regardless of the forum" (quotingIn re Ayers, supra, at 505) (citations omitted; emphasisadded)). The affront to a State's dignity does not lessenwhen an adjudication takes place in an administrative tribunal as opposed to an Article III court.11 In both instances, aState is required to defend itself in an adversarial proceeding11 One, in fact, could argue that allowing a private party to haul a Statein front of such an administrative tribunal constitutes a greater insult toa State's dignity than requiring a State to appear in an Article III courtpresided over by a judge with life tenure nominated by the President ofthe United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN761Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courtagainst a private party before an impartial federal officer.12Moreover, it would be quite strange to prohibit Congressfrom exercising its Article I powers to abrogate state sover-eign immunity in Article III judicial proceedings, see Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 72, but permit the use of those sameArticle I powers to create court-like administrative tribunalswhere sovereign immunity does not apply.13DThe United States suggests two reasons why we shoulddistinguish FMC administrative adjudications from judicialproceedings for purposes of state sovereign immunity. Bothof these arguments are unavailing.1The United States first contends that sovereign immunityshould not apply to FMC adjudications because the Commission's orders are not self-executing. See Brief for UnitedStates 18-21. Whereas a court may enforce a judgmentthrough the exercise of its contempt power, the FMC cannotenforce its own orders. Rather, the Commission's orders12 Contrary to the suggestion contained in Justice Breyer's dissentingopinion, our "basic analogy" is not "between a federal administrative proceeding triggered by a private citizen and a private citizen's lawsuitagainst a State" in a State's own courts. Post, at 779. Rather, as ourdiscussion above makes clear, the more apt comparison is between a complaint filed by a private party against a State with the FMC and a lawsuitbrought by a private party against a State in federal court.13 While Justice Breyer asserts by use of analogy that this case implicates the First Amendment right of citizens to petition the Federal Government for a redress of grievances, see ibid., the Constitution no moreprotects a citizen's right to litigate against a State in front of a federaladministrative tribunal than it does a citizen's right to sue a State in federal court. Both types of proceedings were "anomalous and unheard ofwhen the Constitution was adopted," Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 18(1890), and a private party plainly has no First Amendment right to haula State in front of either an Article III court or a federal administrativetribunal.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN762 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courtcan only be enforced by a federal district court. See, e. g.,46 U. S. C. App. $ 1712(e) (1994 ed.) (enforcement of civil penalties); $$ 1713(c) and (d) (enforcement of nonreparation andreparation orders).The United States presents a valid distinction between theauthority possessed by the FMC and that of a court. Forpurposes of this case, however, it is a distinction without ameaningful difference. To the extent that the United Stateshighlights this fact in order to suggest that a party allegedto have violated the Shipping Act is not coerced to participate in FMC proceedings, it is mistaken. The relevant stat-utory scheme makes it quite clear that, absent sovereignimmunity, States would effectively be required to defendthemselves against private parties in front of the FMC.A State seeking to contest the merits of a complaint filedagainst it by a private party must defend itself in front ofthe FMC or substantially compromise its ability to defenditself at all. For example, once the FMC issues a nonreparation order, and either the Attorney General or the injuredprivate party seeks enforcement of that order in a federaldistrict court,14 the sanctioned party is not permitted to liti-gate the merits of its position in that court. See $ 1713(c)(limiting district court review to whether the relevant order"was properly made and duly issued"). Moreover, if a partyfails to appear before the FMC, it may not then argue themerits of its position in an appeal of the Commission's determination filed under 28 U. S. C. $ 2342(3)(B)(iv). See UnitedStates v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 37(1952) ("Simple fairness to those who are engaged in thetasks of administration, and to litigants, requires as a generalrule that courts should not topple over administrative deci-sions unless the administrative body not only has erred but14 A reparation order issued by the FMC, by contrast, may be enforcedin a United States district court only in an action brought by the injured private party. See Part IV-B, infra. 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1713(d)(1994 ed.).535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN763Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courthas erred against objection made at the time appropriateunder its practice").Should a party choose to ignore an order issued by theFMC, the Commission may impose monetary penalties foreach day of noncompliance. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1712(a)(1994 ed., Supp. V). The Commission may then request thatthe Attorney General of the United States seek to recoverthe amount assessed by the Commission in federal districtcourt, see $ 1712(e) (1994 ed.), and a State's sovereign im-munity would not extend to that action, as it is one broughtby the United States. Furthermore, once the FMC issuesan order assessing a civil penalty, a sanctioned party maynot later contest the merits of that order in an enforcementaction brought by the Attorney General in federal districtcourt. See ibid. (limiting review to whether the assessmentof the civil penalty was "regularly made and duly issued");United States v. Interlink Systems, Inc., 984 F. 2d 79, 83(CA2 1993) (holding that review of whether an order was"regularly made and duly issued" does not include review ofthe merits of the FMC's order).Thus, any party, including a State, charged in a complaintby a private party with violating the Shipping Act is facedwith the following options: appear before the Commission ina bid to persuade the FMC of the strength of its positionor stand defenseless once enforcement of the Commission'snonreparation order or assessment of civil penalties is soughtin federal district court.15 To conclude that this choice does15 While Justice Breyer argues that States' access to "full judicialreview" of the Commission's orders mitigates any coercion to participatein FMC adjudicative proceedings, post, at 784, he earlier concedes that aState must appear before the Commission in order "to obtain full judicialreview of an adverse agency decision in a court of appeals," post, at 783.This case therefore does not involve a situation where Congress has allowed a party to obtain full de novo judicial review of Commission orderswithout first appearing before the Commission, and we express no opinionas to whether sovereign immunity would apply to FMC adjudicative proceedings under such circumstances.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN764 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courtnot coerce a State to participate in an FMC adjudicationwould be to blind ourselves to reality.16The United States and Justice Breyer maintain that anysuch coercion to participate in FMC proceedings is permissible because the States have consented to actions brought bythe Federal Government. See Alden, 527 U. S., at 755-756("In ratifying the Constitution, the States consented to suitsbrought by . . . the Federal Government"). The AttorneyGeneral's decision to bring an enforcement action against aState after the conclusion of the Commission's proceedings,however, does not retroactively convert an FMC adjudica-tion initiated and pursued by a private party into one initiated and pursued by the Federal Government. The prose-cution of a complaint filed by a private party with the FMCis plainly not controlled by the United States, but rather iscontrolled by that private party; the only duty assumed bythe FMC, and hence the United States, in conjunction witha private complaint is to assess its merits in an impartialmanner. Indeed, the FMC does not even have the discretionto refuse to adjudicate complaints brought by private parties. See, e. g., 243 F. 3d, at 176 ("The FMC had no choicebut to adjudicate this dispute"). As a result, the UnitedStates plainly does not "exercise . . . political responsibility"for such complaints, but instead has impermissibly effected"a broad delegation to private persons to sue nonconsentingStates."17 Alden, supra, at 756.16 Justice Breyer's observation that private citizens may pressure theFederal Government in a variety of ways to take other actions that affectStates is beside the point. See post, at 783-784. Sovereign immunityconcerns are not implicated, for example, when the Federal Governmentenacts a rule opposed by a State. See post, at 784. It is an entirelydifferent matter, however, when the Federal Government attempts to coerce States into answering the complaints of private parties in an adjudicative proceeding. See Part III-C, supra.17 Moreover, a State obviously will not know ex ante whether the Attorney General will choose to bring an enforcement action. Therefore, it is535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN765Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Court2The United States next suggests that sovereign immunityshould not apply to FMC proceedings because they do notpresent the same threat to the financial integrity of Statesas do private judicial suits. See Brief for United States 21.The Government highlights the fact that, in contrast to anonreparation order, for which the Attorney General mayseek enforcement at the request of the Commission, a reparation order may be enforced in a United States districtcourt only in an action brought by the private party to whomthe award was made. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1713(d)(1).The United States then points out that a State's sovereignimmunity would extend to such a suit brought by a privateparty. Brief for United States 21.This argument, however, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the purposes of sovereign immunity. Whilestate sovereign immunity serves the important function ofshielding state treasuries and thus preserving "the States'ability to govern in accordance with the will of their citizens," Alden, supra, at 750-751, the doctrine's central purpose is to "accord the States the respect owed them as" jointsovereigns. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 146 (1993); seePart III-C, supra. It is for this reason, for instance, thatsovereign immunity applies regardless of whether a privateplaintiff 's suit is for monetary damages or some other typeof relief. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 58 ("[W]e haveoften made it clear that the relief sought by a plaintiff suingthe mere prospect that he may do so that coerces a State to participate inFMC proceedings. For if a State does not present its arguments to theCommission, it will have all but lost any opportunity to defend itself inthe event that the Attorney General later decides to seek enforcement of aCommission order or the Commission's assessment of civil penalties. Seesupra, at 762-764.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN766 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courta State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit isbarred by the Eleventh Amendment").Sovereign immunity does not merely constitute a defenseto monetary liability or even to all types of liability. Rather,it provides an immunity from suit. The statutory scheme,as interpreted by the United States, is thus no more permissible than if Congress had allowed private parties to sueStates in federal court for violations of the Shipping Act butprecluded a court from awarding them any relief.It is also worth noting that an FMC order that a State payreparations to a private party may very well result in thewithdrawal of funds from that State's treasury. A Statesubject to such an order at the conclusion of an FMC adjudicatory proceeding would either have to make the requiredpayment to the injured private party or stand in violationof the Commission's order. If the State were willfully andknowingly to choose noncompliance, the Commission couldassess a civil penalty of up to $25,000 a day against the State.See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1712(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V). And if theState then refused to pay that penalty, the Attorney General,at the request of the Commission, could seek to recover thatamount in a federal district court; because that action wouldbe one brought by the Federal Government, the State's sovereign immunity would not extend to it.To be sure, the United States suggests that the FMC'sstatutory authority to impose civil penalties for violationsof reparation orders is "doubtful." Reply Brief for UnitedStates 7. The relevant statutory provisions, however, appear on their face to confer such authority. For while reparation orders and nonreparation orders are distinguished inother parts of the statutory scheme, see, e. g., 46 U. S. C. App.$$ 1713(c) and (d) (1994 ed.), the provision addressing civilpenalties makes no such distinction. See $ 1712(a) (1994 ed.,Supp. V) ("Whoever violates . . . a Commission order is liable to the United States for a civil penalty"). The United535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN767Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the CourtStates, moreover, does not even dispute that the FMC couldimpose a civil penalty on a State for failing to obey a nonreparation order, which, if enforced by the Attorney General,would also result in a levy upon that State's treasury.IVTwo final arguments raised by the FMC and the UnitedStates remain to be addressed. Each is answered in partby reference to our decision in Seminole Tribe.AThe FMC maintains that sovereign immunity should notbar the Commission from adjudicating Maritime Services'complaint because "[t]he constitutional necessity of uniform-ity in the regulation of maritime commerce limits the States'sovereignty with respect to the Federal Government's au-thority to regulate that commerce." Brief for Petitioner 29.This Court, however, has already held that the States' sover-eign immunity extends to cases concerning maritime commerce. See, e. g., Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490 (1921).Moreover, Seminole Tribe precludes us from creating a new"maritime commerce" exception to state sovereign immunity.Although the Federal Government undoubtedly possesses animportant interest in regulating maritime commerce, seeU. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, we noted inSeminole Tribethat "the background principle of state sovereign immunityembodied in the Eleventh Amendment is not so ephemeralas to dissipate when the subject of the suit is an area . . .that is under the exclusive control of the Federal Govern-ment,"18 517 U. S., at 72. Thus, "[e]ven when the Constitu18 Justice Breyer apparently does not accept this proposition, see post,at 776-778, maintaining that it is not supported by the text of the TenthAmendment. The principle of state sovereign immunity enshrined in ourconstitutional framework, however, is not rooted in the Tenth Amendment.See Part II, supra. Moreover, to the extent that Justice Breyer ar535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN768 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINAPORTS AUTHORITYOpinion of the Courttion vests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over aparticular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against uncon-senting States." Ibid. Of course, the Federal Governmentretains ample means of ensuring that state-run ports complywith the Shipping Act and other valid federal rules governing ocean-borne commerce. The FMC, for example, remainsfree to investigate alleged violations of the Shipping Act,either upon its own initiative or upon information suppliedby a private party, see,e. g., 46 CFR $ 502.282 (2001), and toinstitute its own administrative proceeding against a staterun port, see 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1710(c) (1994 ed.); 46 CFR$ 502.61(a) (2001). Additionally, the Commission "may bringsuit in a district court of the United States to enjoin conductin violation of [the Act]." 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1710(h)(1).19Indeed, the United States has advised us that the Court ofAppeals' ruling below "should have little practical effect onthe FMC's enforcement of the Shipping Act," Brief forUnited States in Opposition 20, and we have no reason tobelieve that our decision to affirm that judgment will lead tothe parade of horribles envisioned by the FMC.BFinally, the United States maintains that even if sovereignimmunity were to bar the FMC from adjudicating a privategues that the Federal Government's Article I power "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States," U. S. Const.,Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, allows it to authorize private parties to sue nonconsentingStates, see post, at 777-778, his quarrel is not with our decision today butwith our decision in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996).See id., at 72.19 For these reasons, private parties remain "perfectly free to complain to the Federal Government about unlawful state activity" and "theFederal Government [remains] free to take subsequent legal action."Post, at 776 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The only step the FMC may nottake, consistent with this Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, is toadjudicate a dispute between a private party and a nonconsenting State.535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN769Cite as: 535 U. S. 743 (2002)Opinion of the Courtparty's complaint against a state-run port for purposes ofissuing a reparation order, the FMC should not be precludedfrom considering a private party's request for other formsof relief, such as a cease-and-desist order. See Brief forUnited States 32-34. As we have previously noted, how-ever, the primary function of sovereign immunity is not toprotect state treasuries, see Part III-C, supra, but to affordthe States the dignity and respect due sovereign enti-ties. As a result, we explained inSeminole Tribe that "therelief sought by a plaintiff suing a State is irrelevant tothe question whether the suit is barred by the EleventhAmendment." 517 U. S., at 58. We see no reason why adifferent principle should apply in the realm of administrative adjudications. * * *While some might complain that our system of dual sover-eignty is not a model of administrative convenience, see,e. g.,post, at 785-786 (Breyer, J., dissenting), that is not its pur-pose. Rather, "[t]he `constitutionally mandated balance ofpower' between the States and the Federal Government wasadopted by the Framers to ensure the protection of `our fundamental liberties.' " Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985) (quoting Garcia v. San AntonioMetropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 572 (1985)(Powell, J., dissenting)). By guarding against encroach-ments by the Federal Government on fundamental aspectsof state sovereignty, such as sovereign immunity, we striveto maintain the balance of power embodied in our Constitution and thus to "reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse fromeither front."Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 458. Although the Framers likely did not envision the intrusion onstate sovereignty at issue in today's case, we are nonethelessconfident that it is contrary to their constitutional design,and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
