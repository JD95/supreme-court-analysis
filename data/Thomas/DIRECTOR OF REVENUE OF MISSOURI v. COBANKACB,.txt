In this case we are asked to decide whether the NationalBank for Cooperatives, which Congress has designated as afederally chartered instrumentality of the United States, isexempt from state income taxation. We hold that it is not.IIn the Farm Credit Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 257, as amended,12 U. S. C. $ 2001et seq., Congress created various lendinginstitutions within the Farm Credit System to meet the specific credit needs of farmers. Among these institutions werebanks for cooperatives, one in each of 12 farm credit districts,and a Central Bank for Cooperatives. These banks weredesigned to make loans to cooperative associations engagedin marketing farm products, purchasing farm supplies, orfurnishing farm services.Today, the Farm Credit System includes banks for cooper-atives, production credit associations, farm credit banks, andfederal land bank associations. $ 2002(a). By statute, eachof these institutions is designated as a "federally charteredinstrumentalit[y] of the United States." $ 2121 (banks forcooperatives and Central Bank for Cooperatives); $ 2141(National Bank for Cooperatives); $$ 2071(a) and (b)(7) (pro-duction credit associations); $ 2011(a) (farm credit banks);$$ 2091(a) and (b)(4) (federal land bank associations). TheFarm Credit Act also addresses the taxation of these institutions. The provision applicable to a bank for cooperatives,the institution at issue in this case, states:"Each bank for cooperatives and its obligations areinstrumentalities of the United States and as such anyand all notes, debentures, and other obligations issuedby such bank shall be exempt, both as to principal andinterest from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inherMichael F.

In March 1996,CoBank filed amended returns on behalf of the NationalBank for Cooperatives, requesting an exemption from allstate income taxes and refunds on the taxes paid--erroneously, it alleged--for 1991 through 1994. Relying on thedoctrine of implied tax immunity that originated inMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), CoBank asserted thatthe Supremacy Clause of the Constitution accords federalinstrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Con-gress has expressly waived this immunity. CoBank arguedthat, because the current version of the Farm Credit Actdoes not expressly waive this immunity, banks for cooperatives are exempt from Missouri's corporate income tax. TheDirector of Revenue of Missouri denied the request.On appeal, the Administrative Hearing Commission upheldthe Director of Revenue's assessment of corporate incometax, because the National Bank for Cooperatives had not established that it was a federal instrumentality statutorilyexempt from state taxation of its income. The commissiondetermined that Congress did not provide expressly that1 CoBank is an "agricultural credit bank," which the Farm CreditAdministration recognizes as having the combined authority of a bankfor cooperatives and a farm credit bank. See 12 CFR $$ 618.8005(c),619.9020 (2000).531US2 Unit: $U19 [04-12-02 19:07:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN320 DIRECTOR OF REVENUE OF MO. v. COBANK ACBOpinion of the Courtbanks for cooperatives, in contrast to farm credit banks andfederal land bank associations, would have immunity fromstate income taxation. The commission reasoned that hadCongress intended to confer upon banks for cooperatives thesame immunity that was provided to farm credit banks andfederal land bank associations, it would have done so expressly. For jurisdictional reasons, the commission did notdecide CoBank's constitutional claim.The Missouri Supreme Court reversed the commission'sdecision and held that banks for cooperatives are exemptfrom state income taxation.2 Production Credit Assn. ofSoutheastern Mo. v. Director of Revenue, 10 S. W. 3d 142,143 (2000). The Missouri Supreme Court held that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution provides federal instru-mentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congresshas expressly waived this immunity. According to the Mis-souri Supreme Court, because the current version of theFarm Credit Act is silent as to such institutions' immunityfrom state taxation, Congress cannot be said to have expressly consented to state income taxation and, thus, theinstitutions are exempt from state income taxes. TheMissouri Supreme Court noted that other courts that hadaddressed the issue of state taxation of member institutionsof the Farm Credit System also had concluded that theStates could not tax such institutions.Id., at 143-144 (citingFarm Credit Servs. of Central Ark., PCA v.

We have held, in addressing state taxation of con-tractors conducting business with the United States, that aninstrumentality is entitled to implied tax immunity onlywhen it is "so closely connected to the Government that thetwo cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities."United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720, 735 (1982). Re-lying on New Mexico, the Director of Revenue argues thatbanks for cooperatives are not "so closely connected" to theUnited States as to be indistinguishable from the UnitedStates, and that banks for cooperatives thus are not entitledto immunity from state taxation. CoBank disagrees withthis characterization and asks us to conclude that banks forcooperatives are indeed virtual arms of the United States,worthy of implied tax immunity under McCulloch.We need not, however, reach this implied immunity question. Implied immunity becomes an issue only when Con-gress has failed to indicate whether an instrumentality is3 See also Farm Credit Act of 1933, $ 63, 48 Stat. 267.531US2 Unit: $U19 [04-12-02 19:07:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN322 DIRECTOR OF REVENUE OF MO. v. COBANK ACBOpinion of the Courtsubject to state taxation. In this case, Congress has pro-vided that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation. To be sure, Congress did not include an express state-ment in the current version of $ 2134. However, nothingin the statute indicates a repeal of the previous expressapproval of state taxation, and the structure of the FarmCredit Act indicates by negative implication that banks forcooperatives are not entitled to immunity.AUpon their creation in 1933, banks for cooperatives weresubject to state income taxation except during periods whenthe United States held stock in the banks. Farm Credit Actof 1933, $ 63, 48 Stat. 267 ("Such banks, . . . and their income,shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposedby the United States or by any State, Territorial, or localtaxing authority . . . . The exemption provided herein shallnot apply . . . with respect to . . . any . . . Bank for Cooperatives, or its property or income after the stock held in it bythe United States has been retired"). Under this statute, assoon as governmental investment in a bank for cooperativeswas repaid (as it was for all such banks by 1968), the bankhad to pay state income taxes because the exemption fromsuch taxation no longer applied.When Congress amended the Farm Credit Act in 1971, itdid not change the rule that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation unless the United States holds stock inthe banks. Farm Credit Act of 1971, $ 3.13, 85 Stat. 608.Although all banks for cooperatives were at the time pri-vately owned, Congress provided that the Governor of theFarm Credit Administration had the authority on behalf ofthe United States to purchase stock in banks for cooperatives"as a temporary investment in the stock of the institution tohelp one or several of the banks . . . to meet emergency creditneeds of borrowers." $ 4.0, 85 Stat. 609. The 1971 versionof $ 2134 therefore provided, in relevant part:531US2 Unit: $U19 [04-12-02 19:07:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN323Cite as: 531 U. S. 316 (2001)Opinion of the Court"Such banks . . . and their income shall be exempt fromall taxation now or hereafter imposed by the UnitedStates or by any State, territorial, or local taxingauthority . . . . The exemption provided in the preceding sentence shall apply only for any year or part thereofin which stock in the bank for cooperatives is held bythe Governor of the Farm Credit Administration."$ 3.13, 85 Stat. 608-609.In 1985, Congress enacted various amendments to the Act.Among other things, these amendments eliminated the position of Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, discontinued the Farm Credit Administration's authority to ownstock in banks for cooperatives, and included numerous"Technical and Conforming Amendments." Farm CreditAmendments Act of 1985, $ 201, 99 Stat. 1688; $ 101, 99 Stat.1678; $ 205, 99 Stat. 1703-1707. One of these technical andconforming amendments was the deletion of the two sentences within $ 2134 that, first, exempted a bank for cooperatives from state taxation and, second, limited that exemptionto periods when the Governor held stock in the bank.$ 205(e)(10), 99 Stat. 1705, as amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 2134.CoBank argues that the deletion of these two sentencesaltered the States' ability to tax the income of banks forcooperatives. According to CoBank, because the deletioneliminated the express statutory authorization for such taxation, Congress intended banks for cooperatives to be immunefrom state taxation under McCulloch's implied immunitydoctrine. We do not share CoBank's interpretation as to theeffect of this amendment, because there is no indication thatCongress intended to change the taxation of banks for cooperatives with the 1985 amendments. Since 1933, the Statescould collect revenue from banks for cooperatives. Nothingin the 1985 amendments expressly changes this. And, itwould be surprising, indeed, if Congress had eliminated thisimportant fact sub silentio.531US2 Unit: $U19 [04-12-02 19:07:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN324 DIRECTOR OF REVENUE OF MO. v. COBANK ACBOpinion of the CourtCoBank's interpretation would mean that Congress madea radical--but entirely implicit--change in the taxation ofbanks for cooperatives with the 1985 amendment to $ 2134.The amendment to $ 2134 was merely one of numerous "technical and conforming amendments" to the Farm Credit Act.Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985, $ 205, 99 Stat. 1703-1707 (section entitled "Technical and Conforming Amend-ments"). In fact, the deletion of the sentence within $ 2134referring to the Governor was one of more than 30 deletionsof references to the Governor, a position eliminated by the1985 amendments to the Act. Ibid. The more logical inter-pretation of this amendment to $ 2134 is that Congressmerely deleted language that had become superfluous oncethe United States no longer owned, and no longer could own,stock in banks for cooperatives. This explanation accordswith the more than 50-year history of the Farm Credit Act,permitting the States to tax banks for cooperatives exceptwhen there was governmental investment in the banks.Had Congress simply deleted the final sentence of $ 2134 thatlimited the exemption while retaining the sentence grantingthe exemption, we would have no trouble concluding thatCongress had eliminated the States' ability to tax banks forcooperatives. Short of this act, however, we find Congress'silence insufficient to disrupt the 50-year history of state taxation of banks for cooperatives.BIn addition, the structure of the Farm Credit Act confirmsthat banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation.With respect to each lending institution in the Farm CreditSystem, the Act contains a taxation provision that specifically delineates the immunity from taxation enjoyed by thatentity. For example, farm credit banks and federal landbank associations receive the type of immunity from statetaxation that the Missouri Supreme Court held to be impliedhere for banks for cooperatives. See 12 U. S. C. $ 2023 ("The531US2 Unit: $U19 [04-12-02 19:07:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN325Cite as: 531 U. S. 316 (2001)Opinion of the CourtFarm Credit Banks and the capital, reserves, and surplusthereof, and the income derived therefrom, shall be exemptfrom Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation . . .");$ 2098 ("Each Federal land bank association and the capital,reserves, and surplus thereof, and the income derived there-from, shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, andlocal taxation . . .").By contrast, since their creation in 1933, banks for cooperatives have been granted only limited exemptions from taxa-tion. Had Congress intended to confer upon banks for cooperatives the more comprehensive exemption from taxationthat it had provided to farm credit banks and federal landbank associations, it would have done so expressly as it haddone elsewhere in the Farm Credit Act. Thus, in light ofthe structure of the Farm Credit Act--and the explicit grantof immunity to other institutions within the Farm CreditSystem--Congress' silence with respect to banks for cooper-atives indicates that banks for cooperatives are subject tostate taxation. * * *The judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN326 OCTOBER TERM, 2000SyllabusILLINOIS v. McARTHURcertiorari to the appellate court of illinois,fourth districtNo. 99-1132. Argued November 1, 2000--Decided February 20, 2001Police officers, with probable cause to believe that respondent McArthurhad hidden marijuana in his home, prevented him from entering thehome unaccompanied by an officer for about two hours while theyobtained a search warrant. Once they did so, the officers found drugparaphernalia and marijuana, and arrested McArthur. He was subsequently charged with misdemeanor possession of those items. Hemoved to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was the "fruit"of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter hishome unaccompanied. The Illinois trial court granted the motion, andthe State Appellate Court affirmed.Held: Given the nature of the intrusion and the law enforcement interestat stake, the brief seizure of the premises was permissible under theFourth Amendment. Pp. 330-337.(a) The Amendment's central requirement is one of reasonableness.Although, in the ordinary case, personal property seizures are unreasonable unless accomplished pursuant to a warrant, United States v. Place,462 U. S. 696, 701, there are exceptions to this rule involving speciallaw enforcement needs, diminished expectations of privacy, minimalintrusions, and the like, see, e. g., Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S.938, 940-941. The circumstances here involve a plausible claim of specially pressing or urgent law enforcement need. Cf., e. g., United Statesv. Place, supra, at 701. Moreover, the restraint at issue was tailoredto that need, being limited in time and scope, cf. Terry v. Ohio, 392U. S. 1, 29-30, and avoiding significant intrusion into the home itself,cf. Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 585. Consequently, rather thanemploying a per se rule of unreasonableness, the Court must balancethe privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to determineif the intrusion here was reasonable. Cf. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.648, 654. In light of the following circumstances, considered in combination, the Court concludes that the restriction was reasonable, andhence lawful. First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur's home contained evidence of a crime and unlawful drugs. Second, they had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, he would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant. Third, they531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN327Cite as: 531 U. S. 326 (2001)Syllabusmade reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs withthe demands of personal privacy by avoiding a warrantless entry orarrest and preventing McArthur only from entering his home unaccompanied. Fourth, they imposed the restraint for a limited period, whichwas no longer than reasonably necessary for them, acting with diligence,to obtain the warrant. Pp. 330-333.(b) The conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significantsupport in this Court's case law. See, e. g., Segura v. United States,468 U. S. 796; United States v. Place, supra, at 706. And in no casehas this Court held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supportedby probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidencewhile the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period.But cf. Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 754. Pp. 333-334.(c) The Court is not persuaded by the countervailing considerationsraised by the parties or lower courts: that the police proceeded withoutprobable cause; that, because McArthur was on his porch, the policeorder that he stay outside his home amounted to an impermissible"constructive eviction"; that an officer, with McArthur's consent,stepped inside the home's doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the home on two or three occasions; and that Welshv. Wisconsin, supra, at 742, 754, offers direct support for McArthur'sposition. Pp. 334-336.304 Ill. App. 3d 395, 713 N.

The officers remained outside.When Tera emerged after collecting her possessions, shespoke to Chief Love, who was then on the porch. She suggested he check the trailer because "Chuck had dope inthere." App. 15. She added (in Love's words) that she hadseen Chuck "slid[e] some dope underneath the couch." Id.,at 19.Love knocked on the trailer door, told Charles what Terahad said, and asked for permission to search the trailer,which Charles denied. Love then sent Officer Skidis withTera to get a search warrant.Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch,that he could not reenter the trailer unless a police officeraccompanied him. Charles subsequently reentered thetrailer two or three times (to get cigarettes and to makephone calls), and each time Love stood just inside the doorto observe what Charles did.Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m.He returned to the trailer and, along with other officers,searched it. The officers found under the sofa a marijuanapipe, a box for marijuana (called a "one-hitter" box), and asmall amount of marijuana. They then arrested Charles.BIllinois subsequently charged Charles McArthur with un-lawfully possessing drug paraphernalia and marijuana (lessthan 2.5 grams), both misdemeanors. See Ill. Comp.

McARTHUROpinion of the Court395, 713 N. E. 2d 93 (1999), and the Illinois Supreme Courtdenied the State's petition for leave to appeal, 185 Ill. 2d651, 720 N. E. 2d 1101 (1999). We granted certiorari to de-termine whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits the kindof temporary seizure at issue here.IIAThe Fourth Amendment says that the "right of the peopleto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be vio-lated." U. S. Const., Amdt. 4. Its "central requirement" isone of reasonableness. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730,739 (1983). In order to enforce that requirement, this Courthas interpreted the Amendment as establishing rules andpresumptions designed to control conduct of law enforcementofficers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests.Sometimes those rules require warrants. We have said, forexample, that in "the ordinary case," seizures of personalproperty are "unreasonable within the meaning of theFourth Amendment," without more, "unless . . . accom-plished pursuant to a judicial warrant," issued by a neutralmagistrate after finding probable cause. United States v.Place, 462 U. S. 696, 701 (1983).We nonetheless have made it clear that there are exceptions to the warrant requirement. When faced with speciallaw enforcement needs, diminished expectations of privacy,minimal intrusions, or the like, the Court has found thatcertain general, or individual, circumstances may render awarrantless search or seizure reasonable. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938, 940-941 (1996) (per cu-riam) (search of automobile supported by probable cause);Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444, 455(1990) (suspicionless stops at drunk driver checkpoint);United States v. Place, supra, at 706 (temporary seizureof luggage based on reasonable suspicion);Michigan v.531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN331Cite as: 531 U. S. 326 (2001)Opinion of the CourtSummers, 452 U. S. 692, 702-705 (1981) (temporary detentionof suspect without arrest warrant to prevent flight and protect officers while executing search warrant); Terry v. Ohio,392 U. S. 1, 27 (1968) (temporary stop and limited search forweapons based on reasonable suspicion).In the circumstances of the case before us, we cannot saythat the warrantless seizure was per se unreasonable. It involves a plausible claim of specially pressing or urgent lawenforcement need,i. e., "exigent circumstances." Cf., e. g.,United States v. Place, supra, at 701 ("[T]he exigencies ofthe circumstances" may permit temporary seizure withoutwarrant); Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S.294, 298-299 (1967) (warrantless search for suspect andweapons reasonable where delay posed grave danger);Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770-771 (1966)(warrantless blood test for alcohol reasonable where delaywould have led to loss of evidence). Moreover, the restraintat issue was tailored to that need, being limited in time andscope, cf. Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 29-30, and avoiding significant intrusion into the home itself, cf. Payton v. NewYork, 445 U. S. 573, 585 (1980) (" `[T]he chief evil againstwhich the . . . Fourth Amendment is directed' " is warrantlessentry and search of home) (quoting United States v. UnitedStates Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297,313 (1972)). Consequently, rather than employing a per serule of unreasonableness, we balance the privacy-relatedand law enforcement-related concerns to determine if theintrusion was reasonable. Cf. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.648, 654 (1979) (determining lawfulness by balancing privacyand law enforcement interests); United States v. BrignoniPonce, 422 U. S. 873, 878 (1975) (same).We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable,and hence lawful, in light of the following circumstances,which we consider in combination. First, the police hadprobable cause to believe that McArthur's trailer home contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN332 ILLINOIS v. McARTHUROpinion of the Courtdrugs. The police had had an opportunity to speak withTera McArthur and make at least a very rough assessmentof her reliability. They knew she had had a firsthand opportunity to observe her husband's behavior, in particularwith respect to the drugs at issue. And they thought, withgood reason, that her report to them reflected that opportunity. Cf. Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U. S. 727, 732-734(1984) (per curiam) (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur would destroy the drugs before theycould return with a warrant. They reasonably might havethought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about hismarijuana stash; observed that she was angry or frightenedenough to ask the police to accompany her; saw that afterleaving the trailer she had spoken with the police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the other outside to observe the trailer. They reasonably could have concluded that McArthur, consequentlysuspecting an imminent search, would, if given the chance,get rid of the drugs fast.Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile theirlaw enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy.They neither searched the trailer nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant. Rather, they imposed a significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur onlyfrom entering the trailer unaccompanied. They left hishome and his belongings intact--until a neutral Magistrate,finding probable cause, issued a warrant.Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time, namely, two hours. Cf. Terry v. Ohio, supra,at 28 (manner in which police act is "vital . . . part of . . .inquiry"). As far as the record reveals, this time period wasno longer than reasonably necessary for the police, actingwith diligence, to obtain the warrant.

S. 249, 253 (1970)(holding 29-hour detention of mailed package reasonablegiven unavoidable delay in obtaining warrant and minimalnature of intrusion). Given the nature of the intrusion andthe law enforcement interest at stake, this brief seizure ofthe premises was permissible.BOur conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds sig-nificant support in this Court's case law. InSegura v.United States, 468 U. S. 796 (1984), the Court consideredthe admissibility of drugs which the police had found in alawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but onlyafter unlawfully entering the apartment and occupying itfor 19 hours. The majority held that the drugs were ad-missible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout,they could have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant tothe validly issued warrant. See id., at 799, 814-815 (citingSilverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385(1920)). The minority disagreed. However, when describing alternative lawful search and seizure methods, bothmajority and minority assumed, at least for argument'ssake, that the police, armed with reliable information thatthe apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealedthe apartment from the outside, restricting entry into theapartment while waiting for the warrant. CompareSegurav. United States, 468 U. S., at 814 ("Had police never enteredthe apartment, but instead conducted a perimeter stakeoutto prevent anyone from entering . . . and destroying evidence, the contraband . . . would have been . . . seized pre-cisely as it was here"), withid., at 824, n. 15 (Stevens, J.,dissenting) ("I assume impoundment would be permissible531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN334 ILLINOIS v. McARTHUROpinion of the Courteven absent exigent circumstances when it occurs `from theoutside'--when the authorities merely seal off premisespending the issuance of a warrant but do not enter"); seealso Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978) (exigentcircumstances do not justify search where police guard atdoor could prevent loss of evidence); United States v. Jeffers,342 U. S. 48, 52 (1951) (same).In various other circumstances, this Court has upheldtemporary restraints where needed to preserve evidenceuntil police could obtain a warrant. See,e. g., United Statesv. Place, supra, at 706 (reasonable suspicion justifies briefdetention of luggage pending further investigation); UnitedStates v. Van Leeuwen, supra, at 253 (reasonable suspicionjustifies detaining package delivered for mailing). Cf. Rich-ards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 395 (1997) (no need to"knock and announce" when executing a search warrantwhere officers reasonably suspect that evidence might bedestroyed); Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153(1925) (warrantless search of automobile constitutionallypermissible).We have found no case in which this Court has held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probablecause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence whilethe police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonableperiod of time. But cf.Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740,754 (1984) (holding warrantless entry into and arrest in homeunreasonable despite possibility that evidence of noncriminaloffense would be lost while warrant was being obtained).CNor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerationsthat the parties or lower courts have raised. McArthurargues that the police proceeded without probable cause.But McArthur has waived this argument. See 304 Ill.App. 3d, at 397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN335Cite as: 531 U. S. 326 (2001)Opinion of the Courtdoes not contest existence of probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause). And, in any event,it is without merit. See supra, at 331-332.The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the policecould not order McArthur to stay outside his home becauseMcArthur's porch, where he stood at the time, was partof his home; hence the order "amounted to a constructiveeviction" of McArthur from his residence. 304 Ill. App. 3d,at 402, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98. This Court has held, however,that a person standing in the doorway of a house is "in a`public' place," and hence subject to arrest without a warrantpermitting entry of the home. United States v. Santana,427 U. S. 38, 42 (1976). Regardless, we do not believe thedifference to which the Appellate Court points--porch versus, e. g., front walk--could make a significant differencehere as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; andthat, from the Fourth Amendment's perspective, is whatmatters.The Appellate Court also found negatively significant thefact that Chief Love, with McArthur's consent, stepped inside the trailer's doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions. 304Ill. App. 3d, at 402-403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98. McArthur, however, reentered simply for his own convenience, to makephone calls and to obtain cigarettes. Under these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser(permitting reentry conditioned on observation).Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it isthe only case) that he believes offers direct support, namely,Welsh v. Wisconsin, supra. In Welsh, this Court held thatpolice could not enter a home without a warrant in order toprevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant's bloodalcohol level) of the "nonjailable traffic offense" of drivingwhile intoxicated. 466 U. S., at 742, 754. McArthur notes531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN336 ILLINOIS v. McARTHUROpinion of the Courtthat his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which, hesays, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keepinghim out of his home, was nearly as serious.We nonetheless find significant distinctions. The evidenceat issue here was of crimes that were "jailable," not "non-jailable." See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, $ 550/4(a) (1998);ch. 730, $ 5/5-8-3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams ofmarijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, $ 600/3.5; ch. 730, $ 5/5-8-3(1) (possession of drug paraphernaliapunishable by up to one year in jail). In Welsh, we notedthat, "[g]iven that the classification of state crimes differswidely among the States, the penalty that may attach to anyparticular offense seems to provide the clearest and mostconsistent indication of the State's interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense." 466 U. S.,at 754, n. 14. The same reasoning applies here, whereclass C misdemeanors include such widely diverse offensesas drag racing, drinking alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for public office, andassault. See, e. g., Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, $ 5/4-8-2 (1998);ch. 610, $ 90/1; ch. 625, $ 5/11-504; ch. 720, $ 5/12-1.And the restriction at issue here is less serious. Temporarily keeping a person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the homeitself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct asearch. Cf. Payton v. New York, 445 U. S., at 585 (theFourth Amendment's central concern is the warrantlessentry and search of the home).We have explained above why we believe that the needto preserve evidence of a "jailable" offense was sufficientlyurgent or pressing to justify the restriction upon entry thatthe police imposed. We need not decide whether the circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type of offense or the same restriction wereonly a "nonjailable" offense at issue.531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN337Cite as: 531 U. S. 326 (2001)Souter, J., concurringIIIIn sum, the police officers in this case had probable causeto believe that a home contained contraband, which wasevidence of a crime. They reasonably believed that thehome's resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroythat evidence. And they imposed a restraint that was bothlimited and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcementneeds while protecting privacy interests. In our view, therestraint met the Fourth Amendment's demands.The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Souter, concurring.I join the Court's opinion subject to this afterword ontwo points: the constitutionality of a greater intrusion thanthe one here and the permissibility of choosing impoundmentover immediate search. Respondent McArthur's locationmade the difference between the exigency that justifiedtemporarily barring him from his own dwelling and circumstances that would have supported a greater inter-ference with his privacy and property. As long as he wasinside his trailer, the police had probable cause to believethat he had illegal drugs stashed as his wife had reportedand that with any sense he would flush them down the drainbefore the police could get a warrant to enter and search.This probability of destruction in anticipation of a warrantexemplifies the kind of present risk that undergirds theaccepted exigent circumstances exception to the generalwarrant requirement.Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S.757, 770-771 (1966). That risk would have justified thepolice in entering McArthur's trailer promptly to make alawful, warrantless search. United States v. Santana, 427U. S. 38, 42-43 (1976); Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden,387 U. S. 294, 298-299 (1967). When McArthur stepped531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN338 ILLINOIS v. McARTHURStevens, J., dissentingoutside and left the trailer uninhabited, the risk abated andso did the reasonableness of entry by the police for as longas he was outside. This is so because the only justificationclaimed for warrantless action here is the immediate risk,and the limit of reasonable response by the police is set bythe scope of the risk. SeeTerry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 25-26(1968).Since, however, McArthur wished to go back in, why wasit reasonable to keep him out when the police could perfectlywell have let him do as he chose, and then enjoyed the en-suing opportunity to follow him and make a warrantlesssearch justified by the renewed danger of destruction? Theanswer is not that the law officiously insists on safeguardinga suspect's privacy from search, in preference to respectingthe suspect's liberty to enter his own dwelling. Instead, thelegitimacy of the decision to impound the dwelling followsfrom the law's strong preference for warrants, which underlies the rule that a search with a warrant has a strongerclaim to justification on later, judicial review than a searchwithout one. See United States v. Ventresca, 380 U. S. 102,106 (1965); see also 5 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure$ 11.2(b), p. 38 (3d ed. 1996) ("[M]ost states follow the rulewhich is utilized in the federal courts: if the search or seizurewas pursuant to a warrant, the defendant has the burden ofproof; but if the police acted without a warrant the burdenof proof is on the prosecution"). The law can hardly raiseincentives to obtain a warrant without giving the police afair chance to take their probable cause to a magistrate andget one.Justice Stevens, dissenting.The Illinois General Assembly has decided that the possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana is a class C misdemeanor. See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, $ 550/4(a) (1998).In so classifying the offense, the legislature made a concertedpolicy judgment that the possession of small amounts of531US2 Unit: $U20 [04-12-02 19:07:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN339Cite as: 531 U. S. 326 (2001)Stevens, J., dissentingmarijuana for personal use does not constitute a particularlysignificant public policy concern. While it is true that thisoffense--like feeding livestock on a public highway or offer-ing a movie for rent without clearly displaying its rating1--may warrant a jail sentence of up to 30 days, the detectionand prosecution of possessors of small quantities of thissubstance is by no means a law enforcement priority in theState of Illinois.2Because the governmental interest implicated by the par-ticular criminal prohibition at issue in this case is so slight,this is a poor vehicle for probing the boundaries of the gov-ernment's power to limit an individual's possessory interestin his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant.Cf.Segura v. United States, 468 U. S. 796 (1984) (seven Jus-tices decline to address this issue because case does not require its resolution). Given my preference, I would, there-fore, dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.Compelled by the vote of my colleagues to reach the mer-its, I would affirm. As the majority explains, the essentialinquiry in this case involves a balancing of the "privacy1 See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 605, $ 5/9-124.1 (1998) (making feeding livestock on a public highway a class C misdemeanor); ch. 720, $$ 395/3-395/4(making it a class C misdemeanor to sell or rent a video that does notdisplay the official rating of the motion picture from which it is copied).Other examples of offenses classified as class C misdemeanors in Illinoisinclude camping on the side of a public highway, ch. 605, $ 5/9-124, interfering with the "lawful taking of wild animals," ch. 720, $ 125/2, and tattooingthe body of a person under 21 years of age, ch. 720, $ 5/12-10.2 Nor in many other States. Under the laws of many other States, themaximum penalty McArthur would have faced for possession of 2.3 gramsof marijuana would have been less than what he faced in Illinois. See,e. g., Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 11357(b) (West 1991) ($100 fine);Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-18-406(1) (1999) ($100 fine); Minn. Stat. $ 152.027(4)(2000) ($200 fine and drug education); Miss.

McARTHURStevens, J., dissentingrelated and law enforcement-related concerns to determineif the intrusion was reasonable." Ante, at 331. Under thespecific facts of this case, I believe the majority gets thebalance wrong. Each of the Illinois jurists who participatedin the decision of this case placed a higher value on thesanctity of the ordinary citizen's home than on the prosecution of this petty offense. They correctly viewed thatinterest--whether the home be a humble cottage, a secondhand trailer, or a stately mansion--as one meriting the mostserious constitutional protection.3 Following their analysisand the reasoning in our decision in Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466U. S. 740 (1984) (holding that some offenses may be so minoras to make it unreasonable for police to undertake searchesthat would be constitutionally permissible if graver offenseswere suspected), I would affirm.3 Principled respect for the sanctity of the home has long animatedthis Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. See, e. g., Wilson v.Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 610 (1999) ("The Fourth Amendment embodies thiscenturies-old principle of respect for the privacy of the home"); Payton v.New York, 445 U. S. 573, 601 (1980) (emphasizing "the overriding respectfor the sanctity of the home that has been embedded in our traditionssince the origins of the Republic"); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 393(1978) ("[T]he Fourth Amendment reflects the view of those who wrotethe Bill of Rights that the privacy of a person's home and property maynot be totally sacrificed in the name of maximum simplicity in enforcementof the criminal law").531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN341OCTOBER TERM, 2000SyllabusBUCKMAN CO. v. PLAINTIFFS' LEGAL COMMITTEEcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuitNo. 98-1768. Argued December 4, 2000--Decided February 21, 2001Respondent represents plaintiffs claiming injuries caused by the use oforthopedic bone screws in the pedicles of their spines. Petitioner assisted the screws' manufacturer in securing approval for the devicesfrom the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Administration), whichhas regulatory authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (FDCA), as amended by the Medical Devices Amendments of 1976(MDA). While the screws are in a class that normally must go througha time-consuming process to receive premarket approval (PMA), theywere approved under an exception, known as the $ 510(k) process, forpredicate devices--devices that were already on the market when theMDA was enacted--and for devices that are "substantially equivalent"to predicate devices. The $ 510(k) application filed by petitioner andthe manufacturer sought clearance to market the screws for use in armand leg bones, not the spine. Claiming that the FDA would not haveapproved the screws had petitioner not made fraudulent representationsregarding their intended use, plaintiffs sought damages under state tortlaw. The District Court dismissed these fraud-on-the-FDA claims on,inter alia, the ground that they were pre-empted by the MDA. TheThird Circuit reversed.Held: The plaintiffs' state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims conflict with, andare therefore impliedly pre-empted by, the FDCA, as amended by theMDA. Pp. 347-353.(a) The relationship between a federal agency and the entity it regulates is inherently federal because it originates from, is governed by,and terminates according to federal law. Because petitioner's FDAdealings were prompted by the MDA and the very subject matter ofpetitioner's statements were dictated by that statute--and in contrastto situations implicating "federalism concerns and the historic primacyof state regulation of [health and safety matters]," Medtronic, Inc. v.Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485--no presumption against pre-emption obtainsin this case. The conflict here stems from the fact that the federalstatutory scheme amply empowers the FDA to punish and deter fraudagainst the Administration, and the Administration uses this authorityto achieve a delicate balance of statutory objectives that can be skewedby allowing state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims. While the $ 510(k)531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN342 BUCKMAN CO. v. PLAINTIFFS' LEGAL COMM.Syllabusprocess lacks the PMA review's rigor, the former does set forth a comprehensive scheme for determining substantial equivalence with a predicate device. Other provisions give the FDA enforcement options thatallow it to make a measured response to suspected fraud upon the Administration. This flexibility is a critical component of the frameworkunder which the FDA pursues its difficult (and often competing) objectives of regulating medical device marketing and distribution withoutintruding upon decisions committed by the FDCA to health care professionals. Pp. 347-350.(b) State-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims inevitably conflict with theFDA's responsibility to police fraud consistently with the Administration's judgment and objectives. Complying with the FDA's detailedregulatory regime in the shadow of 50 States' tort regimes will dramatically increase the burdens facing potential applicants, who might be deterred from seeking approval of devices with potentially beneficial offlabel uses--an accepted medical practice in which a device is used forsome other purpose than that for which the FDA approved it--for fearof being exposed to unpredictable civil liability. Conversely, applicants'fear that their disclosures to the FDA will later be judged insufficientin state court might lead them to submit information that the Administration neither needs nor wants, thus delaying the comparatively speedy$ 510(k) process, and, in turn, impeding competition and delaying theprescription of appropriate off-label uses. Respondent's reliance onSilkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, is misplaced. Silkwoodwas based on traditional state tort law principles, not on a fraud-on-theagency theory, and, unlike Silkwood, there is clear evidence here thatCongress intended that the MDA be enforced exclusively by the FederalGovernment. In addition, the MDA's express pre-emption provisiondoes not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles.Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869. And althoughMedtronic can be read to allow certain state-law causes of actionsthat parallel federal safety requirements, it does not stand for theproposition that any FDCA violation will support a state-law claim.Pp. 350-353.159 F. 3d 817, reversed.Rehnquist, C.

S. C. $ 301 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).IRegulation of medical devices is governed by the two Actsjust named. The MDA separates devices into three categories: Class I devices are those that present no unreasonablerisk of illness or injury and therefore require only generalmanufacturing controls; Class II devices are those possessinga greater potential dangerousness and thus warranting morestringent controls; Class III devices "presen[t] a potentialunreasonable risk of illness or injury" and therefore incurthe FDA's strictest regulation. $ 360c(a)(1)(C)(ii)(II). It isnot disputed that the bone screws manufactured by AcroMedare Class III devices.Class III devices must complete a thorough review processwith the FDA before they may be marketed.

The MDAallows these "predicate" devices to remain available until theFDA initiates and completes the PMA process. In orderto avoid the potentially monopolistic consequences of thispredicate-device exception, the MDA allows other manufacturers to distribute (also pending completion of the predicatedevice's PMA review) devices that are shown to be "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device. $ 360e(b)(1)(B).Demonstrating that a device qualifies for this exceptionis known as the "$ 510(k) process," which refers to the section of the original MDA containing this provision.

AcroMed and Buckman claimedthat the two components were substantially equivalentto predicate devices used in long bone surgery. TheFDA approved the devices for this purpose in February1986." Ibid.Pursuant to its designation by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation as the transferee court for In re: Orthopedic Bone Screw Liability Litigation, MDL No. 1014, theDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania hasbeen the recipient of some 2,300 civil actions related to thesemedical devices. Many of these actions include state-law531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN347Cite as: 531 U. S. 341 (2001)Opinion of the Courtcauses of action claiming that petitioner and AcroMed madefraudulent representations to the FDA as to the intendeduse of the bone screws and that, as a result, the devices wereimproperly given market clearance and were subsequentlyused to the plaintiffs' detriment. The District Court dis-missed these "fraud-on-the-FDA" claims, first on the groundthat they were expressly pre-empted by the MDA, and then,after our decision inMedtronic, on the ground that theseclaims amounted to an improper assertion of a private rightof action under the MDA.1 See 159 F. 3d, at 821.A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Third Circuit reversed, concluding that plaintiffs' fraudclaims were neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empted.We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1273 (2000), to resolve a splitamong the Courts of Appeals on this question, see Kemp v.Medtronic, Inc., 231 F. 3d 216, 233-236 (CA6 2000) (identify-ing split and holding such claims expressly pre-empted), andwe now reverse. IIPolicing fraud against federal agencies is hardly "a fieldwhich the States have traditionally occupied," Rice v. SantaFe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947), such as to war-rant a presumption against finding federal pre-emption of astate-law cause of action. To the contrary, the relationshipbetween a federal agency and the entity it regulates is inherently federal in character because the relationship originatesfrom, is governed by, and terminates according to federallaw. Cf. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500,504-505 (1988) (allowing pre-emption of state law by federalcommon law where the interests at stake are "uniquely fed-eral" in nature). Here, petitioner's dealings with the FDAwere prompted by the MDA, and the very subject matter1 The District Court also determined that the plaintiffs' fraud claimsfailed for lack of proximate cause, see In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation, 159 F. 3d 817, 821 (CA3 1998), but that questionis not presently before us.531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN348 BUCKMAN CO. v. PLAINTIFFS' LEGAL COMM.Opinion of the Courtof petitioner's statements were dictated by that statute'sprovisions. Accordingly--and in contrast to situations implicating "federalism concerns and the historic primacy ofstate regulation of matters of health and safety," Medtronic,518 U. S., at 485--no presumption against pre-emption ob-tains in this case.Given this analytical framework, we hold that the plain-tiffs' state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims conflict with, andare therefore impliedly pre-empted by, federal law.2 Theconflict stems from the fact that the federal statutory schemeamply empowers the FDA to punish and deter fraud againstthe Administration, and that this authority is used by theAdministration to achieve a somewhat delicate balance ofstatutory objectives. The balance sought by the Administration can be skewed by allowing fraud-on-the-FDA claimsunder state tort law.As described in greater detail above, the $ 510(k) processsets forth a comprehensive scheme for determining whetheran applicant has demonstrated that a product is substantiallyequivalent to a predicate device. Among other information,the applicant must submit to the FDA "[p]roposed labels,labeling, and advertisements sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the directions for its use," 21 CFR$ 807.87(e) (2000), and a statement attesting to and explainingthe similarities to and/or differences from similar devices(along with supporting data), see $ 807.87(f). The FDA isalso empowered to require additional necessary information.See $ 807.87(l). Admittedly, the $ 510(k) process lacks thePMA review's rigor: The former requires only a showingof substantial equivalence to a predicate device, while thelatter involves a time-consuming inquiry into the risks andefficacy of each device. Nevertheless, to achieve its limitedpurpose, the $ 510(k) process imposes upon applicants a vari-ety of requirements that are designed to enable the FDA to2 In light of this conclusion, we express no view on whether these claimsare subject to express pre-emption under 21 U. S. C. $ 360k.531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN349Cite as: 531 U. S. 341 (2001)Opinion of the Courtmake its statutorily required judgment as to whether thedevice qualifies under this exception.Accompanying these disclosure requirements are variousprovisions aimed at detecting, deterring, and punishing falsestatements made during this and related approval processes.The FDA is empowered to investigate suspected fraud, see21 U. S. C. $ 372; 21 CFR $ 5.35 (2000), and citizens may report wrongdoing and petition the agency to take action,$ 10.30. In addition to the general criminal proscription onmaking false statements to the Federal Government, 18U. S. C. $ 1001 (1994 ed., Supp. V),3 the FDA may respondto fraud by seeking injunctive relief, 21 U. S. C. $ 332, andcivil penalties, 21 U. S. C. $ 333(f)(1)(A); seizing the device,$ 334(a)(2)(D); and pursuing criminal prosecutions, $ 333(a).The FDA 4 thus has at its disposal a variety of enforcementoptions that allow it to make a measured response to suspected fraud upon the Administration.This flexibility is a critical component of the statutory andregulatory framework under which the FDA pursues difficult (and often competing) objectives. For example, withrespect to Class III devices, the FDA simultaneously maintains the exhaustive PMA and the more limited $ 510(k)processes in order to ensure both that medical devices are3 Title 18 U. S. C. $ 1001(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: "[W]hoever, inany matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicialbranch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfullyfalsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a materialfact; [or] makes any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statementor representation; or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than5 years, or both."4 The FDCA leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Government ratherthan private litigants who are authorized to file suit for noncompliancewith the medical device provisions: "[A]ll such proceedings for the enforcement, or to restrain violations, of this chapter shall be by and in the nameof the United States." 21 U. S. C. $ 337(a).531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN350 BUCKMAN CO. v. PLAINTIFFS' LEGAL COMM.Opinion of the Courtreasonably safe and effective and that, if the device qualifiesunder the $ 510(k) exception, it is on the market within arelatively short period of time. Similarly, "off-label" usageof medical devices (use of a device for some other purposethan that for which it has been approved by the FDA) isan accepted and necessary corollary of the FDA's mission toregulate in this area without directly interfering with thepractice of medicine. See, e. g., Beck & Azari, FDA, Off-Label Use, and Informed Consent: Debunking Myths andMisconceptions, 53 Food & Drug L. J. 71, 76-77 (1998) (notingthat courts, several States, and the "FDA itself recogniz[e]the value and propriety of off-label use"). Indeed, a recentamendment to the FDCA expressly states in part that"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or interfere with the authority of a health care practitioner to prescribe or administer any legally marketed device to a patientfor any condition or disease within a legitimate health carepractitioner-patient relationship." 21 U. S. C. $ 396 (1994ed., Supp. V). Thus, the FDA is charged with the difficulttask of regulating the marketing and distribution of medicaldevices without intruding upon decisions statutorily committed to the discretion of health care professionals.State-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims inevitably conflict withthe FDA's responsibility to police fraud consistently with theAdministration's judgment and objectives. As a practicalmatter, complying with the FDA's detailed regulatory regime in the shadow of 50 States' tort regimes will dramatically increase the burdens facing potential applicants--burdens not contemplated by Congress in enacting the FDCAand the MDA. Would-be applicants may be discouragedfrom seeking $ 510(k) approval of devices with potentiallybeneficial off-label uses for fear that such use might exposethe manufacturer or its associates (such as petitioner) to unpredictable civil liability. In effect, then, fraud-on-the-FDAclaims could cause the Administration's reporting requirements to deter off-label use despite the fact that the FDCA531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN351Cite as: 531 U. S. 341 (2001)Opinion of the Courtexpressly disclaims any intent to directly regulate the prac-tice of medicine, see 21 U. S. C. $ 396 (1994 ed., Supp. V), andeven though off-label use is generally accepted.5Conversely, fraud-on-the-FDA claims would also cause applicants to fear that their disclosures to the FDA, althoughdeemed appropriate by the Administration, will later bejudged insufficient in state court. Applicants would thenhave an incentive to submit a deluge of information that theAdministration neither wants nor needs, resulting in additional burdens on the FDA's evaluation of an application.As a result, the comparatively speedy $ 510(k) process couldencounter delays, which would, in turn, impede competitionamong predicate devices and delay health care professionals'ability to prescribe appropriate off-label uses.6Respondent relies heavily onSilkwood v. Kerr-McGeeCorp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984), which it reads to "creat[e] a vir-tually irrefutable presumption against implied preemptionof private damage remedies predicated on an alleged conflictwith a federal remedial scheme." Brief for Respondent 34.5 See Green & Schultz, Tort Law Deference to FDA Regulation of Medical Devices, 88 Geo. L. J. 2119, 2133 (2000) ("Physicians may prescribedrugs and devices for off-label uses"); Smith, Physician Modification ofLegally Marketed Medical Devices: Regulatory Implications Under theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 55 Food & Drug L. J. 245, 251-252(2000) (discussing off-label use in terms of the "practice of medicine doctrine[, which] stands firmly for the proposition that regulatory efforts aredirected primarily at device marketing by manufacturers, not device useby physicians"); Beck & Azari, FDA, Off-Label Use, and Informed Consent: Debunking Myths and Misconceptions, 53 Food & Drug L. J. 71, 72(1998) ("Off-label use is widespread in the medical community and often isessential to giving patients optimal medical care, both of which medicalethics, FDA, and most courts recognize").6 In light of the likely impact that the fraud-on-the-FDA claims wouldhave on the administration of the Administration's duties, we must rejectrespondent's contention that these claims "will . . . affect only the litigantsand will not have the kind of direct impact on the United States, whichpreemption is designed to protect from undue incursion." Brief for Respondent 30 (citing Miree v. DeKalb County, 433 U. S. 25 (1977)).531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN352 BUCKMAN CO. v. PLAINTIFFS' LEGAL COMM.Opinion of the CourtSilkwood is different from the present case, however, inseveral respects. Silkwood's claim was not based on anysort of fraud-on-the-agency theory, but on traditional statetort law principles of the duty of care owed by the producerof plutonium fuel pins to an employee working in its plant.See 464 U. S., at 241. Moreover, our decision there turnedon specific statutory evidence that Congress "disclaimed anyinterest in promoting the development and utilization ofatomic energy by means that fail to provide adequate remedies for those who are injured by exposure to hazardousnuclear materials."Id., at 257. In the present case, bycontrast, we have clear evidence that Congress intended thatthe MDA be enforced exclusively by the Federal Government. 21 U. S. C. $ 337(a).Respondent also suggests that we should be reluctant tofind a pre-emptive conflict here because Congress includedan express pre-emption provision in the MDA. See Brieffor Respondent 37. To the extent respondent posits thatanything other than our ordinary pre-emption principlesapply under these circumstances, that contention must failin light of our conclusion last Term in Geier v. AmericanHonda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000), that neither an express pre-emption provision nor a saving clause "bar[s] theordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles." Id.,at 869.We must also reject respondent's attempt to characterizeboth the claims at issue in Medtronic (common-law negligence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective pacemaker lead) and the fraud claims here as "claimsarising from violations of FDCA requirements." Brief forRespondent 38. Notwithstanding the fact that Medtronicdid not squarely address the question of implied pre-emption,it is clear that the Medtronic claims arose from the manufacturer's alleged failure to use reasonable care in the production of the product, not solely from the violation of FDCArequirements. See 518 U. S., at 481. In the present case,531US2 Unit: $U21 [04-12-02 19:08:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 531 U. S. 341 (2001)Stevens, J., concurring in judgmenthowever, the fraud claims exist solely by virtue of the FDCAdisclosure requirements. Thus, although Medtronic can beread to allow certain state-law causes of actions that parallelfederal safety requirements, it does not and cannot stand forthe proposition that any violation of the FDCA will supporta state-law claim.In sum, were plaintiffs to maintain their fraud-on-the-agency claims here, they would not be relying on traditionalstate tort law which had predated the federal enactmentsin questions. On the contrary, the existence of these federalenactments is a critical element in their case. For the rea-sons stated above, we think this sort of litigation wouldexert an extraneous pull on the scheme established by Con-gress, and it is therefore pre-empted by that scheme.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
