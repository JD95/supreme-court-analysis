The National Firearms Act makes it unlawful for any per-son to possess a machinegun that is not properly registeredwith the Federal Government. Petitioner contends that, toconvict him under the Act, the Government should have beenrequired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knewthe weapon he possessed had the characteristics thatbrought it within the statutory definition of a machinegun.We agree and accordingly reverse the judgment of the Courtof Appeals. IThe National Firearms Act (Act), 26 U. S. C. $$ 5801-5872,imposes strict registration requirements on statutorily defined "firearms." The Act includes within the term "fire-arm" a machinegun, $ 5845(a)(6), and further defines a machinegun as "any weapon which shoots, . . . or can be readilyrestored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger,"$ 5845(b). Thus, any fully automatic weapon is a "firearm"within the meaning of the Act.1 Under the Act, all firearmsmust be registered in the National Firearms Registrationand Transfer Record maintained by the Secretary of theTreasury. $ 5841. Section 5861(d) makes it a crime, punish1 As used here, the terms "automatic" and "fully automatic" refer to aweapon that fires repeatedly with a single pull of the trigger. That is,once its trigger is depressed, the weapon will automatically continue tofire until its trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. Suchweapons are "machineguns" within the meaning of the Act. We use theterm "semiautomatic" to designate a weapon that fires only one shot witheach pull of the trigger, and which requires no manual manipulation by theoperator to place another round in the chamber after each round is fired.511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:18:59 PAGES OPINPGT603Cite as: 511 U. S. 600 (1994)Opinion of the Courtable by up to 10 years in prison, see $ 5871, for any personto possess a firearm that is not properly registered.Upon executing a search warrant at petitioner's home,local police and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms (BATF) recovered, among other things, an AR-15rifle. The AR-15 is the civilian version of the military'sM-16 rifle, and is, unless modified, a semiautomatic weapon.The M-16, in contrast, is a selective fire rifle that allows theoperator, by rotating a selector switch, to choose semiautomatic or automatic fire. Many M-16 parts are interchange-able with those in the AR-15 and can be used to convert theAR-15 into an automatic weapon. No doubt to inhibit suchconversions, the AR-15 is manufactured with a metal stopon its receiver that will prevent an M-16 selector switch,if installed, from rotating to the fully automatic position.The metal stop on petitioner's rifle, however, had been filedaway, and the rifle had been assembled with an M-16 selector switch and several other M-16 internal parts, including a hammer, disconnector, and trigger. Suspecting thatthe AR-15 had been modified to be capable of fully automatic fire, BATF agents seized the weapon. Petitioner subsequently was indicted for unlawful possession of an unregistered machinegun in violation of $ 5861(d).At trial, BATF agents testified that when the AR-15 wastested, it fired more than one shot with a single pull of thetrigger. It was undisputed that the weapon was not registered as required by $ 5861(d). Petitioner testified that therifle had never fired automatically when it was in his possession. He insisted that the AR-15 had operated only semiautomatically, and even then imperfectly, often requiring manual ejection of the spent casing and chambering of the nextround. According to petitioner, his alleged ignorance of anyautomatic firing capability should have shielded him fromcriminal liability for his failure to register the weapon. Herequested the District Court to instruct the jury that, toestablish a violation of $ 5861(d), the Government must prove511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:18:59 PAGES OPINPGT604 STAPLES v.

It wouldbe enough to prove he knows that he is dealing with adangerous device of a type as would alert one to thelikelihood of regulation." Tr. 465.Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to five years' proba-tion and a $5,000 fine.The Court of Appeals affirmed. Relying on its decision inUnited States v. Mittleider, 835 F. 2d 769 (CA10 1987), cert.denied, 485 U. S. 980 (1988), the court concluded that theGovernment need not prove a defendant's knowledge of aweapon's physical properties to obtain a conviction under$ 5861(d). 971 F. 2d 608, 612-613 (CA10 1992). We grantedcertiorari, 508 U. S. 939 (1993), to resolve a conflict in theCourts of Appeals concerning themens rea required under$ 5861(d).IIAWhether or not $ 5861(d) requires proof that a defendantknew of the characteristics of his weapon that made it a"firearm" under the Act is a question of statutory construc-tion. As we observed in Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S.419 (1985), "[t]he definition of the elements of a criminal of-fense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the caseof federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute."Id., at 424 (citing United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 322 In what the parties regard as a mistranscription, the transcript contains the word "suggested" instead of "which subjects it."511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:18:59 PAGES OPINPGT605Cite as: 511 U. S. 600 (1994)Opinion of the Court(1812)). Thus, we have long recognized that determiningthe mental state required for commission of a federal crimerequires "construction of the statute and . . . inference ofthe intent of Congress."United States v. Balint, 258 U. S.250, 253 (1922). See also Liparota, supra, at 423.The language of the statute, the starting place in our in-quiry, seeConnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,253-254 (1992), provides little explicit guidance in this case.Section 5861(d) is silent concerning themens rea requiredfor a violation. It states simply that "[i]t shall be unlawfulfor any person . . . to receive or possess a firearm which isnot registered to him in the National Firearms Registrationand Transfer Record." 26 U. S. C. $ 5861(d). Nevertheless,silence on this point by itself does not necessarily suggestthat Congress intended to dispense with a conventional mensrea element, which would require that the defendant knowthe facts that make his conduct illegal. See Balint, supra,at 251 (stating that traditionally, "scienter" was a necessaryelement in every crime). See also n. 3, infra. On the contrary, we must construe the statute in light of the background rules of the common law, see United States v. UnitedStates Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 436-437 (1978), in whichthe requirement of some mens rea for a crime is firmly embedded. As we have observed, "[t]he existence of a mensrea is the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principlesof Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence." Id., at 436 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Morissette v.United States, 342 U. S. 246, 250 (1952) ("The contention thatan injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is as universaland persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedomof the human will and a consequent ability and duty of thenormal individual to choose between good and evil").There can be no doubt that this established concept hasinfluenced our interpretation of criminal statutes. Indeed,we have noted that the common-law rule requiring mens rea511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:18:59 PAGES OPINPGT606 STAPLES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courthas been "followed in regard to statutory crimes even wherethe statutory definition did not in terms include it."Balint,supra, at 251-252. Relying on the strength of the tradi-tional rule, we have stated that offenses that require nomens rea generally are disfavored, Liparota, supra, at 426,and have suggested that some indication of congressional in-tent, express or implied, is required to dispense withmensrea as an element of a crime. Cf. United States Gypsum,supra, at 438; Morissette, supra, at 263.According to the Government, however, the nature andpurpose of the Act suggest that the presumption favoringmens rea does not apply to this case. The Government argues that Congress intended the Act to regulate and restrictthe circulation of dangerous weapons. Consequently, in theGovernment's view, this case fits in a line of precedent concerning what we have termed "public welfare" or "regulatory" offenses, in which we have understood Congress to impose a form of strict criminal liability through statutes thatdo not require the defendant to know the facts that makehis conduct illegal. In construing such statutes, we haveinferred from silence that Congress did not intend to requireproof of mens rea to establish an offense.For example, in Balint, we concluded that the NarcoticAct of 1914, which was intended in part to minimize thespread of addictive drugs by criminalizing undocumentedsales of certain narcotics, required proof only that the defendant knew that he was selling drugs, not that he knewthe specific items he had sold were "narcotics" within theambit of the statute. See Balint, supra, at 254. Cf. UnitedStates v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 281 (1943) (stating indicta that a statute criminalizing the shipment of adulteratedor misbranded drugs did not require knowledge that theitems were misbranded or adulterated). As we explainedin Dotterweich, Balint dealt with "a now familiar type oflegislation whereby penalties serve as effective means ofregulation. Such legislation dispenses with the conven511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT607Cite as: 511 U. S. 600 (1994)Opinion of the Courttional requirement for criminal conduct--awareness of somewrongdoing." 320 U. S., at 280-281. See also Morissette,supra, at 252-256.Such public welfare offenses have been created by Congress, and recognized by this Court, in "limited circum-stances."United States Gypsum, supra, at 437. Typically,our cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes thatregulate potentially harmful or injurious items. Cf. UnitedStates v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402U. S. 558, 564-565 (1971) (characterizing Balint and similarcases as involving statutes regulating "dangerous or deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials").In such situations, we have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a dangerous device of acharacter that places him "in responsible relation to a publicdanger," Dotterweich, supra, at 281, he should be alerted tothe probability of strict regulation, and we have assumedthat in such cases Congress intended to place the burden onthe defendant to "ascertain at his peril whether [his conduct]comes within the inhibition of the statute." Balint, supra,at 254. Thus, we essentially have relied on the nature of thestatute and the particular character of the items regulatedto determine whether congressional silence concerning themental element of the offense should be interpreted as dis-pensing with conventional mens rea requirements. Seegenerally Morissette, supra, at 252-260.33 By interpreting such public welfare offenses to require at least thatthe defendant know that he is dealing with some dangerous or deleterioussubstance, we have avoided construing criminal statutes to impose a rigorous form of strict liability. See, e. g., United States v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U. S. 558, 563-564 (1971) (suggesting that ifa person shipping acid mistakenly thought that he was shipping distilledwater, he would not violate a statute criminalizing undocumented shippingof acids). True strict liability might suggest that the defendant need notknow even that he was dealing with a dangerous item. Nevertheless, wehave referred to public welfare offenses as "dispensing with" or "eliminating" a mens rea requirement or "mental element," see, e. g., Morissette,511US2 Unit: $U55 [11-04-99 07:43:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN608 STAPLES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtBThe Government argues that $ 5861(d) defines preciselythe sort of regulatory offense described inBalint. In thisview, all guns, whether or not they are statutory "firearms,"are dangerous devices that put gun owners on notice thatthey must determine at their hazard whether their weaponscome within the scope of the Act. On this understanding,the District Court's instruction in this case was correct, because a conviction can rest simply on proof that a defendantknew he possessed a "firearm" in the ordinary sense of theterm.The Government seeks support for its position from ourdecision in United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601 (1971), whichinvolved a prosecution for possession of unregistered grenades under $ 5861(d).4 The defendant knew that the itemsin his possession were grenades, and we concluded that$ 5861(d) did not require the Government to prove the de-fendant also knew that the grenades were unregistered.Id., at 609. To be sure, in deciding that mens rea was notrequired with respect to that element of the offense, we sug342 U. S., at 250, 263; United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 281(1943), and have described them as strict liability crimes, United States v.United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 437 (1978). While use of theterm "strict liability" is really a misnomer, we have interpreted statutesdefining public welfare offenses to eliminate the requirement of mens rea;that is, the requirement of a "guilty mind" with respect to an element ofa crime. Under such statutes we have not required that the defendantknow the facts that make his conduct fit the definition of the offense. Generally speaking, such knowledge is necessary to establish mens rea, as isreflected in the maxim ignorantia facti excusat. See generally J. Hawley & M. McGregor, Criminal Law 26-30 (1899); R. Perkins, Criminal Law785-786 (2d ed. 1969); G. Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part 113-174 (1953). Cf. Queen v. Tolson, 23 Q. B. 168, 187 (1889) (Stephen, J.)("[I]t may, I think, be maintained that in every case knowledge of fact[when not appearing in the statute] is to some extent an element of criminality as much as competent age and sanity").4 A grenade is a "firearm" under the Act. 26 U.

S. 600 (1994)Opinion of the Courtgested that the Act "is a regulatory measure in the in-terest of the public safety, which may well be premised onthe theory that one would hardly be surprised to learn thatpossession of hand grenades is not an innocent act."Ibid.Grenades, we explained, "are highly dangerous offensiveweapons, no less dangerous than the narcotics involved inUnited States v. Balint." Ibid. But that reasoning provides little support for dispensing with mens rea in this case.As the Government concedes,Freed did not address theissue presented here. In Freed, we decided only that$ 5861(d) does not require proof of knowledge that a firearm is unregistered. The question presented by a defendantwho possesses a weapon that is a "firearm" for purposes ofthe Act, but who knows only that he has a "firearm" in thegeneral sense of the term, was not raised or considered.And our determination that a defendant need not know thathis weapon is unregistered suggests no conclusion concerning whether $ 5861(d) requires the defendant to know of thefeatures that make his weapon a statutory "firearm"; different elements of the same offense can require different mentalstates. See Liparota, 471 U. S., at 423, n. 5; United Statesv. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 405-406 (1980). See also W. LaFave & A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law 194-195 (1972).Moreover, our analysis in Freed likening the Act to the public welfare statute in Balint rested entirely on the assumption that the defendant knew that he was dealing with handgrenades--that is, that he knew he possessed a particularlydangerous type of weapon (one within the statutory definition of a "firearm"), possession of which was not entirely"innocent" in and of itself. 401 U. S., at 609. The predicate for that analysis is eliminated when, as in this case, thevery question to be decided is whether the defendant mustknow of the particular characteristics that make his weapona statutory firearm.Notwithstanding these distinctions, the Government urgesthat Freed's logic applies because guns, no less than gre511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT610 STAPLES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtnades, are highly dangerous devices that should alert theirowners to the probability of regulation. But the gap between Freed and this case is too wide to bridge. In glossingover the distinction between grenades and guns, the Government ignores the particular care we have taken to avoid construing a statute to dispense with mens rea where doingso would "criminalize a broad range of apparently innocentconduct." Liparota, 471 U. S., at 426. In Liparota, we con-sidered a statute that made unlawful the unauthorized acquisition or possession of food stamps. We determined thatthe statute required proof that the defendant knew hispossession of food stamps was unauthorized, largely becausedispensing with such a mens rea requirement would haveresulted in reading the statute to outlaw a number of apparently innocent acts. Ibid. Our conclusion that the statuteshould not be treated as defining a public welfare offenserested on the commonsense distinction that a "food stampcan hardly be compared to a hand grenade." Id., at 433.Neither, in our view, can all guns be compared to handgrenades. Although the contrast is certainly not as stark asthat presented in Liparota, the fact remains that there is along tradition of widespread lawful gun ownership by privateindividuals in this country. Such a tradition did not applyto the possession of hand grenades in Freed or to the sellingof dangerous drugs that we considered in Balint. See alsoInternational Minerals, 402 U. S., at 563-565; Balint, 258U. S., at 254. In fact, in Freed we construed $ 5861(d) underthe assumption that "one would hardly be surprised to learnthat possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act."Freed, supra, at 609. Here, the Government essentiallysuggests that we should interpret the section under the altogether different assumption that "one would hardly be surprised to learn that owning a gun is not an innocent act."That proposition is simply not supported by common experience. Guns in general are not "deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials," International Minerals,511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT611Cite as: 511 U. S. 600 (1994)Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 565, that put their owners on notice that they stand"in responsible relation to a public danger," Dotterweich, 320U. S., at 281.The Government protests that guns, unlike food stamps,but like grenades and narcotics, are potentially harmful de-vices.5 Under this view, it seems that Liparota's concernfor criminalizing ostensibly innocuous conduct is inapplicablewhenever an item is sufficiently dangerous--that is, dangerousness alone should alert an individual to probable regula-tion and justify treating a statute that regulates the dangerous device as dispensing with mens rea. But that an itemis "dangerous," in some general sense, does not necessarilysuggest, as the Government seems to assume, that it is notalso entirely innocent. Even dangerous items can, in somecases, be so commonplace and generally available that wewould not consider them to alert individuals to the likelihoodof strict regulation. As suggested above, despite their po-tential for harm, guns generally can be owned in perfect innocence. Of course, we might surely classify certain catego-ries of guns--no doubt including the machineguns, sawed-offshotguns, and artillery pieces that Congress has subjected to5 The dissent's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, the Government's position, "[a]ccurately identified," post, at 632, is precisely that "gunsin general" are dangerous items. The Government, like the dissent, citesSipes v. United States, 321 F. 2d 174, 179 (CA8), cert. denied, 375 U. S. 913(1963), for the proposition that a defendant's knowledge that the item hepossessed "was a gun" is sufficient for a conviction under $ 5861(d). Brieffor United States 21. Indeed, the Government argues that "guns" shouldbe placed in the same category as the misbranded drugs in Dotterweichand the narcotics in Balint because " `one would hardly be surprised tolearn' (Freed, 401 U. S. at 609) that there are laws that affect one's rightsof gun ownership." Brief for United States 22. The dissent relies uponthe Government's repeated contention that the statute requires knowledgethat "the item at issue was highly dangerous and of a type likely to besubject to regulation." Id., at 9. But that assertion merely patterns thegeneral language we have used to describe the mens rea requirement inpublic welfare offenses and amounts to no more than an assertion that thestatute should be treated as defining a public welfare offense.511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT612 STAPLES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtregulation--as items the ownership of which would have thesame quasi-suspect character we attributed to owning handgrenades in Freed. But precisely because guns falling out-side those categories traditionally have been widely acceptedas lawful possessions, their destructive potential, while per-haps even greater than that of some items we would classifyalong with narcotics and hand grenades, cannot be said toput gun owners sufficiently on notice of the likelihood of regulation to justify interpreting $ 5861(d) as not requiring proofof knowledge of a weapon's characteristics.66 The dissent asserts that the question is not whether all guns are deleterious devices, but whether a gun "such as the one possessed by petitioner," post, at 632 (which the dissent characterizes as a "semiautomaticweapon that [is] readily convertible into a machinegun," post, at 624, 633,640), is such a device. If the dissent intends to suggest that the categoryof readily convertible semiautomatics provides the benchmark for definingthe knowledge requirement for $ 5861(d), it is difficult to see how it derivesthat class of weapons as a standard. As explained above, see n. 5, supra,the Government's argument has nothing to do with this ad hoc categoryof weapons. And the statute certainly does not suggest that any significance should attach to readily convertible semiautomatics, for that classbears no relation to the definitions in the Act. Indeed, in the absence ofany definition, it is not at all clear what the contours of this categorywould be. The parties assume that virtually all semiautomatics may beconverted into automatics, and limiting the class to those "readily" convertible provides no real guidance concerning the required mens rea. Inshort, every owner of a semiautomatic rifle or handgun would potentiallymeet such a mens rea test.But the dissent apparently does not conceive of the mens rea requirement in terms of specific categories of weapons at all, and rather views itas a more fluid concept that does not require delineation of any concreteelements of knowledge that will apply consistently from case to case. Thedissent sees no need to define a class of items the knowing possession ofwhich satisfies the mens rea element of the offense, for in the dissent'sview the exact content of the knowledge requirement can be left to thejury in each case. As long as the jury concludes that the item in a givencase is "sufficiently dangerous to alert [the defendant] to the likelihood ofregulation," post, at 637, the knowledge requirement is satisfied. See alsopost, at 624, 639, 640. But the mens rea requirement under a criminalstatute is a question of law, to be determined by the court. Our decisions511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT613Cite as: 511 U. S. 600 (1994)Opinion of the CourtOn a slightly different tack, the Government suggests thatguns are subject to an array of regulations at the federal,state, and local levels that put gun owners on notice thatthey must determine the characteristics of their weaponsand comply with all legal requirements.7 But regulation initself is not sufficient to place gun ownership in the categoryof the sale of narcotics in Balint. The food stamps at issuein Liparota were subject to comprehensive regulations, yetwe did not understand the statute there to dispense with amens rea requirement. Moreover, despite the overlay oflegal restrictions on gun ownership, we question whetherregulations on guns are sufficiently intrusive that they im-pinge upon the common experience that owning a gun isusually licit and blameless conduct. Roughly 50 percent ofsuggesting that public welfare offenses require that the defendant knowthat he stands in "responsible relation to a public danger," Dotterweich,320 U. S., at 281, in no way suggest that what constitutes a public dangeris a jury question. It is for courts, through interpretation of the statute,to define the mens rea required for a conviction. That task cannot bereduced to setting a general "standard," post, at 637, that leaves it tothe jury to determine, based presumably on the jurors' personal opinions,whether the items involved in a particular prosecution are sufficiently dangerous to place a person on notice of regulation.Moreover, as our discussion above should make clear, to determine asa threshold matter whether a particular statute defines a public welfareoffense, a court must have in view some category of dangerous and deleterious devices that will be assumed to alert an individual that he standsin "responsible relation to a public danger." Dotterweich, supra, at 281.The truncated mens rea requirement we have described applies preciselybecause the court has determined that the statute regulates in a fieldwhere knowing possession of some general class of items should alert individuals to probable regulation. Under the dissent's approach, however, itseems that every regulatory statute potentially could be treated as a public welfare offense as long as the jury--not the court--ultimately determines that the specific items involved in a prosecution were sufficientlydangerous.7 See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $$ 921-928 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV) (requiring licensing of manufacturers, importers, and dealers of guns and regulatingthe sale, possession, and interstate transportation of certain guns).511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT614 STAPLES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtAmerican homes contain at least one firearm of some sort,8and in the vast majority of States, buying a shotgun or rifleis a simple transaction that would not alert a person to regu-lation any more than would buying a car.9If we were to accept as a general rule the Government'ssuggestion that dangerous and regulated items place theirowners under an obligation to inquire at their peril into compliance with regulations, we would undoubtedly reach someuntoward results. Automobiles, for example, might also betermed "dangerous" devices and are highly regulated at boththe state and federal levels. Congress might see fit to criminalize the violation of certain regulations concerning automobiles, and thus might make it a crime to operate a vehiclewithout a properly functioning emission control system.But we probably would hesitate to conclude on the basis ofsilence that Congress intended a prison term to apply to acar owner whose vehicle's emissions levels, wholly unbeknownst to him, began to exceed legal limits between regular inspection dates.Here, there can be little doubt that, as in Liparota, theGovernment's construction of the statute potentially wouldimpose criminal sanctions on a class of persons whose mentalstate--ignorance of the characteristics of weapons in their8 See U.

Anderson, 885 F. 2d 1248, 1251, 1253-1254 (CA5 1989) (en banc). Such a gun may give no externally visible indication that it is fully automatic. See UnitedStates v. Herbert, 698 F. 2d 981, 986 (CA9), cert. denied, 464U. S. 821 (1983). But in the Government's view, any personwho has purchased what he believes to be a semiautomaticrifle or handgun, or who simply has inherited a gun from arelative and left it untouched in an attic or basement, canbe subject to imprisonment, despite absolute ignorance ofthe gun's firing capabilities, if the gun turns out to be anautomatic.We concur in the Fifth Circuit's conclusion on this point:"It is unthinkable to us that Congress intended to subjectsuch law-abiding, well-intentioned citizens to a possible tenyear term of imprisonment if . . . what they genuinely andreasonably believed was a conventional semi-automatic[weapon] turns out to have worn down into or been secretlymodified to be a fully automatic weapon."

But knowledge can be inferred from circumstantial511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT616 STAPLES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtCongress where, as here, it would mean easing the path toconvicting persons whose conduct would not even alert themto the probability of strict regulation in the form of a statutesuch as $ 5861(d).CThe potentially harsh penalty attached to violation of$ 5861(d)--up to 10 years' imprisonment--confirms our reading of the Act. Historically, the penalty imposed under astatute has been a significant consideration in determiningwhether the statute should be construed as dispensing withmens rea. Certainly, the cases that first defined the conceptof the public welfare offense almost uniformly involved stat-utes that provided for only light penalties such as fines orshort jail sentences, not imprisonment in the state peniten-tiary. See,e. g., Commonwealth v. Raymond, 97 Mass. 567(1867) (fine of up to $200 or six months in jail, or both); Commonwealth v. Farren, 91 Mass. 489 (1864) (fine); People v.Snowburger, 113 Mich. 86, 71 N. W. 497 (1897) (fine of up to$500 or incarceration in county jail).12As commentators have pointed out, the small penaltiesattached to such offenses logically complemented the absenceof a mens rea requirement: In a system that generally reevidence, including any external indications signaling the nature of theweapon. And firing a fully automatic weapon would make the regulatedcharacteristics of the weapon immediately apparent to its owner. Inshort, we are confident that when the defendant knows of the characteristics of his weapon that bring it within the scope of the Act, the Government will not face great difficulty in proving that knowledge. Of course,if Congress thinks it necessary to reduce the Government's burden at trialto ensure proper enforcement of the Act, it remains free to amend $ 5861(d)by explicitly eliminating a mens rea requirement.12 Leading English cases developing a parallel theory of regulatory offenses similarly involved violations punishable only by fine or short-termincarceration. See, e. g., Queen v. Woodrow, 15 M. & W. 404, 153 Eng.Rep. 907 (Ex. 1846) (fine of #200 for adulterated tobacco); Hobbs v. Winchester Corp., [1910] 2 K. B. 471 (maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment for sale of unwholesome meat).511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT617Cite as: 511 U.

Blackstone,Commentaries *21, imposing severe punishments for offenses that require no mens rea would seem incongruous.See Sayre, Public Welfare Offenses, 33 Colum. L. Rev. 55, 70(1933). Indeed, some courts justified the absence of mensrea in part on the basis that the offenses did not bear thesame punishments as "infamous crimes," Tenement HouseDept. v. McDevitt, 215 N. Y. 160, 168, 109 N. E. 88, 90 (1915)(Cardozo, J.), and questioned whether imprisonment wascompatible with the reduced culpability required for suchregulatory offenses. See, e. g., People ex rel. Price v. Sheffield Farms-Slawson-Decker Co., 225 N. Y. 25, 32-33, 121N. E. 474, 477 (1918) (Cardozo, J.); id., at 35, 121 N. E., at478 (Crane, J., concurring) (arguing that imprisonment for acrime that requires no mens rea would stretch the law regarding acts mala prohibita beyond its limitations).13 Similarly, commentators collecting the early cases have arguedthat offenses punishable by imprisonment cannot be understood to be public welfare offenses, but must require mensrea. See R. Perkins, Criminal Law 793-798 (2d ed. 1969)(suggesting that the penalty should be the starting point indetermining whether a statute describes a public welfare offense); Sayre, supra, at 72 ("Crimes punishable with prisonsentences . . . ordinarily require proof of a guilty intent").14In rehearsing the characteristics of the public welfare offense, we, too, have included in our consideration the punishments imposed and have noted that "penalties commonly arerelatively small, and conviction does no grave damage to an13 Cf. Queen v. Tolson, 23 Q. B., at 177 (Wills, J.) (In determining whethera criminal statute dispenses with mens rea, "the nature and extent of thepenalty attached to the offence may reasonably be considered. There isnothing that need shock any mind in the payment of a small pecuniarypenalty by a person who has unwittingly done something detrimental tothe public interest").14 But see, e. g., State v. Lindberg, 125 Wash. 51, 215 P. 41 (1923) (applyingthe public welfare offense rationale to a felony).511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT618 STAPLES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtoffender's reputation." Morissette, 342 U. S., at 256.15 Wehave even recognized that it was "[u]nder such considerations" that courts have construed statutes to dispense withmens rea. Ibid.Our characterization of the public welfare offense inMorissette hardly seems apt, however, for a crime that is afelony, as is violation of $ 5861(d).16 After all, "felony" is, aswe noted in distinguishing certain common-law crimes frompublic welfare offenses, " `as bad a word as you can give toman or thing.' " Id., at 260 (quoting 2 F. Pollock & F. Mait-land, History of English Law 465 (2d ed. 1899)). Close adherence to the early cases described above might suggestthat punishing a violation as a felony is simply incompatiblewith the theory of the public welfare offense. In this view,absent a clear statement from Congress thatmens rea isnot required, we should not apply the public welfare offenserationale to interpret any statute defining a felony offenseas dispensing withmens rea. But see United States v.Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922).We need not adopt such a definitive rule of constructionto decide this case, however. Instead, we note only thatwhere, as here, dispensing withmens rea would require thedefendant to have knowledge only of traditionally lawful con-duct, a severe penalty is a further factor tending to suggestthat Congress did not intend to eliminate a mens rea require15 See also United States Gypsum, 438 U. S., at 442, n. 18 (noting thatan individual violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act is a felony punishableby three years in prison or a fine not exceeding $100,000 and stating that"[t]he severity of these sanctions provides further support for our conclusion that the [Act] should not be construed as creating strict-liabilitycrimes"). Cf. Holdridge v. United States, 282 F. 2d 302, 310 (CA8 1960)(Blackmun, J.) ("[W]here a federal criminal statute omits mention of intentand . . . where the penalty is relatively small, where conviction does notgravely besmirch, [and] where the statutory crime is not one taken overfrom the common law, . . . the statute can be construed as one not requiringcriminal intent").16 Title 18 U.

In such a case, the usual presumption that a defend-ant must know the facts that make his conduct illegalshould apply. IIIIn short, we conclude that the background rule of thecommon law favoring mens rea should govern interpretationof $ 5861(d) in this case. Silence does not suggest that Con-gress dispensed withmens rea for the element of $ 5861(d)at issue here. Thus, to obtain a conviction, the Governmentshould have been required to prove that petitioner knew ofthe features of his AR-15 that brought it within the scopeof the Act.17We emphasize that our holding is a narrow one. As inour prior cases, our reasoning depends upon a commonsenseevaluation of the nature of the particular device or substanceCongress has subjected to regulation and the expectationsthat individuals may legitimately have in dealing with theregulated items. In addition, we think that the penaltyattached to $ 5861(d) suggests that Congress did not intendto eliminate a mens rea requirement for violation of the sec-tion. As we noted inMorissette: "Neither this Court nor,17 In reaching our conclusion, we find it unnecessary to rely on the ruleof lenity, under which an ambiguous criminal statute is to be construed infavor of the accused. That maxim of construction "is reserved for caseswhere, `[a]fter "seiz[ing] every thing from which aid can be derived," ' theCourt is `left with an ambiguous statute.' " Smith v. United States, 508U. S. 223, 239 (1993) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347(1971), in turn quoting United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805)).See also United States v. R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 311 (1992) (Thomas, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Chapman v. UnitedStates, 500 U. S. 453, 463 (1991) (rule of lenity inapplicable unless there isa " `grievous ambiguity or uncertainty' " in the statute). Here, the background rule of the common law favoring mens rea and the substantialbody of precedent we have developed construing statutes that do not specify a mental element provide considerable interpretive tools from whichwe can "seize aid," and they do not leave us with the ultimate impressionthat $ 5861(d) is "grievous[ly]" ambiguous. Certainly, we have not concluded in the past that statutes silent with respect to mens rea are ambiguous. See, e. g., United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922).511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT620 STAPLES v.

We note only that our holding de-pends critically on our view that if Congress had intendedto make outlaws of gun owners who were wholly ignorantof the offending characteristics of their weapons, and to subject them to lengthy prison terms, it would have spokenmore clearly to that effect.
