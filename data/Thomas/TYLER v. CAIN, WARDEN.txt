Under Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.

A jury found Tyler guilty of second-degree mur-der, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. After sentencing, Tyler assiduously sought postconviction relief. By1986, he had filed five state petitions, all of which were denied. See State ex rel. Tyler v. Blackburn, 494 So. 2d 1171(La. 1986); State v. Tyler, 446 So. 2d 1226 (La. 1984); Stateex rel. Tyler v.

He next filed a federal habeaspetition, which was unsuccessful as well. Tyler v. Butler,No. 88cv4929 (ED La.), aff 'd, Tyler v. Whitley, 920 F. 2d 929(CA5 1990). After this Court's decision in Cage, Tyler continued his efforts. Because the jury instruction definingreasonable doubt at Tyler's trial was substantively identicalto the instruction condemned in Cage, Tyler filed a sixthstate postconviction petition, this time raising aCage claim.The State District Court denied relief, and the LouisianaSupreme Court affirmed.

Seekingto pursue his Cage claim, Tyler moved the United Statesand n. 4 (1991), however, this Court made clear that the proper inquiry isnot whether the instruction "could have" been applied unconstitutionally,but whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did so applyit. See also Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U. S. 1, 6 (1994) ("The constitutionalquestion in the present cases . . . is whether there is a reasonable likelihoodthat the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based onproof insufficient to meet the [constitutional] standard").533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN660 TYLER v.

Lensing, 171 F. 3d1031 (CA5 1999); In re Smith, 142 F. 3d 832 (CA5 1998), theCourt of Appeals concluded that Tyler did not meet thisstandard because he "could not show that any SupremeCourt decision renders the Cage decision retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review." App. 15.The Courts of Appeals are divided on the questionwhether Cage was "made retroactive to cases on collateralreview by the Supreme Court," as required by 28 U. S. C.$ 2244(b)(2)(A). Compare Rodriguez v. Superintendent, 139F. 3d 270 (CA1 1998) (holding thatCage has not been maderetroactive by the Supreme Court); Brown, supra (same);In re Hill, 113 F. 3d 181 (CA11 1997) (same), with West v.Vaughn, 204 F. 3d 53 (CA3 2000) (holding that Cage has beenmade retroactive to cases on collateral review). To resolvethis conflict, we granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1051 (2000).IIAEDPA greatly restricts the power of federal courts toaward relief to state prisoners who file second or successivehabeas corpus applications. If the prisoner asserts a claimthat he has already presented in a previous federal habeas petition, the claim must be dismissed in all cases.$ 2244(b)(1). And if the prisoner asserts a claim that wasnot presented in a previous petition, the claim must be dis-missed unless it falls within one of two narrow exceptions.One of these exceptions is for claims predicated on newly3 This requirement differs from the one that applicants must satisfy inorder to obtain permission from a court of appeals to file a second orsuccessive petition. As noted above, a court of appeals may authorizesuch a filing only if it determines that the applicant makes a "primafacie showing" that the application satisfies the statutory standard.$ 2244(b)(3)(C). But to survive dismissal in district court, the applicantmust actually "sho[w]" that the claim satisfies the standard.533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN662 TYLER v. CAINOpinion of the Courtdiscovered facts that call into question the accuracy ofa guilty verdict. $ 2244(b)(2)(B). The other is for certain claims relying on new rules of constitutional law.$ 2244(b)(2)(A).It is the latter exception that concerns us today. Specifi-cally, $ 2244(b)(2)(A) covers claims that "rel[y] on a new ruleof constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateralreview by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable." This provision establishes three prerequisites to ob-taining relief in a second or successive petition: First, therule on which the claim relies must be a "new rule" of consti-tutional law; second, the rule must have been "made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court";and third, the claim must have been "previously unavailable." In this case, the parties ask us to interpret only thesecond requirement; respondent does not dispute thatCagecreated a "new rule" that was "previously unavailable."Based on the plain meaning of the text read as a whole, weconclude that "made" means "held" and, thus, the requirement is satisfied only if this Court has held that the new ruleis retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.AAs commonly defined, "made" has several alternativemeanings, none of which is entirely free from ambiguity.See, e. g., Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 718-719 (1991) (defining "to make" as "to cause to happen," "tocause to exist, occur or appear," "to lay out and construct,"and "to cause to act in a certain way"). Out of context, itmay thus be unclear which meaning should apply in$ 2244(b)(2)(A), and how the term should be understood. Wedo not, however, construe the meaning of statutory terms ina vacuum. Rather, we interpret the words "in their contextand with a view to their place in the overall statutoryscheme."Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.803, 809 (1989). In $ 2244(b)(2)(A), the word "made" fallswithin a clause that reads as follows: "[A] new rule of consti533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN663Cite as: 533 U. S. 656 (2001)Opinion of the Courttutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral reviewby the Supreme Court." (Emphasis added.) Quite significantly, under this provision, the Supreme Court is the onlyentity that can "ma[k]e" a new rule retroactive. The newrule becomes retroactive, not by the decisions of the lowercourt or by the combined action of the Supreme Court andthe lower courts, but simply by the action of the SupremeCourt.The only way the Supreme Court can, by itself, "lay outand construct" a rule's retroactive effect, or "cause" that effect "to exist, occur, or appear," is through a holding. TheSupreme Court does not "ma[k]e" a rule retroactive when itmerely establishes principles of retroactivity and leaves theapplication of those principles to lower courts. In such anevent, any legal conclusion that is derived from the principlesis developed by the lower court (or perhaps by a combinationof courts), not by the Supreme Court.4 We thus concludethat a new rule is not "made retroactive to cases on collateralreview" unless the Supreme Court holds it to be retroactive.54 Similarly, the Supreme Court does not make a rule retroactive throughdictum, which is not binding. Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517U. S. 44, 67 (1996) (contrasting dictum with holdings, which include thefinal disposition of a case as well as the preceding determinations "necessary to that result" (emphasis added)).5 Tyler argues that defining "made" to mean "held" would create ananomaly: When it is obvious that a rule should be retroactive, the courtsof appeals will not be in conflict, and this Court will never decide to hearthe case and will never make the rule retroactive. Thus, Tyler concludes,we should construe $ 2244(b)(2)(A) to allow for retroactive applicationwhenever the "principles" of our decisions, as interpreted by the courts ofappeals, indicate that retroactivity is appropriate. This argument isflawed, however. First, even if we disagreed with the legislative decisionto establish stringent procedural requirements for retroactive applicationof new rules, we do not have license to question the decision on policygrounds. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254(1992). Second, the "anomalous" result that Tyler predicts is speculativeat best, because AEDPA does not limit our discretion to grant certiorarito cases in which the courts of appeals have reached divergent results.533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN664 TYLER v. CAINOpinion of the CourtTo be sure, the statute uses the word "made," not "held."But we have already stated, in a decision interpreting another provision of AEDPA, that Congress need not use theword "held" to require as much. In Williams v. Taylor, 529U. S. 362 (2000), we concluded that the phrase "clearly estab-lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ofthe United States," $ 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added), "refers tothe holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions," id., at 412. The provision did not use the word"held," but the effect was the same. Congress, needless tosay, is permitted to use synonyms in a statute. And justas "determined" and "held" are synonyms in the context of$ 2254(d)(1), "made" and "held" are synonyms in the contextof $ 2244(b)(2)(A).We further note that our interpretation is necessary forthe proper implementation of the collateral review structurecreated by AEDPA. Under the statute, before a state pris-oner may file a second or successive habeas application, he"shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an orderauthorizing the district court to consider the application."$ 2244(b)(3)(A). The court of appeals must make a decisionon the application within 30 days. $ 2244(b)(3)(D). In thislimited time, the court of appeals must determine whetherthe application "makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the [second habeas standard]." $ 2244(b)(3)(C). It isunlikely that a court of appeals could make such a determination in the allotted time if it had to do more than simply relyon Supreme Court holdings on retroactivity. The stringenttime limit thus suggests that the courts of appeals do nothave to engage in the difficult legal analysis that can berequired to determine questions of retroactivity in the firstinstance.BBecause "made" means " held" for purposes of$ 2244(b)(2)(A), it is clear that theCage rule has not been"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court." Cage itself does not hold that it is retroac533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN665Cite as: 533 U. S. 656 (2001)Opinion of the Courttive. The only holding in Cage is that the particular juryinstruction violated the Due Process Clause.Tyler argues, however, that a subsequent case, Sullivanv.Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275 (1993), made the Cage rule retroactive. But Sullivan held only that a Cage error is struc-tural--i. e., it is not amenable to harmless-error analysis and"will always invalidate the conviction." 508 U. S., at 279.Conceding that the holding in Sullivan does not render Cageretroactive to cases on collateral review, Tyler contends thatthe reasoning in Sullivan makes clear that retroactive appli-cation is warranted by the principles ofTeague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989). Under Teague, a new rule can be retroac-tive to cases on collateral review if, and only if, it falls withinone of two narrow exceptions to the general rule of nonretro-activity.Id., at 311-313 (plurality opinion). See also O'Dellv. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 156-157 (1997). The exceptionrelevant here is for "watershed rules of criminal procedureimplicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of thecriminal proceeding."Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 478(1993). To fall within this exception, a new rule must meettwo requirements: Infringement of the rule must "seriouslydiminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,"and the rule must " ` "alter our understanding of the bedrockprocedural elements" ' essential to the fairness of a proceeding." Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242 (1990) (quotingTeague, supra, at 311 (plurality opinion), in turn quotingMackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 693 (1971) (Harlan,J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part)).According to Tyler, the reasoning of Sullivan demonstrates that the Cage rule satisfies both prongs of this Teagueexception. First, Tyler notes, Sullivan repeatedly emphasized that a Cage error fundamentally undermines the reliability of a trial's outcome. And second, Tyler contends, thecentral point of Sullivan is that a Cage error deprives a defendant of a bedrock element of procedural fairness: the rightto have the jury make the determination of guilt beyond areasonable doubt. Tyler's arguments fail to persuade, how533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN666 TYLER v. CAINOpinion of the Courtever. The most he can claim is that, based on the principlesoutlined inTeague, this Court should make Cage retroactiveto cases on collateral review. What is clear, however, is thatwe have not "made"Cage retroactive to cases on collateralreview.6Justice Breyer observes that this Court can make a ruleretroactive over the course of two cases. See post, at 672-673 (dissenting opinion). We do not disagree that, with theright combination of holdings, the Court could do this. Buteven so, the Court has not made Cage retroactive. Multiplecases can render a new rule retroactive only if the holdingsin those cases necessarily dictate retroactivity of the newrule. The only holding inSullivan is that a Cage error isstructural error. There is no second case that held thatall structural-error rules apply retroactively or that allstructural-error rules fit within the second Teague exception.The standard for determining whether an error is structural,see generally Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991),is not coextensive with the second Teague exception,7 and a6 We also reject Tyler's attempt to find support in our disposition inAdams v. Evatt, 511 U. S. 1001 (1994). In Adams, we vacated an opinionof the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which had held that Cagewas not retroactive, and remanded for further consideration in light ofSullivan. Our order, however, was not a "final determination on the merits." Henry v. Rock Hill, 376 U. S. 776, 777 (1964) (per curiam). It simply indicated that, in light of "intervening developments," there was a"reasonable probability" that the Court of Appeals would reject a legalpremise on which it relied and which may affect the outcome of the litigation. Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam).7 As explained above, the second Teague exception is available only ifthe new rule " ` "alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock proceduralelements" ' essential to the fairness of a proceeding." Sawyer v. Smith,497 U. S. 227, 242 (1990) (quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (1989)(plurality opinion), in turn quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667,693 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting inpart) (emphasis added)). Classifying an error as structural does not necessarily alter our understanding of these bedrock procedural elements.Nor can it be said that all new rules relating to due process (or even533US2 Unit: $U86 [10-19-02 15:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN667Cite as: 533 U. S. 656 (2001)Opinion of the Courtholding that a particular error is structural does not logicallydictate the conclusion that the second Teague exception hasbeen met. IIIFinally, Tyler suggests that, if Cage has not been maderetroactive to cases on collateral review, we should make itretroactive today. We disagree. Because Tyler's habeasapplication was his second, the District Court was requiredto dismiss it unless Tyler showed that this Court already hadmade Cage retroactive. $ 2244(b)(4) ("A district court shalldismiss any claim presented in a second or successive appli-cation that the court of appeals has authorized to be filedunless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the re-quirements of this section"); $ 2244(b)(2)(A) ("A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus applicationunder section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless . . . the applicant shows thatthe "fundamental requirements of due process," see post, at 674 (dissenting opinion)) alter such understanding. See, e. g., Sawyer, supra, at 244(holding that the rule in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), didnot fit within the second Teague exception even though it "added to anexisting guarantee of due process protection against fundamental unfairness"); O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 167 (1997) (holding that therule in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), which has beendescribed as serving "one of the hallmarks of due process," id., at 175(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), did not fit within the secondTeague exception). On the contrary, the second Teague exception is reserved only for truly "watershed" rules. See O'Dell, supra, at 167; seealso Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 396 (1994) (describing such rules as"groundbreaking"); Graham v. Collins, 506 U.

S. 484, 495 (1990) (focusing on "primacy and centrality" ofthe rule). As we have recognized, it is unlikely that any of these watershed rules "ha[s] yet to emerge."
