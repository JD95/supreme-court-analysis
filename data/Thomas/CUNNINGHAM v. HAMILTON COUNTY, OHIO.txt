Federal courts of appeals ordinarily have jurisdiction overappeals from "final decisions of the district courts." 28U. S. C. $ 1291. This case presents the question whether anorder imposing sanctions on an attorney pursuant to FederalRule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(4) is a final decision. We holdthat it is not, even where, as here, the attorney no longerrepresents a party in the case.IPetitioner, an attorney, represented Darwin Lee Starcherin a federal civil rights suit filed against respondent andother defendants. Starcher brought the suit after his son,Casey, committed suicide while an inmate at the HamiltonCounty Justice Center.1 The theory of the original com-plaint was that the defendants willfully ignored their duty tocare for Casey despite his known history of suicide attempts.A Magistrate Judge oversaw discovery. On May 29, 1996,petitioner was served with a request for interrogatories anddocuments; responses were due within 30 days after service.See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 33(b)(3), 34(b). This deadline,however, passed without compliance. The Magistrate Judgeordered the plaintiff "by 4:00 p.m. on July 12, 1996 to makefull and complete responses" to defendants' requests for interrogatories and documents and further ordered that fourwitnesses--Rex Smith, Roxanne Dieffenbach, and two individual defendants--be deposed on July 25, 1996. Starcherv. Correctional Medical Systems, Inc., No. C1-95-815 (SDOhio, July 11, 1996), p. 2.Petitioner failed to heed the Magistrate Judge's commands. She did not produce the requested documents, gaveincomplete responses to several of the interrogatories, andobjected to several others. Flouting the Magistrate Judge's1 Starcher died sometime after he initiated the suit, and Casey's sisterbecame the new administrator of Casey's estate.527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN201Cite as: 527 U. S. 198 (1999)Opinion of the Courtorder, she noticed the deposition of Rex Smith on July 22,1996, not July 25, and then refused to withdraw this noticedespite reminders from defendants' counsel. And eventhough the Magistrate Judge had specified that the individual defendants were to be deposed only if plaintiff hadcomplied with his order to produce "full and complete"responses, she filed a motion to compel their appearance.Respondent and other defendants then filed motions for sanctions against petitioner.At a July 19 hearing, the Magistrate Judge granted thedefendants' motions for sanctions. In a subsequent order,he found that petitioner had violated the discovery order anddescribed her conduct as "egregious." App. to Pet. for Cert.9a. Relying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(4), theMagistrate Judge ordered petitioner to pay the HamiltonCounty treasurer $1,494, representing costs and fees incurred by the Hamilton County prosecuting attorney ascounsel for respondent and one individual defendant.2 Hetook care to specify, however, that he had not held a con-tempt hearing and that petitioner was never found to be incontempt of court.The District Court affirmed the Magistrate Judge's sanctions order. The court noted that the matter "ha[d] alreadyconsumed an inordinate amount of the Court's time" and described the Magistrate's job of overseeing discovery as a"task assum[ing] the qualities of a full time occupation."App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a. It found that "[t]he MagistrateJudge did not err in concluding that sanctions were appropriate" and that "the amount of the Magistrate Judge'saward was not contrary to law."Id., at 11a. The DistrictCourt also granted several defendants' motions to disqualifypetitioner as counsel for plaintiff due to the fact that she wasa material witness in the case.2 He also ordered petitioner to pay $2,432 as costs and fees incurred byother defendants in the case. Those sanctions were later satisfied pursuant to a settlement agreement and are not at issue in this appeal.527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN202 CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTYOpinion of the CourtAlthough proceedings in the District Court were ongoing,petitioner immediately appealed the District Court's orderaffirming the Magistrate Judge's sanctions award to theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. TheCourt of Appeals, over a dissent, dismissed the appeal forlack of jurisdiction. Starcher v. Correctional Medical Systems, Inc., 144 F. 3d 418 (1998). It considered whether thesanctions order was immediately appealable under the collat-eral order doctrine, which provides that certain orders maybe appealed, notwithstanding the absence of final judgment,but only when they "are conclusive, . . . resolve importantquestions separate from the merits, and . . . are effectivelyunreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action." Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514U. S. 35, 42 (1995) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial IndustrialLoan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949)). In the Sixth Circuit'sview, these conditions were not satisfied because the issuesinvolved in petitioner's appeal were not "completely separate" from the merits. 144 F. 3d, at 424. As for the factthat petitioner had been disqualified as counsel, the courtheld that "a non-participating attorney, like a participatingattorney, ordinarily must wait until final disposition of theunderlying case before filing an appeal." Id., at 425. Itavoided deciding whether the order was effectively unreviewable absent an immediate appeal but saw "no reasonwhy, after final resolution of the underlying case . . . a sanctioned attorney should be unable to appeal the order imposing sanctions." Ibid.The Federal Courts of Appeals disagree over whether anorder of Rule 37(a) sanctions against an attorney is immediately appealable under $ 1291. Compare, e. g., EasternMaico Distributors, Inc. v. Maico-Fahrzeugfabrik, G.m.b.h.,658 F. 2d 944, 946-951 (CA3 1981) (order not immediatelyappealable), with Telluride Management Solutions, Inc. v.Telluride Investment Group, 55 F. 3d 463, 465 (CA9 1995)(order immediately appealable). We granted a writ of cer527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN203Cite as: 527 U. S. 198 (1999)Opinion of the Courttiorari, limited to this question, 525 U. S. 1098 (1999), andnow affirm.3IISection 1291 of the Judicial Code generally vests courts ofappeals with jurisdiction over appeals from "final decisions"of the district courts. It descends from the Judiciary Act of1789, where "the First Congress established the principlethat only `final judgments and decrees' of the federal districtcourts may be reviewed on appeal."Midland AsphaltCorp. v. United States, 489 U. S. 794, 798 (1989) (quoting 1Stat. 84); see generally Crick, The Final Judgment as a Basisfor Appeal, 41 Yale L. J. 539, 548-551 (1932) (discussing his-tory of final judgment rule in the United States). In accordwith this historical understanding, we have repeatedly inter-preted $ 1291 to mean that an appeal ordinarily will not lieuntil after final judgment has been entered in a case. See,e. g., Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 712(1996); Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511U. S. 863, 867 (1994); Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472U. S. 424, 430 (1985). As we explained in Firestone Tire &Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368 (1981), the final judg-ment rule serves several salutary purposes:"It emphasizes the deference that appellate courts oweto the trial judge as the individual initially called uponto decide the many questions of law and fact that occurin the course of a trial. Permitting piecemeal appealswould undermine the independence of the district judge,as well as the special role that individual plays in ourjudicial system. In addition, the rule is in accordancewith the sensible policy of avoid[ing] the obstruction tojust claims that would come from permitting the harass-ment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from3 Petitioner also sought review of the Sixth Circuit's decision to applyits appealability ruling to petitioner rather than to apply that ruling onlyprospectively. We declined to review this question.527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN204 CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTYOpinion of the Courtthe various rulings to which a litigation may give rise,from its initiation to entry of judgment. The rule alsoserves the important purpose of promoting efficient ju-dicial administration." Id., at 374 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).Consistent with these purposes, we have held that a decisionis not final, ordinarily, unless it " `ends the litigation on themerits and leaves nothing for the court to do but executethe judgment.' "Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517,521-522 (1988) (quotingCatlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229,233 (1945)).The Rule 37 sanction imposed on petitioner neither endedthe litigation nor left the court only to execute its judgment.Thus, it ordinarily would not be considered a final decisionunder $ 1291. See, e. g., Midland Asphalt Corp., supra, at798; Richardson-Merrell, supra, at 430. However, we haveinterpreted the term "final decision" in $ 1291 to permit jurisdiction over appeals from a small category of orders thatdo not terminate the litigation.E. g., Quackenbush, supra,at 711-715; Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v.Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 142-147 (1993); Mitchellv. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524-530 (1985); Cohen, supra, at545-547. "That small category includes only decisions thatare conclusive, that resolve important questions separatefrom the merits, and that are effectively unreviewable onappeal from the final judgment in the underlying action."Swint, supra, at 42.44 Most of our collateral order decisions have considered whether anorder directed at a party to the litigation is immediately appealable. E. g.,Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468-469 (1978). Petitioner,of course, was an attorney representing the plaintiff in the case. It isnevertheless clear that a decision does not automatically become finalmerely because it is directed at someone other than a plaintiff or defendant. See Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424, 434-435 (1985)(rejecting, as outside collateral order doctrine, immediate appeal of orderdisqualifying counsel). For example, we have repeatedly held that a wit527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN205Cite as: 527 U. S. 198 (1999)Opinion of the CourtRespondent conceded that the sanctions order was conclu-sive, Brief in Opposition 11, so at least one of the collateralorder doctrine's conditions is presumed to have been satis-fied. We do not think, however, that appellate review of asanctions order can remain completely separate from themerits. SeeVan Cauwenberghe, supra, at 527-530; Coo-pers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 469 (1978). InVan Cauwenberghe, for example, we held that the denial ofa motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non convenienswas not a final decision. We reasoned that consideration ofthe factors underlying that decision such as "the relativeease of access to sources of proof " and "the availability ofwitnesses" required trial courts to "scrutinize the substanceof the dispute between the parties to evaluate what proof isrequired, and determine whether the pieces of evidence citedby the parties are critical, or even relevant, to the plaintiff 'scause of action and to any potential defenses to the action."486 U. S., at 528. Similarly, inCoopers & Lybrand, we heldthat a determination that an action may not be maintainedas a class action also was not a final decision, noting thatsuch a determination was enmeshed in the legal and factualaspects of the case. 437 U. S., at 469.Much like the orders at issue inVan Cauwenberghe andCoopers & Lybrand, a Rule 37(a) sanctions order often willbe inextricably intertwined with the merits of the action.An evaluation of the appropriateness of sanctions may re-quire the reviewing court to inquire into the importance ofthe information sought or the adequacy or truthfulness of aresponse. See,e. g., Thomas E. Hoar, Inc. v. Sara Lee Corp.,882 F. 2d 682, 687 (CA2 1989) (adequacy of responses); Outleyness subject to a discovery order, but not held in contempt, generallymay not appeal the order. See, e. g., United States Catholic Conferencev. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U. S. 72, 76 (1988); UnitedStates v. Ryan, 402 U. S. 530, 533-534 (1971); Cobbledick v. United States,309 U. S. 323, 327-330 (1940); Webster Coal & Coke Co. v. Cassatt, 207 U. S.181, 186-187 (1907); Alexander v. United States, 201 U. S. 117, 121 (1906).527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN206 CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTYOpinion of the Courtv. New York, 837 F. 2d 587, 590-591 (CA2 1988) (importanceof incomplete answers to interrogatories);Evanson v. UnionOil Company of Cal., 619 F. 2d 72, 74 (Temp. Emerg. Ct.App. 1980) (truthfulness of responses). Some of the sanctions in this case were based on the fact that petitionerprovided partial responses and objections to some of the de-fendants' discovery requests. To evaluate whether thosesanctions were appropriate, an appellate court would have toassess the completeness of petitioner's responses. See Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 37(a)(3) ("For purposes of this subdivision anevasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response is tobe treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond").Such an inquiry would differ only marginally from an inquiryinto the merits and counsels against application of the collateral order doctrine. Perhaps not every discovery sanctionwill be inextricably intertwined with the merits, but we haveconsistently eschewed a case-by-case approach to decidingwhether an order is sufficiently collateral. See, e. g., DigitalEquipment Corp., 511 U. S., at 868; Richardson-Merrell, 472U. S., at 439.Even if the merits were completely divorced from thesanctions issue, the collateral order doctrine requires thatthe order be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a finaljudgment. Petitioner claims that this is the case. In support, she relies on a line of decisions holding that one who isnot a party to a judgment generally may not appeal from it.See, e. g., Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987). She alsoposits that contempt orders imposed on witnesses who disobey discovery orders are immediately appealable and argues that the sanctions order in this case should be treatedno differently.Petitioner's argument suffers from at least two flaws. Itignores the identity of interests between the attorney andclient. Unlike witnesses, whose interests may differ substantially from the parties', attorneys assume an ethical obligation to serve their clients' interests. Evans v. Jeff D., 475527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN207Cite as: 527 U. S. 198 (1999)Opinion of the CourtU. S. 717, 728 (1986). This obligation remains even wherethe attorney might have a personal interest in seeking vindication from the sanctions order. See Richardson-Merrell,supra, at 434-435. In Richardson-Merrell, we held that anorder disqualifying an attorney was not an immediately ap-pealable final decision. 472 U. S., at 429-440; see alsoFlan-agan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259, 263-269 (1984) (orderdisqualifying attorney in criminal case not a "final decision"under $ 1291). We explained that "[a]n attorney who is disqualified for misconduct may well have a personal interestin pursuing an immediate appeal, an interest which neednot coincide with the interests of the client. As a matter ofprofessional ethics, however, the decision to appeal shouldturn entirely on the client's interest." Richardson-Merrell,supra, at 435 (citing ABA Model Rules of Professional Con-duct 1.7(b), 2.1 (1985)). This principle has the same forcewhen an order of discovery sanctions is imposed on the attor-ney alone. See In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings inPetroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 747 F. 2d 1303,1305 (CA9 1984) (Kennedy, J.). The effective congruence ofinterests between clients and attorneys counsels againsttreating attorneys like other nonparties for purposes ofappeal. Cf. United States Catholic Conference v. AbortionRights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U. S. 72, 78 (1988).Petitioner's argument also overlooks the significant differences between a finding of contempt and a Rule 37(a) sanc-tions order. "Civil contempt is designed to force the contemnor to comply with an order of the court." Willy v.Coastal Corp., 503 U. S. 131, 139 (1992). In contrast, a Rule37(a) sanctions order lacks any prospective effect and is notdesigned to compel compliance. Judge Adams captured theessential distinction between the two types of orders whenhe noted that an order such as civil contempt"is not simply to deter harassment and delay, but to ef-fect some discovery conduct. A non-party's interest inresisting a discovery order is immediate and usually sep527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN208 CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTYOpinion of the Courtarate from the parties' interests in delay. Before finaljudgment is reached, the non-party either will have surrendered the materials sought or will have suffered in-carceration or steadily mounting fines imposed to compelthe discovery. If the discovery is held unwarranted onappeal only after the case is resolved, the non-party'sinjury may not be possible to repair. Under Rule 37(a),no similar situation exists. The objective of the Ruleis the prevention of delay and costs to other litigantscaused by the filing of groundless motions. An attorneysanctioned for such conduct by and large suffers no inor-dinate injury from a deferral of appellate considerationof the sanction. He need not in the meantime surrenderany rights or suffer undue coercion." Eastern MaicoDistributors, 658 F. 2d, at 949-950 (citation and foot-note omitted).To permit an immediate appeal from such a sanctions orderwould undermine the very purposes of Rule 37(a), which wasdesigned to protect courts and opposing parties from de-laying or harassing tactics during the discovery process.55 In 1970, the prerequisites for imposing sanctions were redesigned "toencourage judges to be more alert to abuses occurring in the discoveryprocess." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 37(a)(4),28 U. S. C., p. 748. Before 1970, the Rule required a court, after grantinga motion to compel discovery but before imposing sanctions, to find thelosing party to have acted without substantial justification. At that time,courts rarely exercised this authority to impose sanctions. See W. Glaser,Pretrial Discovery and the Adversary System 154 (1968). While theamended Rule retained the substantial justification requirement, theplacement of the requirement was changed so that the Rule provided thatthe district court, upon granting the motion to compel, "shall" impose thesanction unless it found that the losing party's conduct was "substantiallyjustified." The change in placement signaled a shift in presumption aboutthe appropriateness of sanctions for discovery abuses. See Federal Discovery Rules: Effects of the 1970 Amendments, 8 Colum. J. L. & Soc.Probs. 623, 642 (1972) ("The Advisory Committee reversed the presumption in Rule 37(a)(4) in order to encourage the awarding of expenses andfees wherever applicable").527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN209Cite as: 527 U. S. 198 (1999)Opinion of the CourtImmediate appeals of such orders would undermine trialjudges' discretion to structure a sanction in the most effective manner. They might choose not to sanction an attor-ney, despite abusive conduct, in order to avoid further delaysin their proceedings. Not only would such an approach ignore the deference owed by appellate courts to trial judgescharged with managing the discovery process, seeFirestoneTire & Rubber Co., 449 U. S., at 374, it also could forestallresolution of the case as each new sanction would give riseto a new appeal. The result might well be the very sortsof piecemeal appeals and concomitant delays that the finaljudgment rule was designed to prevent.Petitioner finally argues that, even if an attorney ordinarily may not immediately appeal a sanction order, specialconsiderations apply when the attorney no longer representsa party in the case. Like the Sixth Circuit, we do not thinkthat the appealability of a Rule 37 sanction imposed on anattorney should turn on the attorney's continued participation. Such a rule could not be easily administered. Forexample, it may be unclear precisely when representationterminates, and questions likely would arise over when the30-day period for appeal would begin to run under FederalRule of Appellate Procedure 4. The rule also could be subject to abuse if attorneys and clients strategically terminatedtheir representation in order to trigger a right to appealwith a view to delaying the proceedings in the underlyingcase. While we recognize that our application of the finaljudgment rule in this setting may require nonparticipatingattorneys to monitor the progress of the litigation after theirwork has ended, the efficiency interests served by limitingimmediate appeals far outweigh any nominal monitoringcosts borne by attorneys. For these reasons, an attorney'scontinued participation in a case does not affect whether asanctions order is "final" for purposes of $ 1291.We candidly recognize the hardship that a sanctions ordermay sometimes impose on an attorney. Should these hard527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN210 CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTYKennedy, J., concurringships be deemed to outweigh the desirability of restrictingappeals to "final decisions," solutions other than an expansive interpretation of $ 1291's "final decision" requirementremain available. Congress may amend the Judicial Codeto provide explicitly for immediate appellate review ofsuch orders. See,e. g., 28 U. S. C. $$ 1292(a)(1)-(3). Recentamendments to the Judicial Code also have authorized thisCourt to prescribe rules providing for the immediate appealof certain orders, see $$ 1292(e), 2072(c), and "Congress' designation of the rulemaking process as the way to define orrefine when a district court ruling is `final' and when an interlocutory order is appealable warrants the Judiciary's fullrespect."Swint, 514 U. S., at 48 (footnote omitted). Fi-nally, in a particular case, a district court can reduce anyhardship by reserving until the end of the trial decisions suchas whether to impose the sanction, how great a sanction toimpose, or when to order collection.* * *For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that a sanctionsorder imposed on an attorney is not a "final decision" under$ 1291 and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.
