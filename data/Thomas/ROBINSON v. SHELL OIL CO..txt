Section 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964makes it unlawful "for an employer to discriminate againstany of his employees or applicants for employment" whohave either availed themselves of Title VII's protections orassisted others in so doing. 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 42U.

S. 337 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is deter-mined by reference to the language itself, the specific contextin which that language is used, and the broader context ofthe statute as a whole. Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477 (1992); McCarthy v. Bronson, 500U. S. 136, 139 (1991). In this case, consideration of thosefactors leads us to conclude that the term "employees," asused in $ 704(a), is ambiguous as to whether it excludes former employees.At first blush, the term "employees" in $ 704(a) would seemto refer to those having an existing employment relationshipwith the employer in question. Cf.Walters v. MetropolitanEd. Enterprises, Inc., ante, at 207-208 (interpreting theterm "employees" in $ 701(b), 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(b)). Thisinitial impression, however, does not withstand scrutiny inthe context of $ 704(a). First, there is no temporal qualifierin the statute such as would make plain that $ 704(a) protectsonly persons still employed at the time of the retaliation.That the statute could have expressly included the phrase"former employees" does not aid our inquiry. Congress alsocould have used the phrase "current employees." But nowhere in Title VII is either phrase used--even where thespecific context otherwise makes clear an intent to cover current or former employees.2 Similarly, that other statuteshave been more specific in their coverage of "employees" and2 Our recent decision in Walters v. Metropolitan Ed. Enterprises,Inc., ante, p. 202, held that the term "employees" in $ 701(b), 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e(b), referred to those persons with whom an employer has an existing employment relationship. See ante, at 207-208. But $ 701(b) hastwo significant temporal qualifiers. The provision, which delimits TitleVII's coverage, states that the Act applies to any employer "who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or morecalendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year." 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e(b) (emphasis added). The emphasized words specify the timeframe in which the employment relationship must exist, and thus the specific context of that section did not present the particular ambiguity atissue in the present case.519us2$21N 06-03-99 21:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT342 ROBINSON v. SHELL OIL CO.Opinion of the Court"former employees," see, e. g., 2 U. S. C. $ 1301(4) (1994 ed.,Supp. I) (defining "employee" to include "former employee");5 U. S. C. $ 1212(a)(1) (including "employees, former employ-ees, and applicants for employment" in the operative provision), proves only that Congress can use the unqualified term"employees" to refer only to current employees, not that itdid so in this particular statute.Second, Title VII's definition of "employee" likewise lacksany temporal qualifier and is consistent with either currentor past employment. Section 701(f) defines "employee" forpurposes of Title VII as "an individual employed by an employer." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(f ). The argument that theterm "employed," as used in $ 701(f), is commonly used tomean "[p]erforming work under an employer-employee relationship," Black's Law Dictionary 525 (6th ed. 1990), begsthe question by implicitly reading the word "employed" tomean "is employed." But the word "employed" is not solimited in its possible meanings, and could just as easily beread to mean "was employed."Third, a number of other provisions in Title VII use theterm "employees" to mean something more inclusive or different from "current employees." For example, $$ 706(g)(1)and 717(b) both authorize affirmative remedial action (by acourt or EEOC, respectively) "which may include . . . reinstatement or hiring of employees." 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000e-5(g)(1) and 2000e-16(b). As petitioner notes, because onedoes not "reinstat[e]" current employees, that language necessarily refers to former employees. Likewise, one mayhire individuals to be employees, but one does not typicallyhire persons who already are employees.Section 717(b) requires federal departments and agenciesto have equal employment opportunity policies and rules,"which shall include a provision that an employee or applicant for employment shall be notified of any final actiontaken on any complaint of discrimination filed by him thereunder." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(b). If the complaint involves519us2$21N 06-03-99 21:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT343Cite as: 519 U. S. 337 (1997)Opinion of the Courtdiscriminatory discharge, as it often does, the "employee"who must be notified is necessarily a former employee.Similarly, $ 717(c) provides that an "employee or applicantfor employment, if aggrieved by the final disposition of hiscomplaint, . . . may file a civil action . . . ." 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e-16(c). Again, given that discriminatory discharge isa forbidden "personnel actio[n] affecting employees," see$ 717(a), 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(a), the term "employee" in$ 717(c) necessarily includes a former employee. See Loeffler v. Frank, 486 U. S. 549 (1988) (involving a discriminatorydischarge action successfully brought under $ 717 by a former Postal Service employee).3Of course, there are sections of Title VII where, in context,use of the term "employee" refers unambiguously to a cur-rent employee, for example, those sections addressing salaryor promotions. See $ 703(h), 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(h) (allow-ing different standards of compensation for "employees whowork in different locations"); $ 717(b), 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(b) (directing federal agencies to establish a plan "to provide a maximum opportunity for employees to advance so asto perform at their highest potential").But those examples at most demonstrate that the term"employees" may have a plain meaning in the context of aparticular section--not that the term has the same meaningin all other sections and in all other contexts. Once it isestablished that the term "employees" includes former em-ployees in some sections, but not in others, the term standingalone is necessarily ambiguous and each section must be ana3 Other sections also seem to use the term "employees" to mean something other than current employees. Section 701(c) defines "employmentagency" as "any person regularly undertaking . . . to procure employeesfor an employer or to procure for employees opportunities to work foran employer . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(c). This language most naturallyis read to mean "prospective employees."

SHELL OIL CO.Opinion of the Courtlyzed to determine whether the context gives the term afurther meaning that would resolve the issue in dispute.4Respondent argues that the addition of the word "his" be-fore "employees" narrows the scope of the provision. Brieffor Respondent 19. That argument is true, so far as it goes,but it does not resolve the question before us--namely, inwhat time frame must the employment relationship exist.The phrase "his employees" could include "his" formeremployees, but still exclude persons who have never workedfor the particular employer being charged with retaliation.Nor are we convinced by respondent's argument that Congress' inclusion in $ 704(a) of "applicants for employment" aspersons distinct from "employees," coupled with its failureto include "former employees," is evidence of congressionalintent not to include former employees. The use of the term"applicants" in $ 704(a) does not serve to confine, by negativeinference, the temporal scope of the term "employees." Respondent's argument rests on the incorrect premise that theterm "applicants" is equivalent to the phrase "future employees." But the term "applicants" would seem to cover manypersons who will not become employees. Unsuccessful applicants or those who turn down a job offer, for example,would have been applicants, but not future employees. Andthe term fails to cover certain future employees who may beoffered and will accept jobs without having to apply for thosejobs. Because the term "applicants" in $ 704(a) is not synonymous with the phrase "future employees," there is no basisfor engaging in the further (and questionable) negative infer4 Petitioner's examples of non-Title VII cases using the term "employee"to refer to a former employee are largely irrelevant, except to the extentthey tend to rebut a claim that the term "employee" has some intrinsicallyplain meaning. See, e. g., Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U. S. 78, 81, 83 (1971)(unemployed disabled worker); Nash v. Florida Industrial Comm'n, 389U. S. 235, 239 (1967) (individual who had been fired); Flemming v. Nestor,363 U. S. 603, 611 (1960) (retired worker).519us2$21N 06-03-99 21:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT345Cite as: 519 U. S. 337 (1997)Opinion of the Courtence that inclusion of the term "applicants" demonstratesintentional exclusion of former employees.Finally, the use of the term "individual" in $ 704(a), as wellas in $ 703(a), 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a), provides no meaningfulassistance in resolving this case. To be sure, "individual" isa broader term than "employee" and would facially seem tocover a former employee. But it would also encompass apresent employee as well as other persons who have neverhad an employment relationship with the employer at issue.The term "individual," therefore, does not seem designed tocapture former employees, as distinct from current employ-ees, and its use provides no insight into whether the term"employees" is limited only to current employees.BFinding that the term "employees" in $ 704(a) is ambigu-ous, we are left to resolve that ambiguity. The broader context provided by other sections of the statute provides con-siderable assistance in this regard. As noted above, severalsections of the statute plainly contemplate that former em-ployees will make use of the remedial mechanisms of TitleVII. See supra, at 342-343. Indeed, $ 703(a) expressly in-cludes discriminatory "discharge" as one of the unlawful employment practices against which Title VII is directed. 42U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a). Insofar as $ 704(a) expressly protectsemployees from retaliation for filing a "charge" under TitleVII, and a charge under $ 703(a) alleging unlawful dischargewould necessarily be brought by a former employee, it is farmore consistent to include former employees within thescope of "employees" protected by $ 704(a).In further support of this view, petitioner argues that theword "employees" includes former employees because to holdotherwise would effectively vitiate much of the protectionafforded by $ 704(a). See Brief for Petitioner 20-30. Thisis also the position taken by the EEOC. See Brief for519us2$21N 06-03-99 21:52:45 PAGES OPINPGT346 ROBINSON v. SHELL OIL CO.Opinion of the CourtUnited States and EEOC as Amici Curiae 16-25; see also2 EEOC Compliance Manual $ 614.7(f). According to theEEOC, exclusion of former employees from the protection of$ 704(a) would undermine the effectiveness of Title VII byallowing the threat of postemployment retaliation to detervictims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC, andwould provide a perverse incentive for employers to fire em-ployees who might bring Title VII claims. Brief for UnitedStates and EEOC as Amici Curiae 18-21.Those arguments carry persuasive force given their coherence and their consistency with a primary purpose ofantiretaliation provisions: Maintaining unfettered access tostatutory remedial mechanisms. Cf. NLRB v. Scrivener,405 U. S. 117, 121-122 (1972) (National Labor Relations Act);Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288, 292-293 (1960) (Fair Labor Standards Act). The EEOC quitepersuasively maintains that it would be destructive of thispurpose of the antiretaliation provision for an employer tobe able to retaliate with impunity against an entire class ofacts under Title VII--for example, complaints regarding discriminatory termination. We agree with these contentionsand find that they support the inclusive interpretation of"employees" in $ 704(a) that is already suggested by thebroader context of Title VII.IIIWe hold that the term "employees," as used in $ 704(a)of Title VII, is ambiguous as to whether it includes formeremployees. It being more consistent with the broader con-text of Title VII and the primary purpose of $ 704(a), we holdthat former employees are included within $ 704(a)'s cov-erage. Accordingly, the decision of the Fourth Circuit isreversed. It is so ordered.519us2$22Z 04-11-98 09:16:52 PAGES OPINPGT347OCTOBER TERM, 1996SyllabusUNITED STATES v. BROCKAMP, administrator ofthe ESTATE OF McGILL, DECEASEDcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 95-1225. Argued December 3, 1996--Decided February 18, 1997*After the taxpayer in each of these cases paid the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) money he did not owe, he (or his representative) submitted anadministrative refund claim several years past the end of the applicablefiling period set forth in $ 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.Each taxpayer asked the court to extend the statutory period for an"equitable" reason, namely, that he had a mental disability (senility oralcoholism) that caused the delay. Such a reason is not mentioned in$ 6511, but, in both cases, the Ninth Circuit read the statute as if itcontained an implied "equitable tolling" exception. It then applied equity principles to each case, found that those principles justified tollingthe statutory period, and permitted the actions to proceed.Held: Congress did not intend the "equitable tolling" doctrine to apply to$ 6511's time (and related amount) limitations for filing tax refundclaims. The taxpayers misplace their reliance on Irwin v. Departmentof Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 94-96. Even assuming, as they contend, that a tax refund suit and a private restitution suit are sufficientlysimilar to warrant asking Irwin's negatively phrased question--Is theregood reason to believe that Congress did not want the equitable tollingdoctrine to apply in a suit against the Government?--there are strongreasons for answering that question in the Government's favor. Section 6511 sets forth its time limitations in a highly detailed technicalmanner, reiterates them several times in different ways, imposes substantive limitations, and sets forth explicit exceptions to its basic timelimits that do not include "equitable tolling." To read such tolling intothese provisions would require one to assume an implied tolling exception virtually every time a number appears in $ 6511, and would requirethe tolling of that section's substantive limitations on the amount ofrecovery--a kind of tolling for which there is no direct precedent.There are no counterindications of congressional intent. Reading"equitable tolling" into the statute could create serious administrativeproblems by forcing the IRS to respond to, and perhaps litigate, large*Together with United States v.

Klueger argued the cause and filed a brief forrespondents.Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.The two cases before us raise a single question. Cancourts toll, for nonstatutory equitable reasons, the statutorytime (and related amount) limitations for filing tax refundclaims set forth in $ 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of1986? We hold that they cannot.These two cases present similar circumstances. In eachcase a taxpayer initially paid the Internal Revenue Service(IRS) several thousand dollars that he did not owe. In eachcase the taxpayer (or his representative) filed an administra-tive claim for refund several years after the relevant statutory time period for doing so had ended. In each case thetaxpayer suffered a disability (senility or alcoholism), which,he said, explained why the delay was not his fault. And ineach case he asked the court to extend the relevant statutorytime period for an "equitable" reason, namely, the existenceof a mental disability--a reason not mentioned in $ 6511, butwhich, we assume, would permit a court to toll the statutorylimitations period if, but only if, $ 6511 contains an implied519us2$22Q 04-11-98 09:16:52 PAGES OPINPGT349Cite as: 519 U.

Smith Barney, Inc., 83 F. 3d 847, 852(CA7 1996) (defining equitable tolling).In both cases, the Ninth Circuit read $ 6511 as if it didcontain an implied exception that would permit "equitabletolling." It then applied principles of equity to each case.It found those principles justified tolling the statutory timeperiod. And it permitted the actions to proceed. 67 F. 3d260 (1995); judgt. order reported at 70 F. 3d 120 (1995). Allother Circuits that have considered the matter, however,have taken the opposite view. They have held that $ 6511does not authorize equitable tolling. See Amoco ProductionCo. v. Newton Sheep Co., 85 F. 3d 1464 (CA10 1996); Lovettv. United States, 81 F. 3d 143 (CA Fed. 1996); Webb v.

We granted certiorarito resolve this conflict. And we conclude that the latter Circuits are correct.The taxpayers rest their claim for equitable tolling uponIrwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89 (1990),a case in which this Court considered the timeliness of anemployee's lawsuit charging his Government employer withdiscrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil RightsAct of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq. The Court found thelawsuit untimely, but nevertheless tolled the limitations period. It held that the "rule of equitable tolling" applies "tosuits against the Government, in the same way that it is applicable" to Title VII suits against private employers. 498U. S., at 94-95. The Court went on to say that the "samerebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable tosuits against private defendants should also apply to suitsagainst the United States." Id., at 95-96.The taxpayers, pointing to Irwin, argue that principles ofequitable tolling would have applied had they sued private519us2$22Q 04-11-98 09:16:52 PAGES OPINPGT350 UNITED STATES v. BROCKAMPOpinion of the Courtdefendants, e. g., had they sought restitution from private de-fendants for "Money Had and Received." See C. Keigwin,Cases in Common Law Pleading 220 (2d ed. 1934). Theyadd that givenIrwin's language, there must be a "presumption" that limitations periods in tax refund suits against theGovernment can be equitably tolled. And, they say, that"presumption," while "rebuttable," has not been rebutted.They conclude that, given Irwin, the Ninth Circuit correctlytolled the statutory period for "equitable" reasons.In evaluating this argument, we are willing to assume, fa-vorably to the taxpayers but only for argument's sake, thata tax refund suit and a private suit for restitution are sufficiently similar to warrant asking Irwin's negatively phrasedquestion: Is there good reason to believe that Congress didnot want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply? But seeFlora v. United States, 362 U. S. 145, 153-154 (1960) (citingCurtis's Administratrix v. Fiedler, 2 Black 461, 479 (1863))(distinguishing common-law suit against the tax collectorfrom action of assumpsit for money had and received);George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U. S. 373, 382-383(1933); see also Plumb, Tax Refund Suits Against Collectorsof Internal Revenue, 60 Harv. L. Rev. 685, 687 (1947) (describing collector suit as a fiction solely designed to bring theGovernment into court). We can travel no further, however,along Irwin's road, for there are strong reasons for answering Irwin's question in the Government's favor.Section 6511 sets forth its time limitations in unusuallyemphatic form. Ordinarily limitations statutes use fairlysimple language, which one can often plausibly read as containing an implied "equitable tolling" exception. See, e. g.,42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(c) (requiring suit for employment discrimination to be filed "[w]ithin 90 days of receipt of noticeof final [EEOC] action . . . "). But $ 6511 uses language thatis not simple. It sets forth its limitations in a highly detailed technical manner, that, linguistically speaking, cannoteasily be read as containing implicit exceptions. Moreover,519us2$22Q 04-11-98 09:16:52 PAGES OPINPGT351Cite as: 519 U. S. 347 (1997)Opinion of the Court$ 6511 reiterates its limitations several times in several dif-ferent ways. Section 6511 says, first, that a"[c]laim for . . . refund . . . of any tax . . . shall be filedby the taxpayer within 3 years from the time the returnwas filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid,whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed . . . within 2 years from the time the taxwas paid." 26 U. S. C. $ 6511(a).It then says that"[n]o credit or refund shall be allowed or made afterthe expiration of the period of limitation prescribed . . .unless a claim for . . . refund is filed . . . within suchperiod." $ 6511(b)(1).It reiterates the point by imposing substantive limitations:"If the claim was filed by the taxpayer during the 3-year period . . . the amount of the credit or refund shallnot exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period,immediately preceding the filing of the claim, equal to 3years plus the period of any extension of time for filingthe return. . . ." $ 6511(b)(2)(A).And"[i]f the claim was not filed within such 3-year period,the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed theportion of the tax paid during the 2 years immediatelypreceding the filing of the claim." $ 6511(b)(2)(B).The Tax Code reemphasizes the point when it says that re-funds that do not comply with these limitations "shall beconsidered erroneous," $ 6514, and specifies procedures forthe Government's recovery of any such "erroneous" refundpayment. $$ 6532(b), 7405. In addition, $ 6511 sets forthexplicit exceptions to its basic time limits, and those veryspecific exceptions do not include "equitable tolling." See$ 6511(d) (establishing special time limit rules for refunds re519us2$22Q 04-11-98 09:16:52 PAGES OPINPGT352 UNITED STATES v. BROCKAMPOpinion of the Courtlated to operating losses, credit carrybacks, foreign taxes,self-employment taxes, worthless securities, and bad debts);see also United States v. Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 610 (1990)(discussing mitigation provisions set forth in 26 U. S. C.$$ 1311-1314); $ 507 of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 961(temporarily tolling limitations period during wartime).To read an "equitable tolling" provision into these provisions, one would have to assume an implied exception fortolling virtually every time a number appears. To do sowould work a kind of linguistic havoc. Moreover, such aninterpretation would require tolling, not only procedural limitations, but also substantive limitations on the amount ofrecovery--a kind of tolling for which we have found no directprecedent. Section 6511's detail, its technical language, theiteration of the limitations in both procedural and substantive forms, and the explicit listing of exceptions, taken together, indicate to us that Congress did not intend courts toread other unmentioned, open-ended, "equitable" exceptionsinto the statute that it wrote. There are no counterindications. Tax law, after all, is not normally characterizedby case-specific exceptions reflecting individualized equities.The nature of the underlying subject matter--tax collection--underscores the linguistic point. The IRS processesmore than 200 million tax returns each year. It issues morethan 90 million refunds. See Dept. of Treasury, InternalRevenue Service, 1995 Data Book 8-9. To read an "equitable tolling" exception into $ 6511 could create serious administrative problems by forcing the IRS to respond to, and perhaps litigate, large numbers of late claims, accompanied byrequests for "equitable tolling" which, upon close inspection,might turn out to lack sufficient equitable justification. SeeH. R. Conf. Rep. No. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 41 (1926)(deleting provision excusing tax deficiencies in the estates ofinsane or deceased individuals because of difficulties involvedin defining incompetence). The nature and potential magnitude of the administrative problem suggest that Congress519us2$22Q 04-11-98 09:16:52 PAGES OPINPGT353Cite as: 519 U. S. 347 (1997)Opinion of the Courtdecided to pay the price of occasional unfairness in individualcases (penalizing a taxpayer whose claim is unavoidably delayed) in order to maintain a more workable tax enforcementsystem. At the least it tells us that Congress would likelyhave wanted to decide explicitly whether, or just where andwhen, to expand the statute's limitations periods, rather thandelegate to the courts a generalized power to do so wherevera court concludes that equity so requires.The taxpayers' counterrebuttal consists primarily of an interesting historical analysis of the Internal Revenue Code'stax refund provisions. They try to show that $ 6511's specific, detailed language reflects congressional concern aboutmatters not related to equitable tolling. They explain somelanguage, for example, in terms of a congressional effort tostop taxpayers from keeping the refund period open indefinitely through the device of making a series of small taxpayments. See S. Rep. No. 398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 33(1924). They explain other language as an effort to makethe refund time period and the tax assessment period coextensive. See H. R. Rep. No. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 52(1942). Assuming all that is so, however, such congressionalefforts still seem but a smaller part of a larger congressionalobjective: providing the Government with strong statutory"protection against stale demands." Cf. United States v.Garbutt Oil Co., 302 U. S. 528, 533 (1938) (statute of limitations bars untimely amendment of claim for additional refund). Moreover, the history to which the taxpayers pointreveals that $ 6511's predecessor tax refund provisions, like$ 6511, contained highly detailed language with clear timelimits. See, e. g., $ 281(b) of the Revenue Act of 1924, ch. 234,43 Stat. 301 (4-year limit on claims for overpayment of income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax and cap on refundamount); $ 322(b) of the Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, 47 Stat.242 (2-year limit for claim filing and corresponding limit onrefund amount); Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A Stat.808 (adopting current alternative time and amount limita519us2$22Q 04-11-98 09:16:52 PAGES OPINPGT354 UNITED STATES v. BROCKAMPOpinion of the Courttions); see also $ 810 of the Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, 47Stat. 283 (imposing time and amount limits for estate taxrefunds). And that history lacks any instance (but for thepresent cases) of equitable tolling. On balance, these historical considerations help the Government's argument.For these reasons, we conclude that Congress did not intend the "equitable tolling" doctrine to apply to $ 6511's timelimitations.
