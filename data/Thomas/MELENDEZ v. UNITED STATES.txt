The issue here is whether a Government motion attestingto the defendant's substantial assistance in a criminal investigation and requesting that the district court depart belowthe minimum of the applicable sentencing range under theSentencing Guidelines also permits the district court to depart below any statutory minimum sentence. We hold thatit does not.IPetitioner and several others entered into an agreementto buy cocaine from confidential informants of the UnitedStates Customs Service. As a result, petitioner wascharged with conspiring to distribute and to possess withintent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, see$ 406, 84 Stat. 1265, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $ 846, a crimethat carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years'imprisonment, see $ 841(b)(1)(A). Plea negotiations ensued,and petitioner ultimately signed a cooperating plea agreement. The agreement provided, in pertinent part, that inreturn for petitioner's cooperation with the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the Government would "movethe sentencing court, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, to depart from the otherwise applicableguideline range." App. 9. The agreement noted that theoffense to which petitioner would plead guilty "carries a statutory mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment." Id., at 6. The agreement did not require the Government to authorize the District Court to impose a sentencebelow the statutory minimum, nor did it specifically statethat the Government would oppose departure below the statutory minimum.Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charged conspiracy. Theprobation officer determined that the Guideline sentencingrange applicable to petitioner's crime was 135 to 168 months'imprisonment. In a letter to the court, the Government described the assistance rendered by petitioner and moved the518US1$72N 05-18-99 16:09:08 PAGES OPINPGT123Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)Opinion of the Courtcourt to impose "a sentence lower than what the [c]ourt ha[d]determined to be the otherwise applicable [sic] under thesentencing guidelines." Id., at 13-14. The letter specifi-cally noted that "[t]his motion is made pursuant to Section5K1.1." Id., at 13. The Government did not request a sen-tence below the statutory minimum, although, again, it didnot state that the Government opposed such a departure.The District Court granted the Government's motion and departed downward from the sentencing range set by theGuidelines. However, because the Government had not alsomoved the District Court to depart below the statutory mini-mum pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e), the court ruled that ithad no authority to so depart; it thus imposed the 10-yearminimum sentence required by statute.On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Courthad erred in concluding that it had no authority to departbelow the statutory minimum. A $ 5K1.1 motion, he argued,not only allows the court to depart downward from the sentencing level set by the Guidelines but also permits the courtto depart below a lower statutory minimum. See UnitedStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5K1.1,p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). A divided panel of the Court ofAppeals for the Third Circuit rejected that argument andaffirmed the 10-year sentence. 55 F. 3d 130 (1995). A petition for rehearing was denied, with six judges dissenting.As we noted inWade v. United States, 504 U. S. 181, 185(1992), the Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial as-sistance and requesting that the district court depart belowthe minimum of the applicable sentencing range under theGuidelines also permits the district court to depart belowany statutory minimum.11 Compare 55 F. 3d 130 (CA3 1995) and United States v.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWe granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 516 U. S.963 (1995). We now hold that such a motion does not authorize a departure below a lower statutory minimum.IIThe question presented involves two subsections of federalstatutes and a policy statement of the Guidelines. Title 18U. S. C. $ 3553(e) provides:"Limited authority to impose a sentence below a stat-utory minimum.--Upon motion of the Government, thecourt shall have the authority to impose a sentencebelow a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistancein the investigation or prosecution of another personwho has committed an offense. Such sentence shall beimposed in accordance with the guidelines and policystatements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursu-ant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code."Title 28 U. S. C. $ 994(n), in turn, states:"The Commission shall assure that the guidelines re-flect the general appropriateness of imposing a lowersentence than would otherwise be imposed, includinga sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a de-fendant's substantial assistance in the investigation orprosecution of another person who has committed anoffense."Finally, the text of $ 5K1.1 of the Guidelines provides:"Substantial Assistance to Authorities (PolicyStatement)"Upon motion of the government stating that the de-fendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who hascommitted an offense, the court may depart from theguidelines.518US1$72N 05-18-99 16:09:08 PAGES OPINPGT125Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)Opinion of the Court"(a) The appropriate reduction shall be determined bythe court for reasons stated that may include, but arenot limited to, consideration of the following: [List offive factors for the court's consideration, including] thegovernment's evaluation of the assistance rendered."Petitioner argues that $ 5K1.1 creates what he calls a "uni-tary" motion system, in which a motion attesting to the substantial assistance of the defendant and requesting a depar-ture below the Guidelines range also permits a district courtto depart below the statutory minimum.2 The Governmentviews $ 5K1.1 as establishing a binary motion system, whichpermits the Government to authorize a departure below theGuidelines range while withholding from the court the authority to depart below a lower statutory minimum. Theparties argue, naturally, that their respective interpretationsof the system actually adopted by the Sentencing Commis-sion were permissible ones under $ 3553(e) and $ 994(n).3We believe that $ 3553(e) requires a Government motionrequesting or authorizing the district court to "impose asentence below a level established by statute as minimum2 Petitioner also argues for the first time in his reply brief that the pleaagreement into which he entered was at least ambiguous with respect towhether it required the Government to move the District Court to departbelow the statutory minimum--and thus that the agreement itself permitted the court to depart below the 10-year minimum. See Reply Brief forPetitioner 7-8. We do not view this issue as included within the questionupon which we granted certiorari, see Pet. for Cert. 3 ("Did the sentencingcourt have the discretion to depart below the applicable statutory minimum once the United States moved for departure under USSG $ 5K1,without the requirement of a second government departure applicationunder 18 U. S. C. 3553(e)?"), and petitioner appears to concede that itis not, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 15. We therefore decline to address theargument.3 Although it is plain that under $ 994(n), the Commission was at leastauthorized to create a system in which no Government motion of any kindneed be filed before the district court may depart below the Guidelinesminimum, neither party argues that the Commission has created such asystem.518US1$72N 05-18-99 16:09:08 PAGES OPINPGT126 MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsentence" before the court may impose such a sentence. Pe-titioner and his amici repeatedly characterize the motion required by $ 3553(e) as a "motion that substantial assistancehas occurred," Brief for Petitioner 12, a "motion acknowledging the defendant's `substantial assistance,' " id., at 8, and thelike. But the term "motion" generally means "[a]n application made to a court or judge for purpose of obtaining a ruleor order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant." Black's Law Dictionary 1013 (6th ed. 1990).4 Paperssimply "acknowledging" substantial assistance are not sufficient if they do not indicate desire for, or consent to, a sen-tence below the statutory minimum.5Of course, the Government did more than simply "ac-knowledge" substantial assistance here: It moved the courtto impose a sentence below the Guideline range. But weagree with the Government that nothing in $ 3553(e) suggests that a district court has power to impose a sentencebelow the statutory minimum to reflect a defendant's cooperation when the Government has not authorized such a sen-tence, but has instead moved for a departure only from theapplicable Guidelines range. Nor does anything in $ 3553(e)or $ 994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispensewith $ 3553(e)'s motion requirement or, alternatively, "deem"4 See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1254 (2ded. 1987) (defining "motion" in the legal sense as "an application made toa court or judge for an order, ruling, or the like"); Wade v. United States,504 U. S. 181, 187 (1992) ("[Substantial assistance] is a necessary conditionfor [a departure, but] it is not a sufficient one. The Government's decisionnot to move may have been based not on a failure to acknowledge orappreciate [the defendant's] help, but simply on its rational assessment ofthe cost and benefit that would flow from moving").5 We do not mean to imply, of course, that specific language (such as thatquoted in text) or, on the other hand, an express reference to $ 3553(e) isnecessarily required before a court may depart below the statutory minimum. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 5-6, 18, 32, 34 (characterizing the opposingargument in this fashion). But the Government must in some way indicate its desire or consent that the court depart below the statutory minimum before the court may do so.518US1$72N 05-18-99 16:09:08 PAGES OPINPGT127Cite as: 518 U. S. 120 (1996)Opinion of the Courta motion requesting or authorizing different action--such asa departure below the Guidelines minimum--to be a motionauthorizing the district court to depart below the statutoryminimum.Moreover, we do not read $ 5K1.1 as attempting to exercisethis nonexistent authority. Section 5K1.1 says: "Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has pro-vided substantial assistance . . . the court may depart fromthe guidelines," while its Application Note 1 says: "Undercircumstances set forth in 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e) and 28 U. S. C.$ 994(n) . . . substantial assistance . . . may justify a sentencebelow a statutorily required minimum sentence," $ 5K1.1,comment., n. 1. One of the circumstances set forth in$ 3553(e) is, as we have explained previously, that the Government has authorized the court to impose a sentence belowthe statutory minimum.Petitioner and his amici argue that $ 3553(e) requires asentence below the statutory minimum to be imposed in"accordance" with the Guidelines; that $ 994(n) specifically di-rects the Commission to draft a provision covering substantial assistance cases, including cases in which a sentencebelow a statutory minimum is warranted; and that if $ 5K1.1is not read as creating a unitary motion system, then theCommission has improperly failed to meet its obligation,because no other provision of the Guidelines implements$ 3553(e) and $ 994(n). They also argue (1) that the referenceto $ 3553(e) in $ 5K1.1's Application Note 1 indicates that$ 5K1.1 is a "conduit" established by the Commission for "implementation" of $ 3553(e); (2) that Application Note 2's useof the broad term "sentencing reduction," rather than "departure from the guidelines range," supports petitioner'sview that $ 5K1.1 authorizes departures below a statutoryminimum; 6 (3) that Application Note 3 makes sense only on6 Application Note 2 provides in relevant part: "The sentencing reduction for assistance to authorities shall be considered independently of anyreduction for acceptance of responsibility."

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe assumption that the district court retains "full discre-tionary power" over the extent of the sentencing reduction(i. e., the authority to choose any sentence once the Govern-ment makes any motion confirming the defendant's substantial assistance); 7 (4) that the reference to $ 5K1.1 alone(rather than to $ 3553(e)) in USSG $ 2D1.1's Application Note7 further supports petitioner's claim that $ 5K1.1 is a conduitfor implementation of $ 3553(e);8 and (5) that if the factorsdescribed in $ 5K1.1(a) limiting the district court's discretiondo not apply to sentences imposed after the Governmentmoves to depart below the statutory minimum, then thedistrict court's discretion will be wholly unlimited in thosecircumstances.In the Government's view, $ 3553(e) already gives the district court authority to depart below the statutory minimumon motion to do so by the prosecutor. The Governmenturges us to read the last sentence of $ 3553(e), and theinclusion of the phrase "including a sentence that is lowerthan that established by statute as a minimum sentence" in$ 994(n), as merely requiring the Commission to constrain thedistrict court's discretion in choosing a sentence after theGovernment moves to depart below the statutory minimum.The Government contends that the first paragraph of $ 5K1.1does not authorize departures below the statutory minimum,but that $ 5K1.1(a) does apply to sentences imposed after the7 Application Note 3 provides: "Substantial weight should be given tothe government's evaluation of the extent of the defendant's assistance,particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult toascertain."

According tothe Government, the difficulties and gaps referred to by peti-tioner vanish once $ 5K1.1(a) is so construed.We agree with the Government that the relevant parts ofthe statutes merely charge the Commission with constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific sen-tence after the Government moves for a departure below thestatutory minimum.9 Congress did not charge the Commis-sion with "implementing" $ 3553(e)'s Government motionrequirement, beyond adopting provisions constraining thedistrict court's discretion regarding the particular sentenceselected.Although the various relevant Guidelines provisions invoked by the parties could certainly be clearer, we also be-lieve that the Government's interpretation of the currentprovisions is the better one. Section 5K1.1(a) may guide thedistrict court when it selects a sentence below the statutoryminimum, as well as when it selects a sentence below theGuidelines range.10 The Commission has not, however, im9 Notably, $ 3553(e) states that the "sentence" shall be imposed in accordance with the Guidelines and policy statements, not that the "departure"shall occur, or shall be authorized, in accordance with the Guidelines andpolicy statements.10 Section $ 5K1.1(a) may apply of its own force to sentences below thestatutory minimum, see ibid. (providing that the district court shall determine "[t]he appropriate reduction" by applying a nonexhaustive listof factors), and both the reference to $ 3553(e) in $ 5K1.1's ApplicationNote 1 and the reference to $ 5K1.1 in $ 2D1.1's Application Note 7 mayreflect that fact. Or perhaps the phrase "[t]he appropriate reduction" in$ 5K1.1(a) encompasses only departures below the Guidelines range, but518US1$72N 05-18-99 16:09:08 PAGES OPINPGT130 MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtproperly attempted to dispense with or modify the require-ment for a departure below the statutory minimum spelledout in $ 3553(e)--that of a Government motion requesting orauthorizing a departure below the statutory minimum.The Government has made no such motion here. Hence,the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked theauthority to sentence petitioner to less than 10 years'imprisonment. IIIWhat is at stake in the long run is whether the Govern-ment can make a motion authorizing the district court todepart below the Guidelines range but withholding from thedistrict court the power to depart below the statutory minimum. Although the Government contends correctly thatthe Commission does not have authority to "deem" a Government motion that does not authorize a departure below thestatutory minimum to be one that does authorize such a departure, the Government apparently reads $ 994(n) to permitthe Commission to construct a unitary motion system by adjusting the requirements for a departure below the Guidelines minimum--that is, by providing that the district courtmay depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing to authorize the court to depart below thestatutory minimum, if the court finds that to be appropriate.See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-31.We need not decide whether the Commission could createthis second type of unitary motion system, for two reasons.First, even if the Commission had done so, that would nothelp petitioner, since the Government has not authorized adeparture below the statutory minimum here. Second, weagree with the Government that the Commission has notadopted this type of unitary motion system. Neither thethe Application Notes are meant to suggest that the court should alsoconsider the $ 5K1.1(a) factors in the analogous circumstance of a departure below the statutory minimum.518US1$72N 05-18-99 16:09:08 PAGES OPINPGT131Cite as: 518 U.

We do not read this sentence tosay: "Upon motion of the government stating that the de-fendant has provided substantial assistance . . . and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any,the court may depart from the guidelines."
