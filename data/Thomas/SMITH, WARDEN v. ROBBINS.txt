Not infrequently, an attorney appointed to represent anindigent defendant on appeal concludes that an appeal wouldbe frivolous and requests that the appellate court allow himto withdraw or that the court dispose of the case without thefiling of merits briefs. In Anders v. California, 386 U. S.738 (1967), we held that, in order to protect indigent defendants' constitutional right to appellate counsel, courts mustsafeguard against the risk of granting such requests in caseswhere the appeal is not actually frivolous. We found inade-quate California's procedure--which permitted appellatecounsel to withdraw upon filing a conclusory letter statingthat the appeal had "no merit" and permitted the appellatecourt to affirm the conviction upon reaching the same conclu-sion following a review of the record.

S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Courtforth an acceptable procedure. California has since adopteda new procedure, which departs in some respects from theone that we delineated in Anders. The question is whetherthat departure is fatal. We hold that it is not. The procedure we sketched in Anders is a prophylactic one; the Statesare free to adopt different procedures, so long as those procedures adequately safeguard a defendant's right to appellatecounsel.IAUnder California's new procedure, established in People v.Wende, 25 Cal. 3d 436, 441-442, 600 P. 2d 1071, 1074-1075(1979), and followed in numerous cases since then, see, e. g.,People v. Rowland, 75 Cal. App. 4th 61, 63, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d900, 901 (1999), counsel, upon concluding that an appealwould be frivolous, files a brief with the appellate court thatsummarizes the procedural and factual history of the case,with citations of the record. He also attests that he has reviewed the record, explained his evaluation of the case to hisclient, provided the client with a copy of the brief, and informed the client of his right to file a pro se supplementalbrief. He further requests that the court independently examine the record for arguable issues. Unlike under the Anders procedure, counsel following Wende neither explicitlystates that his review has led him to conclude that an appealwould be frivolous (although that is considered implicit, seeWende, 25 Cal. 3d, at 441-442, 600 P. 2d, at 1075) nor requestsleave to withdraw. Instead, he is silent on the merits of thecase and expresses his availability to brief any issues onwhich the court might desire briefing. See generally id., at438, 441-442, 600 P. 2d, at 1072, 1074-1075.The appellate court, upon receiving a "Wende brief," must"conduct a review of the entire record," regardless ofwhether the defendant has filed a pro se brief. Id., at 441-442, 600 P. 2d, at 1074-1075. The California Supreme Court528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN266 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courtin Wende required such a thorough review notwithstandinga dissenting Justice's argument that it was unnecessary andexceeded the review that a court performs under Anders.See 25 Cal. 3d, at 444-445, 600 P. 2d, at 1077 (Clark, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part); see also id., at444, 600 P. 2d, at 1076 ("The precise holding in Anders wasthat a `no merit' letter . . . `was not enough.' . . . Just whatis `enough' is not clear, but the majority of the court in thatcase did not require an appellate court to function as co-counsel"). If the appellate court, after its review of the record pursuant to Wende, also finds the appeal to be frivolous,it may affirm. Seeid., at 443, 600 P. 2d, at 1076 (majorityopinion). If, however, it finds an arguable (i. e., nonfrivolous) issue, it orders briefing on that issue. Id., at 442, n. 3,600 P. 2d, at 1075, n. 3.1BIn 1990, a California state-court jury convicted respondentLee Robbins of second-degree murder (for fatally shootinghis former roommate) and of grand theft of an automobile(for stealing a truck that he used to flee the State after com-mitting the murder). Robbins was sentenced to 17 years tolife. He elected to represent himself at trial, but on appeal1 In addition to this double review and double determination of frivolity,California affords a third layer of review, through the California AppellateProjects, described in a recent opinion by the California Court of Appealfor the First District:"[The appellate projects] are under contract to the court; their contractual duties include review of the records to assist court-appointed counselin identifying issues to brief. If the court-appointed counsel can find nomeritorious issues to raise and decides to file a Wende brief, an appellateproject staff attorney reviews the record again to determine whether aWende brief is appropriate. Thus, by the time the Wende brief is filed inthe Court of Appeal, the record in the case has been reviewed both by thecourt-appointed counsel (who is presumably well qualified to handle thecase) and by an experienced attorney on the staff of [the appellate project]." People v. Hackett, 36 Cal. App. 4th 1297, 1311, 43 Cal. Rptr. 2d 219,228 (1995).528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN267Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Courthe received appointed counsel. His appointed counsel, con-cluding that an appeal would be frivolous, filed with the California Court of Appeal a brief that complied with the Wendeprocedure.2 Robbins also availed himself of his right underWende to file a pro se supplemental brief, filing a brief inwhich he contended that there was insufficient evidence tosupport his conviction and that the prosecutor violatedBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), by failing to discloseexculpatory evidence.The California Court of Appeal, agreeing with counsel'sassessment of the case, affirmed. The court explained thatit had "examined the entire record" and had, as a result,concluded both that counsel had fully complied with his responsibilities under Wende and that "no arguable issuesexist." App. 39. The court added that the two issues thatRobbins raised in his supplemental brief had no support inthe record.Ibid. The California Supreme Court deniedRobbins' petition for review.After exhausting state postconviction remedies, Robbinsfiled in the United States District Court for the Central District of California the instant petition for a writ of habeascorpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.3 Robbins renewed hisBrady claim, argued that the state trial court had erred bynot allowing him to withdraw his waiver of his right to trialcounsel, and added nine other claims of trial error. In addition, and most importantly for present purposes, he claimedthat he had been denied effective assistance of appellatecounsel because his appellate counsel's Wende brief failed tocomply with Anders v. California, 386 U. S., at 744. Anders2 Before filing his Wende brief, counsel consulted with the CaliforniaAppellate Project for the Second District Court of Appeal and receivedits permission to file such a brief. App. 43.3 The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat.1214, which amended $ 2254 and related provisions, does not apply to respondent's habeas petition, since he filed his petition before that Act's effective date of April 24, 1996. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997).528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN268 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courtset forth a procedure for an appellate counsel to follow inseeking permission to withdraw from the representationwhen he concludes that an appeal would be frivolous; thatprocedure includes the requirement that counsel file a brief"referring to anything in the record that might arguably sup-port the appeal,"ibid.The District Court agreed with Robbins' last claim, concluding that there were at least two issues that, pursuant toAnders, counsel should have raised in his brief (in a Wendebrief, as noted above, counsel is not required to raise issues):first, whether the prison law library was adequate for Robbins' needs in preparing his defense after he elected to dismiss his appointed counsel and proceed pro se at trial, and,second, whether the trial court erred in refusing to allowhim to withdraw his waiver of counsel. The District Courtdid not attempt to determine the likelihood that either ofthese two issues would have prevailed in an appeal. Rather,it simply concluded that, in the language of the Anders procedure, these issues "might arguably" have "support[ed]the appeal," App. 51, n. 6 (citing Anders), and thus that Robbins' appellate counsel, by not including them in his brief,deviated from the procedure set forth in Anders. The courtconcluded that such a deviation amounted to deficient performance by counsel. In addition, rather than requiringRobbins to show that he suffered prejudice from this deficient performance, the District Court applied a presumptionof prejudice. App. 49. Thus, based simply on a finding thatappellate counsel's brief was inadequate under Anders, theDistrict Court ordered California to grant respondent a newappeal within 30 days or else release him from custody.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitagreed with the District Court on the Anders issue. In theNinth Circuit's view, Anders, together with Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963), which held that States must provide appointed counsel to indigent criminal defendants onappeal, "set forth the exclusive procedure through which ap528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN269Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpointed counsel's performance can pass constitutional mus-ter." 152 F. 3d 1062, 1066 (1998). Rejecting petitioner's argument that counsel's brief was sufficient because it compliedwith Wende, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the brief wasdeficient because it did not, as the Anders procedure re-quires, identify any legal issues that arguably could havesupported the appeal. 152 F. 3d, at 1066-1067.4 The courtdid not decide whether a counsel's deviation fromAnders,standing alone, would warrant a new appeal, see 152 F. 3d,at 1066-1067, but rather concluded that the District Court'saward of relief was proper because counsel had failed to briefthe two arguable issues that the District Court identified.The Ninth Circuit remanded, however, for the District Courtto consider respondent's 11 claims of trial error. Id., at 1069.The court reasoned that if Robbins prevailed on any of theseclaims, it would be unnecessary to order the California Courtof Appeal to grant a new direct appeal. We granted certiorari. 526 U. S. 1003 (1999).IIAIn Anders, we reviewed an earlier California procedure forhandling appeals by convicted indigents. Pursuant to thatprocedure, Anders' appointed appellate counsel had filed aletter stating that he had concluded that there was "no meritto the appeal," 386 U. S., at 739-740. Anders, in response,sought new counsel; the State Court of Appeal denied therequest, and Anders filed a pro se appellate brief. Thatcourt then issued an opinion that reviewed the four claims inhis pro se brief and affirmed, finding no error (or no prejudi-cial error).People v. Anders, 167 Cal. App. 2d 65, 333 P. 2d4 In subsequent cases, the Ninth Circuit has reiterated its view that theWende procedure is unconstitutional because it differs from the Andersprocedure. See Delgado v. Lewis, 181 F. 3d 1087, 1090, 1093, stay grantedpending disposition of pet. for cert., 527 U. S. 1066 (1999); Davis v. Kramer,167 F. 3d 494, 496, 497-498 (1999), cert. pending, No. 98-1427.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN270 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Court854 (1959). Anders thereafter sought a writ of habeas cor-pus from the State Court of Appeal, which denied relief, explaining that it had again reviewed the record and had foundthe appeal to be " `without merit.' " Anders, 386 U. S., at740 (quoting unreported memorandum opinion).We held that "California's action does not comport withfair procedure and lacks that equality that is required by theFourteenth Amendment."Id., at 741. We placed the casewithin a line of precedent beginning with Griffin v. Illinois,351 U. S. 12 (1956), and continuing with Douglas, supra, thatimposed constitutional constraints on States when theychoose to create appellate review.5 In finding the Californiaprocedure to have breached these constraints, we comparedit to other procedures we had found invalid and to statutoryrequirements in the federal courts governing appeals by indigents with appointed counsel. Anders, supra, at 741-743.We relied in particular on Ellis v. United States, 356 U. S.674 (1958) (per curiam), a case involving federal statutoryrequirements, and quoted the following passage from it:" `If counsel is convinced, after conscientious investiga-tion, that the appeal is frivolous, of course, he may askto withdraw on that account. If the court is satisfiedthat counsel has diligently investigated the possiblegrounds of appeal, and agrees with counsel's evaluationof the case, then leave to withdraw may be allowed andleave to appeal may be denied.' " Anders, supra, at741-742 (quotingEllis, supra, at 675).In Anders, neither counsel, the state appellate court on di-rect appeal, nor the state habeas courts had made any findingof frivolity.6 We concluded that a finding that the appeal5 The Constitution does not, however, require States to create appellatereview in the first place. See, e. g., Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 606(1974) (citing McKane v. Durston, 153 U. S. 684, 687 (1894)).6 The same was true in Ellis itself. See Ellis v. United States, 249F. 2d 478, 480-481 (CADC 1957) (Washington, J., dissenting) ("Counsel . . .concluded that the rulings of the District Court were not `so clearly erro528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN271Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Courthad "no merit" was not adequate, because it did not meanthat the appeal was so lacking in prospects as to be "frivolous": "We cannot say that there was a finding of frivolity byeither of the California courts or that counsel acted in anygreater capacity than merely as amicus curiae which wascondemned in Ellis." 386 U. S., at 743.Having rejected the California procedure, we proceeded,in a final, separate section, to set out what would be an acceptable procedure for treating frivolous appeals:"[I]f counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, aftera conscientious examination of it, he should so advise thecourt and request permission to withdraw. That re-quest must, however, be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably sup-port the appeal. A copy of counsel's brief should befurnished the indigent and time allowed him to raise anypoints that he chooses; the court--not counsel--thenproceeds, after a full examination of all the proceedings,to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous. If it sofinds it may grant counsel's request to withdraw and dis-miss the appeal insofar as federal requirements are concerned, or proceed to a decision on the merits, if statelaw so requires. On the other hand, if it finds any ofthe legal points arguable on their merits (and thereforenot frivolous) it must, prior to decision, afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal." Id.,at 744.We then concluded by explaining how this procedure wouldbe better than the California one that we had found deficient.Among other things, we thought that it would "induce thecourt to pursue all the more vigorously its own review because of the ready references not only to the record but alsoneous as to constitute probable error.' . . . Where, as here, there was afairly arguable question, counsel should have proceeded to present argument"), vacated and remanded, 356 U. S. 674 (1958) (per curiam).528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN272 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courtto the legal authorities as furnished it by counsel." Id., at745.BThe Ninth Circuit ruled that this final section of Anders,even though unnecessary to our holding in that case, wasobligatory upon the States. We disagree. We have neverso held; we read our precedents to suggest otherwise; andthe Ninth Circuit's view runs contrary to our establishedpractice of permitting the States, within the broad boundsof the Constitution, to experiment with solutions to difficultquestions of policy.In McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wis., Dist. 1, 486 U. S.429 (1988), we rejected a challenge to Wisconsin's variationon the Anders procedure. Wisconsin had departed fromAnders by requiring Anders briefs to discuss why each issueraised lacked merit. The defendant argued that this rulewas contrary to Anders and forced counsel to violate his ethical obligations to his client. We, however, emphasized thatthe right to appellate representation does not include a rightto present frivolous arguments to the court, 486 U. S., at 436,and, similarly, that an attorney is "under an ethical obligation to refuse to prosecute a frivolous appeal," ibid. (footnoteomitted). Anders, we explained, merely aims to "assure thecourt that the indigent defendant's constitutional rights havenot been violated." 486 U. S., at 442. Because the Wisconsin procedure adequately provided such assurance, we foundno constitutional violation, notwithstanding its variance fromAnders. See 486 U. S., at 442-444. We did, in McCoy, de-scribe the procedure at issue as going "one step further"than Anders, McCoy, supra, at 442, thus suggesting that Anders might set a mandatory minimum, but we think this de-scription of the Wisconsin procedure questionable, since itprovided less effective advocacy for an indigent--in at leastone respect--than does the Anders procedure. The Wisconsin procedure, by providing for one-sided briefing by counselagainst his own client's best claims, probably made a court528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN273Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Courtmore likely to rule against the indigent than if the court hadsimply received anAnders brief.In Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987), we ex-plained that theAnders procedure is not "an independentconstitutional command," but rather is just "a prophylacticframework" that we established to vindicate the constitutional right to appellate counsel announced in Douglas. 481U. S., at 555. We did not say that our Anders procedurewas theonly prophylactic framework that could adequatelyvindicate this right; instead, by making clear that the Consti-tution itself does not compel theAnders procedure, we suggested otherwise. Similarly, in Penson v. Ohio, 488 U. S. 75(1988), we described Anders as simply erecting "safeguards."488 U. S., at 80.It is true that in Penson we used some language suggesting that Anders is mandatory upon the States, see 488 U. S.,at 80-82, but that language was not necessary to the decisionwe reached. We had no reason in Penson to determinewhether the Anders procedure was mandatory, because theprocedure at issue clearly failed under Douglas, see infra, at280. Further, counsel's action in Penson was closely analogous to the action of counsel that we found invalid in Anders,see Penson, supra, at 77-78, so there was no need to rely onthe Anders procedure, as opposed to just the Anders holding,to find counsel's action improper. See 488 U. S., at 77 ("Thequestion presented by this case is remarkably similar [to theone presented in Anders] and therefore requires a similaranswer").Finally, any view of the procedure we described in the lastsection of Anders that converted it from a suggestion intoa straitjacket would contravene our established practice,rooted in federalism, of allowing the States wide discretion,subject to the minimum requirements of the FourteenthAmendment, to experiment with solutions to difficult problems of policy. In Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12 (1956),which we invoked as the foundational case for our holding528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courtin Anders, see Anders, 386 U. S., at 741, we expressly dis-claimed any pretensions to rulemaking authority for theStates in the area of indigent criminal appeals. We imposedno broad rule or procedure but merely held unconstitutionalIllinois' requirement that indigents pay a fee to receive atrial transcript that was essential for bringing an appeal.Justice Frankfurter, who provided the necessary fifth votefor the holding inGriffin, emphasized that it was not for thisCourt "to tell Illinois what means are open to the indigentand must be chosen. Illinois may prescribe any means thatare within the wide area of its constitutional discretion" and"may protect itself so that frivolous appeals are not subsi-dized and public moneys not needlessly spent." 351 U. S.,at 24 (opinion concurring in judgment). He added that whilea State could not "bolt the door to equal justice," it also wasnot obliged to "support a wasteful abuse of the appellateprocess." Ibid. The Griffin plurality shared this view, explaining that the Court was not holding "that Illinois mustpurchase a stenographer's transcript in every case where adefendant cannot buy it. The Supreme Court [of Illinois]may find other means of affording adequate and effectiveappellate review to indigent defendants." Id., at 20.In a related context, we stated this basic principle of federalism in the very Term in which we decided Anders. Weemphatically reaffirmed that the Constitution "has neverbeen thought [to] establish this Court as a rule-making organfor the promulgation of state rules of criminal procedure."Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 564 (1967) (citing, inter alia,Griffin, supra). Accord, Medina v. California, 505 U. S.437, 443-444, 447-448 (1992). Justice Stewart, concurring inSpencer, explained further:"If the Constitution gave me a roving commission toimpose upon the criminal courts of Texas my own notions of enlightened policy, I would not join the Court'sopinion. . . . [But] [t]he question is whether those procedures fall below the minimum level the Fourteenth528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN275Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the CourtAmendment will tolerate. Upon that question, I amconstrained to join the opinion and judgment of theCourt." 385 U. S., at 569.We have continued to reiterate this principle in recent years.SeeFinley, 481 U. S., at 559 (refusing to accept the premisethat "when a State chooses to offer help to those seekingrelief from convictions, the Federal Constitution dictates theexact form such assistance must assume"); ibid. (explainingthat States have "substantial discretion to develop and im-plement programs to aid prisoners seeking to secure postconviction review"); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 13(1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[N]or does it seem to methat the Constitution requires the States to follow any particular federal model in [postconviction] proceedings. . . .States [have] considerable discretion"); id., at 14 (Kennedy,J., concurring in judgment) ("[J]udicial imposition of a categorical remedy . . . might pretermit other responsible solu-tions being considered in Congress and state legislatures").Although Finley and Murray involved postconviction pro-ceedings (in which there is no constitutional right to counsel)rather than direct appeal, we think, as the language of Griffin suggests, that the principle is the same in both contexts.For in Griffin, as here, there was an underlying constitutional right at issue.In short, it is more in keeping with our status as a court,and particularly with our status as a court in a federal sys-tem, to avoid imposing a single solution on the States fromthe top down. We should, and do, evaluate state proceduresone at a time, as they come before us, seeMurray, supra,at 14, while leaving "the more challenging task of craftingappropriate procedures . . . to the laboratory of the States inthe first instance," Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,497 U. S. 261, 292 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (citationand internal quotation marks omitted). We will not cavalierly "imped[e] the States' ability to serve as laboratoriesfor testing solutions to novel legal problems."Arizona v.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN276 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the CourtEvans, 514 U. S. 1, 24 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Ac-cordingly, we hold that the Anders procedure is merely onemethod of satisfying the requirements of the Constitution forindigent criminal appeals. States may--and, we are confident, will--craft procedures that, in terms of policy, are su-perior to, or at least as good as, that in Anders. The Constitution erects no barrier to their doing so.7IIIHaving determined that California's Wende procedure isnot unconstitutional merely because it diverges from the Anders procedure, we turn to consider the Wende procedure onits own merits. We think it clear that California's systemdoes not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, for it provides"a criminal appellant pursuing a first appeal as of right [the]minimum safeguards necessary to make that appeal `ade-quate and effective,' " Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 392(1985) (quoting Griffin, 351 U. S., at 20 (plurality opinion)).AAs we have admitted on numerous occasions, " `[t]he pre-cise rationale for the Griffin and Douglas lines of cases hasnever been explicitly stated, some support being derivedfrom the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and some from the Due Process Clause of that Amend-ment.' " Evitts, supra, at 403 (quoting Ross v. Moffitt, 417U. S. 600, 608-609 (1974) (footnote omitted)). But our caselaw reveals that, as a practical matter, the two Clauseslargely converge to require that a State's procedure "affor[d]adequate and effective appellate review to indigent defendants," Griffin, 351 U. S., at 20 (plurality opinion). A State'sprocedure provides such review so long as it reasonably en7 States have, in fact, already been doing this to some degree.

California, 372 U. S. 353, 357 (1963).528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN278 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the CourtState to "protect itself so that frivolous appeals are not sub-sidized and public moneys not needlessly spent," Griffin,supra, at 24 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment). Foralthough, under Douglas, indigents generally have a right tocounsel on a first appeal as of right, it is equally true thatthis right does not include the right to bring a frivolous appeal and, concomitantly, does not include the right to counselfor bringing a frivolous appeal.10 See McCoy, 486 U. S., at436-438; Douglas, supra, at 357; see also United States v.Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656, n. 19 (1984) ("Of course, the SixthAmendment does not require that [trial] counsel do what isimpossible or unethical"); cf. Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157,175 (1986) (no violation of Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel refuses toviolate ethical duty not to assist his client in presenting perjured testimony). To put the point differently, an indigentdefendant who has his appeal dismissed because it is frivolous has not been deprived of "a fair opportunity" to bringhis appeal,Evitts, supra, at 405; see Finley, 481 U. S., at 556,for fairness does not require either counsel or a full appealonce it is properly determined that an appeal is frivolous.The obvious goal of Anders was to prevent this limitation onthe right to appellate counsel from swallowing the right it-self, see Penson, 488 U. S., at 83-84; McCoy, supra, at 444,and we do not retreat from that goal today.BWe think the Wende procedure reasonably ensures that anindigent's appeal will be resolved in a way that is related to10 This distinction gives meaning to our previous emphasis on an indigent appellant's right to "advocacy." Although an indigent whose appealis frivolous has no right to have an advocate make his case to the appellatecourt, such an indigent does, in all cases, have the right to have an attorney, zealous for the indigent's interests, evaluate his case and attempt todiscern nonfrivolous arguments. See Ellis, 356 U. S., at 675; Anders v.California, 386 U. S. 738, 741-743 (1967).528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN279Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthe merit of that appeal. Whatever its strengths or weak-nesses as a matter of policy, we cannot say that it fails toafford indigents the adequate and effective appellate reviewthat the Fourteenth Amendment requires. A comparison ofthe Wende procedure to the procedures evaluated in ourchief cases in this area makes this evident.The Wende procedure is undoubtedly far better than thoseprocedures we have found inadequate. Anders itself, in dis-approving the former California procedure, chiefly relied onthree precedents: Ellis v. United States, 356 U. S. 674 (1958)(per curiam), Eskridge v. Washington Bd. of Prison Termsand Paroles, 357 U. S. 214 (1958) (per curiam), and Lane v.Brown, 372 U. S. 477 (1963). See Anders, 386 U. S., at 741-743. Although we did not, in Anders, explain in detail whythe California procedure was inadequate under each of theseprecedents, our particularly heavy reliance on Ellis makesclear that a significant factor was that the old California procedure did not require either counsel or the court to determine that the appeal was frivolous; instead, the procedurerequired only that they determine that the defendant wasunlikely to prevail on appeal. Compare Anders, supra, at741-742 (" `If counsel is convinced, after conscientious investigation, that the appeal is frivolous, of course, he may askto withdraw . . . . If the court . . . agrees with counsel'sevaluation of the case, then leave to withdraw may be allowed and leave to appeal may be denied' " (quoting Ellis,supra, at 675)), with Anders, supra, at 743 ("We cannot saythat there was a finding of frivolity"). See also McCoy,supra, at 437 (quoting same passage from Ellis that wequoted in Anders). This problem also appears to have beenone of the flaws in the procedures at issue in Eskridge andLane. The former involved a finding only that there hadbeen " `no grave or prejudicial errors' " at trial, Anders,supra, at 742 (quoting Eskridge, supra, at 215), and the latter, a finding only that the appeal " `would be unsuccessful,' "Anders, supra, at 743 (quoting Lane, supra, at 482). Wende,528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN280 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courtby contrast, requires both counsel and the court to find theappeal to be lacking in arguable issues, which is to say, frivolous. See 25 Cal. 3d, at 439, 441-442, 600 P. 2d, at 1073, 1075;seeid., at 441, 600 P. 2d, at 1074 (reading Anders as findingold California procedure deficient largely "because the courtitself did not make an express finding that the appeal wasfrivolous").An additional problem with the old California procedurewas that it apparently permitted an appellate court to allowcounsel to withdraw and thereafter to decide the appealwithout appointing new counsel. SeeAnders, supra, at 740,n. 2. We resolved any doubt on this point in Penson, wherewe struck down a procedure that allowed counsel to withdraw before the court had determined whether counsel'sevaluation of the case was accurate, 488 U. S., at 82-83, and,in addition, allowed a court to decide the appeal withoutcounsel even if the court found arguable issues, id., at 83(stating that this latter flaw was the "[m]ost significan[t]"one). Thus, the Penson procedure permitted a basic violation of the Douglas right to have counsel until a case is determined to be frivolous and to receive a merits brief for anonfrivolous appeal. See 488 U. S., at 88 ("[I]t is importantto emphasize that the denial of counsel in this case left petitioner completely without representation during the appellate court's actual decisional process"); ibid. (defendant was"entirely without the assistance of counsel on appeal"). Cf.McCoy, supra, at 430-431, n. 1 (approving procedure underwhich appellate court first finds appeal to be frivolous andaffirms, then relieves counsel). Under Wende, by contrast,Douglas violations do not occur, both because counsel doesnot move to withdraw and because the court orders briefingif it finds arguable issues. See Wende, supra, at 442, n. 3,600 P. 2d, at 1075, n. 3; see also, e. g., Rowland, 75 Cal. App.3d, at 61-62, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 900-901.In Anders, we also disapproved the old California procedure because we thought that a one-paragraph letter from528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN281Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Courtcounsel stating only his "bare conclusion" that the appeal hadno merit was insufficient. 386 U. S., at 742. It is unclearfrom our opinion in Anders how much our objection on thispoint was severable from our objection to the lack of a finding of frivolity, because we immediately followed our description of counsel's "no merit" letter with a discussion of Ellis,Eskridge, and Lane, and the lack of such a finding. See 386U. S., at 742-743. In any event, the Wende brief providesmore than a one-paragraph "bare conclusion." Counsel'ssummary of the case's procedural and factual history, withcitations of the record, both ensures that a trained legal eyehas searched the record for arguable issues and assists thereviewing court in its own evaluation of the case.Finally, an additional flaw with the procedures in Eskridgeand Lane was that there was only one tier of review--bythe trial judge in Eskridge (who understandably had littleincentive to find any error warranting an appeal) and by thepublic defender in Lane. See Anders, supra, at 742-743.The procedure in Douglas itself was, in part, flawed for thesame reason. See 372 U. S., at 354-355. The Wende procedure, of course, does not suffer from this flaw, for it providesat least two tiers of review.Not only does the Wende procedure far exceed those procedures that we have found invalid, but it is also at least comparable to those procedures that we have approved. Turning first to the procedure we set out in the final section ofAnders, we note that it has, from the beginning, faced " `consistent and severe criticism.' " In re Sade C., 13 Cal. 4th952, 979, n. 7, 920 P. 2d 716, 731, n. 7 (1996) (quoting Note, 67Texas L. Rev. 181, 212 (1988)). One of the most consistentcriticisms, one with which we wrestled in McCoy, is that Anders is in some tension both with counsel's ethical duty as anofficer of the court (which requires him not to present frivolous arguments) and also with his duty to further his client'sinterests (which might not permit counsel to characterize his528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN282 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courtclient's claims as frivolous).11 California, through the Wendeprocedure, has made a good-faith effort to mitigate this problem by not requiring the Wende brief to raise legal issuesand by not requiring counsel to explicitly describe the caseas frivolous. See Wende, 25 Cal. 3d, at 441-442, 600 P. 2d,at 1074-1075.Another criticism of the Anders procedure has been thatit is incoherent and thus impossible to follow. Those makingthis criticism point to our language in Anders suggestingthat an appeal could be both "wholly frivolous" and at thesame time contain arguable issues, even though we also saidthat an issue that was arguable was "therefore not frivolous." Anders, supra, at 744.12 In other words, the Andersprocedure appears to adopt gradations of frivolity and to usetwo different meanings for the phrase "arguable issue."The Wende procedure attempts to resolve this problem aswell, by drawing the line at frivolity and by defining arguable issues as those that are not frivolous.1311 As one former public defender has explained, "an attorney confrontedwith the Anders situation has to do something that the Code of Professional Responsibility describes as unethical; the only choice is as to whichcanon he or she prefers to violate." Pengilly, Never Cry Anders: TheEthical Dilemma of Counsel Appointed to Pursue a Frivolous CriminalAppeal, 9 Crim. Justice J. 45, 64 (1986). See also, e. g., Commonwealth v.Moffett, 383 Mass. 201, 206, 418 N. E. 2d 585, 590 (1981) (Anders requiresa "Janus-faced approach" by counsel); Hermann, Frivolous Criminal Appeals, 47 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 701, 711 (1972).12 Justice Stewart, in his dissent in Anders, was the first to make thiscriticism of the procedure set out by the Anders majority: "[I]f the recorddid present any such `arguable' issues, the appeal would not be frivolous."386 U. S., at 746; see id., at 746, n. See also, e. g., C. Wolfram, ModernLegal Ethics 817 (1986) ("The Anders directives are confusing, if notcontradictory").13 See supra, at 279-280. A further criticism of Anders has been thatit is unjust. More particularly, critics have claimed that, in setting outthe Anders procedure, we were oblivious to the problem of scarce resources (with regard to both counsel and courts) and, as a result, crafteda rule that diverts attention from meritorious appeals of indigents andensures poor representation for all indigents. See, e. g., Pritchard, Auc528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN283Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the CourtFinally, the Wende procedure appears to be, in some ways,better than the one we approved in McCoy and, in otherways, worse. On balance, we cannot say that the latter,assuming, arguendo, that they outweigh the former, do sosufficiently to make the Wende procedure unconstitutional.The Wisconsin procedure we evaluated in McCoy, whichrequired counsel filing an Anders brief to explain why theissues he raised in his brief lacked merit, arguably exacerbated the ethical problem already present in the Andersprocedure. The Wende procedure, as we have explained, attempts to mitigate that problem. Further, it appears thatin the McCoy scheme counsel discussed--and the appellatecourt reviewed--only the parts of the record cited by counselin support of the "arguable" issues he raised. See 486 U. S.,at 440, 442. The Wende procedure, by contrast, requires amore thorough treatment of the record by both counsel andcourt. See 25 Cal. 3d, at 440-441, 600 P. 2d, at 1074-1075;id., at 445, 600 P. 2d, at 1077 (Clark, J., concurring in judgtioning Justice: Legal and Market Mechanisms for Allocating Criminal Appellate Counsel, 34 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1161, 1167-1168 (1997) (Anders hascreated a "tragedy of the commons" that, "far from guaranteeing adequateappellate representation for all criminal defendants, instead ensures thatindigent criminal defendants will receive mediocre appellate representation, whether their claims are good or bad" (footnote omitted)); Pritchard,supra, at 1169 (noting Anders' similar effect on appellate courts); Pritchard, supra, at 1162 ("[J]udicial fiat cannot cure scarcity; it merely disguisesthe symptoms of the disease"); Doherty, Wolf! Wolf!--The Ramificationsof Frivolous Appeals, 59 J. Crim. L., C. & P. S. 1, 2 (1968) ("[T]he peoplewho will suffer the most are the indigent prisoners who have been unjustly convicted; they will languish in prison while lawyers devote timeand energy to hopeless causes on a first come-first served basis" (footnoteomitted)). We cannot say whether the Wende procedure is better orworse than the Anders procedure in this regard (although we are awareof policy-based arguments that it is worse as to appellate courts, see People v. Williams, 59 Cal. App. 4th 1202, 1205-1206, 69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 690,692 (1997); Brief for Retired Justice Armand Arabian et al. as Amici Curiae), but it is clear that, to the extent this criticism has merit, our holdingtoday that the Anders procedure is not exclusive will enable States tocontinue to experiment with solutions to this problem.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN284 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courtment and dissenting in part). On the other hand, the McCoyprocedure, unlike the Wende procedure, does assist the reviewing court by directing it to particular legal issues; as tothose issues, this is presumably a good thing. But it is alsopossible that bad judgment by the attorney in selecting theissues to raise might divert the court's attention from moremeritorious, unmentioned, issues. This criticism is, ofcourse, equally applicable to theAnders procedure. More-over, as to the issues that counsel does raise in a McCoybrief, the one-sided briefing on why those issues are frivolousmay predispose the court to reach the same conclusion. TheWende procedure reduces these risks, by omitting from thebrief signals that may subtly undermine the independenceand thoroughness of the second review of an indigent's case.Our purpose is not to resolve any of these arguments.The Constitution does not resolve them, nor does it requireus to do so. "We address not what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is constitutionally compelled."Cronic, 466 U. S., at 665, n. 38. It is enough to say that theWende procedure, like the Anders and McCoy procedures,and unlike the ones in Ellis, Eskridge, Lane, Douglas, andPenson, affords adequate and effective appellate review forcriminal indigents. Thus, there was no constitutional viola-tion in this case simply because the Wende procedure wasused. IVSince Robbins' counsel complied with a valid procedurefor determining when an indigent's direct appeal is frivolous,we reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment that the Wende pro-cedure fails adequately to serve the constitutional principleswe identified in Anders. But our reversal does not neces-sarily mean that Robbins' claim that his appellate counselrendered constitutionally ineffective assistance fails. For itmay be, as Robbins argues, that his appeal was not frivolousand that he was thus entitled to a merits brief rather thanto aWende brief. Indeed, both the District Court and the528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN285Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the CourtNinth Circuit found that there were two arguable issues ondirect appeal. The meaning of "arguable issue" as used inthe opinions below, however, is far from clear. The courtsbelow most likely used the phrase in the unusual way thatwe used it in Anders--an issue arguably supporting the ap-peal even though the appeal was wholly frivolous. See 152F. 3d, at 1067 (discussing arguable issues in context of requirements of Anders); App. 48 (District Court opinion)(same). Such an issue does not warrant a merits brief. Butthe courts below may have used the term to signify issuesthat were "arguable" in the more normal sense of being nonfrivolous and thus warranting a merits brief. See id., at 49,and n. 3 (District Court, considering arguable issues to determine "whether Anders was violated," but also definingarguable issue as one that counsel could argue "in good faithwith some potential for prevailing"). Further, the courtsbelow, in determining whether there were arguable issues,did not address petitioner's argument that, at least with regard to the adequacy of the prison law library, Robbinswaived the issue for appeal by failing to object at trial.Thus, it will be necessary on remand to clarify just howstrong these two issues are.On remand, the proper standard for evaluating Robbins'claim that appellate counsel was ineffective in neglecting tofile a merits brief is that enunciated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). See Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S.527, 535-536 (1986) (applying Strickland to claim of attorneyerror on appeal). Respondent must first show that his counsel was objectively unreasonable, see Strickland, 466 U. S.,at 687-691, in failing to find arguable issues to appeal--thatis, that counsel unreasonably failed to discover nonfrivolousissues and to file a merits brief raising them. If Robbinssucceeds in such a showing, he then has the burden of demonstrating prejudice. That is, he must show a reasonableprobability that, but for his counsel's unreasonable failure tofile a merits brief, he would have prevailed on his appeal.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN286 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the CourtSee id., at 694 (defendant must show "a reasonable probabil-ity that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result ofthe proceeding would have been different").14The applicability of Strickland's actual-prejudice prong toRobbins' claim of ineffective assistance follows from Pen-son, where we distinguished denial of counsel altogether onappeal, which warrants a presumption of prejudice, frommere ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, which doesnot. See 488 U. S., at 88-89. The defendant in Pensonfaced a denial of counsel because, as we have discussed,supra, at 280, not only was an invalid state procedure fol-lowed, but that procedure was clearly invalid insofar as itdenied the defendant his right to appellate counsel underDouglas, see 488 U. S., at 83, 88. Our holding in Pensonwas consistent with Strickland itself, where we said that wewould presume prejudice when a defendant had suffered an"[a]ctual or constructive denial of the assistance of counselaltogether." 466 U. S., at 692; see also Cronic, supra, at 659,and n. 25. In other words, while we normally apply a"strong presumption of reliability" to judicial proceedingsand require a defendant to overcome that presumption,Strickland, supra, at 696, when, as in Penson, there has beena complete denial of counsel, we understandably presume theopposite, see Strickland, supra, at 692.But where, as here, the defendant has received appellatecounsel who has complied with a valid state procedure fordetermining whether the defendant's appeal is frivolous, andthe State has not at any time left the defendant withoutcounsel on appeal, there is no reason to presume that thedefendant has been prejudiced. In Penson, we worried thatrequiring the defendant to establish prejudice would leavehim "without any of the protections afforded by Anders."14 The performance component need not be addressed first. "If it iseasier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should befollowed." Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S., at 697.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN287Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Opinion of the Court488 U. S., at 86. Here, by contrast, counsel followed a proce-dure that is constitutional under Anders and our other precedents in this area, and Robbins therefore received all theprocedural protection that the Constitution requires. Wethus presume that the result of the proceedings on appeal isreliable, and we require Robbins to prove the presumptionincorrect in his particular case. See Strickland, 466 U. S.,at 694.Further, the ineffective-assistance claim that Robbinspresses does not fall within any of the three categories ofcases, described in Strickland, in which we presume preju-dice rather than require a defendant to demonstrate it.First, as noted, we presume prejudice in a case of denial ofcounsel. Second, "various kinds of state interference withcounsel's assistance" can warrant a presumption of prejudice.Id., at 692; see Cronic, 466 U. S., at 659, and n. 25. Third,"prejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest," Strickland, 466 U. S., at 692, al-though in such a case we do require the defendant to showthat the conflict adversely affected his counsel's performance,ibid. None of these three categories applies to a case suchas Robbins'. Nor does the policy reason that we offered inStrickland for the first two categories apply here, for it isnot the case that, if an attorney unreasonably chooses to follow a procedure such as Anders or Wende instead of filing amerits brief, prejudice "is so likely that case-by-case inquiryinto prejudice is not worth the cost." 466 U. S., at 692; seeCronic, supra, at 658.15 On the contrary, in most cases inwhich a defendant's appeal has been found, pursuant to avalid state procedure, to be frivolous, it will in fact befrivolous.It is no harder for a court to applyStrickland in this areathan it is when a defendant claims that he received ineffec15 Moreover, such an error by counsel is neither "easy to identify" (sinceit is necessary to evaluate a defendant's case in order to find the error)nor attributable to the prosecution. See Strickland, supra, at 692.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN288 SMITH v. ROBBINSOpinion of the Courttive assistance of appellate counsel because his counsel, al-though filing a merits brief, failed to raise a particular claim.It will likely be easier to do so. In Jones v. Barnes, 463U. S. 745 (1983), we held that appellate counsel who files amerits brief need not (and should not) raise every nonfrivo-lous claim, but rather may select from among them in orderto maximize the likelihood of success on appeal. Notwith-standingBarnes, it is still possible to bring a Stricklandclaim based on counsel's failure to raise a particular claim,but it is difficult to demonstrate that counsel was incompe-tent. See, e. g., Gray v. Greer, 800 F. 2d 644, 646 (CA7 1986)("Generally, only when ignored issues are clearly strongerthan those presented, will the presumption of effective assistance of counsel be overcome"). With a claim that counselerroneously failed to file a merits brief, it will be easier fora defendant-appellant to satisfy the first part of the Strick-land test, for it is only necessary for him to show that areasonably competent attorney would have found one non-frivolous issue warranting a merits brief, rather than showing that a particular nonfrivolous issue was clearly strongerthan issues that counsel did present. In both cases, however, the prejudice analysis will be the same.1616 Federal judges are, of course, fully capable of assessing prejudice inthis area, including for the very sorts of claims that Robbins has raised.See, e. g., Duhamel v. Collins, 955 F. 2d 962, 967 (CA5 1992) (defendantnot prejudiced by appellate counsel's failure to challenge sufficiency of theevidence); Banks v. Reynolds, 54 F. 3d 1508, 1515-1516 (CA10 1995) (finding both parts of Strickland test satisfied where appellate counsel failedto raise claim of violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)); Crossv. United States, 893 F. 2d 1287, 1290-1291, 1292 (CA11) (rejecting challenge to appellate counsel's failure to raise claim of violation of Faretta v.California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975), by determining that there was no prejudice), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 849 (1990). Since Robbins was convicted instate court, we have no occasion to consider whether a per se prejudiceapproach, in lieu of Strickland's actual-prejudice requirement, might beappropriate in the context of challenges to federal convictions where counsel was deficient in failing to file a merits brief on direct appeal. SeeGoeke v. Branch, 514 U. S. 115, 119 (1995) (per curiam) (distinguishing528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN289Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Stevens, J., dissentingIn sum, Robbins must satisfy both prongs of the Strick-land test in order to prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.While I join Justice Souter's cogent dissent withoutqualification, I write separately to emphasize two points thatare obscured by the Court's somewhat meandering explana-tion of its sharp departure from settled law.First, despite its failure to say so directly, the Court haseffectively overruled both Anders v. California, 386 U. S.738 (1967), and Penson v. Ohio, 488 U. S. 75 (1988). Second,its unexplained rejection of the reasoning underlying ourdecision in McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wis., Dist. 1, 486U. S. 429 (1988), seeante, at 272-273, illustrates the extentof today's majority's disregard for accepted precedent.To make my first point it is only necessary to quote theCourt's new standard for determining whether a State'sappellate procedure affords adequate review for indigentdefendants:"A State's procedure provides such review so long asit reasonably ensures that an indigent's appeal will beresolved in a way that is related to the merit of thatappeal." Ante, at 276-277.The California procedure reviewed in Anders and the Ohioprocedure reviewed in Penson--both found inadequate bythis Court--would easily have satisfied that standard. Yetthe Court today accepts California's current procedure berules established pursuant to this Court's supervisory power to administerfederal court system from constitutional rules applicable to States);United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 665, n. 38 (1984) (same).528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN290 SMITH v. ROBBINSStevens, J., dissentingcause it "requires both counsel and the court to find the ap-peal to be lacking in arguable issues." Ante, at 280. Butin defense of its position in Anders, California relied heavilyon those very same requirements, i. e., "the additional feature of the [State's] system where the court also reads thefull record." Brief for Respondent in Anders v. California,O. T. 1966, No. 98, pp. 30-31; see also id., at 12-13, 19, 23,28-29. Our Anders decision held, however, that this "ad-ditional feature" was insufficient to safeguard the indigentappellant's rights.To make my second point I shall draw on my own experience as a practicing lawyer and as a judge. On a good manyoccasions I have found that the task of writing out the reasons that support an initial opinion on a question of law--whether for the purpose of giving advice to my client or forthe purpose of explaining my vote as an appellate judge--leads to a conclusion that was not previously apparent. Colleagues who shared that view of the importance of givingreasons, as opposed to merely announcing conclusions, joinedthe opinions that I authored in McCoy, Penson, and Nickolsv.

Instead of relying on an unexplainedassumption that the attorney has discovered law or factsthat completely refute the arguments identified in the1 "The danger that a busy or inexperienced lawyer might opt in favor ofa one sentence letter instead of an effective brief in an individual marginalcase is real, notwithstanding the dedication that typifies the profession.If, however, counsel's ultimate evaluation of the case must be supported bya written opinion `referring to anything in the record that might arguablysupport the appeal,' the temptation to discharge an obligation in summaryfashion is avoided, and the reviewing court is provided with meaningfulassistance."

This requirement furthers thesame interests that are served by the minimum require-ments of Anders. Because counsel may discover previously unrecognized aspects of the law in the processof preparing a written explanation for his or her conclusion, the discussion requirement provides an additionalsafeguard against mistaken conclusions by counsel thatthe strongest arguments he or she can find are frivolous.Just like the references to favorable aspects of the record required by Anders, the discussion requirement mayforestall some motions to withdraw and will assist thecourt in passing on the soundness of the lawyer's conclu-sion that the appeal is frivolous."McCoy, 486 U. S., at442; see also Penson, 488 U. S., at 81-82.In short, "simply putting pen to paper can often shed newlight on what may at first appear to be an open-and-shutissue." Id., at 82, n. 4. For this reason, the Court is quitewrong to say that requiring counsel to articulate reasons forits conclusion results in "less effective advocacy." Ante, at272.2An appellate court that employed a law clerk to review thetrial transcripts in all indigent appeals in search of arguableerror could be reasonably sure that it had resolved all ofthose appeals "in a way that is related" to their merits. Itwould not, however, provide the indigent appellant with any-thing approaching representation by a paid attorney. Like2 The Wende procedure at issue in this case requires a "summary of theproceedings and facts," but does not require counsel to raise any legalissues. People v. Wende, 25 Cal. 3d 436, 438, 600 P. 2d 1071, 1072 (1979);see also ante, at 265. This procedure plainly does not serve the abovepurpose, since it does not force counsel to "put pen to paper" regardingthose things most relevant to an appeal--legal issues. Accordingly, andcontrary to the Court's assertion, ante, at 280-281, this summary does notimprove upon the procedure rejected in Anders--a "bare conclusion" bythe attorney that an appeal is without merit. 386 U.

ROBBINSSouter, J., dissentingCalifornia's so-called Wende procedure, it would violate the"principle of substantial equality" that was described in Anders and McCoy and has been a part of our law for decades.McCoy, 486 U. S., at 438; Anders, 386 U. S., at 744.Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, JusticeGinsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.A defendant's right to representation on appeal is limitedby the prohibition against frivolous litigation, and I realizethat when a lawyer's corresponding obligations are at oddswith each other, there is no perfect place to draw the linebetween them. But because I believe the procedureadopted in People v. Wende, 25 Cal. 3d 436, 600 P. 2d 1071(1979), fails to assure representation by counsel with theadversarial character demanded by the Constitution, Irespectfully dissent.IAlthough the Sixth Amendment guarantees trial counselto a felony defendant, see Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S.335 (1963), the Constitution contains no similarly freestanding, unconditional right to counsel on appeal, there being noobligation to provide appellate review at all, see Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 606 (1974). When a State elects to provideappellate review, however, the terms on which it does so aresubject to constitutional notice. See, e. g., Griffin v. Illinois,351 U. S. 12, 18 (1956); Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U. S. 305, 310(1966); Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 393 (1985).In a line of cases beginning with Griffin, this Court examined appellate procedural schemes under the principle thatjustice may not be conditioned on ability to pay, see generallyRoss, supra, at 605-609. Even though "[a]bsolute equalityis not required," Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353, 357(1963), we held in Douglas that when state criminal defendants are free to retain counsel for a first appeal as of right,528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN293Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Souter, J., dissentingthe Fourteenth Amendment 1 requires that indigent appel-lants be placed on a substantially equal footing through theappointment of counsel at the State's expense. See McCoyv.Court of Appeals of Wis., Dist. 1, 486 U. S. 429, 438 (1988)(referring to "principle of substantial equality").Two services of appellate counsel are on point here. Appellate counsel examines the trial record with an advocate'seye, identifying and weighing potential issues for appeal.This is review not by a dispassionate legal mind but by acommitted representative, pledged to his client's interests,primed to attack the conviction on any ground the recordmay reveal. If counsel's review reveals arguable trial error,he prepares and submits a brief on the merits and arguesthe appeal.The right to the first of these services, a partisan scrutinyof the record and assessment of potential issues, goes to theirreducible core of the lawyer's obligation to a litigant in anadversary system, and we have consistently held it essentialto substantial equality of representation by assigned counsel."The paramount importance of vigorous representation follows from the nature of our adversarial system of justice."Penson v. Ohio, 488 U. S. 75, 84 (1988). See, e. g., Ellis v.United States, 356 U. S. 674, 675 (1958) (per curiam); Douglas, supra, at 357-358; McCoy, supra, at 438. The right isunqualified when a defendant has retained counsel, and I canimagine no reason that it should not be so when counsel hasbeen appointed.Because the right to the second service, merits briefing, isnot similarly unqualified, however, the issue we address1 The Griffin line of cases has roots in both due process and equal protection, see M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102, 120 (1996), but we have notedthat "[m]ost decisions in this area have rested on an equal protectionframework . . . ," Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U. S. 660, 665 (1983). Seealso Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 611 (1974) (noting that right to appellate counsel "is more profitably considered under an equal protectionanalysis").528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN294 SMITH v. ROBBINSSouter, J., dissentingtoday arises. The limitation on the right to a merits briefis that no one has a right to a wholly frivolous appeal, seeAnders v. California, 386 U. S. 738, 742 (1967), against whichthe judicial system's first line of defense is its lawyers.Being officers of the court, members of the bar are bound"not to clog the courts with frivolous motions or appeals,"Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 323 (1981); see alsoMcCoy, supra, at 436, and this is of course true regardlessof a lawyer's retained or appointed status in a given case.The problem to which Anders responds arises when counselviews his client's appeal as frivolous, leaving him dutybarred from pressing it upon a court.2The rub is that although counsel may properly refuse tobrief a frivolous issue and a court may just as properly denyleave to take a frivolous appeal, there needs to be some reasonable assurance that the lawyer has not relaxed his parti-san instinct prior to refusing,3 in which case the court'sreview could never compensate for the lawyer's failure ofadvocacy. A simple statement by counsel that an appeal hasno merit, coupled with an appellate court's endorsement ofcounsel's conclusion, gives no affirmative indication that anyone has sought out the appellant's best arguments or championed his cause to the degree contemplated by the adversarysystem. Nor do such conclusions acquire any implicit per2 Anders addressed the problem as confronted by assigned counsel,though in theory it can be equally acute when counsel is retained. It isunlikely to show up in practice, however. Paying clients generally canfire a lawyer expressing unsatisfying conclusions and will often find a replacement with a keener eye for arguable issues or a duller nose for frivolous ones. As a practical matter, the States may find it too difficult orcostly to prevent moneyed appellants from wasting their own resources,and those of the judicial system, by bringing frivolous appeals. This doesnot mean, however, that the States are obligated to subsidize such effortsby indigents.3 An assurance, that is, that he has not become what is known aroundthe Los Angeles County Jail as a " `dumptruck.'

S. 259 (2000)Souter, J., dissentingsuasiveness through exposure to an interested opponent'sreadiness to mount a challenge. The government is unlikelyto dispute or even test counsel's evaluation; one does not be-rate an opponent for giving up. To guard against the possibility, then, that counsel has not done the advocate's work oflooking hard for potential issues, there must be some prodto find any reclusive merit in an ostensibly unpromising caseand some process to assess the lawyer's efforts after the fact.A judicial process that renders constitutional error invisibleis, after all, itself an affront to the Constitution. See Penson, supra, at 81-82.In Anders, we devised such a mechanism to ensure respectfor an appellant's rights. See Penson, supra, at 80. A lawyer's request to withdraw on the ground that an appeal isfrivolous "must . . . be accompanied by a brief referring toanything in the record that might arguably support the appeal." Anders, 386 U. S., at 744. This simply means thatcounsel must do his partisan best, short of calling blackwhite, to flag the points that come closest to being appealable; the lawyer's job is to state the issues that give thedefendant his best chances to prevail, even if the best comesup short under the rule against trifling with the court."[T]he court--not counsel--," we continued, "then proceeds,after a full examination of all the proceedings, to decidewhether the case is wholly frivolous." Ibid.Anders thus contemplates two reviews of the record, eachof a markedly different character. First comes review bythe advocate, the defendant's interested representative.His job is to identify the best issues the partisan eye canspot. Then comes judicial review from a disinterestedjudge, who asks two questions: whether the lawyer reallydid function as a committed advocate, and whether he misjudged the legitimate appealability of any issue. In reviewing the advocate's work, the court is responsible for assuringthat counsel has gone as far as advocacy will take him withthe best issues undiscounted. We have repeatedly de528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN296 SMITH v. ROBBINSSouter, J., dissentingscribed the task of an appellate court in terms of this dualresponsibility. " `First, [the court] must satisfy itself thatthe attorney has provided the client with a diligent and thor-ough search of the record for any arguable claim that mightsupport the client's appeal. Second, it must determinewhether counsel has correctly concluded that the appeal isfrivolous.' " Penson, 488 U. S., at 83 (quoting McCoy, 486U. S., at 442).Griffin and Anders thus require significantly more thanthe abstract evaluation of the merits of conceivably appealable points. Without the assurance that assigned counselhas done his best as a partisan, his substantial equality to alawyer retained at a defendant's expense cannot be assumed.And without the benefit of the lawyer's statement of strongest claims, the appellate panel cannot act as a reviewingcourt, but is relegated to an inquisitorial role.It is owing to the importance of assuring that an adversar-ial, not an inquisitorial, system is at work that I disagreewith the Court's statement today that our cases approve ofany state procedure that "reasonably ensures that an indigent's appeal will be resolved in a way that is related to themerit of that appeal." Ante, at 276-277. A purely inquisitorial system could satisfy that criterion, and so could onethat appoints counsel only if the appellate court deems ituseful. But we have rejected the former and have explicitlyheld the latter unconstitutional, see Douglas, 372 U. S., at355, the reason in each case being that the Constitution looksto the means as well as to the ends.4 See Singer v. UnitedStates, 380 U. S. 24, 36 (1965) ("The Constitution recognizesan adversary system as the proper method of determiningguilt . . ."). See also, e. g., Penson, supra, at 87 ("A criminalappellant is entitled to a single-minded advocacy . . .");4 Of course, if appellate review is not constitutionally required, Statesmay well be able to impose nonadversarial review on all appellants. Theymay not, however, reserve the adversary system for those able to affordcounsel.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN297Cite as: 528 U.

S. 668, 685 (1984) ("TheSixth Amendment recognizes the right to the assistance ofcounsel because it envisions counsel's playing a role that iscritical to the ability of the adversarial system to reach justresults"); United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656 (1984)("Thus, the adversarial process protected by the SixthAmendment requires that the accused have `counsel actingin the role of an advocate' ") (quotingAnders, supra, at 743).IIWe have not held the details of Anders to be exclusive,but it does make sense to read the case as exemplifying whatsubstantial equality requires on behalf of indigent appellantsentitled to an advocate's review and to reasonable certaintythat arguable issues will be briefed on their merits. WithAnders thus as a benchmark, California's Wende procedurefails to measure up. Its primary failing is in permittingcounsel to refrain as a matter of course from mentioning pos-sibly arguable issues in a no-merit brief; its second deficiencyis a correlative of the first, in obliging an appellate court tosearch the record for arguable issues without benefit of anissue-spotting, no-merit brief to review. See 25 Cal. 3d, at440-442, 600 P. 2d, at 1074-1075.Although Wende assumes that counsel will act as an advo-cate, seeid., at 441-442, 600 P. 2d, at 1075, it fails to assure,or even promote, the partisan attention that the Constitutionrequires. While the lawyer must summarize the proceduraland factual history of the case with citations to the record,nothing in the Wende scheme requires counsel to show af-firmatively, subject to evaluation, that he has made the committed search for issues and the advocate's assessment oftheir merits that go to the heart of appellate representationin our adversary system. It begs the question to say that"[c]ounsel's inability to find any arguable issues may readilybe inferred from his failure to raise any," id., at 442, 600P. 2d, at 1075, and it misses the point to argue that the528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN298 SMITH v. ROBBINSSouter, J., dissentingindigent appellant is adequately protected because the law-yer assigned to a case under California's assigned counselscheme may not file a Wende brief without the approval of asupervisor. The point is the need for some affirmative andexpress indicator that an advocate has been at work, in theform of a product that an appellate court can specifically review.5 Thus Anders requires counsel to flag the best issuesfor the sake of keeping counsel on his toes and giving focusto judicial review of his judgment. Wende on the other handrequires no indication of conceivable issues and hence nothing specifically reviewable by a court bound to preserve thesystem's adversary character.Wende does no more to pro-tect the indigent's right to advocacy than the no-merit lettercondemned in Anders, or the conclusory statement disap-proved in Penson.On like reasoning, Wende is deficient in relying on a judge'snonpartisan review to assure that a defendant suffers noprejudice at the hands of a lawyer who has failed to docu-ment his best effort at partisan review. Exactly becauseour system assumes that a lawyer committed to a client isthe most dependable guardian of the client's interest, seesupra, at 296-297, we have consistently rejected proceduresleaving the determination of frivolousness to the court in thefirst instance, see Douglas, supra, at 355-356, or to the courtfollowing a conclusory declaration by counsel, seePenson,supra, at 81-82, or to the court assisted by counsel in the roleof amicus curiae, see Ellis, 356 U. S., at 675. The defect inthese procedures is their entire reliance on review by a detached magistrate who does not apply the partisan scrutinyin the first instance that defendants with paid lawyers get asa matter of course.5 Since the state petitioner's claims that the lawyer's unrevealing andconclusory certification has been approved by a superior are neither herenor there on my analysis, I need not evaluate assertions by amicus Delgado that there is no scheme of assigned representation uniform throughout the State, see Brief for Jesus Garcia Delgado as Amicus Curiae 8.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN299Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Souter, J., dissentingIt goes without saying, too, that Wende's reliance onjudges to start from scratch in seeking arguable issues addssubstantially to the burden on the judicial shoulders. WhileI have no need to decide whether this drawback of the Wendescheme is of constitutional significance, it raises questionsthat certainly underscore the constitutional failing of relyingon judicial scrutiny uninformed by counsel's partisan analy-sis. In anamicus brief filed in this case, 13 retired justicesof the Supreme Court or Courts of Appeal of California havepointed out the "risk that the review of the cold record[under the Wende scheme] will be more perfunctory withoutthe issue-spotting guidance, and associated record citations,of counsel." Brief for Retired Justice Armand Arabian et al.as Amici Curiae 5. The amici have candidly representedthat "[w]hen a California appellate court receives a Wendebrief, it assigns the case to a staff attorney who prepares amemorandum analyzing all possible legal issues in the case.Typically, the staff attorney then makes an oral presentationto the appellate panel . . . ."Id., at 6. When the responsi-bility of counsel is thrown onto the court, the court givesway to a staff attorney; it could not be clearer that Wende isseriously at odds with the respective obligations of counseland the courts as contemplated by the Constitution.IIIUnlike the Court, I reach the question of appropriate re-lief. With respect to respondent'sAnders claim, the Courtof Appeals premised its disposition on finding that two potentially meritorious issues showed that Robbins had beenprejudiced by the failure of the Wende scheme to result intheir litigation. I think it unnecessary to invoke such find-ings, however, and would hold for Robbins simply because ofthe failure to provide an advocate's analysis of issues as apredicate of court review. Without more, I would, in effect,require the state courts to reinstate the appeal for treatmentconsistent with theAnders application of Griffin.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN300 SMITH v. ROBBINSSouter, J., dissentingIt is true, of course, that before relief is normally grantedfor want of adequate assistance of trial counsel, a defendantmust show not only his lawyer's failure to represent himwith reasonable competence (demonstrated here by the failure to file an advocate's issue-spotting brief), but also a "rea-sonable probability" that competent representation wouldhave produced a different result in his case, see Strickland,466 U. S., at 694. But the assumption behind Strickland'sprejudice requirement is that the defendant had a lawyerwho was representing him as his advocate at least at somelevel, whereas that premise cannot be assumed when a defendant receives the benefit of nothing more than a Wendebrief. In a Wende situation, nominal counsel is functioningmerely as a friend of the court, helping the judge to graspthe structure of the record but not even purporting to highlight the record's nearest approach to supporting his client'shope to appeal. Counsel under Wende is doing less than thejudge's law clerk (or a staff attorney) might do, and he isdoing nothing at all in the way of advocacy. When a lawyerabandons the role of advocate and adopts that of amicus curiae, he is no longer functioning as counsel or rendering assistance within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. SeeCronic, 466 U. S., at 654-655. Since the apparently missingingredient of the advocate's analysis goes to the very essenceof the right to counsel, a lawyer who does nothing more thanfile a Wende brief is closer to being no counsel at all than tobeing subpar counsel under Strickland.This, I think, is the answer to any suggestion that a specific assessment of prejudice need be shown in order to getrelief from Wende. A complete absence of counsel is a reversible violation of the constitutional right to representation, even when there is no question that at the end of theday the smartest lawyer in the world would have watchedhis client being led off to prison. See Cronic, supra, at 658-659; cf. Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U. S. 327 (1969). Wedo not ask how the defendant would have fared if he had528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN301Cite as: 528 U. S. 259 (2000)Souter, J., dissentingbeen given counsel, and we should not look to what sort ofappeal might have ensued if an appellant's lawyer hadflagged the points that came closest to appealable issues.Such a result is equally consistent with our cases holding aviolation of due process to be complete when a defendant isdenied a right to the appeal he is otherwise entitled to pursue. See Peguero v. United States, 526 U. S. 23, 30-31 (1999)(O'Connor, J., concurring); Rodriquez, supra, at 330.6This conclusion was anticipated in Penson, in which wedealt with the violation of Anders standards when counselwas allowed to withdraw without supplying the court withhis best effort to identify appealable weaknesses, and priorto any judicial determination that counsel had missed nothing in finding no arguable appellate issues in the record.The appellate court in Penson subsequently identified arguable issues but thought the appointment of new counsel un-necessary after finding that any legitimately appealable issues would be losers. This Court recognized a presumptionof prejudice without more, for purposes of bothStricklandand Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967). See Penson, 488 U. S., at 85-86. Although the state court's failureto appoint counsel after identifying issues made Penson anegregious case, id., at 83, the failure of advocacy and conse-quent constructive absence of counsel was clear even at thepoint at which the lawyer withdrew, id., at 82, and the pre-sumption of prejudice applicable then is applicable in thiscase now.There is practical sense as well as good theory behind thispresumption of prejudice, for any requirement to demon-strate prejudice specifically would often place federal judgeson habeas in highly precarious positions calling for judg-ments that state judges are generally better qualified to6 Although this habeas proceeding began on February 24, 1994, and istherefore not governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death PenaltyAct of 1996 (AEDPA), see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997), the resultshould be no different in a post-AEDPA case. See infra, at 303.528US2 Unit: $U21 [06-14-01 20:45:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN302 SMITH v. ROBBINSSouter, J., dissentingmake. Since there will have been no advocate's help in ana-lyzing the record on the direct state appeal, and since counselmay well have been absent formally as well as constructivelyin any state postconviction proceedings, the federal judgewould be looking for (among other things) previously uniden-tified state-law issues not previously waived. One could notask for a more certain guarantee of inefficient and time consuming judicial effort.7What remains is only to say a word about the State's argument that relief in this case is barred under Teague v. Lane,489 U. S. 288 (1989), as requiring application of a new rule oflaw not clearly entailed by our prior holdings. The argu-ment seems to be that California has relied onWende for solong that any disapproval from a federal court at this junc-ture is some sort of novelty (resulting from the failure ofother state defendants to reach the federal courts earlierwithWende objections). The obvious answer is that the application of Douglas and Griffin standards to meritless appeals has been subject to repeated explanation starting withAnders and echoed in McCoy and Penson. Once generalrules are announced they do not become "new" again withevery particular violation that may subsequently occur. SeeSaffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 491-492 (1990) (discussing application of the rule of Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976),7 Since a Wende case is like a denial of counsel, it would make no moresense to give the State an option to demonstrate no prejudice under Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), or Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S.619 (1993), than it would to require a defendant to show it under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The presumption of prejudicedoes not, however, promise relief to every California defendant whose appeal was dismissed as frivolous and against whom the statute of limitations has not run, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III). Onesubmission before us claims that the Wende scheme has not supplantedAnders v. California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967), throughout California.

MARTINEZ-SALAZARcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 98-1255. Argued November 29, 1999--Decided January 19, 2000Respondent Martinez-Salazar and a codefendant were charged with a variety of federal offenses. As the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedureinstruct, the District Court allotted them 10 peremptory challenges exercisable jointly in the selection of 12 jurors, Rule 24(b), and anothersuch challenge exercisable in the selection of an alternate juror, Rule24(c). Because prospective juror Don Gilbert indicated several timesthat he would favor the prosecution, the codefendants challenged himfor cause, but the District Court declined to excuse him. After twiceobjecting, unsuccessfully, to the for-cause ruling, Martinez-Salazar useda peremptory challenge to remove Gilbert. The codefendants subsequently exhausted all of their peremptory challenges. At the close ofjury selection, the District Court read the names of the jurors to beseated and asked if the prosecutor or defense counsel had any objectionsto any of those jurors. Martinez-Salazar's counsel responded: "Nonefrom us." At the conclusion of the trial, Martinez-Salazar was convicted on all counts. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed with him (andthe Government here does not contest) that the District Court's refusalto strike Gilbert for cause was an abuse of discretion. This error, theNinth Circuit held, did not violate the Sixth Amendment, because Gilbert was removed and the impartiality of the jury eventually seatedwas not challenged. But the Court of Appeals further concluded thatthe District Court's mistake resulted in a violation of Martinez-Salazar'sFifth Amendment due process rights because it forced him to use aperemptory challenge curatively, thereby impairing his right to the fullcomplement of peremptory challenges to which federal law entitled him.Such an error, the Court of Appeals held, requires automatic reversal.Held: A defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges pursuant to Rule24 is not denied or impaired when the defendant chooses to use such achallenge to remove a juror who should have been excused for cause.Pp. 311-317.(a) Although the peremptory challenge plays an important role in reinforcing a defendant's constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury,see, e. g., Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 212-213, 218-219, this Courthas long recognized that such challenges are auxiliary; unlike the rightto an impartial jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, peremptory528US2 Unit: $U22 [06-18-01 18:02:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN305Cite as: 528 U.

Peremptory challenges in federal criminaltrials are governed by Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 24(b) prescribes, inter alia, that for offenses "punishableby imprisonment for more than one year, . . . the defendant or defendants [are] jointly [entitled] to 10 peremptory challenges." Rule 24(c)further provides that when, as in this case, an alternate juror is tobe selected, each side is entitled to one peremptory challenge in selecting that juror. The question to which the Court turns is whetherMartinez-Salazar was denied any right for which Rule 24 provides.Pp. 311-313.(b) Ross dealt with a state-law question resembling the one presentedhere. This Court first rejected the Ross defendant's position that,without more, the loss of a peremptory challenge constitutes a violationof the constitutional right to an impartial jury. 487 U. S., at 88. Solong as the jury that sits is impartial, the Court held, the fact that thedefendant had to use a peremptory challenge to achieve that result doesnot mean the Sixth Amendment was violated. Ibid. The Court thenrejected the defendant's due process objection that forced use of a peremptory challenge to cure a trial court's error in denying a challengefor cause arbitrarily deprived him of the full complement of peremptorychallenges allowed under Oklahoma law. Id., at 89. An Oklahomastatute accorded the defendant nine such challenges. Oklahoma courtshad read into that grant a requirement that a defendant who disagreedwith the trial court's ruling on a for-cause challenge must, in order topreserve the claim that the ruling deprived him of a fair trial, exercisea peremptory challenge to remove the juror. Ibid. Even then, understate law, the error was grounds for reversal only if the defendant exhausted all peremptory challenges, and an incompetent juror thereforewas forced upon him. Ibid. The defendant in Ross, the Court concluded, did not lose any state-law right when he used one of his ninechallenges to remove a juror who should have been excused for cause;rather, he received all that state law allowed him, and the fair trial thatthe Federal Constitution guaranteed. Id., at 90-91. Pp. 313-314.(c) This Court rejects the Government's contention that federal law,like the Oklahoma statute considered in Ross, should be read to requirea defendant to use a peremptory challenge to strike a juror who shouldhave been removed for cause, in order to preserve the claim that thefor-cause ruling impaired the defendant's right to a fair trial. Althoughthis Court has sanctioned various limitations on the exercise of peremptory challenges that could be viewed as effectively reducing the numberof challenges available to a defendant, see, e. g., Stilson v. United States,250 U. S. 583, 586, these cases address procedures under which such528US2 Unit: $U22 [06-18-01 18:02:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN306 UNITED STATES v. MARTINEZ-SALAZARSyllabuschallenges are exercised. None of them demands that a defendant useor refrain from using a challenge on a particular basis or when a particular set of facts is present. To date this Court has recognized only onesubstantive control over a federal criminal defendant's choice of whomto challenge peremptorily. Under the Equal Protection Clause, a defendant may not exercise a challenge to remove a potential juror solelyon the basis of the juror's gender, ethnic origin, or race. See, e. g., Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79. The Court declines to read into Rule 24,or otherwise impose, the further control advanced by the Government.Pp. 314-315.(d) However, the Court agrees with the Government's narrowercontention that Rule 24(b) was not violated in this case. The NinthCircuit erred in concluding that the District Court's mistake compelledMartinez-Salazar to challenge Gilbert peremptorily, thereby reducinghis allotment of peremptory challenges by one. A hard choice is notthe same as no choice. Martinez-Salazar received and exercised 11 peremptory challenges. That is all he is entitled to under the Rule.After objecting to the District Court's denial of his for-cause challenge,he had the option of letting Gilbert sit on the petit jury and, upon conviction, pursuing a Sixth Amendment challenge on appeal. Instead, heelected to use a challenge to remove Gilbert. In choosing to removeGilbert rather than taking his chances on appeal, Martinez-Salazar didnot lose a peremptory challenge. Rather, he used the challenge in linewith a principal reason for peremptories: to help secure the constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury. See, e. g., J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 137, n. 8. Moreover, the immediatechoice he confronted comports with the reality of the jury selection process. Challenges for cause and rulings upon them are fast paced, madeon the spot and under pressure. Counsel as well as court in that process must be prepared promptly to decide, often between shades ofgray. Pp. 315-317.(e) Martinez-Salazar and his codefendant were accorded the exactnumber of peremptory challenges that federal law allowed; he cannottenably assert any violation of his Fifth Amendment due process right.See Ross, 487 U.

We address in this case a problem infederal jury selection left open in Ross. See id., at 91, n. 4.We focus on this sequence of events: the erroneous refusal ofa trial judge to dismiss a potential juror for cause, followedby the defendant's exercise of a peremptory challenge to remove that juror. Confronting that order of events, theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruledthat the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires automatic reversal of a conviction whenever the defendant goes on to exhaust his peremptory challenges duringjury selection. 146 F. 3d 653 (1998).We reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment. We reject theGovernment's contention that under federal law, a defendantis obliged to use a peremptory challenge to cure the judge'serror. We hold, however, that if the defendant elects to curesuch an error by exercising a peremptory challenge, and issubsequently convicted by a jury on which no biased jurorsat, he has not been deprived of any rule-based or constitutional right.*David A.

MARTINEZ-SALAZAROpinion of the CourtIRespondent Abel Martinez-Salazar and a codefendantwere tried by a jury in the United States District Court forthe District of Arizona for a variety of narcotics and weaponsoffenses. As Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of CriminalProcedure instructs, the District Court allotted the co-defendants 10 peremptory challenges exercisable jointly inthe selection of 12 jurors. Martinez-Salazar and his co-defendant also received an additional peremptory challengeexercisable in the selection of an alternate juror. See Fed.Rule Crim. Proc. 24(c).Prior to jury selection, the District Court gave the pro-spective jurors a written questionnaire to complete. See146 F. 3d, at 654-655. A potential juror, Don Gilbert, indi-cated on his questionnaire that he would favor the prosecution. Id., at 655. In a discussion with the trial judge, Gil-bert restated: "[A]ll things being equal, I would probablytend to favor the prosecution." Ibid. The judge explainedthat the burden of proving a person guilty rests with theGovernment. Gilbert said he would not disagree with thatproposition. The judge next asked Gilbert whether, ifhe were a defendant facing jurors with backgrounds andopinions similar to his own, he thought he would get a fairtrial. Gilbert answered: "I think that's a difficult question.I don't think I know the answer to that."Ibid. Martinez-Salazar's counsel then inquired whether Gilbert would feelmore comfortable erring on the side of the prosecution orthe defense. Gilbert responded: "I would probably be morefavorable to the prosecution. I suppose most people are. Imean, they're predisposed. You assume that people are ontrial because they did something wrong." Ibid. The judgethen told Gilbert that his response was "contrary to ourwhole system of justice. When people are accused of acrime, there's no presumption . . . of guil[t]. The presumption is the other way." Ibid. Gilbert replied, "I understandthat in theory."Ibid.528US2 Unit: $U22 [06-18-01 18:02:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN309Cite as: 528 U. S. 304 (2000)Opinion of the CourtAt the completion of this colloquy, Martinez-Salazar andhis codefendant challenged Gilbert for cause. The Government opposed the challenge. The District Court declined toexcuse Gilbert for cause, stating: "You know about him andknow his opinions. He said . . . he could follow the instruc-tions, and he said . . . `I don't think I know what I would do,'et cetera. So I think you have reasons to challenge him[,]. . . strike him if you choose to do that." Ibid.After twice objecting, unsuccessfully, to the for-cause ruling, Martinez-Salazar used a peremptory challenge to re-move Gilbert. Martinez-Salazar and his codefendant subsequently exhausted all of their peremptory challenges. Thecodefendants did not request an additional peremptory challenge for selection of the petit jury (a request Rule 24(b)expressly permits a district court to grant when there aremultiple defendants). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-35. At theclose of jury selection, the District Court read out the namesof the jurors to be seated and asked if the prosecutor ordefense counsel had any objections to any of those jurors.Martinez-Salazar's counsel responded: "None from us."App. 182. At the conclusion of the trial, Martinez-Salazarwas convicted on all counts.On appeal, Martinez-Salazar contended that the DistrictCourt abused its discretion in refusing to strike Gilbert forcause and that this error forced Martinez-Salazar to use aperemptory challenge on Gilbert. The Ninth Circuit agreed(and the Government here does not contest) that the DistrictCourt's refusal to strike Gilbert for cause was an abuse ofdiscretion. 146 F. 3d, at 656. This error, the Court of Appeals held, did not violate the Sixth Amendment, becauseGilbert was removed and the impartiality of the jury eventually seated was not challenged. Id., at 657. But the Courtof Appeals further concluded that the District Court's mistake resulted in a violation of Martinez-Salazar's FifthAmendment due process rights. According to the NinthCircuit, the District Court's error in denying the for-cause528US2 Unit: $U22 [06-18-01 18:02:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN310 UNITED STATES v. MARTINEZ-SALAZAROpinion of the Courtchallenge forced Martinez-Salazar to use a peremptory chal-lenge curatively, thereby impairing his right to the full complement of peremptory challenges to which federal law enti-tled him. Such an error, the Court of Appeals held, requiresautomatic reversal. Id., at 659.Judge Rymer dissented in part. She observed that nothing in the text of Rule 24(b) suggests that the exercise ofperemptory challenges is impaired if the defendant uses achallenge to remove a juror who should have been excusedfor cause. Id., at 659-660. Martinez-Salazar, she empha-sized, never asserted in the District Court that he wished tostrike some other juror with the peremptory challenge heused to remove Gilbert, nor did he question the impartialityof the jury as finally composed. Id., at 660. Assuming,arguendo, that there was a violation of Rule 24(b), JudgeRymer "would not engraft [onto the Due Process Clause] acommon law remedy of per se reversal for a Rule violation."Id., at 661. The court's decision "[c]onstitutionalizing theimpairment of peremptory challenges," she underscored, rancounter to this Court's decision in Ross and was hardly "inconsequential" in view of the reality that "[t]rial courts, stateand federal, rule on cause challenges by the minute." Id.,at 659, 661.The Courts of Appeals have divided on the questionwhether a defendant's peremptory challenge right is impaired when he peremptorily challenges a potential jurorwhom the district court erroneously refused to excuse forcause, and the defendant thereafter exhausts his peremptorychallenges. The First and Fifth Circuits have indicatedagreement with the Ninth Circuit that this circumstance constitutes an abridgment of the right to exercise peremptorychallenges. See United States v. Cambara, 902 F. 2d 144,147-148 (CA1 1990); United States v. Hall, 152 F. 3d 381, 408(CA5 1998). The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits, on the otherhand, have found in this situation no impairment of the rightto peremptory challenges. See United States v. Brooks, 161528US2 Unit: $U22 [06-18-01 18:02:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN311Cite as: 528 U. S. 304 (2000)Opinion of the CourtF. 3d 1240, 1245-1246 (CA10 1998); United States v. Farmer,923 F. 2d 1557, 1566 (CA11 1991).1 We granted certiorari,527 U. S. 1021 (1999), and now reverse the Ninth Circuit'sjudgment.IIThe peremptory challenge is part of our common-lawheritage. Its use in felony trials was already venerable inBlackstone's time. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 346-348 (1769). We have long recognized the role of the peremptory challenge in reinforcing a defendant's right to trial byan impartial jury. See,e. g., Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S.202, 212-213, 218-219 (1965);Pointer v. United States, 151U. S. 396, 408 (1894). But we have long recognized, as well,that such challenges are auxiliary; unlike the right to an im-partial jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, peremptory challenges are not of federal constitutional dimension.Ross, 487 U. S., at 88; see Stilson v. United States, 250 U. S.583, 586 (1919) ("There is nothing in the Constitution of theUnited States which requires the Congress to grant peremptory challenges.").Legislative provision for peremptory challenges in federalcriminal trials dates from 1790. See Act of Apr. 30, 1790,ch. 9, $ 30, 1 Stat. 119. Since 1946, Rule 24 of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure has provided the governinginstructions. That Rule, reproduced in its entirety below,21 There is a corresponding conflict among the Circuits in civil cases.Compare Kirk v. Raymark Industries, Inc., 61 F. 3d 147, 157 (CA3 1995)(right to peremptory challenge is impaired when a party exercises such achallenge to strike a prospective juror who should have been removed forcause), with Getter v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 66 F. 3d 1119, 1122-1123(CA10 1995) (no impairment).2 Rule 24. Trial Jurors."(a) Examination.

S. 304 (2000)Opinion of the CourtFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 24(c). The question to which we nowturn is whether Martinez-Salazar was denied any right forwhich Rule 24 provides. IIIOur most recent decision in point is Ross v. Oklahoma.That 1988 decision dealt with a question resembling the onepresented here, although the issue in Ross arose in a state-law setting. The defendant in Ross exercised a peremptorychallenge to cure the trial court's error in denying a chal-lenge for cause. We first rejected, as the Ninth Circuitrightly did in the decision under review, the position that,without more, "the loss of a peremptory challenge constitutes a violation of the constitutional right to an impartialjury." 487 U. S., at 88. "So long as the jury that sits isimpartial," we held, "the fact that the defendant had to usea peremptory challenge to achieve that result does not meanthe Sixth Amendment was violated." Ibid. We then tookup the defendant's due process objection. He argued thatforced use of a peremptory challenge to cure a trial court'serror in denying a challenge for cause "arbitrarily depriv[ed]him of the full complement of . . . peremptory challengesallowed under Oklahoma law."Id., at 89. An Oklahomastatute accorded the defendant nine peremptory challenges.Oklahoma courts had read into that grant a requirement that"a defendant who disagrees with the trial court's ruling on afor-cause challenge must, in order to preserve the claim thatthe ruling deprived him of a fair trial, exercise a peremptorychallenge to remove the juror." Ibid. Even then, underOklahoma law, "the error [was] grounds for reversal only ifthe defendant exhaust[ed] all peremptory challenges and anincompetent juror [was] forced upon him."Ibid. The de-fendant in Ross, we therefore concluded, did not lose anyright conferred by state law when he used one of his ninechallenges to remove a juror who should have been excusedfor cause. Because the defendant received all that state lawallowed him, and the fair trial that the Federal Constitution528US2 Unit: $U22 [06-18-01 18:02:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN314 UNITED STATES v. MARTINEZ-SALAZAROpinion of the Courtguaranteed, we rejected his due process challenge. Id., at90-91.Underlying the Court of Appeals holding in this case wasthe notion that the District Court's error in denying the challenge for cause "forced" Martinez-Salazar to use a peremp-tory challenge to remove the objectionable venire member.146 F. 3d, at 659. Starting from this premise, the Courtof Appeals reasoned that Rule 24(b) was violated becauseMartinez-Salazar could effectively exercise only nine of theten initial peremptory challenges for which the Rule pro-vided. The Court of Appeals further concluded that "dueprocess is violated when a defendant is forced to exercisea peremptory challenge to cure an erroneous for-cause refusal." Id., at 658.The Government urges us to reverse the Court of Appealsjudgment on the ground that federal law, like the Oklahomastatute considered in Ross, should be read to require a defendant to use a peremptory challenge to strike a juror whoshould have been removed for cause, in order to preservethe claim that the for-cause ruling impaired the defendant'sright to a fair trial. Brief for United States 19-22. In support of its position, the Government points to various limitations on the exercise of peremptory challenges that thisCourt has sanctioned--limitations that could be viewed aseffectively reducing the number of challenges available to adefendant. See Reply Brief 3 (citing Stilson, 250 U. S., at586 (sharing of peremptories among codefendants); St. Clairv. United States, 154 U. S. 134, 147-148 (1894) (requirementthat parties exercise or waive peremptory strike as each potential juror is selected at random and qualified); Pointer,151 U. S., at 409, 412 (simultaneous defense and prosecutionstrikes)). The cases on which the Government relies address procedures under which peremptory challenges areexercised. None of them demands that a defendant use orrefrain from using a peremptory challenge on a particularbasis or when a particular set of facts is present. To date528US2 Unit: $U22 [06-18-01 18:02:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN315Cite as: 528 U. S. 304 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthis Court has recognized only one substantive control overa federal criminal defendant's choice of whom to challengeperemptorily. Under the Equal Protection Clause, a de-fendant may not exercise a peremptory challenge to removea potential juror solely on the basis of the juror's gender,ethnic origin, or race. See, e. g., J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.T. B., 511 U. S. 127 (1994) (gender); Hernandez v. New York,500 U. S. 352 (1991) (ethnic origin);Batson v. Kentucky, 476U. S. 79 (1986) (race). We decline to read into Rule 24,or otherwise impose, the further control advanced by theGovernment.We agree, however, with the Government's narrower con-tention that Rule 24(b) was not violated in this case. ReplyBrief 2-3. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding thatthe District Court's for-cause mistake compelled MartinezSalazar to challenge Gilbert peremptorily, thereby reduc-ing his allotment of peremptory challenges by one. 146 F.3d, at 659. A hard choice is not the same as no choice.Martinez-Salazar, together with his codefendant, receivedand exercised 11 peremptory challenges (10 for the petit jury,1 in selecting an alternate juror). That is all he is entitledto under the Rule.After objecting to the District Court's denial of his forcause challenge, Martinez-Salazar had the option of lettingGilbert sit on the petit jury and, upon conviction, pursuing aSixth Amendment challenge on appeal. Instead, Martinez-Salazar elected to use a challenge to remove Gilbert because he did not want Gilbert to sit on his jury. Thiswas Martinez-Salazar's choice.3 The District Court did notdemand--and Rule 24(b) did not require--that Martinez-Salazar use a peremptory challenge curatively.In choosing to remove Gilbert rather than taking hischances on appeal, Martinez-Salazar did not lose a peremp3 The choice would be less hard, of course, if, as Justice Scalia hypothesizes, the "defendant had plenty of peremptories left."

Rather, he used the challenge in line with aprincipal reason for peremptories: to help secure the constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury. See, e. g.,J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 137, n. 8 (purpose of peremptory challenges " `is to permit litigants to assist the government inthe selection of an impartial trier of fact' ") (quotingEdmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 620 (1991)); Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57 (1992) (peremptory chal-lenges are "one state-created means to the constitutional endof an impartial jury and a fair trial"); Frazier v. UnitedStates, 335 U. S. 497, 505 (1948) ("the right [to peremptorychallenges] is given in aid of the party's interest to secure afair and impartial jury"). Moreover, the immediate choiceMartinez-Salazar confronted--to stand on his objection tothe erroneous denial of the challenge for cause or to use aperemptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of theerror--comports with the reality of the jury selection process. Challenges for cause and rulings upon them, as JudgeRymer observed, see supra, at 310, are fast paced, made onthe spot and under pressure. Counsel as well as court, inthat setting, must be prepared to decide, often betweenshades of gray, "by the minute." 146 F. 3d, at 661.In conclusion, we note what this case does not involve. Itis not asserted that the trial court deliberately misappliedthe law in order to force the defendants to use a peremptorychallenge to correct the court's error. See Ross, 487 U. S.,at 91, n. 5. Accordingly, no question is presented herewhether such an error would warrant reversal. Nor did theDistrict Court's ruling result in the seating of any juror whoshould have been dismissed for cause. As we have recognized, that circumstance would require reversal. See id., at85 ("Had [the biased juror] sat on the jury that ultimatelysentenced petitioner to death, and had petitioner properlypreserved his right to challenge the trial court's failure toremove [the juror] for cause, the sentence would have to beoverturned."); see also Parker v.

Martinez-Salazarand his codefendant were accorded 11 peremptory challenges, the exact number Rule 24(b) and (c) allowed in thiscase. Martinez-Salazar received precisely what federal lawprovided; he cannot tenably assert any violation of his FifthAmendment right to due process. SeeRoss, 487 U. S., at91. For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is
