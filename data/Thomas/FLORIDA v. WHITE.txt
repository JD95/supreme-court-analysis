The Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act provides that cer-tain forms of contraband, including motor vehicles used inviolation of the Act's provisions, may be seized and poten-tially forfeited. In this case, we must decide whether theFourth Amendment requires the police to obtain a warrantbefore seizing an automobile from a public place when theyhave probable cause to believe that it is forfeitable contra-band. We hold that it does not.IOn three occasions in July and August 1993, police officersobserved respondent Tyvessel Tyvorus White using his carto deliver cocaine, and thereby developed probable cause tobelieve that his car was subject to forfeiture under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act (Act), Fla. Stat. $ 932.701 etseq. (1997).1 Several months later, the police arrested re-spondent at his place of employment on charges unrelated tothe drug transactions observed in July and August 1993. Atthe same time, the arresting officers, without securing a warrant, seized respondent's automobile in accordance with theprovisions of the Act. See $ 932.703(2)(a).2 They seized theof Virginia, Christine O. Gregoire of Washington, and Gay Woodhouse ofWyoming.Richard J. Troberman and Lisa B. Kemler filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urgingaffirmance.1 That Act provides, in relevant part: "Any contraband article, vessel,motor vehicle, aircraft, other personal property, or real property used inviolation of any provision of the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act, or in,upon, or by means of which any violation of the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act has taken or is taking place, may be seized and shall be forfeited." Fla. Stat. $ 932.703(1)(a) (1997).2 Nothing in the Act requires the police to obtain a warrant priorto seizing a vehicle. See State v. Pomerance, 434 So. 2d 329, 330 (Fla.App. 1983). Rather, the Act simply provides that "[p]ersonal property526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN562 FLORIDA v. WHITEOpinion of the Courtvehicle solely because they believed that it was forfeitableunder the Act. During a subsequent inventory search, thepolice found two pieces of crack cocaine in the ashtray.Based on the discovery of the cocaine, respondent wascharged with possession of a controlled substance in violationof Florida law.At his trial on the possession charge, respondent filed amotion to suppress the evidence discovered during the inventory search. He argued that the warrantless seizure of hiscar violated the Fourth Amendment, thereby making the cocaine the "fruit of the poisonous tree." The trial court initially reserved ruling on respondent's motion, but later denied it after the jury returned a guilty verdict. On appeal,the Florida First District Court of Appeal affirmed. 680So. 2d 550 (1996). Adopting the position of a majority ofstate and federal courts to have considered the question, thecourt rejected respondent's argument that the FourthAmendment required the police to secure a warrant prior toseizing his vehicle. Id., at 554. Because the Florida Su-preme Court and this Court had not directly addressed theissue, the court certified to the Florida Supreme Court thequestion whether, absent exigent circumstances, the war-rantless seizure of an automobile under the Act violated theFourth Amendment. Id., at 555.In a divided opinion, the Florida Supreme Court answeredthe certified question in the affirmative, quashed the FirstDistrict Court of Appeal's opinion, and remanded. 710So. 2d 949, 955 (1998). The majority of the court concludedthat, absent exigent circumstances, the Fourth Amendmentrequires the police to obtain a warrant prior to seizing propmay be seized at the time of the violation or subsequent to the violation,if the person entitled to notice is notified at the time of the seizure . . .that there is a right to an adversarial preliminary hearing after the seizureto determine whether probable cause exists to believe that such propertyhas been or is being used in violation of the Florida Contraband ForfeitureAct." $ 932.703(2)(a).526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN563Cite as: 526 U.

Ac-cording to the court, the fact that the police develop probablecause to believe that such a violation occurred does not,standing alone, justify a warrantless seizure. The court expressly rejected the holding of the Eleventh Circuit, seeUnited States v. Valdes, 876 F. 2d 1554 (1989), and the major-ity of other Federal Circuits to have addressed the sameissue in the context of the federal civil forfeiture law, 21U. S.

U. S. Const., Amdt. 4. In deciding whether a chal-lenged governmental action violates the Amendment, wehave taken care to inquire whether the action was regardedas an unlawful search and seizure when the Amendment wasframed. See Wyoming v. Houghton, ante, at 299; Carroll v.United States, 267 U. S. 132, 149 (1925) ("The Fourth Amend-ment is to be construed in light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted, and in amanner which will conserve public interests as well as theinterests and rights of individual citizens").InCarroll, we held that when federal officers have proba-ble cause to believe that an automobile contains contraband,526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN564 FLORIDA v. WHITEOpinion of the Courtthe Fourth Amendment does not require them to obtain awarrant prior to searching the car for and seizing the contraband. Our holding was rooted in federal law enforcementpractice at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, we looked to laws of the First, Second,and Fourth Congresses that authorized federal officers toconduct warrantless searches of ships and to seize concealedgoods subject to duties. Id., at 150-151 (citing Act of July31, 1789, $$ 24, 29, 1 Stat. 43; Act of Aug. 4, 1790, $ 50, 1 Stat.170; Act of Feb. 18, 1793, $ 27, 1 Stat. 315; Act of Mar. 2,1799, $$ 68-70, 1 Stat. 677, 678). These enactments led usto conclude that "contemporaneously with the adoption of theFourth Amendment," Congress distinguished "the necessityfor a search warrant between goods subject to forfeiture,when concealed in a dwelling house or similar place, and likegoods in course of transportation and concealed in a movablevessel where they readily could be put out of reach of asearch warrant." 267 U. S., at 151.The Florida Supreme Court recognized that under Carroll, the police could search respondent's car, without obtaining a warrant, if they had probable cause to believe that itcontained contraband. The court, however, rejected the argument that the warrantless seizure of respondent's vehicleitself also was appropriate under Carroll and its progeny.It reasoned that "[t]here is a vast difference between permitting the immediate search of a movable automobile based onactual knowledge that it then contains contraband [and] thediscretionary seizure of a citizen's automobile based upon abelief that it may have been used at some time in the past toassist in illegal activity." 710 So. 2d, at 953. We disagree.The principles underlying the rule in Carroll and thefounding-era statutes upon which they are based fully support the conclusion that the warrantless seizure of respondent's car did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Although,as the Florida Supreme Court observed, the police lacked526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN565Cite as: 526 U. S. 559 (1999)Opinion of the Courtprobable cause to believe that respondent's car containedcontraband, see 710 So. 2d, at 953, they certainly had probable cause to believe that the vehicle itself was contrabandunder Florida law.3 Recognition of the need to seize readilymovable contraband before it is spirited away undoubtedlyunderlies the early federal laws relied upon inCarroll. See267 U. S., at 150-152; see also California v. Carney, 471 U. S.386, 390 (1985); South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364,367 (1976). This need is equally weighty when the automobile, as opposed to its contents, is the contraband that thepolice seek to secure.4 Furthermore, the early federal statutes that we looked to in Carroll, like the Florida Contra-band Forfeiture Act, authorized the warrantless seizure ofboth goods subject to duties and the ships upon which thosegoods were concealed. See, e. g., 1 Stat. 43, 46; 1 Stat. 170,174; 1 Stat. 677, 678, 692.In addition to the special considerations recognized in thecontext of movable items, our Fourth Amendment jurispru-dence has consistently accorded law enforcement officialsgreater latitude in exercising their duties in public places.For example, although a warrant presumptively is requiredfor a felony arrest in a suspect's home, the Fourth Amend-ment permits warrantless arrests in public places where anofficer has probable cause to believe that a felony has oc-curred. See United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 416-424(1976). In explaining this rule, we have drawn upon the es3 The Act defines "contraband" to include any "vehicle of any kind, . . .which was used . . . as an instrumentality in the commission of, or in aidingor abetting in the commission of, any felony." $ 932.701(2)(a)(5).4 At oral argument, respondent contended that the delay between thetime that the police developed probable cause to seize the vehicle andwhen the seizure actually occurred undercuts the argument that the warrantless seizure was necessary to prevent respondent from removing thecar out of the jurisdiction. We express no opinion about whether excessive delay prior to a seizure could render probable cause stale, and theseizure therefore unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.526US2 Unit: $U56 [10-14-99 17:11:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN566 FLORIDA v. WHITESouter, J., concurringtablished "distinction between a warrantless seizure in anopen area and such a seizure on private premises."Paytonv. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 587 (1980); see also id., at 586-587("It is also well settled that objects such as weapons or contraband found in a public place may be seized by the policewithout a warrant"). The principle that underlies Watsonextends to the seizure at issue in this case. Indeed, the factsof this case are nearly indistinguishable from those in G. M.Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U. S. 338 (1977). There,we considered whether federal agents violated the FourthAmendment by failing to secure a warrant prior to seizingautomobiles in partial satisfaction of income tax assessments.Id., at 351. We concluded that they did not, reasoning that"[t]he seizures of the automobiles in this case took place onpublic streets, parking lots, or other open places, and did notinvolve any invasion of privacy." Ibid. Here, because thepolice seized respondent's vehicle from a public area--respondent's employer's parking lot--the warrantless seizurealso did not involve any invasion of respondent's privacy.Based on the relevant history and our prior precedent, wetherefore conclude that the Fourth Amendment did not require a warrant to seize respondent's automobile in thesecircumstances.The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed,and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistentwith this opinion.
