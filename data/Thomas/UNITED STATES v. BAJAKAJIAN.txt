Respondent Hosep Bajakajian attempted to leave theUnited States without reporting, as required by federal law,that he was transporting more than $10,000 in currency.Federal law also provides that a person convicted of willfullyviolating this reporting requirement shall forfeit to the Gov-ernment "any property . . . involved in such offense." 18U. S. C. $ 982(a)(1). The question in this case is whether for-feiture of the entire $357,144 that respondent failed to declare would violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the EighthAmendment. We hold that it would, because full forfeitureof respondent's currency would be grossly disproportional tothe gravity of his offense.IOn June 9, 1994, respondent, his wife, and his two daugh-ters were waiting at Los Angeles International Airport toboard a flight to Italy; their final destination was Cyprus.Using dogs trained to detect currency by its smell, customsinspectors discovered some $230,000 in cash in the Bajakaji-ans' checked baggage. A customs inspector approached respondent and his wife and told them that they were requiredto report all money in excess of $10,000 in their possessionor in their baggage. Respondent said that he had $8,000 and*Ronald D.

A search of their carry-onbags, purse, and wallet revealed more cash; in all, customsinspectors found $357,144. The currency was seized andrespondent was taken into custody.A federal grand jury indicted respondent on three counts.Count One charged him with failing to report, as requiredby 31 U. S. C. $ 5316(a)(1)(A),1 that he was transporting morethan $10,000 outside the United States, and with doing so"willfully," in violation of $ 5322(a).2 Count Two chargedhim with making a false material statement to the UnitedStates Customs Service, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1001.Count Three sought forfeiture of the $357,144 pursuant to 18U. S. C. $ 982(a)(1), which provides:"The court, in imposing sentence on a person convictedof an offense in violation of section . . . 5316, . . . shallorder that the person forfeit to the United States anyproperty, real or personal, involved in such offense, orany property traceable to such property." 18 U.

Tr.61-62 (Jan. 19, 1995). The District Court further found thatrespondent had failed to report that he was taking the currency out of the United States because of fear stemmingfrom "cultural differences": Respondent, who had grown upas a member of the Armenian minority in Syria, had a "dis-trust for the Government."Id., at 63; see Tr. of Oral Arg.30.Although $ 982(a)(1) directs sentencing courts to imposefull forfeiture, the District Court concluded that such forfeiture would be "extraordinarily harsh" and "grossly disproportionate to the offense in question," and that it would therefore violate the Excessive Fines Clause. Tr. 63. The courtinstead ordered forfeiture of $15,000, in addition to a sentence of three years of probation and a fine of $5,000--themaximum fine under the Sentencing Guidelines--because thecourt believed that the maximum Guidelines fine was "toolittle" and that a $15,000 forfeiture would "make up for whatI think a reasonable fine should be." Ibid.The United States appealed, seeking full forfeiture of respondent's currency as provided in $ 982(a)(1). The Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 84 F. 3d 334 (1996).Applying Circuit precedent, the court held that, to satisfythe Excessive Fines Clause, a forfeiture must fulfill two conditions: The property forfeited must be an "instrumentality"of the crime committed, and the value of the property mustbe proportional to the culpability of the owner. Id., at 336(citing United States v. Real Property Located in El DoradoCounty, 59 F. 3d 974, 982 (CA9 1995)). A majority of thepanel determined that the currency was not an "instrumentality" of the crime of failure to report because " `[t]he crime[in a currency reporting offense] is the withholding of information, . . . not the possession or the transportation of themoney.' " 84 F. 3d, at 337 (quoting United States v. $69,292524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN327Cite as: 524 U. S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the Courtin United States Currency, 62 F. 3d 1161, 1167 (CA9 1995)).The majority therefore held that $ 982(a)(1) could never satisfy the Excessive Fines Clause in cases involving forfeituresof currency and that it was unnecessary to apply the "proportionality" prong of the test. Although the panel majorityconcluded that the Excessive Fines Clause did not permitforfeiture of any of the unreported currency, it held that itlacked jurisdiction to set the $15,000 forfeiture aside becauserespondent had not cross-appealed to challenge that forfeit-ure. 84 F. 3d, at 338.Judge Wallace concurred in the result. He viewed re-spondent's currency as an instrumentality of the crime because "without the currency, there can be no offense," id., at339, and he criticized the majority for "strik[ing] down a portion of " the statute, id., at 338. He nonetheless agreed thatfull forfeiture would violate the Excessive Fines Clause inrespondent's case, based upon the "proportionality" prong ofthe Ninth Circuit test. Finding no clear error in the District Court's factual findings, he concluded that the reducedforfeiture of $15,000 was proportional to respondent's culpability. Id., at 339-340.Because the Court of Appeals' holding--that the forfeitureordered by $ 982(a)(1) was per se unconstitutional in cases ofcurrency forfeiture--invalidated a portion of an Act of Congress, we granted certiorari. 520 U. S. 1239 (1997).IIThe Eighth Amendment provides: "Excessive bail shallnot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel andunusual punishments inflicted." U. S. Const., Amdt. 8.This Court has had little occasion to interpret, and has neveractually applied, the Excessive Fines Clause. We have,however, explained that at the time the Constitutionwas adopted, "the word `fine' was understood to mean apayment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense."Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN328 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIANOpinion of the CourtInc., 492 U. S. 257, 265 (1989). The Excessive Fines Clausethus "limits the government's power to extract payments,whether in cash or in kind, `as punishment for some of-fense.' "Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 609-610(1993) (emphasis deleted). Forfeitures--payments in kind--are thus "fines" if they constitute punishment for an offense.We have little trouble concluding that the forfeiture of currency ordered by $ 982(a)(1) constitutes punishment. Thestatute directs a court to order forfeiture as an additionalsanction when "imposing sentence on a person convicted of "a willful violation of $ 5316's reporting requirement. Theforfeiture is thus imposed at the culmination of a criminalproceeding and requires conviction of an underlying felony,and it cannot be imposed upon an innocent owner of unreported currency, but only upon a person who has himselfbeen convicted of a $ 5316 reporting violation.3 Cf. id., at619 (holding forfeiture to be a "fine" in part because theforfeiture statute "expressly provide[d] an `innocent owner'defense" and thus "look[ed] . . . like punishment").3 Although the currency reporting statute provides that "a person or anagent or bailee of the person shall file a report," 31 U. S. C. $ 5316(a), thestatute ordering the criminal forfeiture of unreported currency providesthat "[t]he court, in imposing sentence on a person convicted of" failure tofile the required report, "shall order that the person forfeit to the UnitedStates" any property "involved in" or "traceable to" the offense, 18 U. S. C.$ 982(a)(1). The combined effect of these two statutes is that an owner ofunreported currency is not subject to criminal forfeiture if his agent orbailee is the one who fails to file the required report, because such anowner could not be convicted of the reporting offense. The United Statesendorsed this interpretation at oral argument in this case. See Tr. ofOral Arg. 24-25.For this reason, the dissent's speculation about the effect of today's holding on "kingpins" and "cash couriers" is misplaced. See post, at 352, 354.Section 982(a)(1)'s criminal in personam forfeiture reaches only currencyowned by someone who himself commits a reporting crime. It is unlikelythat the Government, in the course of criminally indicting and prosecutinga cash courier, would not bother to investigate the source and true ownership of unreported funds.524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN329Cite as: 524 U. S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe United States argues, however, that the forfeiture ofcurrency under $ 982(a)(1) "also serves important remedialpurposes." Brief for United States 20. The Governmentasserts that it has "an overriding sovereign interest in controlling what property leaves and enters the country." Ibid.It claims that full forfeiture of unreported currency supportsthat interest by serving to "dete[r] illicit movements of cash"and aiding in providing the Government with "valuable information to investigate and detect criminal activities associ-ated with that cash."Id., at 21. Deterrence, however, hastraditionally been viewed as a goal of punishment, andforfeiture of the currency here does not serve the remedialpurpose of compensating the Government for a loss. SeeBlack's Law Dictionary 1293 (6th ed. 1990) ("[R]emedial ac-tion" is one "brought to obtain compensation or indemnity");One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S.232 (1972)(per curiam) (monetary penalty provides "a rea-sonable form of liquidated damages," id., at 237, to theGovernment and is thus a "remedial" sanction because itcompensates Government for lost revenues). Although theGovernment has asserted a loss of information regarding theamount of currency leaving the country, that loss would notbe remedied by the Government's confiscation of respond-ent's $357,144.4The United States also argues that the forfeiture man-dated by $ 982(a)(1) is constitutional because it falls within aclass of historic forfeitures of property tainted by crime.See Brief for United States 16 (citing,inter alia, The Pal4 We do not suggest that merely because the forfeiture of respondent'scurrency in this case would not serve a remedial purpose, other forfeituresmay be classified as nonpunitive (and thus not "fines") if they serve someremedial purpose as well as being punishment for an offense. Even if theGovernment were correct in claiming that the forfeiture of respondent'scurrency is remedial in some way, the forfeiture would still be punitive inpart. (The Government concedes as much.) This is sufficient to bringthe forfeiture within the purview of the Excessive Fines Clause. SeeAustin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 621-622 (1993).524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN330 UNITED STATES v.

In so doing, the Government reliesupon a series of cases involving traditional civil in rem forfeitures that are inapposite because such forfeitures werehistorically considered nonpunitive.The theory behind such forfeitures was the fiction that theaction was directed against "guilty property," rather thanagainst the offender himself.5 See, e. g., Various Items ofPersonal Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577, 581 (1931)("[I]t is the property which is proceeded against, and, byresort to a legal fiction, held guilty and condemned as thoughit were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient"); seealso R. Waples, Proceedings In Rem 13, 205-209 (1882).Historically, the conduct of the property owner was irrelevant; indeed, the owner of forfeited property could be entirely innocent of any crime. See, e. g., Origet v. UnitedStates, 125 U. S. 240, 246 (1888) ("[T]he merchandise is to beforfeited irrespective of any criminal prosecution. . . . Theperson punished for the offence may be an entirely differentperson from the owner of the merchandise, or any personinterested in it. The forfeiture of the goods of the principalcan form no part of the personal punishment of his agent").As Justice Story explained:"The thing is here primarily considered as the offender,or rather the offence is attached primarily to the thing;and this, whether the offence be malum prohibitum, or5 The "guilty property" theory behind in rem forfeiture can be traced tothe Bible, which describes property being sacrificed to God as a means ofatoning for an offense. See Exodus 21:28. In medieval Europe and atcommon law, this concept evolved into the law of deodand, in which offending property was condemned and confiscated by the church or the Crownin remediation for the harm it had caused. See 1 M. Hale, Pleas of theCrown 420-424 (1st Am. ed. 1847); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on theLaws of England 290-292 (1765); O. Holmes, The Common Law 10-13,23-27 (M.

The Palmyra,12 Wheat., at 14-15.Traditional in rem forfeitures were thus not consideredpunishment against the individual for an offense. Seeid., at14; Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, supra, at 401; VanOster v. Kansas, 272 U. S. 465, 467-468 (1926); Calero-Toledov.Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663, 683-684 (1974);Taylor v.

Ursery, 518 U. S.267, 293 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("[C]ivil in remforfeiture is not punishment of the wrongdoer for his criminal offense"). Because they were viewed as nonpunitive,such forfeitures traditionally were considered to occupy aplace outside the domain of the Excessive Fines Clause.Recognizing the nonpunitive character of such proceedings,we have held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not barthe institution of a civil,in rem forfeiture action after thecriminal conviction of the defendant. Seeid., at 278.6The forfeiture in this case does not bear any of the hallmarks of traditional civil in rem forfeitures. The Govern6 It does not follow, of course, that all modern civil in rem forfeitures arenonpunitive and thus beyond the coverage of the Excessive Fines Clause.Because some recent federal forfeiture laws have blurred the traditionaldistinction between civil in rem and criminal in personam forfeiture, wehave held that a modern statutory forfeiture is a "fine" for Eighth Amendment purposes if it constitutes punishment even in part, regardless ofwhether the proceeding is styled in rem or in personam. See Austin v.United States, supra, at 621-622 (although labeled in rem, civil forfeitureof real property used "to facilitate" the commission of drug crimes waspunitive in part and thus subject to review under the Excessive FinesClause).524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN332 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIANOpinion of the Courtment has not proceeded against the currency itself, but hasinstead sought and obtained a criminal conviction of respondent personally. The forfeiture serves no remedial purpose,is designed to punish the offender, and cannot be imposedupon innocent owners.Section 982(a)(1) thus descends not from historic in remforfeitures of guilty property, but from a different historicaltradition: that of in personam, criminal forfeitures. Suchforfeitures have historically been treated as punitive, beingpart of the punishment imposed for felonies and treason inthe Middle Ages and at common law. See W. McKechnie,Magna Carta 337-339 (2d ed. 1958); 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, The History of English Law 460-466 (2d ed. 1909). Although in personam criminal forfeitures were well established in England at the time of the founding, they wererejected altogether in the laws of this country until veryrecently.77 The First Congress explicitly rejected in personam forfeitures as punishments for federal crimes, see Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, $ 24, 1 Stat.117 ("[N]o conviction or judgment . . . shall work corruption of blood, orany forfeiture of estate"), and Congress reenacted this ban several timesover the course of two centuries. See Rev. Stat. $ 5326 (1875); Act of Mar.4, 1909, ch. 321, $ 341, 35 Stat. 1159; Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 645, $ 3563,62 Stat. 837, codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 3563 (1982 ed.); repealed effectiveNov. 1, 1987, Pub.

See Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 18 U. S. C. $ 1963, andComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21U. S. C. $ 848(a). In providing for this mode of punishment, which hadlong been unused in this country, the Senate Judiciary Committee acknowledged that "criminal forfeiture . . . represents an innovative attemptto call on our common law heritage to meet an essentially modern problem." S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 79 (1969). Indeed, it was not until 1992 thatCongress provided for the criminal forfeiture of currency at issue here.See 18 U. S.

S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe Government specifically contends that the forfeitureof respondent's currency is constitutional because it involvesan "instrumentality" of respondent's crime.8 According tothe Government, the unreported cash is an instrumentalitybecause it "does not merely facilitate a violation of law," butis " `the very sine qua non of the crime.' " Brief for UnitedStates 20 (quoting United States v. United States Currencyin the Amount of One Hundred Forty-Five Thousand, OneHundred Thirty-Nine Dollars, 18 F. 3d 73, 75 (CA2), cert.denied sub nom. Etim v. United States, 513 U. S. 815 (1994)).The Government reasons that "there would be no violationat all without the exportation (or attempted exportation) ofthe cash." Brief for United States 20.Acceptance of the Government's argument would requireus to expand the traditional understanding of instrumentality forfeitures. This we decline to do. Instrumentalitieshistorically have been treated as a form of "guilty property"that can be forfeited in civil in rem proceedings. In thiscase, however, the Government has sought to punish respondent by proceeding against him criminally, in personam,rather than proceeding in rem against the currency. It istherefore irrelevant whether respondent's currency is aninstrumentality; the forfeiture is punitive, and the test for8 Although the term "instrumentality" is of recent vintage, see Austinv. United States, 509 U. S., at 627-628 (Scalia, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment), it fairly characterizes property that historicallywas subject to forfeiture because it was the actual means by which anoffense was committed. See infra this page; see, e. g., J. W. Goldsmith,Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 505, 508-510 (1921). "Instrumentality" forfeitures have historically been limited to the property actuallyused to commit an offense and no more. See Austin v. United States,supra, at 627-628 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A forfeiture that reaches beyond this strict historical limitationis ipso facto punitive and therefore subject to review under the ExcessiveFines Clause.524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN334 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIANOpinion of the Courtthe excessiveness of a punitive forfeiture involves solelya proportionality determination. See infra this page and335-337.9 IIIBecause the forfeiture of respondent's currency constitutespunishment and is thus a "fine" within the meaning ofthe Excessive Fines Clause, we now turn to the questionwhether it is "excessive."AThe touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Ex-cessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportionality: Theamount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to thegravity of the offense that it is designed to punish. SeeAustin v. United States, 509 U. S., at 622-623 (noting Courtof Appeals' statement that " `the government is exacting toohigh a penalty in relation to the offense committed' "); Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 559 (1993) ("It is inthe light of the extensive criminal activities which petitionerapparently conducted . . . that the question whether the for-feiture was `excessive' must be considered"). Until today,however, we have not articulated a standard for determiningwhether a punitive forfeiture is constitutionally excessive.We now hold that a punitive forfeiture violates the ExcessiveFines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity ofa defendant's offense.9 The currency in question is not an instrumentality in any event. TheCourt of Appeals reasoned that the existence of the currency as a "precondition" to the reporting requirement did not make it an "instrumentality"of the offense. See 84 F. 3d 334, 337 (CA9 1996). We agree; the currencyis merely the subject of the crime of failure to report. Cash in a suitcasedoes not facilitate the commission of that crime as, for example, an automobile facilitates the transportation of goods concealed to avoid taxes.See, e. g., J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, supra, at 508.In the latter instance, the property is the actual means by which the criminal act is committed. See Black's Law Dictionary 801 (6th ed. 1990) ("Instrumentality" is "[s]omething by which an end is achieved; a means,medium, agency").524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN335Cite as: 524 U. S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe text and history of the Excessive Fines Clause demon-strate the centrality of proportionality to the excessivenessinquiry; nonetheless, they provide little guidance as to howdisproportional a punitive forfeiture must be to the gravityof an offense in order to be "excessive." Excessive meanssurpassing the usual, the proper, or a normal measure ofproportion. See 1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of theEnglish Language (1828) (defining excessive as "beyond thecommon measure or proportion"); S. Johnson, A Dictionaryof the English Language 680 (4th ed. 1773) ("[b]eyond thecommon proportion"). The constitutional question that weaddress, however, is just how proportional to a criminal offense a fine must be, and the text of the Excessive FinesClause does not answer it.Nor does its history. The Clause was little discussed inthe First Congress and the debates over the ratification ofthe Bill of Rights. As we have previously noted, the Clausewas taken verbatim from the English Bill of Rights of 1689.See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S., at 266-267. That document's prohibi-tion against excessive fines was a reaction to the abuses ofthe King's judges during the reigns of the Stuarts, id., at267, but the fines that those judges imposed were describedcontemporaneously only in the most general terms. SeeEarl of Devonshire's Case, 11 State Tr. 1367, 1372 (H. L.1689) (fine of #30,000 "excessive and exorbitant, againstMagna Charta, the common right of the subject, and the lawof the land"). Similarly, Magna Charta--which the Stuartjudges were accused of subverting--required only thatamercements (the medieval predecessors of fines) should beproportioned to the offense and that they should not deprivea wrongdoer of his livelihood:"A Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault,but after the manner of the fault; and for a great faultafter the greatness thereof, saving to him his contene-ment; (2) and a Merchant likewise, saving to him his524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN336 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIANOpinion of the Courtmerchandise; (3) and any other's villain than ours shallbe likewise amerced, saving his wainage." MagnaCharta, 9 Hen. III, ch. 14 (1225), 1 Stat. at Large 6-7(1762 ed.).None of these sources suggests how disproportional to thegravity of an offense a fine must be in order to be deemedconstitutionally excessive.We must therefore rely on other considerations in derivinga constitutional excessiveness standard, and there are twothat we find particularly relevant. The first, which we haveemphasized in our cases interpreting the Cruel and UnusualPunishments Clause, is that judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong in the first instanceto the legislature. See,e. g., Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277,290 (1983) ("Reviewing courts . . . should grant substantialdeference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarilypossess in determining the types and limits of punishmentsfor crimes"); see also Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386,393 (1958) ("Whatever views may be entertained regardingseverity of punishment, . . . these are peculiarly questions oflegislative policy"). The second is that any judicial determination regarding the gravity of a particular criminal offensewill be inherently imprecise. Both of these principles counsel against requiring strict proportionality between theamount of a punitive forfeiture and the gravity of a criminaloffense, and we therefore adopt the standard of gross dispro-portionality articulated in our Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause precedents. See, e. g., Solem v. Helm, supra,at 288;Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 271 (1980).In applying this standard, the district courts in the firstinstance, and the courts of appeals, reviewing the propor-tionality determination de novo,10 must compare the amount10 At oral argument, respondent urged that a district court's determination of excessiveness should be reviewed by an appellate court for abuseof discretion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. We cannot accept this submission.The factual findings made by the district courts in conducting the exces524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN337Cite as: 524 U. S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the Courtof the forfeiture to the gravity of the defendant's offense. Ifthe amount of the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to thegravity of the defendant's offense, it is unconstitutional.BUnder this standard, the forfeiture of respondent's entire$357,144 would violate the Excessive Fines Clause.11 Respondent's crime was solely a reporting offense. It was per-missible to transport the currency out of the country so longas he reported it. Section 982(a)(1) orders currency to beforfeited for a "willful" violation of the reporting requirement. Thus, the essence of respondent's crime is a willfulfailure to report the removal of currency from the UnitedStates.12 Furthermore, as the District Court found, resiveness inquiry, of course, must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574-575 (1985). But thequestion whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for the application of a constitutional standard to the facts of a particular case, and inthis context de novo review of that question is appropriate. See Ornelasv. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 697 (1996).11 The only question before this Court is whether the full forfeiture ofrespondent's $357,144 as directed by $ 982(a)(1) is constitutional under theExcessive Fines Clause. We hold that it is not. The Government petitioned for certiorari seeking full forfeiture, and we reject that request.Our holding that full forfeiture would be excessive reflects no judgmentthat "a forfeiture of even $15,001 would have suffered from a gross disproportion," nor does it "affir[m] the reduced $15,000 forfeiture on de novoreview." Post, at 349. Those issues are simply not before us. Nor, indeed, do we address in any respect the validity of the forfeiture orderedby the District Court, including whether a court may disregard the termsof a statute that commands full forfeiture: As noted, supra, at 327, respondent did not cross-appeal the $15,000 forfeiture ordered by the District Court. The Court of Appeals thus declined to address the $15,000forfeiture, and that question is not properly presented here either.12 Contrary to the dissent's contention, the nature of the nonreportingoffense in this case was not altered by respondent's "lies" or by the "suspicious circumstances" surrounding his transportation of his currency. Seepost, at 352-353. A single willful failure to declare the currency constitutes the crime, the gravity of which is not exacerbated or mitigated by524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN338 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIANOpinion of the Courtspondent's violation was unrelated to any other illegal activities. The money was the proceeds of legal activity and wasto be used to repay a lawful debt. Whatever his other vices,respondent does not fit into the class of persons for whomthe statute was principally designed: He is not a moneylaunderer, a drug trafficker, or a tax evader.13 See Brieffor United States 2-3. And under the Sentencing Guidelines, the maximum sentence that could have been imposedon respondent was six months, while the maximum finewas $5,000.

See post,at 352. The Government indicted respondent under 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 for"lying," but that separate count did not form the basis of the nonreportingoffense for which $ 982(a)(1) orders forfeiture.Further, the District Court's finding that respondent's lies stemmedfrom a fear of the Government because of "cultural differences," supra, at326, does not mitigate the gravity of his offense. We reject the dissent'scontention that this finding was a "patronizing excuse" that "demeans millions of law-abiding American immigrants by suggesting they cannot beexpected to be as truthful as every other citizen." Post, at 353. We areconfident that the District Court concurred in the dissent's incontrovertible proposition that "[e]ach American, regardless of culture or ethnicity,is equal before the law." Ibid. The District Court did nothing whatsoever to imply that "cultural differences" excuse lying, but rather madethis finding in the context of establishing that respondent's willful failureto report the currency was unrelated to any other crime--a finding highlyrelevant to the determination of the gravity of respondent's offense. Thedissent's charge of ethnic paternalism on the part of the District Courtfinds no support in the record, nor is there any indication that the DistrictCourt's factual finding that respondent "distrust[ed] . . . the Government,"see supra, at 326, was clearly erroneous.13 Nor, contrary to the dissent's repeated assertion, see post, at 344, 346-351, 354, 356, is respondent a "smuggl[er]." Respondent owed no customsduties to the Government, and it was perfectly legal for him to possessthe $357,144 in cash and to remove it from the United States. His crimewas simply failing to report the wholly legal act of transporting hiscurrency.524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN339Cite as: 524 U. S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the Court(Nov. 1994). Such penalties confirm a minimal level ofculpability.14The harm that respondent caused was also minimal. Failure to report his currency affected only one party, the Government, and in a relatively minor way. There was no fraudon the United States, and respondent caused no loss to thepublic fisc. Had his crime gone undetected, the Governmentwould have been deprived only of the information that$357,144 had left the country. The Government and the dissent contend that there is a correlation between the amountforfeited and the harm that the Government would have suffered had the crime gone undetected. See Brief for UnitedStates 30 (forfeiture is "perfectly calibrated"); post, at 344 ("afine calibrated with this accuracy"). We disagree. There isno inherent proportionality in such a forfeiture. It is impossible to conclude, for example, that the harm respondentcaused is anywhere near 30 times greater than that causedby a hypothetical drug dealer who willfully fails to reporttaking $12,000 out of the country in order to purchase drugs.Comparing the gravity of respondent's crime with the$357,144 forfeiture the Government seeks, we conclude thatsuch a forfeiture would be grossly disproportional to the14 In considering an offense's gravity, the other penalties that the Legislature has authorized are certainly relevant evidence. Here, as the Government and the dissent stress, Congress authorized a maximum fine of$250,000 plus five years' imprisonment for willfully violating the statutoryreporting requirement, and this suggests that it did not view the reportingoffense as a trivial one. That the maximum fine and Guideline sentenceto which respondent was subject were but a fraction of the penalties authorized, however, undercuts any argument based solely on the statute,because they show that respondent's culpability relative to other potentialviolators of the reporting provision--tax evaders, drug kingpins, or moneylaunderers, for example--is small indeed. This disproportion is tellingnotwithstanding the fact that a separate Guideline provision permitsforfeiture if mandated by statute, see post, at 350-351. That Guideline,moreover, cannot override the constitutional requirement of proportionality review.524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN340 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIANOpinion of the Courtgravity of his offense.15 It is larger than the $5,000 fine im-posed by the District Court by many orders of magnitude,and it bears no articulable correlation to any injury sufferedby the Government.CFinally, we must reject the contention that the proportion-ality of full forfeiture is demonstrated by the fact that theFirst Congress enacted statutes requiring full forfeiture ofgoods involved in customs offenses or the payment of monetary penalties proportioned to the goods' value. It is arguedthat the enactment of these statutes at roughly the sametime that the Eighth Amendment was ratified suggests thatfull forfeiture, in the customs context at least, is a proportional punishment. The early customs statutes, however, donot support such a conclusion because, unlike $ 982(a)(1), thetype of forfeiture that they imposed was not considered pun-ishment for a criminal offense.Certain of the early customs statutes required the forfeit-ure of goods imported in violation of the customs laws, and,in some instances, the vessels carrying them as well. See,e. g., Act of Aug. 4, 1790, $ 27, 1 Stat. 163 (goods unladenwithout a permit from the collector). These forfeitures,however, were civil in rem forfeitures, in which the Govern-ment proceeded against the property itself on the theorythat it was guilty, not against a criminal defendant. See,e. g., Harford v. United States, 8 Cranch 109 (1814) (goodsunladen without a permit); Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch339, 340 (1813) (same). Such forfeitures sought to vindicatethe Government's underlying property right in customs duties, and like other traditional in rem forfeitures, they werenot considered at the founding to be punishment for anoffense. See supra, at 330-331. They therefore indicate15 Respondent does not argue that his wealth or income are relevant tothe proportionality determination or that full forfeiture would deprive himof his livelihood, see supra, at 335-336, and the District Court made nofactual findings in this respect.524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN341Cite as: 524 U. S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the Courtnothing about the proportionality of the punitive forfeitureat issue here. See supra, at 330-332.16Other statutes, however, imposed monetary "forfeitures"proportioned to the value of the goods involved. See, e. g.,Act of July 31, 1789, $ 22, 1 Stat. 42 (if an importer, "withdesign to defraud the revenue," did not invoice his goods attheir actual cost at the place of export, "all such goods, waresor merchandise, or the value thereof . . . shall be forfeited");$ 25, id., at 43 (any person concealing or purchasing goods,knowing they were liable to seizure for violation of the customs laws, was liable to "forfeit and pay a sum double thevalue of the goods so concealed or purchased"); see also Actof Aug. 4, 1790, $$ 10, 14, 22, id., at 156, 158, 161. Similarstatutes were passed in later Congresses. See, e. g., Act ofMar. 2, 1799, $$ 24, 28, 45, 46, 66, 69, 79, 84, id., at 646, 648,661, 662, 677, 678, 687, 694; Act of Mar. 3, 1823, ch. 58, $ 1, 3Stat. 781.These "forfeitures" were similarly not considered punishments for criminal offenses. This Court so recognized inStockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531 (1871), a case interpreting a statute that, like the Act of July 31, 1789, providedthat a person who had concealed goods liable to seizure forcustoms violations should "forfeit and pay a sum double theamount or value of the goods." Act of Mar. 3, 1823, ch. 58,$ 2, 3 Stat. 781-782. TheStockwell Court rejected the de16 The nonpunitive nature of these early forfeitures was not lost on theDepartment of Justice, in commenting on the punitive forfeiture provisionsof the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970:" `The concept of forfeiture as a criminal penalty which is embodied inthis provision differs from other presently existing forfeiture provisionsunder Federal statutes where the proceeding is in rem against the property and the thing which is declared unlawful under the statute, or whichis used for an unlawful purpose, or in connection with the prohibited property or transaction, is considered the offender, and the forfeiture is nopart of the punishment for the criminal offense. Examples of such forfeiture provisions are those contained in the customs, narcotics, and revenue laws.' " S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 79 (1969) (emphasis added).524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN342 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIANOpinion of the Courtfendant's contention that this provision was "penal," statinginstead that it was "fully as remedial in its character, designed as plainly to secure [the] rights [of the Government],as are the statutes rendering importers liable to duties." 13Wall., at 546. The Court reasoned:"When foreign merchandise, subject to duties, is im-ported into the country, the act of importation imposeson the importer the obligation to pay the legal charges.Besides this the goods themselves, if the duties be notpaid, are subject to seizure . . . . Every act, therefore,which interferes with the right of the government toseize and appropriate the property which has been for-feited to it . . . is a wrong to property rights, and is a fitsubject for indemnity." Ibid.Significantly, the fact that the forfeiture was a multiple ofthe value of the goods did not alter the Court's conclusion:"The act of abstracting goods illegally imported, re-ceiving, concealing, or buying them, interposes difficulties in the way of a government seizure, and impairs,therefore, the value of the government right. It is,then, hardly accurate to say that the only loss the gov-ernment can sustain from concealing the goods liable toseizure is their single value . . . . Double the value maynot be more than complete indemnity." Id., at 546-547.The early monetary forfeitures, therefore, were considerednot as punishment for an offense, but rather as serving theremedial purpose of reimbursing the Government for thelosses accruing from the evasion of customs duties.17 They17 In each of the statutes from the early Congresses cited by the dissent,the activities giving rise to the monetary forfeitures, if undetected, werelikely to cause the Government losses in customs revenue. The forfeitureimposed by the Acts of Aug. 4, 1790, and Mar. 2, 1799, was not simply for"transferring goods from one ship to another," post, at 346, but rather fordoing so "before such ship . . . shall come to the proper place for thedischarge of her cargo . . . and be there duly authorized by the properofficer or officers of the customs to unlade" the goods, see 1 Stat. 157,524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN343Cite as: 524 U. S. 321 (1998)Opinion of the Courtwere thus no different in purpose and effect than the in remforfeitures of the goods to whose value they were proportioned.18 Cf. One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States,409 U. S., at 237 (customs statute requiring the forfeiture ofundeclared goods concealed in baggage and imposing a monetary penalty equal to the value of the goods imposed a "remedial, rather than [a] punitive sanctio[n]").19 By contrast,158, 648, whereupon duties would be assessed. Similarly, the forfeitureimposed by the Act of Mar. 3, 1823, was for failing to deliver the ship'smanifest of cargo--which was to list "merchandise subject to duty"--tothe collector of customs. See Act of Mar. 2, 1821, $ 1, 3 Stat. 616; Act ofMar. 3, 1823, $ 1, id., at 781. And the "invoices" that if "false" gave riseto the forfeiture imposed by the Act of Mar. 3, 1863, were to include thevalue or quantity of any dutiable goods. $ 1, 12 Stat. 737-738.18 The nonpunitive nature of the monetary forfeitures was also reflectedin their procedure: like traditional in rem forfeitures, they were broughtas civil actions, and as such are distinguishable from the punitive criminalfine at issue here. Instead of instituting an information of libel in remagainst the goods, see, e. g., Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339 (1813),the Government filed "a civil action of debt" against the person from whomit sought payment. See, e. g., Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531,541-542 (1871). In both England and the United States, an action of debtwas used to recover import duties owed the Government, being "the general remedy for the recovery of all sums certain, whether the legal liabilityarise from contract, or be created by a statute. And the remedy as welllies for the government itself, as for a citizen." United States v. Lyman,26 F. Cas. 1024, 1030 (No. 15,647) (CC Mass. 1818) (Story, C. J.). Thussuits for the payment of monetary forfeitures were viewed no differentlythan suits for the customs duties themselves.19 One Lot Emerald Cut Stones differs from this case in the most fundamental respect. We concluded that the forfeiture provision in EmeraldCut Stones was entirely remedial and thus nonpunitive, primarily becauseit "provide[d] a reasonable form of liquidated damages" to the Government. 409 U. S., at 237. The additional fact that such a remedial forfeiture also "serves to reimburse the Government for investigation and enforcement expenses," ibid.; see post, at 346, is essentially meaningless,because even a clearly punitive criminal fine or forfeiture could be said insome measure to reimburse for criminal enforcement and investigation.Contrary to the dissent's assertion, this certainly does not mean that theforfeiture in this case--which, as the dissent acknowledges, see post, at344 (respondent's forfeiture is a "fine"); post, at 353 ($ 982(a)(1) imposes a524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN344 UNITED STATES v.
