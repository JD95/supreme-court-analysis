L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, forthe purpose of "seek[ing] the eradication of organized crimein the United States," id., at 923. Congress found that "organized crime in the United States [had become] a highlysophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drain[ed] billions of dollars from America's economyby unlawful conduct and the illegal use of force, fraud, andcorruption." Id., at 922. The result was to "weaken thestability of the Nation's economic system, harm innocentinvestors and competing organizations, interfere with freecompetition, seriously burden interstate and foreign commerce, threaten the domestic security, and undermine thegeneral welfare of the Nation and its citizens."Id., at 923.Finding the existing "sanctions and remedies available tothe Government [to be] unnecessarily limited in scope andimpact," Congress resolved to address the problem of organized crime "by strengthening the legal tools in theevidence-gathering process, by establishing new penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced sanctions and new reme-dies to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged inorganized crime."

Sabato, Harry Olstein, Freder-ick C. Mezey, and Joseph S. Littenberg, are former seniorofficers and directors of SIG. Until 1990, when it declaredbankruptcy, SIG was a Florida insurance holding companywith three operating subsidiaries, each of which was engagedin the business of writing surety bonds for constructioncontractors.Beginning in or around 1987, certain directors and officersof SIG, including respondents, began engaging in acts ofracketeering. They created an entity called ConstructionPerformance Corporation, which demanded fees from con-tractors in exchange for qualifying them for SIG suretybonds. Respondents also diverted corporate funds to per-sonal uses and submitted false financial statements to regulators, shareholders, and creditors. During most of the timehe was employed at SIG, petitioner was unaware of theseactivities. In early 1988, however, petitioner discovered re-spondents' unlawful conduct and contacted regulators concerning the financial statements. Respondents then orches-trated a scheme to remove petitioner from the company.They hired an insurance consultant to write a false reportsuggesting that petitioner had failed to perform his materialduties. The day after this report was presented to the SIGboard of directors, the board fired petitioner, relying on aclause in his contract providing for termination in the eventof an "inability or substantial failure to perform [his] material duties."

With respectto this last claim, petitioner's theory was that his injury wasproximately caused by an overt act--namely, the termination of his employment--done in furtherance of respondents'conspiracy, and that $ 1964(c) therefore provided a cause ofaction. Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that employees who are terminated for refusing toparticipate in RICO activities, or who threaten to reportRICO activities, do not have standing to sue under RICO fordamages from their loss of employment. The District Courtagreed and dismissed petitioner's RICO conspiracy claim.The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a cause of actionunder $ 1964(c) for a violation of $ 1962(d) is not available toa person injured by an overt act in furtherance of a RICOconspiracy unless the overt act is an act of racketeering.162 F. 3d 1090, 1098 (CA11 1998). Since the overt act thatallegedly caused petitioner's injury was not an act of racketeering, see $ 1961(1), it could not support a civil cause ofaction. The court held, "RICO was enacted with an expresstarget--racketeering activity--and only those injuries thatare proximately caused by racketeering activity should beactionable under the statute." Ibid.55 Although petitioner alleged violations of $$ 1962(a), (b), and (c), theCourt of Appeals concluded that he had presented no evidence of violations of subsections (a) and (b). It therefore treated each of petitioner'ssubstantive RICO claims as alleging a violation of $ 1962(c). 162 F. 3d,at 1095, n. 8. The court held that petitioner did not present evidenceregarding elements of his $ 1962(c) claims and therefore affirmed theDistrict Court's order granting summary judgment for respondents withrespect to those claims.

The majority of theCircuits to consider this question have answered it in thenegative. See, e. g., Bowman v. Western Auto Supply Co.,985 F. 2d 383, 388 (CA8), cert. denied, 508 U.

CommerceClearing House, Inc., 897 F. 2d 21, 25 (CA2 1990). OtherCircuits have allowed RICO conspiracy claims where theovert act was, as in the instant case, merely the termination of employment, and was not, therefore, racketeeringactivity.

Section 1964(c) states that a cause ofaction is available to anyone "injured . . . by reason of aviolation of section 1962." Section 1962(d) makes it unlawfulfor a person "to conspire to violate any of the provisions ofsubsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." To determine whatit means to be "injured . . . by reason of " a "conspir[acy],"we turn to the well-established common law of civil conspiracy.

S. 322, 329 (1981).6By the time of RICO's enactment in 1970, it was widelyaccepted that a plaintiff could bring suit for civil conspiracyonly if he had been injured by an act that was itself tortious.See, e. g., 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 876, Comment b(1977) ("The mere common plan, design or even expressagreement is not enough for liability in itself, and there mustbe acts of a tortious character in carrying it into execution");W.

See post, at 510-511, n. 5(dissenting opinion). However, his quotations omit pertinent language.When read in context, it is clear that these passages refer to harm, notfrom any overt act, but only from overt acts that are themselves tortious.Compare ibid. with Adler v.

PRUPISOpinion of the CourtThe principle that a civil conspiracy plaintiff must claiminjury from an act of a tortious character was so widely accepted at the time of RICO's adoption as to be incorporatedin the common understanding of "civil conspiracy." See Ballentine's Law Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 1969) ("It is the civilwrong resulting in damage, and not the conspiracy whichconstitutes the cause of action"); Black's Law Dictionary 383(4th ed. 1968) ("[W]here, in carrying out the design of theconspirators, overt acts are done causing legal damage, theperson injured has a right of action" (emphasis added)). Wepresume, therefore, that when Congress established in RICOa civil cause of action for a person "injured . . . by reasonof " a "conspir[acy]," it meant to adopt these well-establishedcommon-law civil conspiracy principles.Justice Stevens does not challenge our view that Congress meant to incorporate common-law principles when itadopted RICO. Nor does he attempt to make an affirmativecase from the common law for his reading of the statute bypointing to a case in which there was (a) an illegal agreement; (b) injury proximately caused to the plaintiff by anontortious overt act in furtherance of the agreement; and(c) recovery by the plaintiff. Seepost, at 508. Instead, heargues only that courts, authoritative commentators, andeven dictionaries repeatedly articulated a rule with no meaning or application.8 We find this argument to be implausible472, 479 (CADC 1983) (stating that civil conspiracy requires "an overttortious act in furtherance of the agreement that causes injury. . . . Sinceliability for civil conspiracy depends on performance of some underlyingtortious act, the conspiracy is not independently actionable; rather, it is ameans for establishing vicarious liability for the underlying tort").8 We disagree, moreover, with Justice Stevens' interpretation of thegrounds for decision in some of the cases we have cited. For example,Justice Stevens reads Mills v. Hansell, 378 F. 2d 53 (CA5 1967) (percuriam), and Chapman v. Pollock, 148 F. Supp. 769, 772 (WD Mo. 1957),to deny recovery for conspiracy because the defendants had not enteredinto an unlawful agreement. See post, at 508-509. We think the opinions, and the language cited from these opinions by Justice Stevens,529US2 Unit: $U51 [09-26-01 10:31:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN505Cite as: 529 U. S. 494 (2000)Opinion of the Courtand, accordingly, understand RICO to adopt the common-lawprinciples we have cited. Interpreting the statute in a waythat is most consistent with these principles, we concludethat injury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO, see n. 7, supra,is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under$ 1964(c) for a violation of $ 1962(d). As at common law, acivil conspiracy plaintiff cannot bring suit under RICO basedon injury caused byany act in furtherance of a conspiracythat might have caused the plaintiff injury. Rather, consist-ency with the common law requires that a RICO conspiracyplaintiff allege injury from an act that is analogous to an"ac[t] of a tortious character," see 4 Restatement (Second) ofTorts $ 876, Comment b, meaning an act that is independmake clear that recovery was denied because the defendants had committed no actionable tort, regardless of whether they agreed to commitany such act. See ibid. Likewise, Justice Stevens reads J. & C. Ornamental Iron Co. v. Watkins, 114 Ga. App. 688, 691, 152 S. E. 2d 613, 615(1966), to deny recovery because the plaintiff had suffered no injury.However, in that case, the plaintiff's conspiracy claim was predicated onseveral alleged torts including fraud, trespass, and malicious interference.Ibid. While the court held that the plaintiff could not recover for conspiracy to maliciously interfere because he had suffered no injury, the plaintiff's remaining conspiracy allegations were insufficient because the plaintiff did not allege "all the elements of a cause of action for the tort thesame as would be required if there were no allegation of a conspiracy."Ibid. Further, Justice Stevens chides us for citing cases in which thecourt allowed recovery. But in two of these cases the court explicitlygrounded its decision on the fact that the plaintiff had identified an actionable independent tort on which the conspiracy claim could be based. SeeCohen v. Bowdoin, 288 A. 2d 106, 110 (Me. 1972) ("[I]f [the plaintiff's conspiracy claim] is to be upheld as stating a claim upon which relief can begranted, it must be on the ground that the complaint sufficiently allegesthe actual commission of the separate and independent tort of defamationagainst the plaintiff"); Middlesex Concrete Products & Excavating Corp.v. Carteret Indus. Assn., 37 N. J. 507, 516, 181 A. 2d 774, 779 (1962) (holdingthat the plaintiffs stated a claim for conspiracy because they alleged anactionable tort). In short, we think that there is ample evidence of thecommon-law rule we have cited.529US2 Unit: $U51 [09-26-01 10:31:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN506 BECK v. PRUPISOpinion of the Courtently wrongful under RICO. The specific type of act that isanalogous to an act of a tortious character may depend onthe underlying substantive violation the defendant is allegedto have committed.9 However, respondents' alleged overtact in furtherance of their conspiracy is not independentlywrongful under any substantive provision of the statute.Injury caused by such an act is not, therefore, sufficient togive rise to a cause of action under $ 1964(c).10Petitioner challenges this view of the statute under thelongstanding canon of statutory construction that terms in astatute should not be construed so as to render any provisionof that statute meaningless or superfluous. He asserts thatunder our view of the statute, any person who had a claimfor a violation of $ 1962(d) would necessarily have a claimfor a violation of $ 1962(a), (b), or (c). However, contrary topetitioner's assertions, our interpretation of $ 1962(d) doesnot render it mere surplusage. Under our interpretation, aplaintiff could, through a $ 1964(c) suit for a violation of9 For example, most courts of appeals have adopted the so-called investment injury rule, which requires that a plaintiff suing for a violation of$ 1962(a) allege injury from the defendant's "use or invest[ment]" of incomederived from racketeering activity, see $ 1962(a). See, e. g., Crowe v.Henry, 43 F. 3d 198, 205 (CA5 1995); Vemco, Inc. v. Camardella, 23 F. 3d129, 132 (CA6) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1017 (1994). Although we express no view on this issue, arguably a plaintiff suing for aviolation of $ 1962(d) based on an agreement to violate $ 1962(a) is requiredto allege injury from the "use or invest[ment]" of illicit proceeds.10 Respondents argue that a $ 1962(d) claim must be predicated on anactionable violation of $$ 1962(a)-(c). However, the merit of this view isa different (albeit related) issue from the one on which we granted certiorari, namely, whether a plaintiff can bring a $ 1962(d) claim for injury flowing from an overt act that is not an act of racketeering. Therefore, contrary to Justice Stevens' suggestion, see post, at 511-512, we do notresolve whether a plaintiff suing under $ 1964(c) for a RICO conspiracymust allege an actionable violation under $$ 1962(a)-(c), or whether it issufficient for the plaintiff to allege an agreement to complete a substantiveviolation and the commission of at least one act of racketeering that causedhim injury.529US2 Unit: $U51 [09-26-01 10:31:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN507Cite as: 529 U.
