This case concerns the scope of 18 U. S. C. $ 3501, the stat-ute governing the admissibility of confessions in federalprosecutions. Respondent contends that $ 3501(c), whichprovides that a custodial confession made by a person withinsix hours following his arrest "shall not be inadmissiblesolely because of delay in bringing such person" before a511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT352 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZOpinion of the Courtfederal magistrate, rendered inadmissible the custodialstatement he made more than six hours after his arrest onstate criminal charges. We conclude, however, that $ 3501(c)does not apply to statements made by a person who is beingheld solely on state charges. Accordingly, we reverse thejudgment of the Court of Appeals.IOn Friday, August 5, 1988, officers of the Los AngelesSheriff 's Department obtained a warrant to search respondent's residence for heroin and other evidence of narcotics dis-tribution. While executing the warrant later that day, theofficers discovered not only narcotics, but $2,260 in counter-feit Federal Reserve Notes. Respondent was arrested andbooked on state felony narcotics charges at approximately5:40 p.m. He spent the weekend in custody.On Monday morning, August 8, the Sheriff 's Departmentinformed the United States Secret Service of the counterfeitcurrency found in respondent's residence. Two Secret Serv-ice agents arrived at the Sheriff 's Department shortly beforemidday to take possession of the currency and to interviewrespondent. Using a deputy sheriff as an interpreter, theagents informed respondent of his rights under Miranda v.Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). After waiving these rights,respondent admitted that he had known that the currencywas counterfeit. The agents arrested respondent shortlythereafter, took him to the Secret Service field office forbooking, and prepared a criminal complaint. Due to conges-tion in the Federal Magistrate's docket, respondent was notpresented on the federal complaint until the following day.1Respondent was indicted for unlawful possession of counterfeit currency in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 472. Prior totrial, he moved to suppress the statement he had made dur1 For reasons that are not apparent from the record, respondent wasnever arraigned or prosecuted by the State of California on the statedrug charges.511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT353Cite as: 511 U.

He ar-gued that his confession was made without a voluntary andknowing waiver of his Miranda rights, and that the delaybetween his arrest on state charges and his presentment onthe federal charge rendered his confession inadmissibleunder 18 U. S. C. $ 3501(c).2 The District Court rejected2 Title 18 U. S. C. $ 3501 provides:"(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States or by theDistrict of Columbia, a confession, as defined in subsection (e) hereof, shallbe admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given. Before such confessionis received in evidence, the trial judge shall, out of the presence of thejury, determine any issue as to voluntariness. If the trial judge determines that the confession was voluntarily made it shall be admitted inevidence . . . ."(b) The trial judge in determining the issue of voluntariness shall takeinto consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, including (1) the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment ofthe defendant making the confession, if it was made after arrest and before arraignment . . . ."The presence or absence of any of the above-mentioned factors to betaken into consideration by the judge need not be conclusive on the issueof voluntariness of the confession."(c) In any criminal prosecution by the United States or by the Districtof Columbia, a confession made or given by a person who is a defendanttherein, while such person was under arrest or other detention in thecustody of any law-enforcement officer or law-enforcement agency, shallnot be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing such person beforea magistrate or other officer empowered to commit persons charged withoffenses against the laws of the United States or of the District of Columbia if such confession is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and if the weight to be given the confession is left to the jury andif such confession was made or given by such person within six hoursimmediately following his arrest or other detention: Provided, That thetime limitation contained in this subsection shall not apply in any case inwhich the delay in bringing such person before such magistrate or otherofficer beyond such six-hour period is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available such magistrate or other officer."(d) Nothing contained in this section shall bar the admission in evidence of any confession made or given voluntarily by any person to anyother person without interrogation by anyone, or at any time at which511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT354 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZOpinion of the Courtboth contentions and denied the motion. Respondent subse-quently was convicted after a jury trial at which the statement was admitted into evidence.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitvacated the conviction. 975 F. 2d 1396 (1992). The courtfirst outlined the exclusionary rule developed by this Courtin a line of cases including McNabb v. United States, 318U. S. 332 (1943), andMallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449(1957). The so-called McNabb-Mallory rule, adopted bythis Court "[i]n the exercise of its supervisory authority overthe administration of criminal justice in the federal courts,"McNabb, supra, at 341, generally rendered inadmissible con-fessions made during periods of detention that violated theprompt presentment requirement of Rule 5(a) of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure. SeeMallory, supra, at 453.Rule 5(a) provides that a person arrested for a federal offense shall be taken "without unnecessary delay" before thenearest federal magistrate, or before a state or local judicialofficer authorized to set bail for federal offenses under 18U. S. C. $ 3041, for a first appearance, or presentment.The Ninth Circuit went on to discuss the interrelated pro-visions of 18 U. S. C. $ 3501 and the decisions of the Courtsof Appeals that have sought to discern the extent to whichthis statute curtailed theMcNabb-Mallory rule. Section3501(a), the court observed, states that a confession "shall beadmitted in evidence" if voluntarily made, and $ 3501(b) listsseveral nonexclusive factors that the trial judge should consider when making the voluntariness determination, includ-ing "the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment ofthe defendant making the confession, if it was made afterarrest and before arraignment." Section 3501(c) providesthe person who made or gave such confession was not under arrest orother detention."(e) As used in this section, the term `confession' means any confessionof guilt of any criminal offense or any self-incriminating statement madeor given orally or in writing."511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT355Cite as: 511 U. S. 350 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthat a confession made by a person within six hours followinghis arrest or other detention "shall not be inadmissible"solely because of delay in presenting the person to a federalmagistrate. The Ninth Circuit construed $ 3501(c) as precluding suppression under McNabb-Mallory of any confes-sion made during this "safe harbor" period following arrest.975 F. 2d, at 1399. The court then reasoned that, by nega-tive implication, $ 3501(c) must in some circumstances allowsuppression of a confession made more than six hours afterarrest solely on the basis of pre-presentment delay, "regardless of the voluntariness of the confession." Id., at 1401.The court thus concluded that theMcNabb-Mallory rule, ineither a pure or slightly modified form, applies to confessionsmade after the expiration of the safe harbor period.Turning to the facts of the case before it, the court determined that $ 3501(c) applied to respondent's statement be-cause respondent was in custody and had not been presentedto a magistrate at the time of the interview. The court con-cluded that the statement fell outside the subsection's safeharbor because it was not made until Monday afternoon,nearly three days after respondent's arrest on state charges.975 F. 2d, at 1405, and n. 8 (citing United States v. Fouche,776 F. 2d 1398, 1406 (CA9 1985)). Because the statementwas not made within the $ 3501(c) safe harbor period, thecourt applied both its pure and modified versions of theMcNabb-Mallory rule and held that, under either approach,the confession should have been suppressed. 975 F. 2d, at1405-1406.We granted the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari in order to consider the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of$ 3501. 510 U. S. 912 (1993).IIThe parties argue at some length over the proper interpre-tation of subsections (a) and (c) of 18 U. S. C. $ 3501, and,in particular, over the question whether $ 3501(c) requires511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT356 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZOpinion of the Courtsuppression of a confession that is made by an arrestee priorto presentment and more than six hours after arrest, regardless of whether the confession was voluntarily made. TheGovernment contends that through $ 3501, Congress repudiated the McNabb-Mallory rule in its entirety. Under thistheory, $ 3501(c) creates a safe harbor that prohibits suppression on grounds of pre-presentment delay if a confessionis made within six hours following arrest, but says nothing about the admissibility of a confession given beyond that6-hour period. The admissibility of such a confession, theGovernment argues, is controlled by $ 3501(a), which pro-vides that voluntary confessions "shall be admitted inevidence."Largely agreeing with the Ninth Circuit, respondent contends that $ 3501(c) codified a limited form of the McNabb-Mallory rule--one that requires the suppression of a confession made before presentment but after the expiration of thesafe harbor period. A contrary interpretation of $ 3501(c),respondent argues, would render that subsection meaning-less in the face of $ 3501(a).As the parties recognize, however, we need not addresssubtle questions of statutory construction concerning thesafe harbor set out in $ 3501(c), or resolve any tension be-tween the provisions of that subsection and those of$ 3501(a), if we determine that the terms of $ 3501(c) werenever triggered in this case. We turn, then, to that threshold inquiry.When interpreting a statute, we look first and foremost toits text. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,253-254 (1992). Section 3501(c) provides that in any federalcriminal prosecution,"a confession made or given by a person who is a defend-ant therein, while such person was under arrest or otherdetention in the custody of any law-enforcement officeror law-enforcement agency, shall not be inadmissiblesolely because of delay in bringing such person before a511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT357Cite as: 511 U. S. 350 (1994)Opinion of the Courtmagistrate or other officer empowered to commit per-sons charged with offenses against the laws of theUnited States or of the District of Columbia if such con-fession is found by the trial judge to have been madevoluntarily and if . . . such confession was made or givenby such person within six hours immediately followinghis arrest or other detention."Respondent contends that he was under "arrest or other de-tention" for purposes of $ 3501(c) during the interview at theSheriff 's Department, and that his statement to the SecretService agents constituted a confession governed by thissubsection. In respondent's view, it is irrelevant that hewas in the custody of the local authorities, rather than thatof the federal agents, when he made the statement. Be-cause the statute applies to persons in the custody of "any"law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency, respond-ent suggests that the $ 3501(c) 6-hour time period beginsto run whenever a person is arrested by local, state, orfederal officers.We believe respondent errs in placing dispositive weighton the broad statutory reference to "any" law enforcementofficer or agency without considering the rest of the statute.Section 3501(c) provides that, if certain conditions are met,a confession made by a person under "arrest or other deten-tion" shall not be inadmissible in a subsequent federal prosecution "solely because of delay in bringing such person be-fore a magistrate or other officer empowered to commitpersons charged with offenses against the laws of the UnitedStates or of the District of Columbia." 18 U. S. C. $ 3501(c)(emphasis added). Clearly, the terms of the subsection canapply only when there is some "delay" in presentment. Because "delay" is not defined in the statute, we must construethe term "in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning." FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476 (1994). To delay is"[t]o postpone until a later time" or to "put off an action"; adelay is a "postponement." American Heritage Dictionary511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT358 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZOpinion of the Court493 (3d ed. 1992). The term presumes an obligation to act.Thus, there can be no "delay" in bringing a person before afederal magistrate until, at a minimum, there is some obligation to bring the person before such a judicial officer in thefirst place. Plainly, a duty to present a person to a federalmagistrate does not arise until the person has been arrestedfor a federal offense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a) (requiring initial appearance before a federal magistrate).3Until a person is arrested or detained for a federal crime,there is no duty, obligation, or reason to bring him before ajudicial officer "empowered to commit persons charged withoffenses against the laws of the United States," and therefore, no "delay" under $ 3501(c) can occur.In short, it is evident "from the context in which [thephrase] is used," Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132(1993), that the "arrest or other detention" of which the subsection speaks must be an "arrest or other detention" for aviolation of federal law. If a person is arrested and held ona federal charge by "any" law enforcement officer--federal,state, or local--that person is under "arrest or other detention" for purposes of $ 3501(c) and its 6-hour safe harbor period. If, instead, the person is arrested and held on statecharges, $ 3501(c) does not apply, and the safe harbor is notimplicated. This is true even if the arresting officers (who,when the arrest is for a violation of state law, almost certainly will be agents of the State or one of its subdivisions)believe or have cause to believe that the person also mayhave violated federal law. Such a belief, which may not beuncommon given that many activities are criminalized underboth state and federal law, does not alter the underlyingbasis for the arrest and subsequent custody. As long as aperson is arrested and held only on state charges by state orlocal authorities, the provisions of $ 3501(c) are not triggered.3 As we observed in Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449 (1957), Rule5(a) is part of "[t]he scheme for initiating a federal prosecution." Id., at454 (emphasis added).511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT359Cite as: 511 U. S. 350 (1994)Opinion of the CourtIn this case, respondent was under arrest on state narcot-ics charges at the time he made his inculpatory statement tothe Secret Service agents. The terms of $ 3501(c) thus didnot come into play until respondent was arrested by theagents on a federal charge--after he made the statement.Because respondent's statement was made voluntarily, asthe District Court found, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, noth-ing in $ 3501 authorized its suppression. See 18 U. S. C.$$ 3501(a), (d). The State's failure to arraign or prosecuterespondent does not alter this conclusion. Although Congress could have provided that the exercise of prosecutorialdiscretion by the State in this scenario retroactively transforms time spent in the custody of state or local officers intotime spent under "arrest or other detention" for purposes of$ 3501(c), it did not do so in the statute as written. Cf. Ger-main, 503 U. S., at 253-254.Although we think proper application of $ 3501(c) will beas straightforward in most cases as it is here, the partiesidentify one presumably rare scenario that might presentsome potential for confusion; namely, the situation thatwould arise if state or local authorities, acting in collusionwith federal officers, were to arrest and detain someone inorder to allow the federal agents to interrogate him in viola-tion of his right to a prompt federal presentment. Long before the enactment of $ 3501, we held that a confession ob-tained during such a period of detention must be suppressedif the defendant could demonstrate the existence of impropercollaboration between federal and state or local officers.See Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350 (1943).4 In this4 In Anderson, a local sheriff, acting without authority under state law,arrested several men suspected of dynamiting federally owned power linesduring the course of a labor dispute and allowed them to be interrogatedfor several days by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Onlyafter the suspects made confessions were they arrested by the federalagents and arraigned before a United States Commissioner. We held theconfessions to be inadmissible as the "improperly" secured product of animpermissible "working arrangement" between state and federal officers.318 U. S., at 356.511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT360 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZOpinion of the Courtcase, however, we need not address $ 3501's effect, if any, onthe rule announced in Anderson. The District Court concluded that there was "no evidence" that a "collusive arrangement between state and federal agents . . . caused [respondent's] confession to be made," App. to Pet. for Cert.50a, and we see no reason to disturb that factual finding. Itis true that the Sheriff 's Department informed the SecretService agents that counterfeit currency had been found inrespondent's possession, but such routine cooperation between local and federal authorities is, by itself, wholly unobjectionable: "Only by such an interchange of information cansociety be adequately protected against crime." UnitedStates v. Coppola, 281 F. 2d 340, 344 (CA2 1960) (en banc),aff 'd, 365 U. S. 762 (1961). Cf. Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S.121, 123 (1959).5IIIFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.
