Parts I and II-A, concluding that Social Security claimants who exhaustadministrative remedies need not also exhaust issues in a request forreview by the Appeals Council in order to preserve judicial review ofthose issues. Although administrative issue-exhaustion requirementsare largely creatures of statute, there is no contention that any statuterequires such exhaustion here. It is also common for an agency's regulations to require issue exhaustion in administrative appeals, but SocialSecurity Administration (SSA) regulations do not. This Court has required issue exhaustion even in the absence of a statute or regulation,but the reason for doing so does not apply here. The desirability of ajudicially imposed issue-exhaustion requirement depends on the degreeto which the analogy to normal adversarial litigation applies in a particular administrative proceeding. See Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S.552, 556. Where that proceeding is not adversarial, the reasons for acourt to require issue exhaustion are much weaker than where the parties are expected to develop the issues themselves. Pp. 106-110.Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, andJustice Ginsburg, concluded in Part II-B that the differences between courts and agencies are nowhere more pronounced than in SocialSecurity proceedings, which are inquisitorial rather than adversarial.The ALJ's duty is to investigate the facts and develop the arguments530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN104 SIMS v. APFELOpinion of the Courtboth for and against granting benefits, and the Council's review is similarly broad. The regulations expressly provide that the SSA conductsthe administrative review process in an informal, nonadversary manner.As the Council, not the claimant, has primary responsibility for identifying and developing the issues, the general issue-exhaustion rule makeslittle sense in this context. Pp. 110-112.Justice O'Connor concluded that the SSA's failure to notify claimants of an issue exhaustion requirement is a sufficient basis for holdingthat such exhaustion is not required in this context. Requiring issueexhaustion is inappropriate here, where the SSA's regulations and procedures affirmatively suggest that specific issues need not be raised before the Appeals Council.

S. 103 (2000)Opinion of the Courtbefore seeking judicial review of that denial, request thatthe Social Security Appeals Council review his claim. Thequestion is whether a claimant pursuing judicial review haswaived any issues that he did not include in that request.We hold that he has not. IIn 1994, petitioner Juatassa Sims filed applications for dis-ability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 49Stat. 622, 42 U. S. C. $ 401 et seq., and for supplemental secu-rity income benefits under Title XVI of that Act, 86 Stat.1465, 42 U. S. C. $ 1381 et seq. She alleged disability from avariety of ailments, including degenerative joint diseases andcarpal tunnel syndrome. After a state agency denied herclaims, she obtained a hearing before a Social Security ALJ.See generally Heckler v. Day, 467 U. S. 104, 106-107 (1984)(describing stages of review of claims for Social Security benefits). The ALJ, in 1996, also denied her claims, concludingthat, although she did have some medical impairments, shehad not been and was not under a "disability," as defined inthe Act. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 423(d) (1994 ed. and Supp. III)and 1382c(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. III); Sullivan v. Zebley, 493U. S. 521, 524-526 (1990).Petitioner then requested that the Social Security AppealsCouncil review her claims. A claimant may request suchreview by completing a one-page form provided by the So-cial Security Administration (SSA)--Form HA-520--or "byany other writing specifically requesting review." 20 CFR$ 422.205(a) (1999). Petitioner, through counsel, chose thelatter option, submitting to the Council a letter arguing thatthe ALJ had erred in several ways in analyzing the evidence.The Council denied review.Next, petitioner filed suit in the District Court for theNorthern District of Mississippi. She contended that (1) theALJ had made selective use of the record; (2) the questionsthe ALJ had posed to a vocational expert to determine peti-tioner's ability to work were defective because they omitted530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN106 SIMS v. APFELOpinion of the Courtseveral of petitioner's ailments; and (3) in light of certainpeculiarities in the medical evidence, the ALJ should haveordered a consultative examination. The District Court re-jected all of these contentions. App. 74-84.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 200F. 3d 229 (1998). That court affirmed on the merits withregard to petitioner's first contention. With regard to thesecond and third contentions, it concluded that, under its decision in Paul v. Shalala, 29 F. 3d 208, 210 (1994), it lackedjurisdiction because petitioner had not raised those contentions in her request for review by the Appeals Council. Wegranted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1018 (1999), to resolve a conflictamong the Courts of Appeals over whether a Social Securityclaimant waives judicial review of an issue if he fails to exhaust that issue by presenting it to the Appeals Council inhis request for review. ComparePaul, supra, at 210; Jamesv. Chater, 96 F. 3d 1341, 1343-1344 (CA10 1996), with Harwood v. Apfel, 186 F. 3d 1039, 1042-1043 (CA8 1999); Johnsonv.Apfel, 189 F. 3d 561, 563-564 (CA7 1999).1IIAThe Social Security Act provides that "[a]ny individual,after any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing to which he was a party, . . . mayobtain a review of such decision by a civil action" in federaldistrict court. 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g). But the Act does notdefine "final decision," instead leaving it to the SSA to givemeaning to that term through regulations. See $ 405(a);Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 766 (1975). SSA regulations provide that, if the Appeals Council grants review of aclaim, then the decision that the Council issues is the Com1 We agree with the parties that, even were a court-imposed issueexhaustion requirement proper, the Fifth Circuit erred in treating it asjurisdictional. Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 328 (1976).530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN107Cite as: 530 U. S. 103 (2000)Opinion of the Courtmissioner's final decision. But if, as here, the Council deniesthe request for review, the ALJ's opinion becomes the finaldecision. See 20 CFR $$ 404.900(a)(4)-(5), 404.955, 404.981,422.210(a) (1999).2 If a claimant fails to request reviewfrom the Council, there is no final decision and, as a result,no judicial review in most cases. See $ 404.900(b); Bowenv. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467, 482-483 (1986). Inadministrative-law parlance, such a claimant may not obtainjudicial review because he has failed to exhaust administra-tive remedies. SeeSalfi, supra, at 765-766.The Commissioner rightly concedes that petitioner exhausted administrative remedies by requesting review bythe Council. Petitioner thus obtained a final decision, andnothing in $ 405(g) or the regulations implementing it barsjudicial review of her claims.Nevertheless, the Commissioner contends that we shouldrequire issue exhaustion in addition to exhaustion of remedies. That is, he contends that a Social Security claimant,to obtain judicial review of an issue, not only must obtaina final decision on his claim for benefits, but also must spec-ify that issue in his request for review by the Council.(Whether a claimant must exhaust issues before the ALJ isnot before us.) The Commissioner argues, in particular,that an issue-exhaustion requirement is "an important corol-lary" of any requirement of exhaustion of remedies. Brieffor Respondent 13. We think that this is not necessarily soand that the corollary is particularly unwarranted in thiscase.Initially, we note that requirements of administrative issueexhaustion are largely creatures of statute. Marine Mammal Conservancy, Inc. v. Department of Agriculture, 134F. 3d 409, 412 (CADC 1998). Our cases addressing issue2 Part 404 of 20 CFR (1999) applies to Title II of the Act. The regulations governing Title XVI, which can be found at 20 CFR pt. 416 (1999),are, as relevant here, not materially different. We will therefore omitreferences to the latter regulations.530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN108 SIMS v. APFELOpinion of the Courtexhaustion reflect this fact. For example, in Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U. S. 645 (1982), we heldthat the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review objections not raised before the National Labor Relations Board.We so held because a statute provided that " `[n]o objectionthat has not been urged before the Board . . . shall be considered by the court.' " Id., at 665 (quoting 29 U. S. C. $ 160(e)(1982 ed.)). Our decision in FPC v. Colorado Interstate GasCo., 348 U. S. 492, 497-498 (1955), followed similar reasoning.See also United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,344 U. S. 33, 36, n. 6 (1952) (collecting statutes); Washington Assn. for Television and Children v. FCC, 712 F. 2d677, 681-682, and n. 6 (CADC 1983) (interpreting issueexhaustion requirement in 47 U. S. C. $ 405 (1982 ed.) andcollecting statutes). Here, the Commissioner does not contend that any statute requires issue exhaustion in the request for review.Similarly, it is common for an agency's regulations to require issue exhaustion in administrative appeals. See, e. g.,20 CFR $ 802.211(a) (1999) (petition for review to BenefitsReview Board must "lis[t] the specific issues to be consideredon appeal"). And when regulations do so, courts reviewingagency action regularly ensure against the bypassing of thatrequirement by refusing to consider unexhausted issues.See, e. g., South Carolina v. United States Dept. of Labor,795 F. 2d 375, 378 (CA4 1986); Sears, Roebuck and Co. v.FTC, 676 F. 2d 385, 398, n. 26 (CA9 1982). Yet, SSA regulations do not require issue exhaustion. (Although the question is not before us, we think it likely that the Commissionercould adopt a regulation that did require issue exhaustion.)It is true that we have imposed an issue-exhaustion requirement even in the absence of a statute or regulation.But the reason we have done so does not apply here. Thebasis for a judicially imposed issue-exhaustion requirement isan analogy to the rule that appellate courts will not consider530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN109Cite as: 530 U. S. 103 (2000)Opinion of the Courtarguments not raised before trial courts. As the Courtexplained inHormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552 (1941):"Ordinarily an appellate court does not give consider-ation to issues not raised below. For our proceduralscheme contemplates that parties shall come to issue inthe trial forum vested with authority to determine questions of fact. This is essential in order that parties mayhave the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues which the trial tribunal isalone competent to decide; it is equally essential in orderthat litigants may not be surprised on appeal by finaldecision there of issues upon which they have had noopportunity to introduce evidence. And the basic reasons which support this general principle applicable totrial courts make it equally desirable that parties shouldhave an opportunity to offer evidence on the general is-sues involved in the less formal proceedings before administrative agencies entrusted with the responsibilityof fact finding."Id., at 556.As we further explained in L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, courtsrequire administrative issue exhaustion "as a general rule"because it is usually "appropriate under [an agency's] prac-tice" for "contestants in an adversary proceeding" before itto develop fully all issues there. 344 U. S., at 36-37. (Wealso spoke favorably of issue exhaustion inUnemploymentCompensation Comm'n of Alaska v. Aragon, 329 U. S. 143,154-155 (1946), without relying on any statute or regulation,but in that case the waived issue had not been raised beforethe District Court, seeid., at 149, 155.)But, as Hormel and L. A. Tucker Truck Lines suggest,the desirability of a court imposing a requirement of issueexhaustion depends on the degree to which the analogy tonormal adversarial litigation applies in a particular administrative proceeding. Cf. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S.185, 193 (1969) (application of doctrine of exhaustion of ad530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN110 SIMS v. APFELOpinion of Thomas, J.ministrative remedies "requires an understanding of its pur-poses and of the particular administrative scheme involved");Salfi, 422 U. S., at 765 (same). Where the parties are ex-pected to develop the issues in an adversarial administrativeproceeding, it seems to us that the rationale for requiringissue exhaustion is at its greatest. Hormel, L. A. TuckerTruck Lines, and Aragon each involved an adversarialproceeding. SeeHormel, supra, at 554, 556; L. A. TuckerTruck Lines, supra, at 36; Aragon v. Unemployment Compensation Comm'n of Alaska, 149 F. 2d 447, 449-452 (CA91945), aff 'd in part and rev'd in part, 329 U. S. 143 (1946).(In Hormel, we allowed an exception to the issue-exhaustionrequirement. 312 U. S., at 560.) Where, by contrast, an administrative proceeding is not adversarial, we think the rea-sons for a court to require issue exhaustion are much weaker.More generally, we have observed that "it is well settled thatthere are wide differences between administrative agenciesand courts," Shepard v. NLRB, 459 U. S. 344, 351 (1983), andwe have thus warned against reflexively "assimilat[ing] therelation of . . . administrative bodies and the courts to therelationship between lower and upper courts,"FCC v. Potts-ville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 144 (1940).BThe differences between courts and agencies are nowheremore pronounced than in Social Security proceedings. Although "[m]any agency systems of adjudication are based toa significant extent on the judicial model of decisionmaking,"2 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise $ 9.10,p. 103 (3d ed. 1994), the SSA is "[p]erhaps the best exampleof an agency" that is not, B. Schwartz, Administrative Law469-470 (4th ed. 1994). See id., at 470 ("The most importantof [the SSA's modifications of the judicial model] is the re-placement of normal adversary procedure by . . . the `investigatory model' " (quoting Friendly, Some Kind of Hearing, 123U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1290 (1975))). Social Security proceed530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN111Cite as: 530 U. S. 103 (2000)Opinion of Thomas, J.ings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. It is theALJ's duty to investigate the facts and develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits, see Richardsonv.Perales, 402 U. S. 389, 400-401 (1971), and the Council'sreview is similarly broad. The Commissioner has no repre-sentative before the ALJ to oppose the claim for benefits,and we have found no indication that he opposes claimantsbefore the Council. See generally Dubin, TorquemadaMeets Kafka: The Misapplication of the Issue ExhaustionDoctrine to Inquisitorial Administrative Proceedings, 97Colum. L. Rev. 1289, 1301-1305, 1325-1329 (1997).The regulations make this nature of SSA proceedingsquite clear. They expressly provide that the SSA "conduct[s] the administrative review process in an informal,nonadversary manner." 20 CFR $ 404.900(b) (1999). Theypermit--but do not require--the filing of a brief with theCouncil (even when the Council grants review), $ 404.975, andthe Council's review is plenary unless it states otherwise,$ 404.976(a). See also $ 404.900(b) ("[W]e will consider ateach step of the review process any information you presentas well as all the information in our records"). The Commissioner's involvement in the Appeals Council's decisionwhether to grant review appears to be not as a litigantopposing the claimant, but rather just as an adviser tothe Council regarding which cases are good candidates forthe Council to review pursuant to its authority to review acase sua sponte. See $$ 404.969(b)-(c); Perales, supra, at403. The regulations further make clear that the Councilwill "evaluate the entire record," including "new and material evidence," in determining whether to grant review.$ 404.970(b). Similarly, the notice of decision that ALJ's provide unsuccessful claimants informs them that if they request review, the Council will "consider all of [the ALJ's]decision, even the parts with which you may agree," and thatthe Council might review the decision "even if you do notask it to do so." App. 25-27. Finally, Form HA-520, which530US1 Unit: $U67 [10-22-01 18:25:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN112 SIMS v. APFELOpinion of O'Connor, J.the Commissioner considers adequate for the Council's pur-poses in determining whether to review a case, see$ 422.205(a), provides only three lines for the request for re-view, and a notice accompanying the form estimates that itwill take only 10 minutes to "read the instructions, gatherthe necessary facts and fill out the form." The form therefore strongly suggests that the Council does not dependmuch, if at all, on claimants to identify issues for review.Given that a large portion of Social Security claimants eitherhave no representation at all or are represented by non-attorneys, see Dubin,supra, at 1294, n. 29, the lack of suchdependence is entirely understandable.Thus, theHormel analogy to judicial proceedings is at itsweakest in this area. The adversarial development of issuesby the parties--the "com[ing] to issue," 312 U. S., at 556--on which that analogy depends simply does not exist. TheCouncil, not the claimant, has primary responsibility foridentifying and developing the issues. We therefore agreewith the Eighth Circuit that "the general rule [of issueexhaustion] makes little sense in this particular context."Harwood, 186 F. 3d, at 1042.Accordingly, we hold that a judicially created issueexhaustion requirement is inappropriate. Claimants whoexhaust administrative remedies need not also exhaust issues in a request for review by the Appeals Council in orderto preserve judicial review of those issues. The judgmentof the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings.
