This case presents the issue whether federal courts pos-sess ancillary jurisdiction over new actions in which a federaljudgment creditor seeks to impose liability for a money judg-ment on a person not otherwise liable for the judgment. Wehold that they do not. IRespondent Jack L. Thomas is a former employee of Tru-Tech, Inc. In 1987, Thomas filed an ERISA class action infederal court against Tru-Tech and petitioner D. Grant Pea-cock, an officer and shareholder of Tru-Tech, for benefits dueunder the corporation's pension benefits plan. Thomas al-leged primarily that Tru-Tech and Peacock breached theirfiduciary duties to the class in administering the plan. TheDistrict Court found that Tru-Tech had breached its fiduciary duties, but ruled that Peacock was not a fiduciary. OnNovember 28, 1988, the District Court entered judgment inthe amount of $187,628.93 against Tru-Tech only. Thomasv. Tru-Tech, Inc., No. 87-2243-3 (D. S. C.).

THOMASOpinion of the Courtcute the judgment while the case was on appeal and, duringthat time, Peacock settled many of Tru-Tech's accounts withfavored creditors, including himself.Af ter the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment,Thomas unsuccessfully attempted to collect the judgmentfrom Tru-Tech. Thomas then sued Peacock in federal court,claiming that Peacock had entered into a civil conspiracy tosiphon assets from Tru-Tech to prevent satisfaction of theERISA judgment.1 Thomas also claimed that Peacockfraudulently conveyed Tru-Tech's assets in violation of SouthCarolina and Pennsylvania law. Thomas later amendedhis complaint to assert a claim for "Piercing the CorporateVeil Under ERISA and Applicable Federal Law." App. 49.The District Court ultimately agreed to pierce the corporateveil and entered judgment against Peacock in the amountof $187,628.93--the precise amount of the judgment againstTru-Tech--plus interest and fees, notwithstanding the factthat Peacock's alleged fraudulent transfers totaled no morethan $80,000. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding thatthe District Court properly exercised ancillary jurisdictionover Thomas' suit. 39 F. 3d 493 (CA4 1994).

C. $ 1001 et seq., as the source of federal jurisdictionfor this suit. The District Court did not expressly rule onsubject-matter jurisdiction, but found that Thomas had prop-erly stated a claim under ERISA for piercing the corporateveil. We disagree. We are not aware of, and Thomas doesnot point to, any provision of ERISA that provides for imposing liability for an extant ERISA judgment against athird party. SeeMackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 833 (1988) ("ERISA does notprovide an enforcement mechanism for collecting judg-ments . . .").We reject Thomas' suggestion, not made in the DistrictCourt, that this subsequent suit arose under $ 502(a)(3) ofERISA, which authorizes civil actions for "appropriate eq-uitable relief " to redress violations of ERISA or the termsof an ERISA plan. 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3). Thomas' com-plaint in this lawsuit alleged no violation of ERISA or of theplan. The wrongdoing alleged in the complaint occurred in1989 and 1990, some four to five years after Tru-Tech'sERISA plan was terminated, and Thomas did not--indeed,could not--allege that Peacock was a fiduciary to the terminated plan.3 Thomas further concedes that Peacock'salleged wrongdoing "did not occur with respect to the administration or operation of the plan." Brief for Respondent 11.Under the circumstances, we think Thomas failed to allege aclaim under $ 502(a)(3) for equitable relief. Section 502(a)(3)"does not, after all, authorize `appropriate equitable relief 'at large, but only `appropriate equitable relief ' for the pur-pose of `redress[ing any] violations or . . . enforc[ing] anyprovisions' of ERISA or an ERISA plan." Mertens v.Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 253 (1993) (emphasis andmodifications in original).Moreover, Thomas' veil-piercing claim does not state acause of action under ERISA and cannot independently sup3 The District Court in the original ERISA suit ruled that Peacock wasnot a fiduciary to Tru-Tech's plan.516us2$24n 10-24-98 18:14:07 PAGES OPINPGT354 PEACOCK v. THOMASOpinion of the Courtport federal jurisdiction. Even if ERISA permits a plaintiffto pierce the corporate veil to reach a defendant not otherwise subject to suit under ERISA, Thomas could invoke thejurisdiction of the federal courts only by independently alleging a violation of an ERISA provision or term of the plan.4Piercing the corporate veil is not itself an independentERISA cause of action, "but rather is a means of imposingliability on an underlying cause of action." 1 C. Keating &G. O'Gradney, Fletcher Cyclopedia of Law of Private Corporations $ 41, p. 603 (perm. ed. 1990). Because Thomas al-leged no "underlying" violation of any provision of ERISAor an ERISA plan, neither ERISA's jurisdictional provision,29 U. S. C. $ 1132(e)(1), nor 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 supplied the District Court with subject-matter jurisdiction over this suit.IIIThomas also contends that this lawsuit is ancillary to theoriginal ERISA suit.5 We have recognized that a federalcourt may exercise ancillary jurisdiction "(1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are, in varying respectsand degrees, factually interdependent; and (2) to enable acourt to function successfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees."Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U. S. 375, 379-380(1994) (citations omitted). Thomas has not carried his burden of demonstrating that this suit falls within either cate4 This case is not at all like Anderson v. Abbott, 321 U. S. 349 (1944),cited by Thomas' amici, in which the receiver of a federal bank, havingobtained a judgment against the bank, then sued the bank's shareholdersto hold them liable for the judgment. In Anderson, federal jurisdictionwas founded upon a federal law, 12 U. S. C. $$ 63, 64 (repealed), whichspecifically made shareholders of an undercapitalized federal bank liableup to the par value of their stock, regardless of the amount actuallyinvested.5 Congress codified much of the common-law doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction as part of "supplemental jurisdiction" in 28 U. S. C. $ 1367.516us2$24n 10-24-98 18:14:07 PAGES OPINPGT355Cite as: 516 U. S. 349 (1996)Opinion of the Courtgory. See id., at 377 (burden rests on party assertingjurisdiction).A"[A]ncillary jurisdiction typically involves claims by a de-fending party haled into court against his will, or by anotherperson whose rights might be irretrievably lost unless hecould assert them in an ongoing action in a federal court."Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 376(1978). Ancillary jurisdiction may extend to claims having afactual and logical dependence on "the primary lawsuit,"ibid., but that primary lawsuit must contain an independentbasis for federal jurisdiction. The court must have jurisdic-tion over a case or controversy before it may assert jurisdiction over ancillary claims. See Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383U. S. 715, 725 (1966). In a subsequent lawsuit involvingclaims with no independent basis for jurisdiction, a federalcourt lacks the threshold jurisdictional power that existswhen ancillary claims are asserted in the same proceeding asthe claims conferring federal jurisdiction. SeeKokkonen,supra, at 380-381; H. C. Cook Co. v. Beecher, 217 U. S. 497,498-499 (1910). Consequently, claims alleged to be factuallyinterdependent with and, hence, ancillary to claims broughtin an earlier federal lawsuit will not support federal jurisdic-tion over a subsequent lawsuit. The basis of the doctrine ofancillary jurisdiction is the practical need "to protect legalrights or effectively to resolve an entire, logically entwinedlawsuit." Kroger, 437 U. S., at 377. But once judgmentwas entered in the original ERISA suit, the ability to resolvesimultaneously factually intertwined issues vanished. As inKroger, "neither the convenience of litigants nor considera-tions of judicial economy" can justify the extension of ancillary jurisdiction over Thomas' claims in this subsequent pro-ceeding.Ibid.In any event, there is insufficient factual dependence between the claims raised in Thomas' first and second suitsto justify the extension of ancillary jurisdiction. Thomas'516us2$24n 10-24-98 18:14:07 PAGES OPINPGT356 PEACOCK v. THOMASOpinion of the Courtfactual allegations in this suit are independent from thoseasserted in the ERISA suit, which involved Peacock's andTru-Tech's status as plan fiduciaries and their alleged wrong-doing in the administration of the plan. The facts relevantto this complaint are limited to allegations that Peacockshielded Tru-Tech's assets from the ERISA judgment longafter Tru-Tech's plan had been terminated. The claims inthese cases have little or no factual or logical interdependence, and, under these circumstances, no greater efficiencieswould be created by the exercise of federal jurisdiction overthem. See Kokkonen, supra, at 380.BThe focus of Thomas' argument is that his suit to extendliability for payment of the ERISA judgment from Tru-Techto Peacock fell under the District Court's ancillary enforce-ment jurisdiction. We have reserved the use of ancillaryjurisdiction in subsequent proceedings for the exercise ofa federal court's inherent power to enforce its judgments.Without jurisdiction to enforce a judgment entered by a fed-eral court, "the judicial power would be incomplete and entirely inadequate to the purposes for which it was conferredby the Constitution."Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall. 166,187 (1868). In defining that power, we have approved theexercise of ancillary jurisdiction over a broad range ofsupplementary proceedings involving third parties to assistin the protection and enforcement of federal judgments--including attachment, mandamus, garnishment, and the prejudgment avoidance of fraudulent conveyances. See, e. g.,Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486U. S., at 834, n. 10 (garnishment);Swift & Co. Packers v.Compania Colombiana Del Caribe, S. A., 339 U. S. 684, 690-692 (1950) (prejudgment attachment of property); Dewey v.West Fairmont Gas Coal Co., 123 U. S. 329, 332-333 (1887)(prejudgment voidance of fraudulent transfers); LabetteCounty Comm'rs v.

Indeed, we rejected an attempt to doso in H. C. Cook Co. v. Beecher, 217 U. S. 497 (1910). InBeecher, the plaintiff obtained a judgment in federal courtagainst a corporation that had infringed its patent. Whenthe plaintiff could not collect on the judgment, it sued theindividual directors of the defendant corporation, allegingthat, during the pendency of the original suit, they had au6 The United States, as amicus curiae for Thomas, suggests that theproceeding below was jurisdictionally indistinguishable from Swift & Co.Packers v.

S. 217 (1884),and Riggs v.

Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 9-18. We decline to address this argument, because, even if Thomas could have sought to force payment bymandamus or to void postjudgment transfers, neither Thomas nor thecourts below characterized this suit that way. Indeed, Thomas expresslyrejects that characterization of his lawsuit. Brief for Respondent 4 ("Thisaction . . . is not one to collect a judgment, but one to establish liabilityon the part of the Petitioner") (emphasis in original); see id., at 11. Inany event, the United States agrees that the alleged fraudulent transferstotaled no more than $80,000, far less than the judgment actually imposedon Peacock.

THOMASOpinion of the Courtthorized continuing sales of the infringing product and know-ingly permitted the corporation to become insolvent. Weagreed with the Circuit Court's characterization of the suitas "an attempt to make the defendants answerable for thejudgment already obtained" and affirmed the court's decisionthat the suit was not "ancillary to the judgment in the formersuit."Id., at 498-499. Beecher governs this case and persuades us that Thomas' attempt to make Peacock answerablefor the ERISA judgment is not ancillary to that judgment.Labette County Comm'rs and Riggs are not to the con-trary. In those cases, we permitted a judgment creditorto mandamus county officials to force them to levy a taxfor payment of an existing judgment. Labette CountyComm'rs, supra, at 221-225; Riggs, supra, at 187-188. Theorder in each case merely required compliance with the existing judgment by the persons with authority to comply.We did not authorize the shifting of liability for payment ofthe judgment from the judgment debtor to the county officials, as Thomas attempts to do here.In determining the reach of the federal courts' ancillaryjurisdiction, we have cautioned against the exercise of jurisdiction over proceedings that are " `entirely new and original,' " Krippendorf v. Hyde, supra, at 285 (quoting Minnesota Co. v. St. Paul Co., 2 Wall. 609, 633 (1865)), or where"the relief [sought is] of a different kind or on a differentprinciple" than that of the prior decree. Dugas v. AmericanSurety Co., 300 U. S. 414, 428 (1937). These principles suggest that ancillary jurisdiction could not properly be exercised in this case. This action is founded not only upon different facts than the ERISA suit, but also upon entirely newtheories of liability. In this suit, Thomas alleged civil conspiracy and fraudulent transfer of Tru-Tech's assets, but, aswe have noted, no substantive ERISA violation. The alleged wrongdoing in this case occurred after the ERISAjudgment was entered, and Thomas' claims--civil conspiracy,fraudulent conveyance, and "veil piercing"--all involved new516us2$24n 10-24-98 18:14:07 PAGES OPINPGT359Cite as: 516 U. S. 349 (1996)Opinion of the Courttheories of liability not asserted in the ERISA suit. Otherthan the existence of the ERISA judgment itself, this suithas little connection to the ERISA case. This is a new action based on theories of relief that did not exist, and couldnot have existed, at the time the court entered judgment inthe ERISA case.Ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is, at its core, a creatureof necessity. See Kokkonen, 511 U. S., at 380; Riggs, 6 Wall.,at 187. When a party has obtained a valid federal judgment, only extraordinary circumstances, if any, can justifyancillary jurisdiction over a subsequent suit like this. Toprotect and aid the collection of a federal judgment, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide fast and effectivemechanisms for execution.7 In the event a stay is enteredpending appeal, the Rules require the district court to ensure that the judgment creditor's position is secured, ordinarily by a supersedeas bond.8 The Rules cannot guaranteepayment of every federal judgment. But as long as theyprotect a judgment creditor's ability to execute on a judgment, the district court's authority is adequately preserved,and ancillary jurisdiction is not justified over a new lawsuitto impose liability for a judgment on a third party. Contrary to Thomas' suggestion otherwise, we think these procedural safeguards are sufficient to prevent wholesale fraudupon the district courts of the United States.7 Rule 69(a), for instance, permits judgment creditors to use any execution method consistent with the practice and procedure of the State inwhich the district court sits. Rule 62(a) further protects judgment creditors by permitting execution on a judgment at any time more than 10 daysafter the judgment is entered.8 The district court may only stay execution of the judgment pendingthe disposition of certain post-trial motions or appeal if the court providesfor the security of the judgment creditor. Rule 62(b) (stay pending posttrial motions "on such conditions for the security of the adverse party asare proper"); Rule 62(d) (stay pending appeal "by giving a supersedeasbond").516us2$24n 10-24-98 18:14:07 PAGES OPINPGT360 PEACOCK v.
