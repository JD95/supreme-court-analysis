We decide in this case whether a federal court of appealsmay review a district court order remanding a bankruptcycase to state court on grounds of untimely removal.IRespondent commenced this action in March 1992 by filinga four-count complaint against Child World, Inc., and ColeNational Corporation in the Court of Common Pleas in Sum-mit County, Ohio. The state action charged Child Worldwith failure to pay rent under two commercial leases. Thecomplaint also sought to enforce Cole's guarantee of ChildWorld's performance under the leases. Petitioner is Cole'ssuccessor in interest.On May 6, 1992, Child World filed a Chapter 11 petition inthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern Dis*G. Eric Brunstad, Jr., filed a brief for the Connecticut Bar Association,Commercial Law and Bankruptcy Section, as amicus curiae urgingaffirmance.516us1$10n 10-22-98 11:02:54 PAGES OPINPGT126 THINGS REMEMBERED, INC. v. PETRARCAOpinion of the Courttrict of New York. On September 25, 1992, petitioner filednotices of removal in both the United States District andBankruptcy Courts for the Northern District of Ohio. Peti-tioner based its removal on the bankruptcy removal statute,28 U. S. C. $ 1452(a),1 as well as the general federal removalstatute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a). Petitioner also filed a motionin the District Court to transfer venue to the BankruptcyCourt in the Southern District of New York, so that respondent's guaranty claims could be resolved in the same forum asthe underlying lease claims against Child World. Respondent countered by filing motions to remand in the DistrictCourt on October 23, 1992, and in the Bankruptcy Court onNovember 25, 1992.The District Court consolidated all proceedings in theBankruptcy Court on March 25, 1993. The BankruptcyCourt held that petitioner's removal was untimely under 28U. S. C. $ 1452(a) and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure9027 but that the action had been timely removed under 28U. S. C. $$ 1441 and 1446. The court concluded that removalwas proper and that it had jurisdiction over the removedcase. The court then granted petitioner's motion to transfervenue to the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District ofNew York.Respondent appealed to the District Court in the Northern District of Ohio. The District Court found removalunder both $$ 1441(a) and 1452(a) to be untimely and heldthat the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over the case.1 Section 1452 provides:"(a) A party may remove any claim or cause of action in a civil action. . . to the district court for the district where such civil action is pending,if such district court has jurisdiction of such claim or cause of action undersection 1334 of this title."(b) The court to which such claim or cause of action is removed mayremand such claim or cause of action on any equitable ground. An orderentered under this subsection remanding a claim or cause of action, or adecision to not remand, is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by thecourt of appeals . . . or by the Supreme Court . . . ."516us1$10n 10-22-98 11:02:54 PAGES OPINPGT127Cite as: 516 U.

In an unpublished disposi-tion, the Sixth Circuit held that $$ 1447(d) and 1452(b) barredappellate review of the District Court's remand order. TheCourt of Appeals then dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Judgt. order reported at 65 F. 3d 169 (1994). Wegranted certiorari, 514 U. S. 1095 (1995), and now affirm.IICongress has placed broad restrictions on the power offederal appellate courts to review district court orders remanding removed cases to state court. The general statu-tory provision governing the reviewability of remand ordersis 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(d). That section provides:"An order remanding a case to the State court fromwhich it was removed is not reviewable on appeal orotherwise, except that an order remanding a case to theState court from which it was removed pursuant tosection 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appealor otherwise."As we explained in Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336 (1976), $ 1447(d) must be read in parimateria with $ 1447(c), so that only remands based ongrounds specified in $ 1447(c) are immune from review under$ 1447(d). Id., at 345-346. As long as a district court's remand is based on a timely raised defect in removal procedureor on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction--the grounds for remand recognized by $ 1447(c)--a court of appeals lacks juris2 The District Court's order left the Bankruptcy Court with no optionbut to remand the case to state court. The parties and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are in agreement that the District Court's orderin this case was equivalent to a remand to state court.516us1$10n 10-22-98 11:02:54 PAGES OPINPGT128 THINGS REMEMBERED, INC. v. PETRARCAOpinion of the Courtdiction to entertain an appeal of the remand order under$ 1447(d).Section 1447(d) bars appellate review of the remand orderin this case. As noted, $ 1447(d) precludes appellate reviewof any order "remanding a case to the State court from whichit was removed." The parties do not dispute that the District Court's order remanded this case to the Ohio statecourt from which it came. There is also no dispute that theDistrict Court remanded this case on grounds of untimelyremoval, precisely the type of removal defect contemplatedby $ 1447(c).3 Section 1447(d) thus compels the conclusionthat the District Court's order is "not reviewable on appealor otherwise." See Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell TelephoneCo., 430 U. S. 723 (1977) (per curiam).We reach the same conclusion regardless of whether removal was effected pursuant to $ 1441(a) or $ 1452(a). Section 1447(d) applies "not only to remand orders made in suitsremoved under [the general removal statute], but to ordersof remand made in cases removed under any other statutes,as well."United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742, 752 (1946)(emphasis added).4 Absent a clear statutory command tothe contrary, we assume that Congress is "aware of theuniversality of th[e] practice" of denying appellate reviewof remand orders when Congress creates a new ground forremoval. Ibid.3 Section 1447(c) requires that a motion to remand for a defect in removal procedure be filed within 30 days of removal. Petitioner removedthis case to federal court on September 25, 1992. Respondent filed motions to remand in the District Court on October 23, 1992, and in theBankruptcy Court on November 25, 1992. Respondent's motion to remand filed in the District Court was sufficient to bring this case withinthe coverage of $ 1447(c).4 Rice interpreted the predecessor statute to $ 1447(d). The currentversion of $ 1447(d) is a recodification of the provision reviewed in Riceand is "intended to restate the prior law with respect to remand ordersand their reviewability." Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,423 U. S. 336, 349-350 (1976).516us1$10n 10-22-98 11:02:54 PAGES OPINPGT129Cite as: 516 U. S. 124 (1995)Kennedy, J., concurringThere is no express indication in $ 1452 that Congress in-tended that statute to be the exclusive provision governingremovals and remands in bankruptcy. Nor is there any rea-son to infer from $ 1447(d) that Congress intended to excludebankruptcy cases from its coverage. The fact that $ 1452contains its own provision governing certain types of re-mands in bankruptcy, see $ 1452(b) (authorizing remand on"any equitable ground" and precluding appellate review ofany decision to remand or not to remand on this basis), doesnot change our conclusion. There is no reason $$ 1447(d) and1452 cannot comfortably coexist in the bankruptcy context.We must, therefore, give effect to both. Connecticut Nat.Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992).If an order remands a bankruptcy case to state court because of a timely raised defect in removal procedure or lackof subject-matter jurisdiction, then a court of appeals lacksjurisdiction to review that order under $ 1447(d), regardlessof whether the case was removed under $ 1441(a) or $ 1452(a).The remand at issue falls squarely within $ 1447(d), and theorder is not reviewable on appeal.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis affirmed.
