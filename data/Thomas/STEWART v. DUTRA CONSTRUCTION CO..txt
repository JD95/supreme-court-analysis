IAs part of Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project, or "BigDig," the Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook to extend the Massachusetts Turnpike through a tunnel runningbeneath South Boston and Boston Harbor to Logan Airport.The Commonwealth employed respondent Dutra Construc-tion Company to assist in that undertaking. At the time,Dutra owned the world's largest dredge, the Super Scoop,which was capable of digging the 50-foot-deep, 100-foot-wide,three-quarter-mile-long trench beneath Boston Harbor thatis now the Ted Williams Tunnel.The Super Scoop is a massive floating platform from whicha clamshell bucket is suspended beneath the water. Thebucket removes silt from the ocean floor and dumps the sedi-ment onto one of two scows that float alongside the dredge.The Super Scoop has certain characteristics common to sea-going vessels, such as a captain and crew, navigational lights,ballast tanks, and a crew dining area. But it lacks others.Most conspicuously, theSuper Scoop has only limited meansof self-propulsion. It is moved long distances by tugboat.(To work on the Big Dig, it was towed from its home basein California through the Panama Canal and up the easternseaboard to Boston Harbor.)

S. 481 (2005)Opinion of the CourtBoston Harbor trench, it typically moved in this way onceevery couple of hours, covering a distance of 30-to-50 feeteach time.Dutra hired petitioner Willard Stewart, a marine engineer, to maintain the mechanical systems on the Super Scoopduring its dredging of the harbor. At the time of Stewart'saccident, the Super Scoop lay idle because one of its scows,Scow No. 4, had suffered an engine malfunction and the otherwas at sea. Stewart was on board Scow No. 4, feeding wiresthrough an open hatch located about 10 feet above the enginearea. While Stewart was perched beside the hatch, theSuper Scoop used its bucket to move the scow. In the process, the scow collided with the Super Scoop, causing a joltthat plunged Stewart headfirst through the hatch to the deckbelow. He was seriously injured.Stewart sued Dutra in the United States District Courtfor the District of Massachusetts under the Jones Act, 38Stat. 1185, as amended, 41 Stat. 1007 and 96 Stat. 1955, 46U. S. C. App. $ 688(a), alleging that he was a seaman injuredby Dutra's negligence. He also filed an alternative claimunder $ 5(b) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 905(b), which authorizes covered employees to sue a "vessel" owner as athird party for an injury caused by the owner's negligence.Dutra moved for summary judgment on the Jones Actclaim, arguing that Stewart was not a seaman. The company acknowledged that Stewart was "a member of the[Super Scoop's] crew," 230 F. 3d 461, 466 (CA1 2000); that hespent "[n]inety-nine percent of his time while on the job"aboard the Super Scoop, App. 20 (Defendant's Memorandumin Support of Summary Judgment); and that his "duties contributed to the function" of the Super Scoop, id., at 32.Dutra argued only that the Super Scoop was not a vessel forpurposes of the Jones Act. Dutra pointed to the Court ofAppeals' en banc decision in DiGiovanni v. Traylor Brothers, Inc., 959 F. 2d 1119 (CA1 1992), which held that "if a543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN486 STEWART v. DUTRA CONSTR. CO.Opinion of the Courtbarge . . . or other float's purpose or primary business is notnavigation or commerce, then workers assigned thereto forits shore enterprise are to be considered seamen only whenit is in actual navigation or transit" at the time of the plaintiff 's injury. Id., at 1123 (internal quotation marks omitted).The District Court granted summary judgment to Dutra,because the Super Scoop's primary purpose was dredgingrather than transportation and because it was stationary atthe time of Stewart's injury.On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed,concluding that it too was bound byDiGiovanni. 230 F. 3d,at 467-468. The court reasoned that the Super Scoop's primary function was construction and that "[a]ny navigationor transportation that may be required is incidental to thisprimary function." Id., at 468. The court also concludedthat the scow's movement at the time of the accident did nothelp Stewart, because his status as a seaman depended onthe movement of the Super Scoop (which was stationary)rather than the scow. Id., at 469.On remand, the District Court granted summary judgmentin favor of Dutra on Stewart's alternative claim that Dutrawas liable for negligence as an owner of a "vessel" under theLHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 905(b). The Court of Appeals againaffirmed. It noted that Dutra had conceded that the SuperScoop was a "vessel" for purposes of $ 905(b), explaining that"the LHWCA's definition of `vessel' is `significantly more inclusive than that used for evaluating seaman status underthe Jones Act.' " 343 F. 3d 10, 13 (CA1 2003) (quoting Morehead v. Atkinson-Kiewit, J/V, 97 F. 3d 603, 607 (CA1 1996)(en banc)). The Court of Appeals nonetheless agreed withthe District Court's conclusion that Dutra's alleged negligence was committed in its capacity as an employer ratherthan as owner of the vessel under $ 905(b).We granted certiorari to resolve confusion over how to determine whether a watercraft is a "vessel" for purposes ofthe LHWCA. 540 U. S. 1177 (2004).543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN487Cite as: 543 U. S. 481 (2005)Opinion of the CourtIIPrior to the passage of the Jones Act, general maritimelaw usually entitled a seaman who fell sick or was injuredboth to maintenance and cure (or the right to be cared forand paid wages during the voyage, see,e. g., Harden v.Gordon, 11 F. Cas. 480, 482-483 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823)(Story, J.)), and to damages for any "injuries received . . . inconsequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship," The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, 175 (1903). Suits against shipowners fornegligence, however, were barred. Courts presumed thatthe seaman, in signing articles of employment for the voyage,had assumed the risks of his occupation; thus a seaman was"not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence ofthe master, or any member of the crew."Ibid.Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove thisbar to negligence suits by seamen. See Chandris, Inc. v.Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354 (1995). Specifically, the Jones Actprovides:"Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in thecourse of his employment may, at his election, maintainan action for damages at law, with the right of trial byjury, and in such action all statutes of the United Statesmodifying or extending the common-law right or rem-edy in cases of personal injury to railway employeesshall apply." 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688(a).Although the statute is silent on who is a "seaman," both themaritime law backdrop against which Congress enacted theJones Act and Congress' subsequent enactments providesome guidance.First, "seaman" is a term of art that had an establishedmeaning under general maritime law. We have thus presumed that when the Jones Act made available negligenceremedies to "[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injuryin the course of his employment," Congress took the term"seaman" as the general maritime law found it.Chandris,543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN488 STEWART v. DUTRA CONSTR. CO.Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 355 (citing Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 159(1934)); G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty $ 6-21,pp. 328-329 (2d ed. 1975).Second, Congress provided further guidance in 1927 whenit enacted the LHWCA, which provides scheduled compensa-tion to land-based maritime workers but which also exceptsfrom its coverage "a master or member of a crew of anyvessel." 33 U. S. C. $ 902(3)(G). This exception is simply"a refinement of the term `seaman' in the Jones Act." McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 347 (1991).Thus, the Jones Act and the LHWCA are complementaryregimes that work in tandem: The Jones Act provides tortremedies to sea-based maritime workers, while the LHWCAprovides workers' compensation to land-based maritime em-ployees. Ibid.; Swanson v. Marra Brothers, Inc., 328 U. S.1, 6-7 (1946).Still, discerning the contours of "seaman" status, even withthe general maritime law and the LHWCA's language asaids to interpretation, has not been easy. SeeChandris,supra, at 356. We began clarifying the definition of "seaman" in a pair of cases, McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander,supra, and Chandris, supra, that addressed the relationshipa worker must have to a vessel in order to be a "master ormember" of its crew. We now turn to the other half of theLHWCA's equation: how to determine whether a watercraftis a "vessel."AJust as Congress did not define the term "seaman" in theJones Act,1 it did not define the term "vessel" in the LHWCA1 The Shipping Act, 1916, defines the term "vessel" for purposes of theJones Act. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 801. However, the provision of theJones Act at issue here, $ 688(a), speaks not of "vessels," but of "seamen."In any event, because we have identified a Jones Act "seaman" with reference to the LHWCA's exclusion, see 33 U. S. C. $ 902(3)(G) ("a master ormember of a crew of any vessel"), it is the LHWCA's use of the term"vessel" that matters. And, as we explain, the context surrounding Con543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN489Cite as: 543 U. S. 481 (2005)Opinion of the Courtitself.2 However, Congress provided a definition elsewhere.At the time of the LHWCA's enactment, $$ 1 and 3 of theRevised Statutes of 1873 specified:"In determining the meaning of the revised statutes,or of any act or resolution of Congress passed subsequent to February twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred andseventy-one, . . . [t]he word `vessel' includes every description of water-craft or other artificial contrivanceused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water." 3 18 Stat., pt. 1, p. 1.Sections 1 and 3 show that, because the LHWCA is an Actof Congress passed after February 25, 1871, the LHWCA'suse of the term "vessel" "includes every description ofwater-craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable ofbeing used, as a means of transportation on water." Ibid.Section 3's definition, repealed and recodified in 1947 aspart of the Rules of Construction Act, 1 U. S. C. $ 3, hasgress' enactment of the LHWCA suggests that Rev. Stat. $ 3, now 1U. S. C. $ 3, provides the controlling definition of the term "vessel" in theLHWCA.2 As part of its 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA, Congress amendedthe Act with what appears at first blush to be a definition of the term"vessel": "Unless the context requires otherwise, the term `vessel' meansany vessel upon which or in connection with which any person entitled tobenefits under this chapter suffers injury or death arising out of or in thecourse of his employment, and said vessel's owner, owner pro hac vice,agent, operator, charter or bare boat charterer, master, officer, or crewmember." 33 U. S. C. $ 902(21). However, Congress enacted this definition in conjunction with the third-party vessel owner provision of $ 905(b).Rather than specifying the characteristics of a vessel, $ 902(21) insteadlists the parties liable for the negligent operation of a vessel. See McCarthy v. The Bark Peking, 716 F. 2d 130, 133 (CA2 1983) ($ 902(21) is "circular" and "does not provide precise guidance as to what is included withinthe term `vessel' ").3 Congress had used substantially the same definition before, first in an1866 antismuggling statute, see $ 1, 14 Stat. 178, and then in an 1870 statute "provid[ing] for the Relief of sick and disabled Seamen," ch. clxix, 16Stat. 169 (italics deleted); see id., $ 7, at 170.543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN490 STEWART v. DUTRA CONSTR. CO.Opinion of the Courtremained virtually unchanged from 1873 to the present.4Even now, $ 3 continues to supply the default definition of"vessel" throughout the U. S. Code, "unless the context indi-cates otherwise." 1 U. S. C. $ 1. The context surroundingthe LHWCA's enactment indicates that $ 3 defines the term"vessel" for purposes of the LHWCA.Section 3 merely codified the meaning that the term "ves-sel" had acquired in general maritime law. See 1 S. Friedell,Benedict on Admiralty $ 165 (rev. 7th ed. 2004). In the dec-ades following its enactment, $ 3 was regularly used to definethe term "vessel" in maritime jurisprudence. Taking onlythe issue presented here--whether a dredge is a vessel--prior to passage of the Jones Act and the LHWCA, courtsoften used $ 3's definition to conclude that dredges werevessels.5From the very beginning, these courts understood the differences between dredges and more traditional seagoing ves-sels. Though smaller, the dredges at issue in the earliestcases were essentially the same as the Super Scoop here.For instance, the court could have been speaking equally ofthe Super Scoop as of The Alabama when it declared:"The dredge and scows have no means of propulsion oftheir own except that the dredge, by the use of anchors,windlass, and rope, is moved for short distances, as re-quired in carrying on the business of dredging. Both4 During the 1947 codification, the hyphen was removed from the word"watercraft." $ 3, 61 Stat. 633.5 See, e. g., The Alabama, 19 F. 544, 546 (SD Ala. 1884) (dredge was avessel and subject to maritime liens); Huismann v. The Pioneer, 30 F. 206,207 (EDNY 1886) (dredge was a vessel under $ 3); Saylor v. Taylor, 77 F.476, 477 (CA4 1896) (dredge was a vessel under $ 3, and its workers wereseamen); The International, 89 F. 484, 484-485 (CA3 1898) (dredge was avessel under $ 3); Eastern S. S. Corp. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co.,256 F. 497, 500-501 (CA1 1919) (type of dredge called a "drillboat" was avessel under $ 3); Los Angeles v. United Dredging Co., 14 F. 2d 364, 365-366 (CA9 1926) (dredge was a vessel under $ 3 and its engineers wereseamen).543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN491Cite as: 543 U. S. 481 (2005)Opinion of the Courtthe dredge and the scows are moved from place to placewhere they may be employed by being towed, and someof the tows have been for long distances and upon thehigh seas. The dredge and scows are not made for oradapted to the carriage of freight or passengers, and theevidence does not show that, in point of fact, this dredgeand scows had ever been so used and employed." TheAlabama, 19 F. 544, 545 (SD Ala. 1884).See also Huismann v. The Pioneer, 30 F. 206 (EDNY 1886).None of this prevented the court from recognizing thatdredges are vessels because they are watercraft with "thecapacity to be navigated in and upon the waters."The Ala-bama, supra, at 546; see also The Pioneer, supra, at 207; TheInternational, 89 F. 484, 485 (CA3 1898).This Court also treated dredges as vessels prior to thepassage of the Jones Act and the LHWCA. It did so in apair of cases, first implicitly in The "Virginia Ehrman" andthe "Agnese," 97 U. S. 309 (1878), and then explicitly in Ellisv. United States, 206 U. S. 246 (1907). In Ellis, this Courtconsidered, inter alia, whether workers aboard variousdredges and scows were covered by a federal labor law.Just as in the present case, one of the Ellis appellants arguedthat the dredges at issue were "vessels" within the meaningof Rev. Stat. $ 3, now 1 U. S. C. $ 3. 206 U. S., at 249. TheUnited States responded that dredges were only vessels, ifat all, when in actual navigation as they were "towed fromport to port."Id., at 253. Citing $ 3, Justice Holmes re-jected the Government's argument, stating that "[t]he scowsand floating dredges were vessels" that "were within the ad-miralty jurisdiction of the United States." Id., at 259.These early cases show that at the time Congress enactedthe Jones Act and the LHWCA in the 1920's, it was settledthat $ 3 defined the term "vessel" for purposes of those stat-utes. It was also settled that a structure's status as a vesselunder $ 3 depended on whether the structure was a meansof maritime transportation. See R. Hughes, Handbook of543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN492 STEWART v. DUTRA CONSTR. CO.Opinion of the CourtAdmiralty Law $ 5, p. 14 (2d ed. 1920). For then, as now,dredges served a waterborne transportation function, sincein performing their work they carried machinery, equipment,and crew over water. See, e. g., Butler v. Ellis, 45 F. 2d 951,955 (CA4 1930) (finding the vessel status of dredges "sustained by the overwhelming weight of authority"); The Hurricane, 2 F. 2d 70, 72 (ED Pa. 1924) (expressing "no doubt"that dredges are vessels), aff 'd, 9 F. 2d 396 (CA3 1925).This Court's cases have continued to treat $ 3 as definingthe term "vessel" in the LHWCA, and they have continuedto construe $ 3's definition in light of the term's establishedmeaning in general maritime law. For instance, in Nortonv. Warner Co., 321 U. S. 565 (1944), the Court consideredwhether a worker on a harbor barge was "a master or member of a crew of any vessel" under the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C.$ 902(3)(G). In finding that the "barge [was] a vessel withinthe meaning of the Act," the Court not only quoted $ 3'sdefinition of the term "vessel," but it also cited in support ofits holding several earlier cases that had held dredges to bevessels based on the general maritime law. 321 U. S., at 571,and n. 4. This Court therefore confirmed in Norton that $ 3defines the term "vessel" in the LHWCA and that $ 3 shouldbe construed consistently with the general maritime law.Since Norton, this Court has often said that dredges andcomparable watercraft qualify as vessels under the Jones Actand the LHWCA.66 See, e. g., Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co.,513 U. S. 527, 535, and n. 1 (1995) (indicating that a stationary crane bargewas a "vessel" under the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act); Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, 502 U. S. 81, 92 (1991) (holding that a jurycould reasonably find that floating platforms were "vessels in navigation"under the Jones Act); Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Pfeifer, 462 U.

S. 481 (2005)Opinion of the CourtBDespite this Court's reliance on $ 3 in cases like Ellis andNorton, Dutra argues that the Court has implicitly narrowed$ 3's definition. Section 3 says that a "vessel" must be "used,or capable of being used, as a means of transportation onwater." 18 Stat., pt. 1, p. 1. In a pair of cases, the Courtheld that a drydock, Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., 119 U. S.625, 630 (1887), and a wharfboat attached to the mainland,Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola Bot-tling Co., 271 U. S. 19, 22 (1926), were not vessels under $ 3,because they were not practically capable of being used totransport people, freight, or cargo from place to place. According to Dutra, Cope and Evansville adopted a definitionof "vessel" narrower than $ 3's text.Dutra misreads Cope and Evansville. In Cope, the plain-tiff sought a salvage award for having prevented a drydockfrom sinking after a steamship collided with it. 119 U. S.,at 625-626. At the time of the accident, the drydock, afloating dock used for repairing vessels, was "moored andlying at [the] usual place" it had occupied for the past20 years. Id., at 626. In those circumstances, the dry-dock was a "fixed structure" that had been "permanentlymoored," rather than a vessel that had been temporarilyanchored.Id., at 627. Evansville involved a wharfboatsecured by cables to the mainland. Local water, electricity, and telephone lines all ran from shore to the wharfboat,evincing a "permanent location." 271 U. S., at 22. Andthe wharfboat, like the drydock in Cope, was neither "takenfrom place to place" nor "used to carry freight from oneplace to another." 271 U. S., at 22. As in Cope, the Courtconcluded that the wharfboat "was not practically capable ofbeing used as a means of transportation." 271 U. S., at 22.Cope and Evansville did no more than construe $ 3 in lightof the distinction drawn by the general maritime law between watercraft temporarily stationed in a particular loca-tion and those permanently affixed to shore or resting on the543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN494 STEWART v. DUTRA CONSTR. CO.Opinion of the Courtocean floor. See, e. g., The Alabama, 19 F., at 546 (notingthat vessels possess "mobility and [the] capacity to navigate," as distinct from fixed structures like wharves, dry-docks, and bridges). Simply put, a watercraft is not "capable of being used" for maritime transport in any meaningfulsense if it has been permanently moored or otherwise rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.This distinction is sensible: A ship and its crew do notmove in and out of Jones Act coverage depending on whetherthe ship is at anchor, docked for loading or unloading, orberthed for minor repairs, in the same way that ships takenpermanently out of the water as a practical matter do notremain vessels merely because of the remote possibility thatthey may one day sail again. See Pavone v. MississippiRiverboat Amusement Corp., 52 F. 3d 560, 570 (CA5 1995)(floating casino was no longer a vessel where it "was mooredto the shore in a semi-permanent or indefinite manner");Kathriner v. Unisea, Inc., 975 F. 2d 657, 660 (CA9 1992)(floating processing plant was no longer a vessel where a"large opening [had been] cut into her hull," rendering herincapable of moving over the water). Even if the generalmaritime law had not informed the meaning of $ 3, its definition would not sweep within its reach an array of fixed structures not commonly thought of as capable of being used forwater transport. See, e. g., Leocal v. Ashcroft, ante, at 9("When interpreting a statute, we must give words their `ordinary or natural' meaning" (quoting Smith v. United States,508 U. S. 223, 228 (1993))).Applying $ 3 brings within the purview of the Jones Actthe sorts of watercraft considered vessels at the time Congress passed the Act. By including special-purpose vesselslike dredges, $ 3 sweeps broadly, but the other prerequisitesto qualifying for seaman status under the Jones Act providesome limits, notwithstanding $ 3's breadth. A maritimeworker seeking Jones Act seaman status must also provethat his duties contributed to the vessel's function or mission,543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN495Cite as: 543 U. S. 481 (2005)Opinion of the Courtand that his connection to the vessel was substantial both innature and duration. Chandris, 515 U. S., at 376. Thus,even though the Super Scoop is a "vessel," workers injuredaboard the Super Scoop are eligible for seaman status onlyif they are "master[s] or member[s]" of its crew.CThe Court of Appeals, relying on its previous en banc deci-sion inDiGiovanni v. Traylor Brothers, Inc., 959 F. 2d 1119(CA1 1992), held that the Super Scoop is not a "vessel" because its primary purpose is not navigation or commerce andbecause it was not in actual transit at the time of Stewart'sinjury. 230 F. 3d, at 468-469. Neither prong of the Courtof Appeals' test is consistent with the text of $ 3 or the established meaning of the term "vessel" in general maritime law.Section 3 requires only that a watercraft be "used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water" toqualify as a vessel. It does not require that a watercraft beused primarily for that purpose. See The Alabama, supra,at 546;The International, 89 F., at 485. As the Court ofAppeals recognized, the Super Scoop's "function was to movethrough Boston Harbor, . . . digging the ocean bottom as itmoved." 343 F. 3d, at 12. In other words, the Super Scoopwas not only "capable of being used" to transport equipmentand workers over water--itwas used to transport thosethings. Indeed, it could not have dug the Ted Williams Tunnel had it been unable to traverse the Boston Harbor, carry-ing with it workers like Stewart.Also, a watercraft need not be in motion to qualify as avessel under $ 3. Looking to whether a watercraft is motionless or moving is the sort of "snapshot" test that we re-jected in Chandris. Just as a worker does not "oscillateback and forth between Jones Act coverage and other reme-dies depending on the activity in which the worker was engaged while injured," Chandris, 515 U. S., at 363, neitherdoes a watercraft pass in and out of Jones Act coverage543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN496 STEWART v. DUTRA CONSTR. CO.Opinion of the Courtdepending on whether it was moving at the time of theaccident.Granted, the Court has sometimes spoken of the require-ment that a vessel be "in navigation,"id., at 373-374, butnever to indicate that a structure's locomotion at any givenmoment mattered. Rather, the point was that structuresmay lose their character as vessels if they have been withdrawn from the water for extended periods of time. Ibid.;Roper v. United States, 368 U. S. 20, 21, 23 (1961); West v.United States, 361 U. S. 118, 122 (1959). The Court did notmean that the "in navigation" requirement stood apart from$ 3, such that a "vessel" for purposes of $ 3 might nevertheless not be a "vessel in navigation" for purposes of the JonesAct or the LHWCA. See, e. g., United States v. Templeton,378 F. 3d 845, 851 (CA8 2004) ("[T]he definition of `vessel innavigation' under the Jones Act is not as expansive as thegeneral definition of `vessel' ").Instead, the "in navigation" requirement is an element ofthe vessel status of a watercraft. It is relevant to whetherthe craft is "used, or capable of being used" for maritimetransportation.

Dutra conceded that the Super Scoop was onlytemporarily stationary while Stewart and others were repairing the scow; the Super Scoop had not been taken out ofservice, permanently anchored, or otherwise rendered practically incapable of maritime transport.Finally, although Dutra argues that the Super Scoop is nota "vessel" under $ 902(3)(G), which is the LHWCA provisionthat excludes seamen from the Act's coverage, Dutra con543US2 Unit: $U22 [03-16-07 06:53:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN497Cite as: 543 U. S. 481 (2005)Opinion of the Courtceded below that the Super Scoop is a "vessel" under$ 905(b), which is the LHWCA provision that imposes liability on vessel owners for negligence to longshoremen. Theconcession was necessary because the Court of Appeals hadpreviously held that $ 905(b)'s use of the term "vessel" is" `significantly more inclusive than that used for evaluatingseaman status under the Jones Act.' " 343 F. 3d, at 13 (quoting Morehead v. Atkinson-Kiewit, 97 F. 3d, at 607). TheCourt of Appeals' approach is no longer tenable. TheLHWCA does not meaningfully define the term "vessel" asit appears in either $ 902(3)(G) or $ 905(b), see n. 2, supra,and 1 U. S. C. $ 3 defines the term "vessel" throughout theLHWCA.IIIAt the time that Congress enacted the LHWCA and since,Rev. Stat. $ 3, now 1 U. S. C. $ 3, has defined the term "vessel" in the LHWCA. Under $ 3, a "vessel" is any watercraftpractically capable of maritime transportation, regardless ofits primary purpose or state of transit at a particular moment. Because the Super Scoop was engaged in maritimetransportation at the time of Stewart's injury, it was a vesselwithin the meaning of 1 U. S. C. $ 3. Despite the seemingincongruity of grouping dredges alongside more traditionalseafaring vessels under the maritime statutes, Congress andthe courts have long done precisely that:"[I]t seems a stretch of the imagination to class the deckhands of a mud dredge in the quiet waters of a Potomaccreek with the bold and skillful mariners who breastthe angry waves of the Atlantic; but such and so farreaching are the principles which underlie the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty that they adapt themselves to all the new kinds of property and new sets ofoperatives and new conditions which are brought intoexistence in the progress of the world."

CALIFORNIA et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 03-636. Argued November 2, 2004--Decided February 23, 2005The California Department of Corrections' (CDC) unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells for up to 60 days each timethey enter a new correctional facility is based on the asserted rationalethat it prevents violence caused by racial gangs. Petitioner Johnson,an African-American inmate who has been intermittently double-celledunder the policy's terms ever since his 1987 incarceration, filed this suitalleging that the policy violates his Fourteenth Amendment right toequal protection. The District Court ultimately granted defendant former CDC officials summary judgment on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding thatthe policy's constitutionality should be reviewed under the deferentialstandard articulated in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, not under strictscrutiny, and that the policy survived Turner scrutiny.Held: Strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to the CDC's policy. Pp. 505-515.(a) Because the CDC's policy is "immediately suspect" as an expressracial classification, Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 642, the Ninth Circuiterred in failing to apply strict scrutiny and thereby to require the CDCto demonstrate that the policy is narrowly tailored to serve a compellingstate interest, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200,227. "[A]ll racial classifications [imposed by government] . . . must beanalyzed . . . under strict scrutiny," ibid., in order to " `smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goalimportant enough to warrant [such] a highly suspect tool," Richmond v.J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493. The CDC's claim that its policyshould be exempt from this categorical rule because it is "neutral"--i. e., because all prisoners are "equally" segregated--ignores thisCourt's repeated command that "racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally,"Shaw, supra, at 651. Indeed, the Court rejected the notion that separate can ever be equal--or "neutral"--50 years ago in Brown v. Boardof Education, 347 U. S. 483, and refuses to resurrect it today. TheCourt has previously applied a heightened standard of review in evaluating racial segregation in prisons. Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333.The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here. By perpetuating543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN500 JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIASyllabusthe notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates "mayexacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract."Shaw, supra, at 648. Virtually all other States and the Federal Government manage their prison systems without reliance on racial segregation. In fact, the United States argues that it is possible to addressprison security concerns through individualized consideration withoutusing racial segregation, unless it is warranted as a necessary and temporary response to a serious threat of race-related violence. As totransferees, in particular, whom the CDC has already evaluated at leastonce, it is not clear why more individualized determinations are notpossible. Pp. 505-509.(b) The Court declines the CDC's invitation to make an exception tothe categorical strict scrutiny rule and instead to apply Turner's deferential review standard on the ground that the CDC's policy applies onlyin the prison context. The Court has never applied the Turner standard--which asks whether a regulation that burdens prisoners' fundamental rights is "reasonably related" to "legitimate penological interests," 482 U. S., at 89--to racial classifications. Turner itself did notinvolve such a classification, and it cast no doubt on Lee. That is unsurprising, as the Court has applied the Turner test only to rights that are"inconsistent with proper incarceration." Overton v. Bazzetta, 539U. S. 126, 131. The right not to be discriminated against based on one'srace is not susceptible to Turner's logic because it is not a right thatneed necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison administration. On the contrary, compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment's ban on racial discrimination is not only consistent with properprison administration, but also bolsters the legitimacy of the entirecriminal justice system. Cf. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 99. Deference to the particular expertise of officials managing daily prison operations does not require a more relaxed standard here. The Court didnot relax the standard of review for racial classifications in prison inLee, and it refuses to do so today. Rather, it explicitly reaffirms thatthe "necessities of prison security and discipline," Lee, supra, at 334,are a compelling government interest justifying only those uses of racethat are narrowly tailored to address those necessities, see, e. g., Grutterv. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 353. Because Turner's standard would allowprison officials to use race-based policies even when there are raceneutral means to accomplish the same goal, and even when the racebased policy does not in practice advance that goal, it is too lenient astandard to ferret out invidious uses of race. Contrary to the CDC'sprotest, strict scrutiny will not render prison administrators unable toaddress legitimate problems of race-based violence in prisons. On remand, the CDC will have the burden of demonstrating that its policy is543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN501Cite as: 543 U. S. 499 (2005)Syllabusnarrowly tailored with regard to new inmates as well as transferees.Pp. 509-515.(c) The Court does not decide whether the CDC's policy violates equalprotection, but leaves it to the Ninth Circuit, or the District Court, toapply strict scrutiny in the first instance.

CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtJustice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has anunwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in doublecells in reception centers for up to 60 days each time theyenter a new correctional facility. We consider whetherstrict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equalprotection challenge to that policy.IACDC institutions house all new male inmates and all maleinmates transferred from other state facilities in receptioncenters for up to 60 days upon their arrival. During thattime, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine theirultimate placement. Double-cell assignments in the recep-tion centers are based on a number of factors, predominantlyrace. In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances ofan inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are" `[p]retty close' " to zero percent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racialgroup. Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separatelyfrom Chinese-Americans, and northern California Hispanicsare separated from southern California Hispanics.The CDC's asserted rationale for this practice is that it isnecessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.

It cites numerous incidents of racialviolence in CDC facilities and identifies five major prisongangs in the State: Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia, BlackGuerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood, and Nazi Low Riders.Id., at 2.

S. 499 (2005)Opinion of the Courttified that if race were not considered in making initial hous-ing assignments, she is certain there would be racial conflictin the cells and in the yard. App. 215a. Other prison offi-cials also expressed their belief that violence and conflictwould result if prisoners were not segregated. See, e. g., id.,at 305a-306a. The CDC claims that it must therefore segregate all inmates while it determines whether they pose adanger to others. See Brief for Respondents 29.With the exception of the double cells in reception areas,the rest of the state prison facilities--dining areas, yards,and cells--are fully integrated. After the initial 60-day pe-riod, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed to-gether, unless there are security reasons for denying them.BGarrison Johnson is an African-American inmate in thecustody of the CDC. He has been incarcerated since 1987and, during that time, has been housed at a number of Cali-fornia prison facilities. Fourth Amended Complaint 3, Record, Doc. No. 78. Upon his arrival at Folsom prison in 1987,and each time he was transferred to a new facility thereafter,Johnson was double-celled with another African-Americaninmate. Seeibid.Johnson filed a complaintpro se in the United States Dis-trict Court for the Central District of California on February24, 1995, alleging that the CDC's reception-center housingpolicy violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment by assigning him cellmates on the basisof his race. He alleged that, from 1987 to 1991, former CDCDirector James Rowland instituted and enforced an unconsti-tutional policy of housing inmates according to race. SecondAmended Complaint 2-4, Record, Doc. No. 21. Johnsonmade the same allegations against former Director JamesGomez for the period from 1991 until the filing of his com-plaint.Ibid. The District Court dismissed his complaint543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN504 JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtfor failure to state a claim. The Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that Johnsonhad stated a claim for racial discrimination in violation ofthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Johnson v. California, 207 F. 3d 650, 655 (2000).On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and grantedleave to amend his complaint. On July 5, 2000, he filed hisFourth Amended Complaint. Record, Doc. No. 81. John-son claimed that the CDC's policy of racially segregating allinmates in reception-center cells violated his rights underthe Equal Protection Clause. Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC Directors Rowland and Gomez, intheir individual capacities, violated his constitutional rightsby formulating and implementing the CDC's housing policy.He also sought injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the policy as a whole--as it relates toboth new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities. Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmatewhen he entered the CDC facility at Folsom. Since 1987, hehas been segregated each time he has been transferred to anew facility. Thus, he has been subject to the CDC's policyboth as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from onefacility to another.After discovery, the parties moved for summary judgment.The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was not clearly unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.321 F. 3d 791 (2003). It held that the constitutionality ofthe CDC's policy should be reviewed under the deferentialstandard we articulated in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78(1987)--not strict scrutiny. 321 F. 3d, at 798-799. Applying Turner, it held that Johnson had the burden of refuting the "common-sense connection" between the policy and543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN505Cite as: 543 U. S. 499 (2005)Opinion of the Courtprison violence. 321 F. 3d, at 802. Though it believed thiswas a "close case," id., at 798, the Court of Appeals concludedthat the policy survived Turner's deferential standard, 321F. 3d, at 807.The Court of Appeals denied Johnson's petition for rehear-ing en banc. Judge Ferguson, joined by three others, dissented on grounds that "[t]he panel's decision ignore[d] theSupreme Court's repeated and unequivocal command that allracial classifications imposed by the government must be an-alyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny, and fail[ed]to recognize that [the] Turner analysis is inapplicable incases, such as this one, in which the right asserted is notinconsistent with legitimate penological objectives." 336F. 3d 1117 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citationsomitted). We granted certiorari to decide which standardof review applies. 540 U. S. 1217 (2004).IIAWe have held that "all racial classifications [imposed bygovernment] . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing courtunder strict scrutiny." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a,515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995) (emphasis added). Under strictscrutiny, the government has the burden of proving that ra-cial classifications "are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests." Ibid. We haveinsisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called"benign" racial classifications, such as race-conscious univer-sity admissions policies, seeGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.306, 326 (2003), race-based preferences in government contracts, see Adarand, supra, at 226, and race-based districtingintended to improve minority representation, see Shaw v.Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 650 (1993).The reasons for strict scrutiny are familiar. Racial classifications raise special fears that they are motivated by aninvidious purpose. Thus, we have admonished time and543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN506 JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtagain that, "[a]bsent searching judicial inquiry into the justi-fication for such race-based measures, there is simply no wayof determining . . . what classifications are in fact motivatedby illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racialpolitics." Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493(1989) (plurality opinion). We therefore apply strict scrutiny to all racial classifications to " `smoke out' illegitimateuses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goalimportant enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool."Ibid.1The CDC claims that its policy should be exempt from ourcategorical rule because it is "neutral"--that is, it "neitherbenefits nor burdens one group or individual more than anyother group or individual." Brief for Respondents 16. Inother words, strict scrutiny should not apply because allprisoners are "equally" segregated. The CDC's argumentignores our repeated command that "racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burdenor benefit the races equally." Shaw, supra, at 651. Indeed,we rejected the notion that separate can ever be equal--or"neutral"--50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education,347 U. S. 483 (1954), and we refuse to resurrect it today. Seealso Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991) (rejecting theargument that race-based peremptory challenges were permissible because they applied equally to white and black ju-rors and holding that "[i]t is axiomatic that racial classifications do not become legitimate on the assumption that allpersons suffer them in equal degree").We have previously applied a heightened standard of re-view in evaluating racial segregation in prisons. InLee v.1 Justice Thomas takes a hands-off approach to racial classifications inprisons, suggesting that a "compelling showing [is] needed to overcomethe deference we owe to prison administrators." Post, at 543 (dissentingopinion). But such deference is fundamentally at odds with our equalprotection jurisprudence. We put the burden on state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN507Cite as: 543 U. S. 499 (2005)Opinion of the CourtWashington, 390 U. S. 333 (1968) (per curiam), we upheld athree-judge court's decision striking down Alabama's policyof segregation in its prisons. Id., at 333-334. Alabama hadargued that desegregation would undermine prison securityand discipline, id., at 334, but we rejected that contention.Three Justices concurred "to make explicit something thatis left to be gathered only by implication from the Court'sopinion"--"that prison authorities have the right, acting ingood faith and inparticularized circumstances, to take intoaccount racial tensions in maintaining security, discipline,and good order in prisons and jails. "Ib id. (emphasisadded). The concurring Justices emphasized that they were"unwilling to assume that state or local prison authoritiesmight mistakenly regard such an explicit pronouncement asevincing any dilution of this Court's firm commitment to theFourteenth Amendment's prohibition of racial discrimination." Ibid.The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here,where prison officials cite racial violence as the reason fortheir policy. As we have recognized in the past, racial classifications "threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason oftheir membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility." Shaw, supra, at 643 (citing J. A. Croson Co., supra,at 493 (plurality opinion); emphasis added). Indeed, by insisting that inmates be housed only with other inmates ofthe same race, it is possible that prison officials will breedfurther hostility among prisoners and reinforce racial andethnic divisions. By perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates "may exacerbate thevery patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract."Shaw, supra, at 648; see also Trulson & Marquart, TheCaged Melting Pot: Toward an Understanding of the Consequences of Desegregation in Prisons, 36 Law & Soc. Rev. 743,774 (2002) (in a study of prison desegregation, finding that"over [10 years] the rate of violence between inmates segregated by race in double cells surpassed the rate among those543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN508 JOHNSON v.

Although Californiaclaimed at oral argument that two other States follow a similar policy, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-31, this assertion wasunsubstantiated, and we are unable to confirm or denyits accuracy.2 Virtually all other States and the FederalGovernment manage their prison systems without relianceon racial segregation. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24. Federal regulations governing the FederalBureau of Prisons (BOP) expressly prohibit racial segregation. 28 CFR $ 551.90 (2004) ("[BOP] staff shall not discrim2 Though, as Justice Thomas points out, see post, at 544-545, and n. 12,inmates in reception centers in Oklahoma and Texas " `are not generallyassigned randomly to racially integrated cells,' " it is also the case that"these inmates are not precluded from integrated cell assignments,"Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum No. OP-030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004), available athttp://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm (as visited Jan. 21, 2005, andavailable in Clerk of Court's case file); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice,Security Memorandum No. SM-01.28, Assignment to General PopulationTwo-Person Cells (June 15, 2002).

The United States contendsthat racial integration actually "leads to less violence inBOP's institutions and better prepares inmates for re-entryinto society." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.Indeed, the United States argues, based on its experiencewith the BOP, that it is possible to address "concerns ofprison security through individualized consideration withoutthe use of racial segregation, unless warranted as a neces-sary and temporary response to a race riot or other seriousthreat of race-related violence." Id., at 24. As to transfer-ees, in particular, whom the CDC has already evaluated atleast once, it is not clear why more individualized determina-tions are not possible.Because the CDC's policy is an express racial classification,it is "immediately suspect."Shaw, 509 U. S., at 642; see alsoWashington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, 485(1982). We therefore hold that the Court of Appeals erredwhen it failed to apply strict scrutiny to the CDC's policy andto require the CDC to demonstrate that its policy is narrowlytailored to serve a compelling state interest.BThe CDC invites us to make an exception to the rule thatstrict scrutiny applies to all racial classifications, and insteadto apply the deferential standard of review articulated inTurner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), because its segregationpolicy applies only in the prison context. We decline theinvitation. In Turner, we considered a claim by Missouriprisoners that regulations restricting inmate marriages andinmate-to-inmate correspondence were unconstitutional.Id., at 81. We rejected the prisoners' argument that theregulations should be subject to strict scrutiny, asking in-stead whether the regulation that burdened the prisoners'543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN510 JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtfundamental rights was "reasonably related" to "legitimatepenological interests."Id., at 89.We have never applied Turner to racial classifications.Turner itself did not involve any racial classification, and itcast no doubt on Lee. We think this unsurprising, as wehave appliedTurner's reasonable-relationship test only torights that are "inconsistent with proper incarceration."Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 131 (2003); see also Pellv.Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974) ("[A] prison inmateretains those First Amendment rights that are not incon-sistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimatepenological objectives of the corrections system"). This isbecause certain privileges and rights must necessarily belimited in the prison context. See O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 348 (1987) (" `[L]awful incarcerationbrings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of manyprivileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system' " (quoting Price v. Johnston, 334 U. S. 266, 285 (1948))). Thus, for example, we haverelied on Turner in addressing First Amendment challengesto prison regulations, including restrictions on freedom ofassociation, Overton, supra; limits on inmate correspondence, Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U. S. 223 (2001); restrictions oninmates' access to courts, Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343(1996); restrictions on receipt of subscription publications,Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S. 401 (1989); and work ruleslimiting prisoners' attendance at religious services, Shabazz,supra. We have also applied Turner to some due processclaims, such as involuntary medication of mentally ill prisoners, Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990); and restrictions on the right to marry, Turner, supra.The right not to be discriminated against based on one'srace is not susceptible to the logic of Turner. It is not aright that need necessarily be compromised for the sake ofproper prison administration.

Race discrimination is "especially pernicious in theadministration of justice."Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545,555 (1979). And public respect for our system of justice isundermined when the system discriminates based on race.Cf. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 99 (1986) ("[P]ublic respect for our criminal justice system and the rule of law willbe strengthened if we ensure that no citizen is disqualifiedfrom jury service because of his race"). When governmentofficials are permitted to use race as a proxy for gang membership and violence without demonstrating a compellinggovernment interest and proving that their means are narrowly tailored, society as a whole suffers. For similar reasons, we have not used Turner to evaluate Eighth Amendment claims of cruel and unusual punishment in prison. Wejudge violations of that Amendment under the "deliberateindifference" standard, rather than Turner's "reasonably related" standard. See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 738(2002) (asking whether prison officials displayed " `deliberateindifference' to the inmates' health or safety" where an inmate claimed that they violated his rights under the EighthAmendment (quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8(1992))). This is because the integrity of the criminal justicesystem depends on full compliance with the Eighth Amendment. See Spain v. Procunier, 600 F. 2d 189, 193-194 (CA91979) (Kennedy, J.) ("[T]he full protections of the eighthamendment most certainly remain in force [in prison]. Thewhole point of the amendment is to protect persons convictedof crimes. . . . Mechanical deference to the findings of stateprison officials in the context of the eighth amendment wouldreduce that provision to a nullity in precisely the contextwhere it is most necessary").In the prison context, when the government's power is atits apex, we think that searching judicial review of racialclassifications is necessary to guard against invidious dis543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN512 JOHNSON v.

Granting the CDC an exemption from the rulethat strict scrutiny applies to all racial classifications wouldundermine our "unceasing efforts to eradicate racial preju-dice from our criminal justice system."McCleskey v. Kemp,481 U. S. 279, 309 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).The CDC argues that "[d]eference to the particular expertise of prison officials in the difficult task of managing dailyprison operations" requires a more relaxed standard of re-view for its segregation policy. Brief for Respondents 18.But we have refused to defer to state officials' judgments onrace in other areas where those officials traditionally exercise substantial discretion. For example, we have held that,despite the broad discretion given to prosecutors when theyuse their peremptory challenges, using those challenges tostrike jurors on the basis of their race is impermissible. SeeBatson, supra, at 89-96. Similarly, in the redistricting context, despite the traditional deference given to States whenthey design their electoral districts, we have subjected redistricting plans to strict scrutiny when States draw districtlines based predominantly on race. Compare generallyVieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267 (2004) (partisan gerrymandering), with Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993) (racialgerrymandering).We did not relax the standard of review for racial classifications in prison in Lee, and we refuse to do so today.Rather, we explicitly reaffirm what we implicitly held in Lee:The "necessities of prison security and discipline," 390 U. S.,at 334, are a compelling government interest justifying onlythose uses of race that are narrowly tailored to address thosenecessities. See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 353 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Lee for theprinciple that "protecting prisoners from violence might justify narrowly tailored racial discrimination"); J. A. CrosonCo., 488 U. S., at 521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)(citing Lee for the proposition that "only a social emergencyrising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb--for543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN513Cite as: 543 U.

Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559(1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting))); see alsoPell, 417 U. S., at 823("[C]entral to all other corrections goals is the institutionalconsideration of internal security within the corrections fa-cilities themselves").Justice Thomas would subject race-based policies in pris-ons toTurner's deferential standard of review because, inhis view, judgments about whether race-based policies arenecessary "are better left in the first instance to the officialswho run our Nation's prisons." Post, at 542. But Turneris too lenient a standard to ferret out invidious uses of race.Turner requires only that the policy be "reasonably related"to "legitimate penological interests." 482 U. S., at 89.Turner would allow prison officials to use race-based policieseven when there are race-neutral means to accomplish thesame goal, and even when the race-based policy does not inpractice advance that goal. See, e. g., 321 F. 3d, at 803 (casebelow) (reasoning that, under Turner, the Court of Appealsdid "not have to agree that the policy actually advances theCDC's legitimate interest, but only [that] `defendants mightreasonably have thought that the policy would advance itsinterests' "). See also Turner, supra, at 90 (warning thatTurner is not a "least restrictive alternative test" (internalquotation marks omitted)).For example, in Justice Thomas' world, prison officialscould segregate visiting areas on the ground that racial mixing would cause unrest in the racially charged prison atmosphere. Under Turner, "[t]he prisoner would have to provethat there would not be a riot[.] [But] [i]t is certainly `plausible' that such a riot could ensue: our society, as well as ourprisons, contains enough racists that almost any interracialinteraction could potentially lead to conflict." 336 F. 3d, at543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN514 JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Court1120 (case below) (Ferguson, J., dissenting from denial of re-hearing en banc). Indeed, underJustice Thomas' view,there is no obvious limit to permissible segregation in prisons. It is not readily apparent why, if segregation in recep-tion centers is justified, segregation in the dining halls,yards, and general housing areas is not also permissible.Any of these areas could be the potential site of racial violence. If Justice Thomas' approach were to carry the day,even the blanket segregation policy struck down in Leemight stand a chance of survival if prison officials simplyasserted that it was necessary to prison management. Wetherefore reject the Turner standard for racial classificationsin prisons because it would make rank discrimination tooeasy to defend.The CDC protests that strict scrutiny will handcuff prisonadministrators and render them unable to address legitimateproblems of race-based violence in prisons. See also post, at531-532, 546-547 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Not so. Strictscrutiny is not "strict in theory, but fatal in fact."Adarand,515 U. S., at 237 (internal quotation marks omitted); Grutter,539 U. S., at 326-327 ("Although all governmental uses ofrace are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated byit"). Strict scrutiny does not preclude the ability of prisonofficials to address the compelling interest in prison safety.Prison administrators, however, will have to demonstratethat any race-based policies are narrowly tailored to thatend. See id., at 327 ("When race-based action is necessaryto further a compelling governmental interest, such actiondoes not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal pro-tection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is alsosatisfied").33 Justice Thomas characterizes the CDC's policy as a "limited" one, seepost, at 525, but the CDC's policy is in fact sweeping in its application. Itapplies to all prisoners housed in double cells in reception centers,whether newly admitted or transferred from one facility to another.Moreover, despite Justice Thomas' suggestion that the CDC considersother nonracial factors in determining housing placements, the CDC itself543US2 Unit: $U23 [03-07-07 14:12:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN515Cite as: 543 U. S. 499 (2005)Opinion of the CourtThe fact that strict scrutiny applies "says nothing aboutthe ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny." Ada-rand, supra, at 229-230. At this juncture, no such determination has been made. On remand, the CDC will have theburden of demonstrating that its policy is narrowly tailoredwith regard to new inmates as well as transferees. Prisonsare dangerous places, and the special circumstances theypresent may justify racial classifications in some contexts.Such circumstances can be considered in applying strict scrutiny, which is designed to take relevant differences intoaccount.IIIWe do not decide whether the CDC's policy violates theEqual Protection Clause. We hold only that strict scrutinyis the proper standard of review and remand the case toallow the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, or the District Court, to apply it in the first instance. See Consoli-dated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 557-558(1994) (reversing and remanding for the lower court to applythe correct legal standard in the first instance); Lucas v.South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1031-1032(1992) (same). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
