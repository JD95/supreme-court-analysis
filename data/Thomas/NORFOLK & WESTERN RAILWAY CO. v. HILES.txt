Before us in this case is the question whether $ 2 of theSafety Appliance Act (SAA), 49 U. S. C. $ 20302(a)(1)(A),makes a railroad liable as a matter of law for injuries in-curred by a railroad employee while trying to straighten amisaligned drawbar. We hold that it does not and, accord-ingly, reverse the judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court.IRailroad cars in a train are connected by couplers locatedat both ends of each car. A coupler consists of a knucklejoined to the end of a drawbar, which itself is fastened to ahousing mechanism on the car.

HILESOpinion of the Courttions--interlock when the fingers are curled.1 When carscome together, the open knuckle on one car engages a closedknuckle on the other car, automatically coupling the cars.The drawbar extends the knuckle out from the end of the carand is designed to pivot in its housing, allowing the knuckledend some lateral play to prevent moving cars from derailingon a curved track. As a consequence of this lateral movement, drawbars may remain off center when cars are uncoupled. This misalignment, if not corrected, may prevent carsfrom coupling by allowing the knuckles to pass by each other.To ensure proper coupling, railroad employees must realigndrawbars manually.Respondent William J. Hiles was a member of a switchingcrew at petitioner Norfolk & Western Railway Company'sLuther Yard in St. Louis, Missouri. His duties included coupling and uncoupling railroad cars and aligning drawbars.On July 18, 1990, Hiles injured his back while attempting torealign an off-center drawbar. Hiles sued in Illinois statecourt, alleging that Norfolk & Western had violated theSAA, which requires that cars be equipped with "couplerscoupling automatically by impact, and capable of being uncoupled, without the necessity of individuals going betweenthe ends of the vehicles." 49 U. S. C. $ 20302(a)(1)(A).Norfolk & Western argued that the misaligned drawbar didnot result from defective equipment. The trial courtgranted Hiles' motion for directed verdict on liability.The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed. 268 Ill. App.3d 561, 644 N. E. 2d 508 (1994). The Illinois Appellate Courtrecognized a deep split of authority over the proper interpretation of the SAA, but determined that it would not reconsider its "longstanding authority permitting a plaintiff . . . to1 See R.

Itconsisted of a tubelike body that received an oblong link.During coupling, a railworker had to stand between the carsas they came together and guide the link into the couplerpocket. Once the cars were joined, the employee inserted apin into a hole a few inches from the end of the tube to holdthe link in place. See J. White, American Railroad FreightCar 490 (1993) (hereinafter White). The link-and-pin coupler, though widely used, ultimately proved unsatisfactorybecause (i) it made a loose connection between the cars withtoo much give and play; (ii) there was no standard designand train crews often spent hours trying to match pins andlinks while coupling cars; (iii) links and pins were frequentlylost, resulting in substantial replacement costs; and (iv) crewmembers had to go between moving cars during couplingand were frequently injured and sometimes killed.

Janney patented a knuckle-style couplerthat was to become the standard for the freight car couplersused even today.3 See Figure 1. The coupler had a bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook, which, when broughtin contact with another coupler, would automatically interlock with its mate.Figure 1The Janney coupler had several advantages over link-andpin couplers. Not only did it alleviate the problem of looseparts that plagued the link-and-pin coupler,4 it also allowedrailworkers to couple and uncouple cars without having to3 Janney was a dry goods clerk and former Confederate Army officerfrom Alexandria, Virginia, who used his lunch hours to whittle from woodan alternative to the link-and-pin coupler. See F. Wilner, Safety: "A greatinvestment," Railway Age, Mar. 1993, p. 53 (hereinafter Wilner).4 Automatic couplers also made possible the use of power air brakes,which had not been successfully used with link-and-pin couplers becauseof excessive slack in the coupling. See Hearings on S. 811 et al. before theSenate Committee on Interstate Commerce, 52d Cong., 1st Sess. (1892),reprinted in S. Rep. No. 1049, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1892) (hereinafterSen.

When the opposite coupler was closedand locked in position, the brakeman was able to standsafely out of the way and signal the engineer to movethe cars together. When the knuckle of the coupler ofthe moving car hit the lever arm of the revolvingknuckle on the open coupler, it revolved around thelocked one, while concurrently the locking pin droppedautomatically from its set position into the coupler, locking the knuckle in place. Although the brakeman hadto set up the entire situation by hand, the actual lockingoperation was automatic and did not require the brakeman to stand between the cars." Clark 191.Though the market was flooded with literally thousands ofpatented couplers,6 Janney's design was clearly among thebest and slowly achieved recognition in the industry. Seeid., at 193-201. In 1888, the Master Car Builders Association Executive Committee obtained a limited waiver of patent rights--placing much of Janney's design in the public domain--and adopted the design as its standard. Conversion5 Ezra Miller is generally credited with creating the first semiautomaticcoupling device for passenger cars--known as the Miller Hook--but it wasnever widely used on freight cars. See C. Clark, Development of theSemiautomatic Freight-Car Coupler, 1863-1893, 13 Technology and Culture 170, 180-182 (1972) (hereinafter Clark); White 505-506.6 In 1875, there were more than 900 car coupler patents.

HILESOpinion of the Courtto the new standard proceeded slowly,7 partly as a result ofthe sheer number of competing designs on the market. Thelack of standardized couplers itself caused safety problems,8and reformers pushed Congress to pass legislation requiringthe use of standardized automatic couplers.In 1893, satisfied that an automatic coupler could meet thedemands of commercial railroad operations and, at the sametime, be manipulated safely, see Clark 206, Congress passedthe SAA. Its success in promoting switchyard safety wasstunning. Between 1877 and 1887, approximately 38% of allrailworker accidents involved coupling. Id., at 179. Thatpercentage fell as the railroads began to replace link-and-pincouplers with automatic couplers. The descent acceleratedduring the SAA's 7-year grace period and by 1902, only twoyears after the SAA's effective date, coupling accidents con-stituted only 4% of all employee accidents. In absolutenumbers, coupler-related accidents dropped from nearly11,000 in 1892 to just over 2,000 in 1902, even though thenumber of railroad employees steadily increased duringthat decade.7 The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, for instance, adopted a policy ofputting automatic couplers on all new cars and on every car that went intothe shop for repairs. Sen. Hearings, at 27. In 1890, approximately 10%of all freight cars in use in the United States were equipped with automatic couplers and power brakes. Wilner 54. By 1893, approximately16% of freight cars were so equipped. Ibid. Witnesses testifying beforethe Senate Committee in 1892 placed the figure between 12% and 20%.Sen. Hearings, at 12 (12% of cars fitted with Janney-style couplers); id., at27, 42 (20% of cars fitted with mutually interchangeable couplers).8 The new automatic couplers had design modifications that permittedthem to couple with link-and-pin style couplers, but not easily. See Clark192 ("[T]he knuckle of the Janney was notched in order to allow the opposing link to enter the drawhead to the point of coupling . . . but in practicalservice it was most difficult to effect"); S.

HILESOpinion of the Courtso that they will couple on impact. Johnson v. SouthernPacific Co., 196 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1904). The railroad is liablefor an employee's injury or death caused by a violation of theSAA. See St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, 210 U. S.281, 295 (1908) ("If the railroad . . . use[s] cars which do notcomply with the standard, it violates the plain prohibitionsof the law, and there arises from that violation the liabilityto make compensation to one who is injured by it").11Early SAA cases involved injuries that occurred when anemployee was forced to go between the cars during couplingoperations. See, e. g., Johnson, supra, at 2 (hand crushedbetween cars during coupling);San Antonio & AransasPass R. Co. v. Wagner, 241 U. S. 476, 478 (1916) (foot crushedbetween couplers); Atlantic City R. Co. v. Parker, 242 U. S.56, 58 (1916) (arm caught in drawhead between cars duringcoupling). Our later cases extended the reach of SAA liabil-ity beyond injuries occurring between cars during couplingto other injuries caused by the failure of cars to automati-cally couple.Affolder v. New York, C. & St. L. R. Co., 339U. S. 96, 97 (1950) (railroad employee who ran after a runaway train caused by failure to couple lost a leg when he fellunder a car);Carter v.

Hilesdid not assert a negligence claim under FELA.516us2$28n 11-04-98 14:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT409Cite as: 516 U. S. 400 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthat automatic couplers be present, but also that they actually perform. See, e. g., Affolder, supra, at 98; Carter,supra, at 433-434.IIIHiles urges that railroads have an absolute duty to outfittheir cars with safe equipment and that the SAA is violatedif an employee is required to go between the ends of cars tomanually adjust a misaligned drawbar. We cannot agree.Hiles correctly points out that failure to perform as requiredby the SAA is itself an actionable wrong dependent on neither negligence nor proof of a defect,12 see Affolder, supra,at 98-99; O'Donnell, supra, at 390, 393, but the absolute dutyto which we have referred on numerous occasions is notbreached as a matter of law when a drawbar becomes misaligned during the ordinary course of railroad operations.In Affolder, the plaintiff was working with a crew couplingcars. The 25th and 26th cars failed to couple and, after afew more cars were added, the first 25 cars began rollingdown a slight incline. The plaintiff ran after the runawaycars in an attempt to board and stop them, but instead fellunder a car and lost his leg. At trial, the railroad attemptedto prove that the coupler at issue was not defective and thatthe knuckle on the coupler was closed when the coupling attempt was made. Following O'Donnell, we reaffirmed thatthe failure of equipment to perform as required is sufficientto create SAA liability, Affolder, supra, at 99 (quotingO'Donnell, supra, at 390), but we noted that failure to couplewould not create liability if the coupler was not properly set:"Of course [imposition of failure-to-perform liability] assumes that the coupler was placed in a position to operate on impact. Thus, if `the failure of these two cars tocouple on impact was because the coupler on the Penn12 Hiles neither pleaded nor attempted to prove at trial that Norfolk &Western acted negligently or that the drawbar was defective.516us2$28n 11-04-98 14:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT410 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. HILESOpinion of the Courtsylvania car had not been properly opened,' the railroadhad a good defense." 339 U. S., at 99.13In Carter, we similarly conditioned the duty on the coupler'sbeing "properly set." 338 U. S., at 434; see O'Donnell,supra, at 394, n. 7 (declining to consider "a situation wherean adequate coupler failed to hold because it was improperly set").In Affolder, we predicated failure-to-perform liability onplacing the coupler "in a position to operate on impact." 339U. S., at 99. We implicitly recognized that certain preliminary steps, such as ensuring that the knuckle is open, arenecessary to proper performance of the coupler and that afailure to couple will not constitute an SAA violation if therailroad can show that the coupler had not been placed in aposition to automatically couple. Though Affolder involveda claimed closed knuckle, its language was not so limited and,as a matter of common sense, could not have been. Hilescould not reasonably complain that an otherwise workingelectrical appliance failed to perform if he had neglected toplug in the power cord. Similarly, a court cannot reasonablyfind as a matter of law that an otherwise nondefective cou-pler has failed to perform when the drawbar has not beenplaced "in a position to operate on impact." We think Affol-der's restriction on failure-to-perform liability logically extends to every step necessary to prepare a nondefective cou-pler for coupling, seesupra, at 404-405 (describing theordinary process of preparing for an automatic coupling),including ensuring proper alignment of the drawbar.1413 Justice Jackson, dissenting on other grounds, agreed: "Before a failureto couple establishes a defective coupler, it must be found that it wasproperly set so it could couple. If it was not adjusted as such automaticcouplers must be, of course the failure is not that of the device." Affolder,339 U. S., at 101.14 Our holding that Affolder's restriction on liability extends to misaligned drawbars suggests that, at least in this case, the absence of a failedcoupling attempt is of no consequence. On this record, Hiles would not516us2$28n 11-04-98 14:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT411Cite as: 516 U. S. 400 (1996)Opinion of the CourtHiles contends that the distinction between a closedknuckle and a misaligned drawbar makes a difference because opening a knuckle can be accomplished without goingbetween cars but realigning a drawbar cannot. This is particularly true, Hiles argues, given that Congress' "centralpolicy" in enacting the SAA was to protect the worker byobviating the necessity of going between cars. Brief for Respondent 12-13. We decline to adopt an expansive interpre-tation of $ 2 that would prohibit railroad employees fromgoing between cars to realign slued drawbars. The lan-guage of $ 2, which requires couplers that both will coupleand can be uncoupled without the necessity of persons goingbetween the cars, does not easily lend itself to Hiles' interpretation. Instead, as even Hiles apparently concedes, seeBrief for Respondent 19, the text of $ 2 only requires rail-roads to use a particular kind of coupler with certain attributes, and there is no question that Norfolk & Western's carsare equipped with couplers with the necessary functionalcharacteristics.15have been entitled to judgment as a matter of law even if he had beeninjured during a failed coupling attempt.15 Hiles reads into the legislative history a singular congressional intentto keep railroad workers from going between cars. Our construction of$ 2 rests on the text of the statute and our prior interpretations of thatlanguage. In any event, we think Hiles' reading of the legislative historyis erroneous. For instance, Hiles selectively quotes statements made byW. E. Rodgers during Senate Committee hearings to suggest that Congress wanted to force the railroads to adopt a coupler that would keeprailworkers out from between cars altogether. Brief for Respondent 14.A full reading of these statements makes clear, however, that Mr. Rodgersbelieved that adoption of the Janney design, as it then existed, would fullysatisfy the requirements of $ 2. Sen. Hearings, at 14. Hiles' reliance onstatements made by H. S. Haines, vice president of the American RailwayAssociation, is similarly misplaced. See Brief for Respondent 15. Mr.Haines evidently thought that 500 existing couplers would satisfy the requirements of the proposed bill. Sen. Hearings, at 41; see Hearings onAutomatic Couplers and Power Brakes before the House Committee onInterstate and Foreign Commerce, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1892). If Con516us2$28n 11-04-98 14:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT412 NORFOLK & WESTERN R. CO. v. HILESOpinion of the CourtAdopting Hiles' reading of $ 2 would require us to hold thata misaligned drawbar, by itself, is a violation of the SAA,and we are quite unwilling to do that. It is true that ourfailure-to-perform cases made clear that the railroad will beliable for injuries caused by malfunctioning equipment, evenwhen cars are equipped with automatic couplers. But wecannot agree that a misaligned drawbar is, as a matter oflaw, a malfunctioning drawbar. Historically, misaligneddrawbars were an inevitable byproduct of the ability to traverse curved track and, like the closed knuckle in Affolder,are part of the normal course of railroad car operations.We are understandably hesitant to adopt a reading of $ 2that would suggest that almost every railroad car in servicefor nearly a century has been in violation of the SAA. SeeUnited Transportation Union v. Lewis, 711 F. 2d 233, 251,n. 39 (CADC 1983). Our hesitance is augmented by the enforcement scheme Congress enacted with the SAA. Fromits beginning, $ 6 of the SAA provided that railroads in violagress had any singular purpose in enacting $ 2, it was to require the railroads to equip cars with uniformly compatible automatic couplers that employees could operate without having to go between the cars. See H. R.Rep. No. 1678, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1892) ("It is the judgment of thiscommittee that all cars and locomotives should be equipped with automaticcouplers, obviating the necessity of the men going between the cars");S. Rep. No. 1049, supra n. 8, at 6 (1892) ("What the railroad employe's needto secure greater safety in the performance of their duties is uniformity.They want all couplers alike and perfectly interchangeable"). We thinkCongress fairly intended to prohibit the practice of placing railworkersbetween moving cars to guide a link into its matching coupler pocket or,worse, into an unfamiliar coupler cavity. Cf. Hearings on Automatic Couplers and Power Brakes before the House Committee on Interstate andForeign Commerce, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1892) ("He goes in to make acoupling. He does not know the conditions that exist there. He can nottell whether it is a Janney or a Hinson, a Dowling, a Drexel, or some otherkind of a drawbar"). Contrary to Hiles' assertion, the legislative historycontains no suggestion that Congress intended to prevent an employeefrom going between cars to ensure that the knuckle is open, that the locking pin is set, see supra, at 405, or that the drawbar is aligned.516us2$28n 11-04-98 14:10:27 PAGES OPINPGT413Cite as: 516 U.

Yet Hiles points to not a single instance inwhich a railroad has been fined for misaligned drawbars. Itis not the case that the Government has simply neglected toenforce the penalty provisions of the SAA for nearly 100years.17 We think there is a better explanation than thatthe Government has failed to enforce this particular aspectof the SAA since its inception: A misaligned drawbar simplyis not a violation of $ 2.18Finally, relying on the railroads' experimental attempts todevelop automatic realigning devices, Hiles argues that Con-gress' clear intent to protect railroad employees in couplingoperations required the railroads to "develop a mechanismfor automatic realignment of a drawbar."

In itsproposed rulemaking for $ 218.39, the FRA explained that the proposedrule would protect employees who place themselves between cars to couple air hoses or adjust coupling devices, including "adjusting drawbars."48 Fed.

We reject this argument, for we find no suchcommand in the text of $ 2. Congress plainly instructed therailroads to install compatible and automatic couplers on allcars, at a time when this basic technology had been in existence for two decades and had received widespread testingand recognition as a feasible technology superior to what wasthen in primary use. In contrast, Hiles concedes that auto-matic realignment technology did not even exist in 1893when Congress passed the SAA, see Brief for Respondent26-27, and, according to Norfolk & Western, automatic realignment has never been shown to be effective. But thismatters not, because Congress legislated working automaticcouplers for employee safety, not employee safety by what-ever method a court might deem appropriate.The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is
