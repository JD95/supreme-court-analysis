At the time of the framing, the common law of search andseizure recognized a law enforcement officer's authority tobreak open the doors of a dwelling, but generally indicatedthat he first ought to announce his presence and authority.In this case, we hold that this common-law "knock and an-nounce" principle forms a part of the reasonableness inquiryunder the Fourth Amendment.IDuring November and December 1992, petitioner SharleneWilson made a series of narcotics sales to an informant acting at the direction of the Arkansas State Police. In lateNovember, the informant purchased marijuana and methamphetamine at the home that petitioner shared with BrysonJacobs. On December 30, the informant telephoned petitioner at her home and arranged to meet her at a local storeto buy some marijuana. According to testimony presentedbelow, petitioner produced a semiautomatic pistol at thismeeting and waved it in the informant's face, threateningto kill her if she turned out to be working for the police.Petitioner then sold the informant a bag of marijuana.The next day, police officers applied for and obtained war-rants to search petitioner's home and to arrest both petitioner and Jacobs. Affidavits filed in support of the war-rants set forth the details of the narcotics transactions andstated that Jacobs had previously been convicted of arsonand firebombing. The search was conducted later that afternoon. Police officers found the main door to petitioner'shome open. While opening an unlocked screen door and entering the residence, they identified themselves as police of-ficers and stated that they had a warrant. Once inside thehome, the officers seized marijuana, methamphetamine, val-ium, narcotics paraphernalia, a gun, and ammunition. Theyalso found petitioner in the bathroom, flushing marijuanadown the toilet. Petitioner and Jacobs were arrested and514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT930 WILSON v. ARKANSASOpinion of the Courtcharged with delivery of marijuana, delivery of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession ofmarijuana.Before trial, petitioner filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search. Petitioner asserted that thesearch was invalid on various grounds, including that the officers had failed to "knock and announce" before entering herhome. The trial court summarily denied the suppressionmotion. After a jury trial, petitioner was convicted of allcharges and sentenced to 32 years in prison.The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction on appeal. 317 Ark. 548, 878 S. W. 2d 755 (1994). Thecourt noted that "the officers entered the home while theywere identifying themselves," but it rejected petitioner's argument that "the Fourth Amendment requires officers toknock and announce prior to entering the residence." Id.,at 553, 878 S. W. 2d, at 758 (emphasis added). Finding "noauthority for [petitioner's] theory that the knock and announce principle is required by the Fourth Amendment," thecourt concluded that neither Arkansas law nor the FourthAmendment required suppression of the evidence. Ibid.We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among thelower courts as to whether the common-law knock and announce principle forms a part of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry.1 513 U. S. 1014 (1995). We hold thatit does, and accordingly reverse and remand.1 See, e. g., People v. Gonzalez, 211 Cal. App. 3d 1043, 1048, 259 Cal.Rptr. 846, 848 (1989) ("Announcement and demand for entry at the timeof service of a search warrant [are] part of Fourth Amendment reasonableness"); People v. Saechao, 129 Ill. 2d 522, 531, 544 N. E. 2d 745, 749 (1989)("[T]he presence or absence of such an announcement is an important consideration in determining whether subsequent entry to arrest or search isconstitutionally reasonable") (internal quotation marks omitted); Commonwealth v. Goggin, 412 Mass. 200, 202, 587 N. E. 2d 785, 787 (1992)("Our knock and announce rule is one of common law which is not constitutionally compelled").514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT931Cite as: 514 U. S. 927 (1995)Opinion of the CourtIIThe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects "[t]heright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches andseizures." In evaluating the scope of this right, we havelooked to the traditional protections against unreasonablesearches and seizures afforded by the common law at thetime of the framing. See California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S.621, 624 (1991); United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 418-420 (1976); Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 149 (1925)."Although the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable,"New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 337 (1985), our effort togive content to this term may be guided by the meaningascribed to it by the Framers of the Amendment. An examination of the common law of search and seizure leaves nodoubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling maydepend in part on whether law enforcement officers announced their presence and authority prior to entering.Although the common law generally protected a man'shouse as "his castle of defence and asylum," 3 W. Blackstone,Commentaries *288 (hereinafter Blackstone), common-lawcourts long have held that "when the King is party, the sheriff (if the doors be not open) may break the party's house,either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K[ing]'sprocess, if otherwise he cannot enter." Semayne's Case, 5Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 195 (K. B. 1603). Tothis rule, however, common-law courts appended an important qualification:"But before he breaks it, he ought to signify the causeof his coming, and to make request to open doors . . . ,for the law without a default in the owner abhors thedestruction or breaking of any house (which is for thehabitation and safety of man) by which great damageand inconvenience might ensue to the party, when no514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT932 WILSON v. ARKANSASOpinion of the Courtdefault is in him; for perhaps he did not know of theprocess, of which, if he had notice, it is to be presumedthat he would obey it . . . ." Ibid., 77 Eng. Rep., at195-196.See also Case of Richard Curtis, Fost. 135, 137, 168 Eng.Rep. 67, 68 (Crown 1757) ("[N]o precise form of words isrequired in a case of this kind. It is sufficient that the partyhath notice, that the officer cometh not as a mere trespasser,but claiming to act under a proper authority . . ."); Lee v.Gansell, Lofft 374, 381-382, 98 Eng. Rep. 700, 705 (K. B.1774) ("[A]s to the outer door, the law is now clearly taken"that it is privileged; but the door may be broken "when thedue notification and demand has been made and refused").2Several prominent founding-era commentators agreed onthis basic principle. According to Sir Matthew Hale, the"constant practice" at common law was that "the officer maybreak open the door, if he be sure the offender is there, ifafter acquainting them of the business, and demanding theprisoner, he refuses to open the door." See 1 M. Hale, Pleasof the Crown *582. William Hawkins propounded a similarprinciple: "the law doth never allow" an officer to break openthe door of a dwelling "but in cases of necessity," that is,unless he "first signify to those in the house the cause of hiscoming, and request them to give him admittance." 2 W.Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 14, $ 1, p. 138 (6th ed. 1787).2 This "knock and announce" principle appears to predate even Semayne's Case, which is usually cited as the judicial source of the commonlaw standard. Semayne's Case itself indicates that the doctrine may betraced to a statute enacted in 1275, and that at that time the statute was"but an affirmance of the common law." 5 Co. Rep., at 91b, 77 Eng. Rep.,at 196 (referring to 3 Edw. I, ch. 17, in 1 Statutes at Large from MagnaCarta to Hen. 6 (O. Ruffhead ed. 1769) (providing that if any person takesthe beasts of another and causes them "to be driven into a Castle or Fortress," if the sheriff makes "solem[n] deman[d]" for deliverance of thebeasts, and if the person "did not cause the Beasts to be delivered incontinent," the King "shall cause the said Castle or Fortress to be beaten downwithout Recovery")).514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT933Cite as: 514 U. S. 927 (1995)Opinion of the CourtSir William Blackstone stated simply that the sheriff may"justify breaking open doors, if the possession be not quietlydelivered." 3 Blackstone *412.The common-law knock and announce principle was wovenquickly into the fabric of early American law. Most of theStates that ratified the Fourth Amendment had enacted con-stitutional provisions or statutes generally incorporatingEnglish common law, see, e. g., N. J. Const. of 1776, $ 22, in 5Federal and State Constitutions 2598 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909)("[T]he common law of England . . . shall still remain in force,until [it] shall be altered by a future law of the Legislature");N. Y. Const. of 1777, Art. 35, in id., at 2635 ("[S]uch parts ofthe common law of England . . . as . . . did form the law of[New York on April 19, 1775] shall be and continue the lawof this State, subject to such alterations and provisions asthe legislature of this State shall, from time to time, makeconcerning the same"); Ordinances of May 1776, ch. 5, $ 6, in9 Statutes at Large of Virginia 127 (W. Hening ed. 1821)("[T]he common law of England . . . shall be the rule of decision, and shall be considered as in full force, until the sameshall be altered by the legislative power of this colony"), anda few States had enacted statutes specifically embracing thecommon-law view that the breaking of the door of a dwellingwas permitted once admittance was refused, see, e. g., Act ofNov. 8, 1782, ch. 15, || 6, in Acts and Laws of Massachusetts193 (1782); Act of Apr. 13, 1782, ch. 39, $ 3, in 1 Laws of theState of New York 480 (1886); Act of June 24, 1782, ch. 317,$ 18, in Acts of the General Assembly of New-Jersey (1784)(reprinted in The First Laws of the State of New Jersey293-294 (J. Cushing comp. 1981)); Act of Dec. 23, 1780,ch. 925, $ 5, in 10 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 255 (J.Mitchell & H. Flanders comp. 1904). Early American courtssimilarly embraced the common-law knock and announceprinciple. See, e. g., Walker v. Fox, 32 Ky. 404, 405 (1834);Burton v. Wilkinson, 18 Vt. 186, 189 (1846); Howe v. Butterfield, 58 Mass. 302, 305 (1849). See generally Blakey, The514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT934 WILSON v. ARKANSASOpinion of the CourtRule of Announcement and Unlawful Entry, 112 U. Pa. L.Rev. 499, 504-508 (1964) (collecting cases).Our own cases have acknowledged that the common-lawprinciple of announcement is "embedded in Anglo-Americanlaw," Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313 (1958), butwe have never squarely held that this principle is an elementof the reasonableness inquiry under the Fourth Amendment.3We now so hold. Given the longstanding common-law endorsement of the practice of announcement, we have littledoubt that the Framers of the Fourth Amendment thoughtthat the method of an officer's entry into a dwelling wasamong the factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a search or seizure. Contrary to the decisionbelow, we hold that in some circumstances an officer's unannounced entry into a home might be unreasonable under theFourth Amendment.This is not to say, of course, that every entry must be pre-ceded by an announcement. The Fourth Amendment's flexible requirement of reasonableness should not be read tomandate a rigid rule of announcement that ignores countervailing law enforcement interests. As even petitioner con-cedes, the common-law principle of announcement was neverstated as an inflexible rule requiring announcement under allcircumstances. SeeKer v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 38(1963) (plurality opinion) ("[I]t has been recognized from theearly common law that . . . breaking is permissible in execut-ing an arrest under certain circumstances"); see also, e. g.,3 In Miller, our discussion focused on the statutory requirement of announcement found in 18 U. S. C. $ 3109 (1958 ed.), not on the constitutionalrequirement of reasonableness. See 357 U. S., at 306, 308, 313. See alsoSabbath v. United States, 391 U. S. 585, 591, n. 8 (1968) (suggesting thatboth the "common law" rule of announcement and entry and its "exceptions" were codified in $ 3109); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 40-41 (1963)(plurality opinion) (reasoning that an unannounced entry was reasonableunder the "exigent circumstances" of that case, without addressing theantecedent question whether the lack of announcement might render asearch unreasonable under other circumstances).514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT935Cite as: 514 U. S. 927 (1995)Opinion of the CourtWhite & Wiltsheire, 2 Rolle 137, 138, 81 Eng. Rep. 709, 710(K. B. 1619) (upholding the sheriff 's breaking of the door ofthe plaintiff 's dwelling after the sheriff 's bailiffs had beenimprisoned in plaintiff 's dwelling while they attempted anearlier execution of the seizure); Pugh v. Griffith, 7 Ad. & E.827, 840-841, 112 Eng. Rep. 681, 686 (K. B. 1838) (holdingthat "the necessity of a demand . . . is obviated, because therewas nobody on whom a demand could be made" and notingthatWhite & Wiltsheire leaves open the possibility thatthere may be "other occasions where the outer door may bebroken" without prior demand).Indeed, at the time of the framing, the common-law admonition that an officer "ought to signify the cause of his coming," Semayne's Case, 5 Co. Rep., at 91b, 77 Eng. Rep., at195, had not been extended conclusively to the context offelony arrests. See Blakey, supra, at 503 ("The full scope ofthe application of the rule in criminal cases . . . was neverjudicially settled"); Launock v. Brown, 2 B. & Ald. 592, 593,106 Eng. Rep. 482, 483 (K. B. 1819) ("It is not at presentnecessary for us to decide how far, in the case of a personcharged with felony, it would be necessary to make a previous demand of admittance before you could justify breakingopen the outer door of his house"); W. Murfree, Law of Sheriffs and Other Ministerial Officers $ 1163, p. 631 (1st ed. 1884)("[A]lthough there has been some doubt on the question, thebetter opinion seems to be that, in cases of felony, no demandof admittance is necessary, especially as, in many cases, thedelay incident to it would enable the prisoner to escape").The common-law principle gradually was applied to cases involving felonies, but at the same time the courts continuedto recognize that under certain circumstances the presumption in favor of announcement necessarily would give way tocontrary considerations.Thus, because the common-law rule was justified in partby the belief that announcement generally would avoid "thedestruction or breaking of any house . . . by which great514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT936 WILSON v. ARKANSASOpinion of the Courtdamage and inconvenience might ensue," Semayne's Case,supra, at 91b, 77 Eng. Rep., at 196, courts acknowledged thatthe presumption in favor of announcement would yield undercircumstances presenting a threat of physical violence. See,e. g., Read v. Case, 4 Conn. 166, 170 (1822) (plaintiff who "hadresolved . . . to resist even to the shedding of blood . . . wasnot within the reason and spirit of the rule requiring notice"); Mahomed v. The Queen, 4 Moore 239, 247, 13 Eng.Rep. 293, 296 (P. C. 1843) ("While he was firing pistols atthem, were they to knock at the door, and to ask him to bepleased to open it for them? The law in its wisdom onlyrequires this ceremony to be observed when it possibly maybe attended with some advantage, and may render thebreaking open of the outer door unnecessary"). Similarly,courts held that an officer may dispense with announcementin cases where a prisoner escapes from him and retreats tohis dwelling. See, e. g., ibid.; Allen v. Martin, 10 Wend. 300,304 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1833). Proof of "demand and refusal"was deemed unnecessary in such cases because it would bea "senseless ceremony" to require an officer in pursuit ofa recently escaped arrestee to make an announcement priorto breaking the door to retake him. Id., at 304. Finally,courts have indicated that unannounced entry may be justified where police officers have reason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed if advance notice weregiven. See Ker, supra, at 40-41 (plurality opinion); Peoplev. Maddox, 46 Cal. 2d 301, 305-306, 294 P. 2d 6, 9 (1956).We need not attempt a comprehensive catalog of the relevant countervailing factors here. For now, we leave to thelower courts the task of determining the circumstancesunder which an unannounced entry is reasonable under theFourth Amendment. We simply hold that although a searchor seizure of a dwelling might be constitutionally defectiveif police officers enter without prior announcement, lawenforcement interests may also establish the reasonablenessof an unannounced entry.514us3$61Z 03-18-97 20:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT937Cite as: 514 U. S. 927 (1995)Opinion of the CourtIIIRespondent contends that the judgment below should beaffirmed because the unannounced entry in this case was justified for two reasons. First, respondent argues that policeofficers reasonably believed that a prior announcementwould have placed them in peril, given their knowledge thatpetitioner had threatened a government informant with asemiautomatic weapon and that Mr. Jacobs had previouslybeen convicted of arson and firebombing. Second, respondent suggests that prior announcement would have producedan unreasonable risk that petitioner would destroy easily disposable narcotics evidence.These considerations may well provide the necessary justification for the unannounced entry in this case. Because theArkansas Supreme Court did not address their sufficiency,however, we remand to allow the state courts to make anynecessary findings of fact and to make the determination ofreasonableness in the first instance. The judgment of theArkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with thisopinion.4
