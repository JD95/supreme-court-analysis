The Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 405, 25 Stat. 888,removed a substantial amount of land from the reservationand divided the remaining territory into several reserva-tions, including the Cheyenne River Reservation, which islocated in north-central South Dakota.

App. 64.After severe floods devastated the lower Missouri Riverbasin in 1943 and 1944, Congress passed the Flood ControlAct of 1944, ch. 665, 58 Stat. 887. This Act authorized theestablishment of a comprehensive flood control plan alongthe Missouri River, which serves as the eastern border ofthe Cheyenne River Reservation. The Act also directed theArmy Chief of Engineers to "construct, maintain, and operate public park and recreational facilities in reservoir areas,"and provided that the "reservoirs shall be open to public usegenerally," subject to "such rules and regulations as the Sec-retary of War may deem necessary." $ 4, 58 Stat. 889-890.Seven subsequent Acts of Congress authorized limited tak-ings of Indian lands for hydroelectric and flood control damson the Missouri River in both North and South Dakota.

Oneof the largest of these takings involved the Oahe Dam andReservoir Project, for which Congress required the Chey-enne River Sioux Tribe to relinquish 104,420 acres of itstrust lands, including roughly 2,000 acres of land underlyingthe Missouri River.1 The Tribe's agreement to "convey tothe United States all tribal, allotted, assigned, and inheritedlands or interests" needed for the project is memorializedin the Cheyenne River Act of Sept. 3, 1954, 68 Stat. 1191.21 Congress authorized the Departments of the Army and the Interior tonegotiate contracts with the Cheyenne River Tribe and the Standing RockSioux Tribe for land needed for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir. See ch.1120, 64 Stat. 1093.2 The Tribe received a total of $10,644,014 in exchange for the 104,420acres of land and interests therein taken by the United States. Thisamount included compensation for the loss of wildlife, the loss of revenuefrom grazing permits, the costs of negotiating the agreement, and the costsof "complete rehabilitation" of all resident members and the restoration oftribal life.

BOURLANDOpinion of the CourtPursuant to the Flood Control Act, the United States alsoacquired for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project an additional 18,000 acres that were owned in fee by non-Indians.3Although the Tribe conveyed all interests in the 104,420acres of former trust lands to the United States,4 the Chey-enne River Act reserved to the Tribe or tribal memberscertain rights respecting the use of these lands. Section 6reserved "mineral rights" to the Tribe or individual triballandowners, "subject to all reasonable regulations, whichmay be imposed by the [Army's] Chief of Engineers."Id.,at 1192. Section 7 gave tribal members the right "withoutcharge to cut and remove all timber and to salvage . . . im-provements" until the dam area was impounded. Ibid. Section 9 allowed tribal members to continue residing on thetaken land until closure of the dam's gates.Id., at 1192-1193. Section 10 provided that the Tribe would have theright to "graze stock" on the taken lands and that:"[The] Tribal Council and the members of said IndianTribe shall have, without cost, the right of freeaccessto the shoreline of the reservoir including the rightto hunt and fish in and on the aforesaid shoreline andreservoir, subject, however, to regulations governingthe corresponding use by other citizens of the UnitedStates." Id., at 1193 (emphasis added).53 The record does not reflect how these lands had come to be owned bynon-Indians.4 The question on which we granted certiorari assumes the UnitedStates acquired these lands in fee, and the District Court referred to the"transfer of fee ownership from the Tribe to the United States." App.125. The Court of Appeals, however, referred to the lands as "neithernon-Indian-owned fee land nor trust land." 949 F. 2d 984, 990 (CA8 1991).Because the nature of the Government's title is not relevant to our analysis, we may assume that the United States owns the 104,420 acres in fee.5 The Cheyenne River Act became effective upon confirmation and acceptance in writing by "three-quarters of the adult Indians of the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota." 68 Stat. 1191.

The Tribe enforced its regulationsagainst all violators; the State limited its enforcement tonon-Indians. In 1988, following a dispute between the Stateand the tribal respondents regarding the 1988 deer huntingseason, the Tribe announced that it would no longer recog-nize state hunting licenses and that hunters within the reservation would be "subject to prosecution in tribal court" un-less licensed by the Tribe. App. 58. In response, the Statefiled this action against the Chairman of the Cheyenne RiverSioux Tribe and the Director of Cheyenne River Sioux TribeGame, Fish and Parks. In its complaint, the State soughtto enjoin the Tribe from excluding non-Indians from huntingon nontrust lands within the reservation. In the alterna-tive, the State sought a declaration that the federal takingsof tribal lands for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir had reducedthe Tribe's authority by withdrawing these lands from thereservation. Id., at 39-40 (Second Amended Complaint).The District Court concluded that the Cheyenne River Act"did not disestablish the Missouri River boundary of theCheyenne River Reservation."Id., at 103. Nevertheless,relying on Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544 (1981),the District Court held that $ 10 of the Cheyenne River Actclearly abrogated the Tribe's right to exclusive use and possession of the former trust lands. App. 125. The court fur-ther found that "Congress has not expressly delegated to theTribe hunting and fishing jurisdiction over nonmembers" onthe taken lands.6 Id., at 149. The District Court perma6 Although the District Court ruled on the issue of the Tribe's regulatoryjurisdiction over Indians who are not members of the Cheyenne RiverSioux, the Court of Appeals vacated that portion of the opinion. It notedthat the "issue of tribal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians was neitherpled nor tried; the complaint was limited to the question of jurisdictionover non-Indians." 949 F. 2d, at 990. The State did not raise this issuein its petition for certiorari, and hence the only question before us iswhether the Tribe may regulate non-Indians who hunt and fish in thetaken area.508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT686 SOUTH DAKOTA v. BOURLANDOpinion of the Courtnently enjoined the Tribe and its members from exertingsuch authority.7The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part,and remanded. 949 F. 2d 984 (CA8 1991). The court distinguished between the 104,420 acres of former trust lands ac-quired pursuant to the Cheyenne River Act and the 18,000acres of former non-Indian fee lands acquired pursuant tothe Flood Control Act. As to the former trust lands, thecourt held that the Tribe had authority to regulate nonIndian hunting and fishing because the Cheyenne River Actdid not clearly reveal Congress' intent to divest the Tribe ofits treaty right to do so. As to the 18,000 acres of formerfee lands, however, the court found that Montana v. UnitedStates and Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands ofYakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408 (1989), controlled. Assumingthe 18,000 acres had previously been held in fee by nonIndians pursuant to one of the Allotment Acts, the Court ofAppeals noted that:"Since Montana held that tribes have been divested oftheir regulatory authority over non-Indians hunting andfishing on land held in fee by non-Indians pursuant to an7 The District Court found no evidence that the Tribe has ever imposedcriminal sanctions on a nonmember who violated tribal hunting or fishingordinances. App. 87. Throughout this litigation, respondents have disavowed any criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers, asserting instead thatthe sanctions they seek to impose on unlicensed hunters and fishermen arepurely civil in nature. Id., at 85. The State, however, has contendedthat these tribal regulations will be enforced through criminal sanctions.The District Court dismissed the State's request for a declaration that theTribe has "no jurisdiction" to arrest and try non-Indians on the reservation, on the ground that the "purported controversy lacks sufficient immediacy and reality." Id., at 88 (internal quotation marks omitted). In anyevent, we have previously held that "the inherent sovereignty of the Indian tribes does not extend to criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians whocommit crimes on the reservation." Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 684(1990) (emphasis added). See also Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S.191, 210 (1978).508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT687Cite as: 508 U.

Our reading of therelevant statutes persuades us that Congress has abrogatedthe Tribe's rights under the Fort Laramie Treaty to regulatehunting and fishing by non-Indians in the area taken for theOahe Dam and Reservoir Project.The Fort Laramie Treaty granted to the Cheyenne RiverSioux Tribe the unqualified right of "absolute and undis8 Although respondents did not cross-petition for review of this portionof the Court of Appeals' decision, the State argues that the Court of Appeals' general approach in distinguishing between the 18,000 acres of nonIndian fee lands and the 104,420 acres of former trust lands was "withoutbasis in this Court's rulings," and thus "wrong and unworkable."

BOURLANDOpinion of the Courtturbed use and occupation" of their reservation lands. 15Stat. 636. We have interpreted identical language in a parallel treaty between the United States and the Crow Tribeas embracing the implicit "power to exclude others" fromthe reservation and thereby "arguably conferr[ing] upon theTribe the authority to control fishing and hunting on thoselands."Montana v. United States, supra, at 558-559 (construing the second Fort Laramie Treaty, 15 Stat. 649).Thus, we may conclude that pursuant to its original treatywith the United States, the Cheyenne River Tribe possessedboth the greater power to exclude non-Indians from, andarguably the lesser included, incidental power to regulatenon-Indian use of, the lands later taken for the Oahe Damand Reservoir Project.Like this case, Montana concerned an Indian Tribe'spower to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing on landslocated within a reservation but no longer owned by theTribe or its members. Under the General Allotment Act of1887, ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 332 etseq., and the Crow Allotment Act of 1920, ch. 224, 41 Stat.751, Congress had provided for certain Crow lands to be conveyed in fee to non-Indians for homesteading. We held thatbecause the Tribe thereby lost the right of absolute use andoccupation of lands so conveyed, the Tribe no longer had theincidental power to regulate the use of the lands by nonIndians. See 450 U. S., at 559. Similarly, six Members ofthis Court, in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes, determinedthat at least with regard to the "open" portion of the YakimaReservation, the Yakima Tribe had lost the authority to zonelands that had come to be owned in fee by non-Indians. 492U. S., 423-424 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 444-445 (opinionof Stevens, J.). Because significant portions of that part ofthe reservation had been allotted under the General Allotment Act and had passed to non-Indians, those Justices concluded that the treaty's "exclusive use and benefit" provisionwas inapplicable to those lands and therefore could not con508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT689Cite as: 508 U. S. 679 (1993)Opinion of the Courtfer tribal authority to regulate the conduct of non-Indiansthere. Id., at 422, 445.Montana and Brendale establish that when an Indiantribe conveys ownership of its tribal lands to non-Indians,it loses any former right of absolute and exclusive use andoccupation of the conveyed lands. The abrogation of thisgreater right, at least in the context of the type of area atissue in this case,9 implies the loss of regulatory jurisdictionover the use of the land by others. In taking tribal trustlands and other reservation lands for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, and broadly opening up those lands for publicuse, Congress, through the Flood Control and CheyenneRiver Acts eliminated the Tribe's power to exclude non-Indians from these lands, and with that the incidental regulatory jurisdiction formerly enjoyed by the Tribe.The Flood Control Act authorized the construction, management, and operation of public recreational facilities on thelands taken for the Oahe Reservoir. $ 4, 58 Stat. 889, asamended, 16 U. S. C. $ 460d. Section 4 of the Act providesthat "all such projects shall be open to public use generally"for various "recreational purposes, . . . when such use is de-termined by the Secretary of the Army not to be contraryto the public interest, all under such rules and regulations asthe Secretary of the Army may deem necessary." Section 4further mandates "ready access to and exit from such waterareas . . . for general public use." Thus, the clear effect ofthe Flood Control Act is to open the lands taken for the OaheDam and Reservoir Project for the general recreational useof the public. Because hunting and fishing are "recreationalpurposes," the Flood Control Act affirmatively allows nonIndians to hunt and fish on such lands, subject to federal9 The District Court found that the taken area is not a "closed" or pristine area, and the Court of Appeals did not disturb that finding. 949 F. 2d,at 995. We agree that the area at issue here has been broadly opened tothe public. Thus, we need not reach the issue of a tribe's regulatory authority in other contexts.508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT690 SOUTH DAKOTA v. BOURLANDOpinion of the Courtregulation. The Act also clearly prohibits any "use" of thelands "which is inconsistent with the laws for the protectionof fish and game of the State in which such area is situated"or which is determined by the Secretary of the Army to be"contrary to the public interest." Ibid.If the Flood Control Act leaves any doubt whether theTribe retains its original treaty right to regulate non-Indianhunting and fishing on lands taken for federal water projects,the Cheyenne River Act extinguishes all such doubt. Section II of that Act declares that the sum paid by the Government to the Tribe for former trust lands taken for the OaheDam and Reservoir Project, "shall be in final and completesettlement of all claims, rights, and demands" of the Tribeor its allottees. 68 Stat. 1191. This provision reliably indicates that the Government and the Tribe understood the Actto embody the full terms of their agreement, including thevarious rights that the Tribe and its members would continue to enjoy after conveying the 104,420 acres to the Government.10 The Tribe's $ IX "right of free access to theshoreline of the reservoir includ[es] the right to hunt andfish" but is "subject . . . to regulations governing the corresponding use by other citizens of the United States." Id.,at 1193 (emphasis added). If Congress had intended by thisprovision to grant the Tribe the additional right to regulatehunting and fishing, it would have done so by a similarlyexplicit statutory command. The rights granted the Tribein $ IX stand in contrast to the expansive treaty right originally granted to the Tribe of "absolute and undisturbed use,"which does encompass the right to exclude and to regulate.See Montana, 450 U. S., at 554, 558.10 The dissent apparently finds ambiguity in this provision, on theground that it "does not address the question of which rights Congressintended to take." Post, at 703. The self-evident answer is that whenCongress used the term "all claims, rights, and demands" of the Tribe, 68Stat. 1191, it meant all claims, rights, and demands.508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT691Cite as: 508 U.

See Tr. of OralArg. 27-28, 30-31. It is ultimately irrelevant whether re-spondents claim a power to exclude.11 Congress gave theArmy Corps of Engineers, not the Tribe, regulatory controlover the taken area. And as we have noted, an abrogatedtreaty right of unimpeded use and occupation of lands "canno longer serve as the basis for tribal exercise of the lesserincluded power" to regulate. Brendale, 492 U. S., at 424.In the absence of applicable Army Corps regulations allowing the Tribe to assert regulatory jurisdiction over the proj-ect lands, we conclude that the Flood Control Act's openaccess mandate and the Cheyenne River Act's relevantprovisions affirmatively abrogate the Tribe's authority toregulate entry onto or use of these lands.12The Court of Appeals found Montana inapposite with respect to the 104,420 acres of former trust lands because "[t]hepurpose of the [Cheyenne River] Act, unlike that of the Allotment Act at issue in Montana, was not the destruction oftribal self-government, but was only to acquire the propertyrights necessary to construct and operate the Oahe Dam andReservoir." 949 F. 2d, at 993.

S. 408, 423-424 (1989) (opinion ofWhite, J.).12 We do not address whether South Dakota has regulatory control overhunting and fishing in the taken area. In its declaratory judgment action,the State sought only a judicial determination regarding the Tribe's claimto regulatory jurisdiction.508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT692 SOUTH DAKOTA v.

However, at the end of this discussion, the Court unequivocally stated that "what is relevant . . . is the effect of the land alienation occasioned bythat policy on Indian treaty rights tied to Indian use andoccupation of reservation land." 450 U. S., at 560, n. 9 (emphasis added). Thus, regardless of whether land is conveyedpursuant to an Act of Congress for homesteading or for floodcontrol purposes, when Congress has broadly opened up suchland to non-Indians, the effect of the transfer is the destruction of pre-existing Indian rights to regulatory control.13 Although Montana involved lands conveyed in fee to nonIndians within the Crow Reservation, Montana's frameworkfor examining the "effect of the land alienation" is applicableto the federal takings in this case.The takings at issue here do differ from the conveyancesof fee title in Montana, however, in that the terms of the13 The dissent argues that our reliance on Montana v.

In fact, as the dissent acknowledges, post, at 702, Congress in the Flood Control Act also mandated thatthe water projects serve as recreational facilities for the general publicfor activities such as "boating, swimming, bathing, [and] fishing," subjectto such "rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Army may deemnecessary." 16 U.

Contrary to the dissent's reasoning, seepost, at 700, that Congress vested the Secretary of the Army with broadregulatory authority over the management of these lands is explicit evidence that Congress "considered the possibility that by taking the land. . . it would deprive the Tribe of its authority to regulate non-Indianhunting and fishing on that land."

It could be argued that by reserving these rights, Congress preserved the right to regulateuse of the land by non-Indians. Thus, the Court of Appealstreated the mineral, grazing, and timber rights retained bythe Tribe under the Cheyenne River Act as evidence thatthe taking "was not a simple conveyance of land and allattendant interests in the land," 949 F. 2d, at 993, and thecourt accordingly concluded that Congress had not abrogatedthe Tribe's pre-existing regulatory authority. We disagree.Congress' explicit reservation of certain rights in the takenarea does not operate as an implicit reservation of all former rights.Our decision in United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734 (1986),supports this conclusion. In Dion, we considered whetheran Indian who takes an eagle on tribal land violates the BaldEagle Protection Act.14 We demanded "clear evidence thatCongress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and Indian treaty rights onthe other, and chose to resolve that conflict by abrogatingthe treaty." Id., at 740. The Bald Eagle Protection Actcontains an exemption allowing the Secretary of the Interiorto permit the taking of an eagle "for the religious purposesof Indian tribes" and for other narrow purposes found to becompatible with the goal of eagle preservation. 16 U.

BOURLANDOpinion of the Courtbers, the very presence of such a limited reservation ofrights suggests that the Indians would otherwise be treatedlike the public at large. IIIRespondents and their amici raise several alternativearguments, none of which undercuts our statutory analysis.Respondents argue, for example, that their right to regulatehunting and fishing in the taken area was not abrogated because the $10,644,014 appropriated in the Cheyenne RiverAct did not include compensation for the Tribe's loss of licensing revenue. This sum, respondents argue, did includepayment for,inter alia, the loss of grazing permit revenuesand the destruction of wildlife, wild fruit, and other naturalresources, as those losses were itemized in the House Reporton the Cheyenne River Act. See Brief for Respondents 9(citing H. R. Rep. No. 2484, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1954)).To hold their regulatory authority divested, respondents contend, would imply that Congress breached its duty to com-pensate the Tribe for all taken resources. The Act itself,however, does not itemize the losses covered by the compen-sation but rather plainly states that the appropriated fundsconstitute a "final and complete settlement of all claims,rights, and demands" of the Tribe arising out of the OaheDam and Reservoir Project. $ II, 68 Stat. 1191. Given theexpress text of the Act, we will not conclude that the Actreserved to the Tribe the right to regulate hunting and fish-ing simply because the legislative history does not includean itemized amount for the Tribe's loss of revenue from li-censing those activities.General principles of "inherent sovereignty" also do notenable the Tribe to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishingin the taken area. Although Indian tribes retain inherentauthority to punish members who violate tribal law, to regulate tribal membership, and to conduct internal tribal rela-tions,United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 326 (1978), the"exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT695Cite as: 508 U.

S., at 564. Having concluded that Congress clearly abrogated the Tribe's pre-existing regulatorycontrol over non-Indian hunting and fishing, we find no evidence in the relevant treaties or statutes that Congress in-tended to allow the Tribe to assert regulatory jurisdictionover these lands pursuant to inherent sovereignty.15The question remains, however, whether the Tribe mayinvoke other potential sources of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians on these lands.Montana discussed two exceptionsto "the general proposition that the inherent sovereignpowers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities ofnonmembers of the tribe." Id., at 565. First, a tribe maylicense or otherwise regulate activities of nonmembers whoenter "consensual relationships" with the tribe or its members through contracts, leases, or other commercial dealings.Ibid. Second, a "tribe may . . . retain inherent power toexercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians onfee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatensor has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe." Id.,at 566. The District Court made extensive findings that neither of these exceptions applies to either the former trustlands or the former fee lands. See App. 142-149. And although the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court15 The dissent's complaint that we give "barely a nod" to the Tribe'sinherent sovereignty argument, post, at 698, is simply another manifestation of its disagreement with Montana, which announced "the generalproposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do notextend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe," 450 U. S., at 565.While the dissent refers to our "myopic focus," post, at 701, on the Tribe'sprior treaty right to "absolute and undisturbed use and occupation" of thetaken area, it shuts both eyes to the reality that after Montana, tribalsovereignty over nonmembers "cannot survive without express congressional delegation," 450 U. S., at 564, and is therefore not inherent.508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT696 SOUTH DAKOTA v. BOURLANDOpinion of the Courtto undertake a new analysis of the Montana exceptions onremand as to the 18,000 acres, it did not pass upon the District Court's previous findings regarding the taken area as awhole. See 949 F. 2d, at 995. Thus, we leave this to beresolved on remand.Finally, respondents contend that Army Corps regulationspermit the Tribe to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing.Although Congress abrogated the Tribe's right to regulatorycontrol in the taken area through the Flood Control andCheyenne River Acts, it gave primary regulatory authorityover the water project lands to the Army Corps of Engineers. 16 U. S. C. $ 460d. See 36 CFR $ 327.1(a) (1992).The Corps has authority to promulgate regulations "not inconsistent with . . . treaties and Federal laws and regulations" concerning "the rights of Indian Nations." $ 327.1(f).The Corps permits "[h]unting, fishing and trapping . . . except in areas where prohibited by the District Engineer."$ 327.8. This regulation provides that "[a]ll Federal, stateand local laws governing these activities apply on projectlands and waters, as regulated by authorized enforcementofficials." Ibid. (emphasis added). See also $ 327.26. Respondents argue that these regulations "not only allow fortribal regulation of hunting and fishing, they affirmativelyestablish the primacy of tribal treaty rights over both publicuse rights and state and federal regulatory interests."Brief for Respondents 33 (emphasis in original) (footnoteomitted). Insisting that "tribal" law is a subset of "local"law, respondents contend that the Tribe's hunting and fishinglaws apply to all who pass through the taken area. Id., at33, n. 39.Respondents did not rely on the Army Corps' regulationsin the proceedings below. And although the United Statesas amicus curiae asserted at oral argument that $ 327.8leaves all pre-existing state, local, and tribal hunting andfishing regulations in effect on project lands, see Tr. of OralArg. 50, it did not even mention the Army Corps regulation508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT697Cite as: 508 U. S. 679 (1993)Opinion of the Courtin its brief. Moreover, it is inconsistent with evidence in therecord that the Corps in fact believed that jurisdiction overnon-Indian hunting and fishing on water project lands isa matter of state law.16 See App. 288, 284. Thus, we findthis argument undeveloped. Under these circumstances, wedecline to defer to the Government's litigating position.IV"[T]reaty rights with respect to reservation lands must beread in light of the subsequent alienation of those lands."Montana, 450 U. S., at 561. In this case, the United Statestook former trust lands pursuant to the Flood Control Act,which mandated that all water project lands be open for thegeneral public's use and recreational enjoyment. The Cheyenne River Act reserved some of the Tribe's original treatyrights in the former trust lands (including the right to huntand fish) but not the right to exert regulatory control.These statutes clearly abrogated the Tribe's "absolute andundisturbed use and occupation" of these tribal lands, 15Stat. 636, and thereby deprived the Tribe of the power tolicense non-Indian use of the lands. Accordingly, the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case16 The dissent simply assumes that the phrase "local laws" in 36 CFR$ 327.8 (1992) includes "tribal" laws. Post, at 702-703. However, anArmy Corps regulation outlining the procedures for evaluating Department of the Army water use permit applications indicates that the ArmyCorps, in fact, distinguishes between the terms "tribal" and "local." See33 CFR $ 320.4( j)(2) (1992) ("[t]he primary responsibility for determiningzoning and land use matters rests with state, local and tribal governments") (emphasis added). Furthermore, we are bewildered that the dissent cites $ 327.1(f) for the proposition that "the regulations themselvesprovide that tribal rights prevail." Post, at 702-703. Section 327.1(f)provides that the regulations in part 327 apply "to the extent that [they]are not inconsistent with . . . treaties and Federal laws and regulations."This is simply to say that the regulations do not purport to abrogate treatyrights--not a startling proposition. The regulation says nothing aboutwhether the Flood Control Act or Cheyenne River Act has already terminated those rights.508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT698 SOUTH DAKOTA v.
