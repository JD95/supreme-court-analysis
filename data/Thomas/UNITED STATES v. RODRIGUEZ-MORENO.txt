This case presents the question whether venue in a prose-cution for using or carrying a firearm "during and in relation to any crime of violence," in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c)(1), is proper in any district where the crime of violence was committed, even if the firearm was used or carriedonly in a single district.IDuring a drug transaction that took place in Houston,Texas, a New York drug dealer stole 30 kilograms of a Texasdrug distributor's cocaine. The distributor hired respond-ent, Jacinto Rodriguez-Moreno, and others to find the dealerand to hold captive the middleman in the transaction,*Steven Wisotsky and Lisa Kemler filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging affirmance.526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN277Cite as: 526 U. S. 275 (1999)Opinion of the CourtEphrain Avendano, during the search. In pursuit of thedealer, the distributor and his henchmen drove from Texasto New Jersey with Avendano in tow. The group usedAvendano's New Jersey apartment as a base for their operations for a few days. They soon moved to a house in NewYork and then to a house in Maryland, taking Avendanowith them.Shortly after respondent and the others arrived at theMaryland house, the owner of the home passed around a .357magnum revolver and respondent took possession of the pistol. As it became clear that efforts to find the New Yorkdrug dealer would not bear fruit, respondent told his employer that he thought they should kill the middleman andend their search for the dealer. He put the gun to the backof Avendano's neck but, at the urging of his cohorts, did notshoot. Avendano eventually escaped through the back doorand ran to a neighboring house. The neighbors called theMaryland police, who arrested respondent along with therest of the kidnapers. The police also seized the .357 magnum, on which they later found respondent's fingerprint.Rodriguez-Moreno and his codefendants were tried jointlyin the United States District Court for the District of NewJersey. Respondent was charged with, inter alia, conspiring to kidnap Avendano, kidnaping Avendano, and using andcarrying a firearm in relation to the kidnaping of Avendano,in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). At the conclusion ofthe Government's case, respondent moved to dismiss the$ 924(c)(1) count for lack of venue. He argued that venuewas proper only in Maryland, the only place where the Government had proved he had actually used a gun. The District Court denied the motion, App. 54, and the jury foundrespondent guilty on the kidnaping counts and on the$ 924(c)(1) charge as well. He was sentenced to 87 months'imprisonment on the kidnaping charges, and was given amandatory consecutive term of 60 months' imprisonment forcommitting the $ 924(c)(1) offense.526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN278 UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENOOpinion of the CourtOn a 2-to-1 vote, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuitreversed respondent's $ 924(c)(1) conviction. United Statesv. Palma-Ruedas, 121 F. 3d 841 (1997). A majority of theThird Circuit panel applied what it called the "verb test" to$ 924(c)(1), and determined that a violation of the statute iscommitted only in the district where a defendant "uses" or"carries" a firearm. Id., at 849. Accordingly, it concludedthat venue for the $ 924(c)(1) count was improper in NewJersey even though venue was proper there for the kidnaping of Avendano. The dissenting judge thought that the majority's test relied too much "on grammatical arcana," id., at865, and argued that the proper approach was to "look at thesubstance of the statutes in question," ibid. In his view, thecrime of violence is an essential element of the course ofconduct that Congress sought to criminalize in enacting$ 924(c)(1), and therefore, "venue for a prosecution under[that] statute lies in any district in which the defendant committed the underlying crime of violence." Id., at 863. TheGovernment petitioned for review on the ground that theThird Circuit's holding was in conflict with a decision of theCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, United States v. Pomranz, 43 F. 3d 156 (1995). We granted certiorari, 524 U.

S. 275 (1999)Opinion of the CourtAs we confirmed just last Term, the " `locus delicti [of thecharged offense] must be determined from the nature of thecrime alleged and the location of the act or acts constitutingit.' " United States v. Cabrales, 524 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1998) (quoting United States v. Anderson, 328 U. S. 699, 703 (1946)).1In performing this inquiry, a court must initially identify theconduct constituting the offense (the nature of the crime) andthen discern the location of the commission of the criminalacts.2 See Cabrales, supra, at 6-7; Travis v. United States,364 U. S. 631, 635-637 (1961);United States v. Cores, 356U. S. 405, 408-409 (1958); Anderson, supra, at 703-706.At the time respondent committed the offense and wastried, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) provided:"Whoever, during and in relation to any crime ofviolence . . . for which he may be prosecuted in a courtof the United States, uses or carries a firearm, shall, inaddition to the punishment provided for such crime ofviolence . . . be sentenced to imprisonment for fiveyears . . . ."3The Third Circuit, as explained above, looked to the verbs ofthe statute to determine the nature of the substantive of1 When we first announced this test in United States v. Anderson, 328U. S., at 703, we were comparing $ 11 of the Selective Training and ServiceAct of 1940, 54 Stat. 894, in which Congress did "not indicate where [it]considered the place of committing the crime to be," 328 U. S., at 703, withstatutes where Congress was explicit with respect to venue. Title 18U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), like the Selective Training and Service Act, does notcontain an express venue provision.2 The Government argues that venue also may permissibly be basedupon the effects of a defendant's conduct in a district other than the onein which the defendant performs the acts constituting the offense. Brieffor United States 16-17. Because this case only concerns the locus delicti, we express no opinion as to whether the Government's assertionis correct.3 The statute recently has been amended, see Pub. L. 105-386, 112 Stat.3469, but it is not argued that the amendment is in any way relevant toour analysis in this case.526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN280 UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENOOpinion of the Courtfense. But we have never before held, and decline to do sohere, that verbs are the sole consideration in identifying theconduct that constitutes an offense. While the "verb test"certainly has value as an interpretative tool, it cannot beapplied rigidly, to the exclusion of other relevant statutorylanguage. The test unduly limits the inquiry into the natureof the offense and thereby creates a danger that certain con-duct prohibited by statute will be missed.In our view, the Third Circuit overlooked an essential con-duct element of the $ 924(c)(1) offense. Section 924(c)(1) prohibits using or carrying a firearm "during and in relation toany crime of violence . . . for which [a defendant] may beprosecuted in a court of the United States." That the crimeof violence element of the statute is embedded in a prepositional phrase and not expressed in verbs does not dissuadeus from concluding that a defendant's violent acts are essential conduct elements. To prove the charged $ 924(c)(1) vio-lation in this case, the Government was required to showthat respondent used a firearm, that he committed all theacts necessary to be subject to punishment for kidnaping (acrime of violence) in a court of the United States, and thathe used the gun "during and in relation to" the kidnapingof Avendano. In sum, we interpret $ 924(c)(1) to containtwo distinct conduct elements--as is relevant to this case,the "using and carrying" of a gun and the commission ofa kidnaping.44 By way of comparison, last Term in United States v. Cabrales, 524 U. S.1 (1998), we considered whether venue for money laundering, in violationof 18 U. S. C. $$ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii) and 1957, was proper in Missouri, wherethe laundered proceeds were unlawfully generated, or rather, only inFlorida, where the prohibited laundering transactions occurred. As weinterpreted the laundering statutes at issue, they did not proscribe "theanterior criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered."Cabrales, 524 U. S., at 7. The existence of criminally generated proceedswas a circumstance element of the offense but the proscribed conduct--defendant's money laundering activity--occurred " `after the fact' of anoffense begun and completed by others." Ibid. Here, by contrast, given526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN281Cite as: 526 U. S. 275 (1999)Opinion of the CourtRespondent, however, argues that for venue purposes "theNew Jersey kidnapping is completely irrelevant to the firearm crime, because respondent did not use or carry a gunduring the New Jersey crime." Brief for Respondent 12.In the words of one amicus, $ 924(c)(1) is a "point-in-time"offense that only is committed in the place where the kidnaping and the use of a gun coincide. Brief for National Associ-ation of Criminal Defense Lawyers asAmicus Curiae 11.We disagree. Several Circuits have determined that kidnaping, as defined by 18 U. S. C. $ 1201 (1994 ed. and Supp.III), is a unitary crime, see United States v. Seals, 130 F. 3d451, 461-462 (CADC 1997); United States v. Denny-Shaffer,2 F. 3d 999, 1018-1019 (CA10 1993);United States v. Godinez,998 F. 2d 471, 473 (CA7 1993); United States v. Garcia, 854F. 2d 340, 343-344 (CA9 1988), and we agree with their con-clusion. A kidnaping, once begun, does not end until thevictim is free. It does not make sense, then, to speak of itin discrete geographic fragments. Section 924(c)(1) criminalized a defendant's use of a firearm "during and in relationto" a crime of violence; in doing so, Congress proscribed boththe use of the firearm and the commission of acts that consti-tute a violent crime. It does not matter that respondentused the .357 magnum revolver, as the Government con-cedes, only in Maryland because he did so "during and inrelation to" a kidnaping that was begun in Texas and contin-ued in New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. In our view,$ 924(c)(1) does not define a "point-in-time" offense when afirearm is used during and in relation to a continuing crimeof violence.As we said in United States v. Lombardo, 241 U. S. 73(1916), "where a crime consists of distinct parts which havedifferent localities the whole may be tried where any partcan be proved to have been done." Id., at 77; cf. Hyde v.United States, 225 U. S. 347, 356-367 (1912) (venue properthe "during and in relation to" language, the underlying crime of violenceis a critical part of the $ 924(c)(1) offense.526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN282 UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENOScalia, J., dissentingagainst defendant in district where co-conspirator carriedout overt acts even though there was no evidence that thedefendant had ever entered that district or that the conspiracy was formed there). The kidnaping, to which the$ 924(c)(1) offense is attached, was committed in all of theplaces that any part of it took place, and venue for the kidnaping charge against respondent was appropriate in any ofthem. (Congress has provided that continuing offenses canbe tried "in any district in which such offense was begun,continued, or completed," 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a).) Wherevenue is appropriate for the underlying crime of violence, sotoo it is for the $ 924(c)(1) offense. As the kidnaping wasproperly tried in New Jersey, the $ 924(c)(1) offense could betried there as well.* * *We hold that venue for this prosecution was proper in thedistrict where it was brought. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals is therefore reversed. It is so ordered.Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.I agree with the Court that in deciding where a crime wascommitted for purposes of the venue provision of Article III,$ 2, of the Constitution, and the vicinage provision of theSixth Amendment, we must look at "the nature of the crimealleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it."Ante, at 279 (quoting United States v. Cabrales, 524 U. S. 1,7 (1998), in turn quoting United States v. Anderson, 328 U. S.699, 703 (1946)) (internal quotation marks omitted). I disagree with the Court, however, that the crime defined in 18U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) is "committed" either where the defendantcommits the predicate offense or where he uses or carriesthe gun. It seems to me unmistakably clear from the textof the law that this crime can be committed only where the526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN283Cite as: 526 U. S. 275 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingdefendant both engages in the acts making up the predicateoffenseand uses or carries the gun.At the time of respondent's alleged offense, $ 924(c)(1)read:"Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of vio-lence or drug trafficking crime . . . for which he may beprosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or car-ries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug traffickingcrime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years."This prohibits the act of using or carrying a firearm "during"(and in relation to) a predicate offense. The provisions ofthe United States Code defining the particular predicate of-fenses already punish all of the defendant's alleged criminalconduct except his use or carriage of a gun; $ 924(c)(1) itselfcriminalizes and punishes such use or carriage "during" thepredicate crime, because that makes the crime more dangerous. Cf. Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 132(1998). This is a simple concept, and it is embodied in astraightforward text. To answer the question before us weneed only ask where the defendant's alleged act of using afirearm during (and in relation to) a kidnaping occurred.Since it occurred only in Maryland, venue will lie only there.The Court, however, relies on United States v. Lombardo,241 U. S. 73, 77 (1916), for the proposition that " `where acrime consists of distinct parts which have different localitiesthe whole may be tried where any part can be proved to havebeen done.' "Ante, at 281. The fallacy in this reliance isthat the crime before us does not consist of "distinct" partsthat can occur in different localities. Its two parts arebound inseparably together by the word "during." Wherethe gun is being used, the predicate act must be occurringas well, and vice versa. The Court quite simply reads thisrequirement out of the statute--as though there were no difference between a statute making it a crime to steal a cookie526US1 Unit: $U42 [09-21-99 14:52:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN284 UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENOScalia, J., dissentingand eat it (which could be prosecuted either in New Jersey,where the cookie was stolen, or in Maryland, where it waseaten) and a statute making it a crime to eat a cookie whilerobbing a bakery (which could be prosecuted only where theingestive theft occurred).The Court believes its holding is justified by the continuingnature of the kidnaping predicate offense, which invokes thestatute providing that "any offense against the United Statesbegun in one district and completed in another, or committedin more than one district, may be inquired of and prosecutedin any district in which such offense was begun, continued,or completed." 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a). To disallow the NewJersey prosecution here, the Court suggests, is to convert$ 924(c)(1) from a continuing offense to a "point-in-time"offense. Ante, at 281. That is simply not so. I in no waycontend that the kidnaping, or, for that matter, the use ofthe gun, can occur only at one point in time. Each can extend over a protracted period, and in many places. But$ 924(c)(1) is violated only so long as, and where, both continuing acts are being committed simultaneously. That is whatthe word "during" means. Thus, if the defendant here hadused or carried the gun throughout the kidnaping, in Texas,New Jersey, New York, and Maryland, he could have beenprosecuted in any of those States. As it was, however, heused a gun during a kidnaping only in Maryland.Finally, the Government contends that focusing on the"use or carry" element of $ 924(c)(1) is "difficult to square"with the cases holding that there can be only one $ 924(c)(1)violation for each predicate offense.

S. 869 (1991). But this dispute has nothingto do with the point before us here. I do not contend thatusing the firearm is "the entire essence of the offense."Reply Brief for United States 9. The predicate offense isassuredly an element of the crime--and if, for whatever rea-son, that element has the effect of limiting prosecution to oneviolation per predicate offense, it can do so just as effectivelyeven if the "during" requirement is observed rather thanignored.The short of the matter is that this defendant, who has aconstitutional right to be tried in the State and districtwhere his alleged crime was "committed," U. S. Const.,Art. III, $ 2, cl. 3; Amdt. 6, has been prosecuted for using agun during a kidnaping in a State and district where allagree he did not use a gun during a kidnaping. If to statethis case is not to decide it, the law has departed furtherfrom the meaning of language than is appropriate for a gov-ernment that is supposed to rule (and to be restrained)through the written word.526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN286 OCTOBER TERM, 1998SyllabusCONN et al. v. GABBERTcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 97-1802. Argued February 23, 1999--Decided April 5, 1999Petitioners Conn and Najera, prosecutors in the "Menendez Brothers"case on retrial, learned that Lyle Menendez had written a letter to TraciBaker, in which he may have instructed her to testify falsely at thefirst trial. Baker was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury and toproduce any correspondence that she had received from Menendez.She later responded that she had given Menendez's letters to her attorney, respondent Gabbert. When Baker appeared to testify before thegrand jury, accompanied by Gabbert, Conn directed police to secure awarrant to search Gabbert for the letter. At the same time that Gabbert was being searched, Najera called Baker before the grand jury forquestioning. Gabbert brought suit against the prosecutors under 42U. S. C. $ 1983, contending, inter alia, that his Fourteenth Amendmentright to practice his profession without unreasonable government interference was violated when the prosecutors executed a search warrantat the same time his client was testifying before the grand jury. TheFederal District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, but theNinth Circuit reversed in part, holding that Gabbert had a right to practice his profession without undue and unreasonable government interference, and that because the right was clearly established, petitionerswere not entitled to qualified immunity.Held: A prosecutor does not violate an attorney's Fourteenth Amendmentright to practice his profession by executing a search warrant while theattorney's client is testifying before a grand jury. To prevail in a $ 1983action for civil damages from a government official performing discretionary functions, the qualified immunity defense requires that the official be shown to have violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.

The cases relied upon by the Ninth Circuit or suggested by Gabbert all deal with a complete prohibition of theright to engage in a calling, and not the sort of brief interruption as aresult of legal process which occurred here. See, e. g., Dent v. West526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN287Cite as: 526 U. S. 286 (1999)Opinion of the CourtVirginia, 129 U. S. 114. Gabbert's argument that the search's impropertiming interfered with his client's right to have him outside the grandjury room and available to consult with her is unavailing, since a grandjury witness has no constitutional right to have counsel present duringthe proceeding, and none of this Court's decisions has held that such awitness has a right to have her attorney present outside the jury room.This Court need not decide whether such a right exists, because Gabberthad no standing to raise the alleged infringement of his client's rights.Although he does have standing to complain of the allegedly unreasonable timing of the search warrant's execution to prevent him from advising his client, challenges to the reasonableness of the execution of asearch warrant must be assessed under the Fourth Amendment, not theFourteenth, see Graham v.

GABBERTOpinion of the Courtclude that such conduct by a prosecutor does not violatean attorney's Fourteenth Amendment right to practice hisprofession.This case arises out of the high-profile California trials ofthe "Menendez Brothers," Lyle and Erik Menendez, for themurder of their parents. Petitioners David Conn and CarolNajera are Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorneys,and respondent Paul Gabbert is a criminal defense attorney.In early 1994, after the first Menendez trial ended in a hungjury, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office as-signed Conn and Najera to prosecute the case on retrial.Conn and Najera learned that Lyle Menendez had written aletter to Traci Baker, his former girlfriend, in which he mayhave instructed her to testify falsely at trial. Gabbert represented Baker, who had testified as a defense witness in thefirst trial. Conn obtained and served Baker with a subpoena directing her to testify before the Los Angeles Countygrand jury and also directing her to produce at that time anycorrespondence that she had received from Lyle Menendez.After Gabbert unsuccessfully sought to quash the portionof the subpoena directing Baker to produce the Menendezcorrespondence, Conn and Najera obtained a warrant tosearch Baker's apartment for any such correspondence.When police tried to execute the warrant, Baker told thepolice that she had given all her letters from Menendez toGabbert.Three days later, on March 21, 1994, Baker appeared asdirected before the grand jury, accompanied by Gabbert.Believing that Gabbert might have the letter on his person,Conn directed a police detective to secure a warrant tosearch Gabbert. California law provides that a warrant tosearch an attorney must be executed by a court-appointedspecial master. When the Special Master arrived, Gabbertrequested that the search take place in a private room. Hedid not request that his client's grand jury testimony be postponed. The Special Master searched Gabbert in the private526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN289Cite as: 526 U. S. 286 (1999)Opinion of the Courtroom, and Gabbert produced two pages of a three-page letterfrom Lyle Menendez to Baker.At approximately the same time that the search of Gabbert was taking place, Najera called Baker before the grandjury and began to question her. After being sworn, Najeraasked Baker whether she was acquainted with Lyle Menendez. Baker replied that she had been unable to speak withher attorney because he was "still with the special master."Brief for Petitioners 6. A short recess was taken duringwhich time Baker was unable to speak with Gabbert. Hewas aware that Baker sought to speak with him, but apparently stated that the prosecutors would simply have to delaythe questioning until they finished searching him. Baker returned to the grand jury room and declined to answer thequestion "upon the advice of [my] counsel" on the basis of herFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Id.,at 7. Najera asked a followup question, and Baker againasked for a short recess to confer with Gabbert. Baker wasagain unable to locate Gabbert, and she again returned tothe grand jury room and asserted her Fifth Amendmentprivilege. At this point, the grand jury recessed.Believing that the actions of the prosecutors were illegal,Gabbert brought suit against them and other officials in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.Relevant to this appeal by Conn and Najera, he contendedthat his Fourteenth Amendment right to practice his profession without unreasonable government interference was violated when the prosecutors executed a search warrant at thesame time his client was testifying before the grand jury.*Conn and Najera moved for summary judgment on the basisof qualified immunity, and the District Court granted themotion.*Gabbert also brought a claim under $ 1983 that Conn and Najera hadviolated his rights under the Fourth Amendment.

S. C. $ 1983. In order to prevailin a $ 1983 action for civil damages from a government officialperforming discretionary functions, the defense of qualifiedimmunity that our cases have recognized requires that theofficial be shown to have violated "clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable personwould have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,818 (1982). Thus a court must first determine whether theplaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whetherthat right was clearly established at the time of the allegedviolation. See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 232-233(1991); see also County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S.833, 841, n. 5 (1998).526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN291Cite as: 526 U. S. 286 (1999)Opinion of the CourtWe find no support in our cases for the conclusion of theCourt of Appeals that Gabbert had a Fourteenth Amendment right which was violated in this case. The Court ofAppeals relied primarily onBoard of Regents v. Roth. InRoth, this Court repeated the pronouncement in Meyer v.Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399 (1923), that the liberty guaran-teed by the Fourteenth Amendment " `denotes not merelyfreedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the indi-vidual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establisha home and bring up children, to worship God according tothe dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoythose privileges long recognized . . . as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.' " Roth, supra, at572 (quoting Meyer, supra, at 399). But neither Roth norMeyer even came close to identifying the asserted "right"violated by the prosecutors in this case. Meyer held thatsubstantive due process forebade a State from enacting astatute that prohibited teaching in any language other thanEnglish. 262 U. S., at 399, 402-403. And Roth was a procedural due process case which held that an at-will collegeprofessor had no "property" interest in his job within themeaning of the Fourteenth Amendment so as to require theuniversity to hold a hearing before terminating him. 408U. S., at 578. Neither case will bear the weight placed uponit by either the Court of Appeals or Gabbert: Neither casesupports the conclusion that the actions of the prosecutorsin this case deprived Gabbert of a liberty interest in practicing law.Similarly, none of the other cases relied upon by the Courtof Appeals or suggested by Gabbert provide any more thanscant metaphysical support for the idea that the use of asearch warrant by government actors violates an attorney'sright to practice his profession. In a line of earlier cases,this Court has indicated that the liberty component of theFourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause includes some526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN292 CONN v. GABBERTOpinion of the Courtgeneralized due process right to choose one's field of privateemployment, but a right which is nevertheless subject to reasonable government regulation. See, e. g., Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114 (1889) (upholding a requirement of licensing before a person can practice medicine); Truax v. Raich,239 U. S. 33, 41 (1915) (invalidating on equal protectiongrounds a state law requiring companies to employ 80%United States citizens). These cases all deal with a com-plete prohibition of the right to engage in a calling, and notthe sort of brief interruption which occurred here.Gabbert also relies onSchware v. Board of Bar Examinersof N. M., 353 U. S. 232, 238-239 (1957), for the propositionthat a State cannot exclude a person from the practice oflaw for reasons that contravene the Due Process Clause.Schware held that former membership in the CommunistParty and an arrest record relating to union activities couldnot be the basis for completely excluding a person from thepractice of law. Like Dent, supra, and Truax, supra, it doesnot deal with a brief interruption as a result of legal process.No case of this Court has held that such an intrusion can riseto the level of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment'sliberty right to choose and follow one's calling. That rightis simply not infringed by the inevitable interruptions of ourdaily routine as a result of legal process, which all of us mayexperience from time to time.Gabbert next argues that the improper timing of thesearch interfered with his client's right to have him outsidethe grand jury room and available to consult with her. Agrand jury witness has no constitutional right to have counsel present during the grand jury proceeding, United Statesv. Mandujano, 425 U. S. 564, 581 (1976), and no decision ofthis Court has held that a grand jury witness has a right tohave her attorney present outside the jury room. We neednot decide today whether such a right exists, because Gabbert clearly had no standing to raise the alleged infringement of the rights of his client Tracy Baker. "[T]he plaintiff526US2 Unit: $U43 [12-11-00 17:55:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN293Cite as: 526 U. S. 286 (1999)Stevens, J., concurring in judgmentgenerally must assert his own legal rights and interests, andcannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interestsof third parties." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975).Gabbert of course does have standing to complain of theallegedly unreasonable timing of the execution of the searchwarrant to prevent him from advising his client. In essencethen, he argues that the prosecutors searched him in anunreasonable manner. We have held that where anotherprovision of the Constitution "provides an explicit textualsource of constitutional protection," a court must assess aplaintiff 's claims under that explicit provision and "not themore generalized notion of `substantive due process.' "Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 395 (1989). Challenges to thereasonableness of a search by government agents clearly fallunder the Fourth Amendment, and not the Fourteenth.We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment right to practiceone's calling is not violated by the execution of a search war-rant, whether calculated to annoy or even to prevent consultation with a grand jury witness. In so holding, we thus ofcourse pretermit the question whether such a right was"clearly established" as of a given day. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals holding to the contrary is thereforereversed.
