In this case, we consider whether a federal district courtis required to instruct the jury regarding the consequencesto the defendant of a verdict of "not guilty by reason of in-sanity," either under the Insanity Defense Reform Act of1984 or as a matter of general federal practice. We concludethat such an instruction is not required, and therefore affirm.IAPrior to the enactment of the Insanity Defense ReformAct of 1984 (IDRA or Act), 18 U. S. C. $$ 17, 4241-4247,federal courts generally did not recognize a verdict of"not guilty by reason of insanity" (NGI). Defendants whomounted a successful insanity defense--that is, those whoraised a reasonable doubt as to their sanity at the time of theoffense--were simply found "not guilty." See, e. g., UnitedStates v. McCracken, 488 F. 2d 406, 409, 418 (CA5 1974);Evalt v. United States, 359 F. 2d 534, 537 (CA9 1966). Inaddition, there was no general federal civil commitment pro-cedure available to ensure that an insanity acquittee wouldreceive proper care and treatment. Only in the District ofColumbia was a defendant who successfully presented an insanity defense to a federal criminal charge subject to a fed-eral commitment process--a process governed by a 1955 congressional enactment. See 69 Stat. 609, as amended, D. C.Code Ann. $ 24-301 (1981).1 Elsewhere, federal authorities*Peter Margulies filed a brief for the Coalition for the FundamentalRights of Ex-Patients urging reversal.1 See also United States v. Brawner, 471 F. 2d 969, 996 (CADC 1972) (enbanc); United States v. Cohen, 733 F. 2d 128, 129-131 (CADC 1984) (enbanc); United States v.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwere forced to rely on the willingness of state authorities toinstitute civil commitment proceedings. Reliance on statecooperation was "at best a partial solution to a serious prob-lem," however, and federal courts "[t]ime and again . . . decried this gaping statutory hole." McCracken, supra, at417.Before the IDRA was enacted, the Federal Courts of Appeals generally disapproved of instructing the jury concern-ing the post-trial consequences of an insanity acquittal.Thus, jurors typically were given no information with regardto what would happen to a defendant acquitted by reason ofinsanity. The courts in general gave two reasons for disapproving such instructions. First, they pointed out that,given the absence of a federal commitment procedure, theconsequences of an insanity acquittal were far from certain.Second, they concluded that such instructions would runafoul of the well-established principle that a jury is to baseits verdict on the evidence before it, without regard to thepossible consequences of the verdict. See, e. g., McCracken,supra, at 423; Evalt, supra, at 546; United States v. Borum,464 F. 2d 896, 900-901 (CA10 1972).The only Court of Appeals to endorse the practice of instructing the jury regarding the consequences of an insanityacquittal was the District of Columbia Circuit. See Lyles v.United States, 254 F. 2d 725 (1957) (en banc), cert. denied, 356U. S. 961 (1958). In Lyles, the District of Columbia Circuitaddressed the jury instruction question in the context ofD. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301 (1951 ed., Supp. V), which, unlikegenerally applicable federal law, provided for a special verdict of NGI and, as noted above, a civil commitment procedure. The Lyles court recognized the "well established andsound" doctrine "that the jury has no concern with the consequences" of a verdict, but stated that the doctrine "d[id]not apply" to the situation before it. 254 F. 2d, at 728. According to the court, although jurors generally were "awareof the meanings of verdicts of guilty and not guilty," they512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT577Cite as: 512 U. S. 573 (1994)Opinion of the Courtwere unfamiliar with the meaning of an NGI verdict. Ibid.The court concluded that jurors had "a right to know" themeaning of an NGI verdict "as accurately as [they] kno[w] bycommon knowledge the meaning of the other two possibleverdicts." Ibid.The acquittal of John Hinckley on all charges stemmingfrom his attempt on President Reagan's life, coupled withthe ensuing public focus on the insanity defense, promptedCongress to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the in-sanity defense as it operated in the federal courts. The result of this effort was the IDRA. In the IDRA, Congressmade insanity an affirmative defense to be proved by thedefendant by clear and convincing evidence, and created aspecial verdict of "not guilty only by reason of insanity." 18U. S. C. $$ 17 and 4242(b). In addition, Congress filled the"statutory hole" that had been identified by federal courts,see McCracken, supra, by creating a comprehensive civilcommitment procedure. $ 4243. Under that procedure, adefendant found NGI is held in custody pending a courthearing, which must occur within 40 days of the verdict.$ 4243(c). At the conclusion of the hearing, the court de-termines whether the defendant should be hospitalized orreleased. $$ 4243(d), (e). BAt about 4 a.m. on August 25, 1990, a police officer stoppedpetitioner Terry Lee Shannon, a convicted felon, on a streetin Tupelo, Mississippi. For reasons not explained in the rec-ord before us, the officer asked Shannon to accompany himto the station house to speak with a detective. After tellingthe officer that he did not want to live anymore, Shannonwalked across the street, pulled a pistol from his coat, andshot himself in the chest.Shannon survived his suicide attempt and was indicted forunlawful possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). At trial, he raised the insanity defense,and asked the District Court to instruct the jury that he512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT578 SHANNON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwould be involuntarily committed if the jury returned anNGI verdict.2 The District Court refused to give Shannon'sproposed charge. Instead, it instructed the jury "to applythe law as [instructed] regardless of the consequence," andthat "punishment . . . should not enter your considerationor discussion." App. A-27 to A-28. The jury returned aguilty verdict.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed Shan-non's conviction. 981 F. 2d 759 (1993). The court notedthat under its pre-IDRA precedent, juries were not to beinstructed concerning the consequences of an insanity acquittal. Id., at 761-762 (discussing United States v. McCracken,488 F. 2d 406 (CA5 1974)). Turning to the text of the IDRA,the court observed that Congress had "said nothing aboutinforming juries of the consequences" of an NGI verdict.981 F. 2d, at 764. Because there was no "statutory requirement" to the contrary, the court "adhere[d] to the establishedaxiom that it is inappropriate for a jury to consider or beinformed about the consequences of its verdict." Ibid.32 Shannon asked the court to give either of the two following instructions: (1) " `In the event it is your verdict that [Shannon] is not guilty onlyby reason of insanity, it is required that the Court commit [him]' "; or (2)" `[Y]ou should know that it is required that the Court commit [Shannon]to a suitable hospital facility until such time as [he] does not pose a substantial risk of bodily injury to another or serious damage to the propertyof another.' " App. A-22.3 In addition to the court below, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits recently have reaffirmed their pre-IDRA holdings that juries generallyshould not be instructed concerning the consequences of an insanity acquittal. See United States v. Frank, 956 F. 2d 872, 880-882 (CA9 1991),cert. denied, 506 U. S. 932 (1992); Thigpen, 4 F. 3d, at 1578. The ThirdCircuit has held that the decision to give such an instruction should beleft to "the sound discretion of the trial judge." United States v. Fisher,10 F. 3d 115, 122 (1993), cert. pending, No. 93-7000. A panel of the SecondCircuit recently divided three ways on the issue. See United States v.Blume, 967 F. 2d 45, 50 (1992) (Newman, J., concurring) ("I believe theinstruction should always be given unless the defendant prefers itsomission. Judge Winter believes the instruction should normally not be512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT579Cite as: 512 U. S. 573 (1994)Opinion of the CourtWe granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 943 (1993), in order to con-sider whether federal district courts are required to instructjuries with regard to the consequences of an NGI verdict.IIIt is well established that when a jury has no sentencingfunction,4 it should be admonished to "reach its verdict without regard to what sentence might be imposed." Rogers v.United States, 422 U. S. 35, 40 (1975).5 The principle thatjuries are not to consider the consequences of their verdictsis a reflection of the basic division of labor in our legal systembetween judge and jury. The jury's function is to find thefacts and to decide whether, on those facts, the defendant isguilty of the crime charged. The judge, by contrast, im-poses sentence on the defendant after the jury has arrivedat a guilty verdict. Information regarding the consequencesof a verdict is therefore irrelevant to the jury's task. Moreover, providing jurors sentencing information invites themto ponder matters that are not within their province, distracts them from their factfinding responsibilities, and cre-ates a strong possibility of confusion. SeePope v. UnitedStates, 298 F. 2d 507, 508 (CA5 1962); cf. Rogers, supra, at 40.Despite these familiar precepts, Shannon contends that aninstruction informing the jury of the consequences of an NGIgiven. Judge Lumbard believes that the decision whether to give theinstruction should be left to the discretion of the trial judge").4 Particularly in capital trials, juries may be given sentencing responsibilities. See, e. g., Simmons v. South Carolina, ante, p. 154. It is undisputed that the jury had no such responsibilities in Shannon's case.5 In Rogers, the jury had been deliberating for almost two hours withoutreaching a verdict. After the trial court informed the jury that it wouldaccept a verdict of "Guilty as charged with extreme mercy of the Court,"the jury returned such a verdict within minutes. 422 U. S., at 36-37 (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded that, instead of givingthe jurors information about sentencing (that is, that they could recommend "extreme mercy"), the trial court should have "admoni[shed] [them]that [they] had no sentencing function and should reach [their] verdictwithout regard to what sentence might be imposed." Id., at 40.512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT580 SHANNON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtverdict is required under the IDRA whenever requested bythe defendant. He also argues that such an instruction isrequired as a matter of general federal criminal practice.We address each argument in turn.ATo determine whether Congress intended courts to departfrom the principle that jurors are not to be informed of theconsequences of their verdicts, we turn first, as always, tothe text of the statute. The IDRA refers to the subject ofjury instructions only once, and that reference occurs in itsdescription of the possible verdicts a jury may return.Under the Act, "the jury shall be instructed to find . . . thedefendant--(1) guilty; (2) not guilty; or (3) not guilty only byreason of insanity." 18 U. S. C. $ 4242(b). The text of theAct gives no indication that jurors are to be instructed regarding the consequences of an NGI verdict. As the courtbelow observed, the Act "leaves the jury solely with its customary determination of guilt or innocence." 981 F. 2d, at763. The Act's text thus gives no support to Shannon's contention that an instruction informing the jury of the conse-quences of an NGI verdict is required.Shannon asserts, however, that an express statutory direc-tive is not necessary because, by modeling the IDRA on D. C.Code Ann. $ 24-301 (1981),6 Congress impliedly adopted theDistrict of Columbia Circuit's decision in Lyles and the practice endorsed by that decision of instructing the jury as tothe consequences of an NGI verdict. For this argument herelies on Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 36 (1899),in which we stated:6 District of Columbia Code Ann. $ 24-301 continued to govern theoperation of the insanity defense in federal criminal prosecutions in theDistrict of Columbia until the passage of the IDRA. Cf. United Statesv. Crutchfield, 893 F. 2d 376, 377-379 (CADC 1990) (holding that theIDRA applies prospectively to insanity acquittees committed after itsenactment).512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT581Cite as: 512 U. S. 573 (1994)Opinion of the Court"By a familiar canon of interpretation, heretofore ap-plied by this court whenever Congress . . . has borrowedfrom the statutes of a State provisions which had re-ceived in that State a known and settled constructionbefore their enactment by Congress, that constructionmust be deemed to have been adopted by Congress together with the text which it expounded, and the provi-sions must be construed as they were understood at thetime in the State."See also Carolene Products Co. v. United States, 323 U. S.18, 26 (1944) ("[T]he general rule [is] that adoption of thewording of a statute from another legislative jurisdiction car-ries with it the previous judicial interpretations of the wording"); Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264, 280 (1831). Thecanon of interpretation upon which Shannon relies, however,is merely a "presumption of legislative intention" to be in-voked only "under suitable conditions."Carolene Products,supra, at 26. We believe that the "conditions" are not "suitable" in this case. Indeed, although Congress may have hadthe District of Columbia Code in mind when it passed theIDRA, see United States v. Crutchfield, 893 F. 2d 376, 378(CADC 1990), it did not, in the language of Hof, "borrow"the terms of the IDRA from the District of Columbia Code.Rather, Congress departed from the scheme embodied inD. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301 in several significant ways.The IDRA, for example, requires a defendant at trial toprove insanity by clear and convincing evidence, 18 U. S. C.$ 17(b); the District of Columbia statute, by contrast, employsa preponderance standard, D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301( j). Acommitment hearing must be held under the IDRA within40 days of an NGI verdict, 18 U. S. C. $ 4243(c); the period is50 days under the District of Columbia scheme, D. C. CodeAnn. $ 24-301(d)(2)(A). Under the IDRA, a defendantwhose offense involved bodily injury to another or seriousdamage to another's property, or the substantial risk thereof,must demonstrate at the hearing by clear and convincing evi512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT582 SHANNON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdence that he is entitled to release, 18 U. S. C. $ 4243(d);under the District of Columbia scheme, an acquittee, regardless of the character of his offense, need only meet the pre-ponderance standard, D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301(k)(3). TheIDRA provides that an acquittee, once committed, may bereleased when he no longer presents a substantial risk ofharm to others or to their property, 18 U. S. C. $ 4243(f); anacquittee under the District of Columbia system may be re-leased from commitment when he "will not in the reasonablefuture be dangerous to himself or others," D. C. Code Ann.$ 24-301(e). Finally, in the IDRA, Congress rejected thebroad test for insanity that had been utilized under the Dis-trict of Columbia provision,7 and instead adopted a more restrictive formulation under which a person is deemed insaneif he is unable "to appreciate the nature and quality or thewrongfulness of his acts." 18 U. S. C. $ 17(a). We believethat these significant differences between the IDRA andD. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301 render the canon upon which Shannon relies inapplicable in this case.87 Under the District of Columbia system, the courts had defined insanityas either the lack of substantial capacity to conform one's conduct to therequirements of the law or the lack of substantial capacity to appreciatethe wrongfulness of one's acts. See Brawner, 471 F. 2d, at 973-995.8 In addition, we note that the canon upon which Shannon relies is acanon of statutory construction. It stems from the notion that a court,in interpreting "borrowed" statutory language, should apply the same construction to that language that was placed upon it by the courts in thejurisdiction from which it was borrowed. In this case, however, the courtin the jurisdiction from which the statutory text was supposedly borrowed--that is, the Lyles court--did not purport to construe the languageof the District of Columbia Code provision; rather, in holding that jurorsshould be informed of the consequences of an NGI verdict, the court appears to have relied on its supervisory power over the Federal DistrictCourts in the District of Columbia. Cf. infra, at 584. Thus, we concludethat the canon is also inapplicable in this case because there was no"known and settled construction," Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S.1, 36 (1899), of the statute that Congress could have adopted by virtue ofborrowing language from the District of Columbia statutory scheme.512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT583Cite as: 512 U. S. 573 (1994)Opinion of the CourtAlternatively, Shannon contends that a provision explicitlyrequiring the instruction is unnecessary for a different reason: namely, that Congress made its intention to adopt theLyles practice crystal clear in the IDRA's legislative history.In particular, Shannon points to the following statement inthe Senate Report:"The Committee endorses the procedure used in theDistrict of Columbia whereby the jury, in a case in whichthe insanity defense has been raised, may be instructedon the effect of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. If the defendant requests that the instruction notbe given, it is within the discretion of the court whetherto give it or not." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 240 (1983)(footnotes omitted).Members of this Court have expressed differing views regarding the role that legislative history should play in statu-tory interpretation. CompareCounty of Washington v.Gunther, 452 U. S. 161, 182 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissent-ing) ("[I]t [is] well settled that the legislative history of astatute is a useful guide to the intent of Congress"), withWisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 617(1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (legislative his-tory is "unreliable . . . as a genuine indicator of congressionalintent"). We are not aware of any case, however (and Shannon does not bring one to our attention), in which we havegiven authoritative weight to a single passage of legislativehistory that is in no way anchored in the text of the statute.On its face, the passage Shannon identifies does not purportto explain or interpret any provision of the IDRA. Rather,it merely conveys the Committee's "endorsement" of theLyles "procedure"--a procedure that Congress did not include in the text of the Act. To give effect to this snippetof legislative history, we would have to abandon altogetherthe text of the statute as a guide in the interpretative process. We agree with the District of Columbia Circuit that512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT584 SHANNON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"courts have no authority to enforce [a] principl[e] gleanedsolely from legislative history that has no statutory reference point." International Brotherhood of Elec. Workers,Local Union No. 474, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 814 F. 2d 697, 712(1987) (emphasis deleted). We thus conclude that there isno support in the Act for the instruction Shannon seeks.9BSetting the Act aside, Shannon argues that the instructionhe proposes is required as a matter of general federal criminal practice. Presumably, Shannon asks us to invoke oursupervisory power over the federal courts. According toShannon, the instruction is necessary because jurors are gen-erally unfamiliar with the consequences of an NGI verdict,and may erroneously believe that a defendant who is foundNGI will be immediately released into society. Jurors whoare under this mistaken impression, Shannon continues, mayalso fear that the defendant, if released, would pose a dangerto the community. Shannon concludes that such jurors, inorder to ensure that the defendant will not be released, maybe tempted to return a guilty verdict in a case in which anNGI verdict would be appropriate.Even assuming Shannon is correct that some jurors willharbor the mistaken belief that defendants found NGI willbe released into society immediately--an assumption that is9 In the court below, Shannon made the additional argument that because Congress filled the "gap" that had been identified by the FederalCourts of Appeals prior to the IDRA with a general federal civil commitment procedure, "the practice announced in Lyles must now be appliednationwide." 981 F. 2d 759, 763 (CA5 1993). We find this argument(which Shannon makes only implicitly before this Court) unpersuasive.As noted above, although the lack of a federal commitment procedure before the passage of the IDRA was one reason for rejecting a Lyles-typeinstruction, courts generally, and properly, relied additionally on the principle that juries are not to be concerned with the consequences of theirverdicts. This principle is not altered by the fact that Congress established a civil commitment procedure. See Thigpen, 4 F. 3d, at 1577.512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT585Cite as: 512 U. S. 573 (1994)Opinion of the Courtopen to debate 10--the jury in his case was instructed "toapply the law as [instructed] regardless of the consequence,"and that "punishment . . . should not enter your considerationor discussion." App. A-27 to A-28. That an NGI verdictwas an option here gives us no reason to depart from "thealmost invariable assumption of the law that jurors followtheir instructions." Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206(1987). Indeed, although it may take effort on a juror's partto ignore the potential consequences of the verdict, the effortrequired in a case in which an NGI defense is raised is nodifferent from that required in many other situations. Forexample, if the Government fails to meet its burden of proofat trial, our judicial system necessarily assumes that a jurorwill vote to acquit, rather than to convict, even if he is convinced the defendant is highly dangerous and should be in-carcerated. We do not believe that the situation involvingan NGI verdict should be treated any differently.We also are not persuaded that the instruction Shannonproposes would allay the fears of the misinformed jurorabout whom Shannon is concerned. "[I]f the members of ajury are so fearful of a particular defendant's release thatthey would violate their oaths by convicting [the defendant]solely in order to ensure that he is not set free, it is question-able whether they would be reassured by anything short ofan instruction strongly suggesting that the defendant, iffound NGI, would very likely be civilly committed for a10 We are not convinced that jurors are as unfamiliar with the consequences of an NGI verdict as Shannon suggests. It may have been thecase in 1957 that, in contrast to verdicts of guilty and not guilty, "a verdictof not guilty by reason of insanity ha[d] no . . . commonly understoodmeaning." Lyles v. United States, 254 F. 2d 725, 728 (CADC 1957) (enbanc), cert. denied, 356 U. S. 961 (1958). Today, however, there is no reason to assume that jurors believe that defendants found NGI are immediately set free. See Fisher, 10 F. 3d, at 122 ("[H]ighly publicized cases,such as that involving John Hinckley, have dramatized the possibility ofcivil commitment following an NGI verdict"). See also Blume, 967 F. 2d,at 54 (Winter, J., concurring in result).512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT586 SHANNON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtlengthy period." United States v. Fisher, 10 F. 3d 115, 122(CA3 1993), cert. pending, No. 93-7000. An accurate instruction about the consequences of an NGI verdict, how-ever, would give no such assurance. Under the IDRA, apostverdict hearing must be held within 40 days to deter-mine whether the defendant should be released immediatelyinto society or hospitalized. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 4243(c), (d).Thus, the only mandatory period of confinement for an insanity acquittee is the period between the verdict and the hear-ing. Instead of encouraging a juror to return an NGI verdict, as Shannon predicts, such information might have theopposite effect--that is, a juror might vote to convict inorder to eliminate the possibility that a dangerous defendantcould be released after 40 days or less.11 Whether theinstruction works to the advantage or disadvantage of adefendant is, of course, somewhat beside the point. Ourcentral concern here is that the inevitable result of suchan instruction would be to draw the jury's attention towardthe very thing--the possible consequences of its verdict--it should ignore.Moreover, Shannon offers us no principled way to limit theavailability of instructions detailing the consequences of averdict to cases in which an NGI defense is raised. Jurorsmay be as unfamiliar with other aspects of the criminal sentencing process as they are with NGI verdicts. But, as ageneral matter, jurors are not informed of mandatory minimum or maximum sentences, nor are they instructed regard11 As the court below observed, "a jury could assume that due to overcrowded mental hospitals, strapped social services budgets, sympatheticjudges, etc., a defendant will be released after only a short period of commitment. To combat the prospect of early release, the jury could simplyopt to find him guilty." 981 F. 2d, at 763, n. 6. Indeed, depending uponthe content of the instruction, information regarding the consequences ofan NGI verdict could influence a juror's decision in countless--and unpredictable--ways. See, e. g., Fisher, supra, at 121-122, and n. 7 (describingvarious scenarios in which sentencing information could induce compromise verdicts in the NGI context).512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT587Cite as: 512 U.

Because it is con-ceivable that some jurors might harbor misunderstandingswith regard to these sentencing options, a district court,under Shannon's reasoning, might be obligated to give juriesinformation regarding these possibilities as well. In short,if we pursue the logic of Shannon's position, the rule againstinforming jurors of the consequences of their verdicts wouldsoon be swallowed by the exceptions.Finally, Congress' recent action in this area counsels hesi-tation in invoking our supervisory powers. As noted above,the IDRA was the product of a thorough and exhaustive re-view of the insanity defense as used in the federal courts.Given the comprehensive nature of the task before it, Con-gress certainly could have included a provision requiring theinstruction Shannon seeks. For whatever reason, Congresschose not to do so. Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to depart from well-established principles of criminalpractice without more explicit guidance from Congress.IIIAlthough we conclude that the IDRA does not require aninstruction concerning the consequences of an NGI verdict,and that such an instruction is not to be given as a matterof general practice, we recognize that an instruction of someform may be necessary under certain limited circumstances.If, for example, a witness or prosecutor states in the presence of the jury that a particular defendant would "go free"if found NGI, it may be necessary for the district court tointervene with an instruction to counter such a misstate-ment. The appropriate response, of course, will vary as isnecessary to remedy the specific misstatement or error.
