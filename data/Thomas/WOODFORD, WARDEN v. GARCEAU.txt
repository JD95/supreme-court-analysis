In Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997), we held thatamendments made to chapter 153 of Title 28 of the UnitedStates Code by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, do not apply tocases pending in federal court on April 24, 1996--AEDPA'seffective date. In this case we consider when a capital habeas case becomes "pending" for purposes of the rule an-nounced inLindh. IRespondent Robert Garceau brutally killed his girlfriendMaureen Bautista and her 14-year-old son, Telesforo Bautista. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sen-tenced to death. The California Supreme Court affirmed respondent's conviction and sentence, People v. Garceau, 6 Cal.4th 140, 862 P. 2d 664 (1993), and denied on the merits hispetition for state postconviction relief. We denied certio-rari. 513 U. S. 848 (1994).On May 12, 1995, respondent filed a motion for the appoint-ment of federal habeas counsel and an application for a stayof execution in the United States District Court for the East-ern District of California. The District Court promptlyissued a 45-day stay of execution. On June 26, 1995, theDistrict Court appointed counsel and extended the stay ofexecution for another 120 days. On August 1, 1995, theState filed a motion to vacate the stay, in part because respondent had failed to file a "specification of nonfrivolousissues," as required by local court rules.

S. 202 (2003)Opinion of the Courtent 2. Respondent cured that defect, and, on October 13,1995, the District Court denied the State's motion and ordered that the habeas petition be filed within nine months.Respondent filed his application for habeas relief on July 2,1996.Although respondent's habeas application was filed afterAEDPA's effective date, the District Court, following Circuitprecedent, concluded that the application was not subject toAEDPA. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-32 (citing Lindh,supra; Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct. for the CentralDist. of Cal., 163 F. 3d 530, 540 (CA9 1998) (en banc), cert.denied, 526 U. S. 1060 (1999)). On the merits, however, theDistrict Court ruled that respondent was not entitled to habeas relief. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-versed. Like the District Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded AEDPA does not apply to respondent's application.275 F. 3d 769, 772, n. 1 (2001). Unlike the District Court,however, the Ninth Circuit granted habeas relief for reasonsthat are not relevant to our discussion here.Id., at 777-778.We granted certiorari. 536 U. S. 990 (2001).IIAs already noted, we held in Lindh that the new provi-sions of chapter 153 of Title 28 do not apply to cases pendingas of the date AEDPA became effective. Lindh, however,had no occasion to elaborate on the precise time when a casebecomes "pending" for purposes of chapter 153 because inthat case petitioner's habeas application had been filed priorto AEDPA's effective date. See Lindh, supra, at 323 (notingthat petitioner filed his federal habeas application on July 9,1992). Since Lindh, the Courts of Appeals have divided onthe question whether AEDPA applies to a habeas applicationfiled after AEDPA's effective date if the applicant sought theappointment of counsel or a stay of execution (or both) priorto that date. Five Courts of Appeals have ruled thatAEDPA applies, see,e. g., Isaacs v. Head, 300 F. 3d 1232,538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN206 WOODFORD v. GARCEAUOpinion of the Court1245-1246 (CA11 2002); Moore v. Gibson, 195 F. 3d 1152,1160-1163 (CA10 1999);Gosier v. Welborn, 175 F. 3d 504, 506(CA7 1999); Williams v. Coyle, 167 F. 3d 1036, 1037-1040(CA6 1999);Williams v. Cain, 125 F. 3d 269, 273-274 (CA51997), while the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hasheld it does not,Calderon, supra, at 539-540. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the majority of the Courtsof Appeals.Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly incapital cases, seeWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 386(2000) (opinion of Stevens, J.) ("Congress wished to curbdelays, to prevent `retrials' on federal habeas, and to giveeffect to state convictions to the extent possible under law");see also id., at 404 (majority opinion), and "to further theprinciples of comity, finality, and federalism," Williams v.Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436 (2000). One of the methods Congress used to advance these objectives was the adoption ofan amended 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). Williams, 529 U. S., at 404("It cannot be disputed that Congress viewed $ 2254(d)(1) asan important means by which its goals for habeas reformwould be achieved"). As we have explained before, $ 2254(d)places "new constraint[s] on the power of a federal habeascourt to grant a state prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the meritsin state court." Id., at 412. Our cases make clear thatAEDPA in general and $ 2254(d) in particular focus in largemeasure on revising the standards used for evaluating themerits of a habeas application. See id., at 412-413; Lindh,supra, at 329 (noting that "amended $ 2254(d) . . . governsstandards affecting entitlement to relief "); see also Early v.Packer, 537 U. S. 3 (2002) (per curiam) (applying AEDPA'sstandards); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19 (2002) (percuriam) (same).Because of AEDPA's heavy emphasis on the standardsgoverning the review of the merits of a habeas application,538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN207Cite as: 538 U. S. 202 (2003)Opinion of the Courtwe interpret the rule announced in Lindh in view of thatemphasis, as have the majority of the Courts of Appeals.See, e. g., Holman v. Gilmore, 126 F. 3d 876, 880 (CA7 1997)("[T]he motion for counsel is not itself a petition, because itdoes not call for (or even permit) a decision on the merits.And it is `the merits' that the amended $ 2254(d)(1) is allabout"); Isaacs, supra, at 1245 (same); Coyle, supra, at 1040(same). Thus, whether AEDPA applies to a state prisonerturns on what was before a federal court on the date AEDPAbecame effective. If, on that date, the state prisoner hadbefore a federal court an application for habeas relief seekingan adjudication on the merits of the petitioner's claims, thenamended $ 2254(d) does not apply. Otherwise, an applicationfiled after AEDPA's effective date should be reviewed underAEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant--suchas, for example, a request for the appointment of counsel ora motion for a stay of execution--were presented to a federalcourt prior to AEDPA's effective date.A review of the amended chapter 153 supports our conclusion. For instance, $ 2254(e)(1) provides that, "[i]n a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeascorpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment ofa State court, a determination of a factual issue made by aState court shall be presumed to be correct." (Emphasisadded.) Under the Ninth Circuit's view, the presumptionestablished in $ 2254(e)(1) would rarely apply in a capitalcase. If, as the Ninth Circuit held, a capital habeas casecan be commenced (and, therefore, may become pending forpurposes of Lindh) with the filing of a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay, then $ 2254(e)(1),which by its terms applies only to a proceeding "instituted"by "an application for a writ of habeas corpus," would notapply to any capital prisoners whose first filing in federalcourt is a request for the appointment of counsel or a motionfor a stay. This would make $ 2254(e)(1) applicable only tothose capital prisoners who did not need counsel and did not538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN208 WOODFORD v. GARCEAUOpinion of the Courtseek a stay. AEDPA's text, however, contains no indicationthat $ 2254(e)(1) was intended to have such a limited scope.Nor is it reasonable to believe that Congress meant for acapital prisoner to avoid the application of the stringent requirements of $ 2254(e)(1) simply by filing a request for coun-sel or a motion for a stay before filing an actual applicationfor habeas relief. Other provisions of chapter 153 likewisesupport our view. See,e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(d) (indicatingthat the power to grant a writ is not triggered except by"application for a writ of habeas corpus"); $ 2244(a) (provid-ing that federal judges are not required to "entertain" a second or successive "application for a writ of habeas corpus"except as provided for by statute).Finally, our conclusion is reinforced by the proceduralrules governing $ 2254 cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3 explains that "[a] civil action is commenced by filinga complaint." The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applyin the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are notinconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. See 28 U. S. C.$ 2254 Rule 11; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2); Pitchess v.Davis, 421 U. S. 482, 489 (1975) (per curiam). Nothing inthe Habeas Corpus Rules contradicts Rule 3. The logicalconclusion, therefore, is that a habeas suit begins with thefiling of an application for habeas corpus relief--the equivalent of a complaint in an ordinary civil case.IIIRespondent asks us to determine the scope of the ruleannounced inLindh by looking at some of the provisions ofchapter 154 of Title 28. But our task in this case is to applyLindh to an action under chapter 153; thus, the precisephrasing of provisions in chapter 154 is inapposite to ourinquiry here.Moreover, respondent's argument that our holding in McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849 (1994), should inform our deci-sion here is unpersuasive. To begin with,McFarland in538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN209Cite as: 538 U. S. 202 (2003)Opinion of the Courtvolved the interpretation of $ 2251, not $ 2254, which is atissue here. And, as the Courts of Appeals have recognized,see Isaacs, 300 F. 3d, at 1242-1246 (collecting and discussingauthorities), the Court's ruling inMcFarland must be understood in light of the Court's concern to protect the right tocounsel contained in 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B).McFarland,512 U. S., at 855 ("This interpretation is the only one thatgives meaning to the statute as a practical matter"); id., at856 ("Requiring an indigent capital petitioner to proceedwithout counsel in order to obtain counsel thus would exposehim to the substantial risk that his habeas claims neverwould be heard on the merits. Congress legislated againstthis legal backdrop in adopting $ 848(q)(4)(B), and we safelyassume that it did not intend for the express requirement ofcounsel to be defeated in this manner"); id., at 857 ("Even ifthe District Court had granted McFarland's motion for appointment of counsel and had found an attorney to representhim, this appointment would have been meaningless unlessMcFarland's execution also was stayed"). Thus, McFarlandcannot carry the day for respondent.Similarly, the Ninth Circuit's and respondent's reliance onHohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236 (1998), is misplaced. InHohn, we considered whether this Court has jurisdiction toreview a court of appeals' denial of a certificate of appealability (COA). To answer that question we focused on the textof 28 U. S. C. $ 1254, which "confines our jurisdiction to`[c]ases in' the courts of appeals." Hohn, supra, at 241 (citing Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 741-742 (1982)). Although we concluded that an application for a COA constituted a case within the meaning of $ 1254, we did not providean all-purpose definition of the term "case." Thus, whileHohn might support an argument that respondent's requestfor appointment of counsel and his motion for a stay of execution began a "case" that could be reviewed on appeal, see,e. g., Gosier, 175 F. 3d, at 506 ("[A] request for counsel is a`case' in the sense that it is subject to appellate review (and,538US1 Unit: $U34 [10-26-04 18:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN210 WOODFORD v. GARCEAUO'Connor, J., concurring in judgmentif need be, review by the Supreme Court)"), it says nothingabout whether a request for counsel or motion for a staysuffices to create a "case" that is "pending" within the mean-ing of the Lindh rule.* * *In sum, we hold that, for purposes of applying the ruleannounced inLindh, a case does not become "pending" untilan actual application for habeas corpus relief is filed in federal court. Because respondent's federal habeas corpus ap-plication was not filed until after AEDPA's effective date,that application is subject to AEDPA's amendments.1 Ac-cordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appealsand remand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.2
