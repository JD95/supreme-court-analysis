Parts I, II, and III-B, concluding:1. The Eighth Amendment does not require that a jury be instructedas to the consequences of their failure to agree. Pp. 379-384.(a) As petitioner argues, the Federal Death Penalty Act requiresjudge sentencing when the jury, after retiring for deliberations, reportsitself as unable to reach a unanimous verdict. In such a case, thesentencing duty falls upon the District Court pursuant to 18 U. S. C.$ 3594. Pp. 379-381.(b) The Eighth Amendment, however, does not require that a jurybe instructed as to the consequences of a breakdown in the deliberativeprocess. Such an instruction has no bearing on the jury's role in thesentencing process. Moreover, the jury system's very object is to secure unanimity, and the Government has a strong interest in having thejury express the conscience of the community on the ultimate life ordeath question. A charge of the sort petitioner suggests might wellundermine this strong governmental interest. In addition, Congresschose not to require such an instruction be given. The Court declinesto invoke its supervisory powers over the federal courts and requirethat such an instruction be given in every capital case in these circumstances. Pp. 381-384.2. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was led to believethat petitioner would receive a court-imposed sentence less than life527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 JONES v. UNITED STATESSyllabusimprisonment in the event they could not recommend unanimously asentence of death or life imprisonment without the possibility of release. Pp. 384-395.(a) Petitioner claims that the instruction pertaining to the jury'ssentencing recommendation, in combination with the Decision Forms,led to confusion warranting reversal of his sentence under the Due Process Clause, the Eighth Amendment, and the Act. Because petitionerdid not voice the objections that he now raises before the jury retired,see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 30, his claim of error is subject to a limitedappellate review for plain error, e. g., Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S.461, 465-466. Pp. 384-389.(b) Under that review, relief is not warranted unless there has been(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights. Petitioner'sargument falls short of satisfying even the first requirement, for noerror occurred. The proper standard for reviewing claims that allegedly ambiguous instructions caused jury confusion is whether there is areasonable likelihood that the jury applied the challenged instruction ina way that violates the Constitution. There is no such likelihood here.The District Court gave no explicit instructions on the consequences ofnonunanimity; and the passages that petitioner argues led to jury confusion, when viewed in the context of the entire instructions, lack anyambiguity. Nor did the Decision Forms or their accompanying instructions create a reasonable likelihood of confusion over the effect of nonunanimity. The District Court's explicit instruction that the jury hadto be unanimous and its exhortation to the jury to discuss the punishment and to attempt to reach agreement make it doubtful that the jurythought it was compelled to recommend a lesser sentence in the event ofa disagreement. Even assuming, arguendo, that a plain error occurred,petitioner cannot show that it affected his substantial rights. The District Court admonished the jury not to concern itself with the effect ofa lesser sentence recommendation. Moreover, assuming that the jurorswere confused over the consequences of deadlock, petitioner cannotshow the confusion necessarily worked to his detriment. It is just aslikely that the jurors, loathe to recommend a lesser sentence, wouldhave compromised on a life imprisonment sentence as on a death sentence. Cf. Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U. S. 1, 14. Pp. 389-395.3. Assuming, arguendo, that the District Court erred in allowing thejury to consider nonstatutory aggravating factors that were vague,overbroad, or duplicative in violation of the Eighth Amendment, sucherror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. An appellate courtmay conduct harmless-error review by considering either whether absent an invalid factor, the jury would have reached the same verdict orwhether the result would have been the same had the invalid aggravat527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN375Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the Courting factor been precisely defined. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494U. S. 738, 753-754. The Fifth Circuit performed the first sort of analysis, and its explanation appears sufficient. Even if its analysis was tooperfunctory, it is plain, under the alternative mode of harmless-erroranalysis, that the error indeed was harmless. Had the nonstatutoryaggravating factors been precisely defined in writing, the jury wouldhave reached the same recommendation as it did. The Government'sargument to the jury cured the factors of any infirmity as written.Pp. 402-405.Thomas, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered theopinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III-B, in which Rehnquist, C.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtless than life imprisonment in the event that they could notreach a unanimous sentence recommendation; and whetherthe submission to the jury of two allegedly duplicative,vague, and overbroad nonstatutory aggravating factors washarmless error. We answer "no" to the first two questions.As for the third, we are of the view that there was no errorin allowing the jury to consider the challenged factors. As-suming error,arguendo, we think it clear that such errorwas harmless.IPetitioner Louis Jones, Jr., kidnaped Private Tracie JoyMcBride at gunpoint from the Goodfellow Air Force Base inSan Angelo, Texas. He brought her to his house and sexu-ally assaulted her. Soon thereafter, petitioner drove Private McBride to a bridge just outside of San Angelo, wherehe repeatedly struck her in the head with a tire iron untilshe died. Petitioner administered blows of such severeforce that, when the victim's body was found, the medicalexaminers observed that large pieces of her skull had beendriven into her cranial cavity or were missing.The Government charged petitioner with, inter alia, kid-naping with death resulting to the victim, in violation of 18U. S. C. $ 1201(a)(2), an offense punishable by life imprison-ment or death. Exercising its discretion under the FederalDeath Penalty Act of 1994, 18 U. S. C. $ 3591 et seq., theGovernment decided to seek the latter sentencing option.Petitioner was tried in the District Court for the NorthernDistrict of Texas and found guilty by the jury.The District Court then conducted a separate sentencinghearing pursuant to $ 3593. As an initial matter, the sentencing jury was required to find that petitioner had the req-uisite intent, see $ 3591(a)(2); it concluded that petitionerintentionally killed his victim and intentionally inflictedserious bodily injury resulting in her death. Even on afinding of intent, however, a defendant is not death eligibleunless the sentencing jury also finds that the Government527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN377Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the Courthas proved beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of thestatutory aggravating factors set forth at $ 3592. See$ 3593(e). Because petitioner was charged with committinga homicide, the Government had to prove 1 of the 16 statutory aggravating factors set forth at 18 U. S. C. $ 3592(c)(1994 ed. and Supp. III) (different statutory aggravating factors for other crimes punishable by death are set forth at$$ 3592(b), (d)). The jury unanimously found that two suchfactors had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt--itagreed that petitioner caused the death of his victim duringthe commission of another crime, see $ 3592(c)(1), and that hecommitted the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, anddepraved manner, see $ 3592(c)(6).1Once petitioner became death eligible, the jury had to decide whether he should receive a death sentence. In makingthe selection decision, the Act requires that the sentencingjury consider all of the aggravating and mitigating factorsand determine whether the former outweigh the latter (or,if there are no mitigating factors, whether the aggravatingfactors alone are sufficient to warrant a death sentence).$$ 3591(a), 3592, 3593(e). The Act, however, requires moreexacting proof of aggravating factors than mitigating ones--although a jury must unanimously agree that the Government established the existence of an aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, $ 3593(c), the jury may consider amitigating factor in its weighing process so long as one jurorfinds that the defendant established its existence by preponderance of the evidence, $$ 3593(c), (d). In addition to the1 As phrased on the Special Findings Form returned by the jury, thestatutory aggravating factors read:"2(A). The defendant LOUIS JONES caused the death of Tracie JoyMcBride, or injury resulting in the death of Tracie Joy McBride, whichoccurred during the commission of the offense of Kidnapping.""2(C). The defendant LOUIS JONES committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, and depraved manner in that it involved torture orserious physical abuse to Tracie Joy McBride."

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttwo statutory aggravators that established petitioner's deatheligibility, the jury also unanimously found two aggravatorsof the nonstatutory variety 2 had been proved: One set forthvictim impact evidence and the other victim vulnerabilityevidence.3 As for mitigating factors, at least one juror found10 of the 11 that petitioner proposed and seven jurors wrotein a factor petitioner had not raised on the Special FindingsForm.42 The term "nonstatutory aggravating factor" is used to refer to anyaggravating factor that is not specifically described in 18 U. S. C. $ 3592.Section 3592(c) provides that the jury may consider "whether any otheraggravating factor for which notice has been given exists." Pursuant to$ 3593(a), when the Government decides to seek the death penalty, it mustprovide notice of the aggravating factors that it proposes to prove as justifying a sentence of death.3 As phrased on the Special Findings Form, the nonstatutory aggravating factors read:"3(B). Tracie Joy McBride's young age, her slight stature, her background, and her unfamiliarity with San Angelo, Texas."3(C). Tracie Joy McBride's personal characteristics and the effect ofthe instant offense on Tracie Joy McBride's family constitute an aggravating factor of the offense." App. 53.4 The mitigating factors that the jury found as set forth on the SpecialFindings Form (along with the number of jurors that found for each factorin brackets) are as follows:"1. That the defendant Louis Jones did not have a significant prior criminal record." [6]"2. That the defendant Louis Jones' capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct or to conform to the requirements of lawwas significantly impaired, regardless of whether the capacity was so impaired as to constitute a defense to the charge."

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIn petitioner's view, the Eighth Amendment requires thatthe jurors be instructed as to the effect of their inability toagree. He alternatively argues that we should invoke oursupervisory power over the federal courts and require thatsuch an instruction be given.Before we turn to petitioner's Eighth Amendment argument, a question of statutory interpretation calls for our attention. The Fifth Circuit held that the District Court didnot err in refusing petitioner's requested instruction becauseit was not substantively correct. See 132 F. 3d, at 242-243.According to the Court of Appeals, $ 3593(b)(2)(C), whichprovides that a new jury shall be impaneled for a new sentencing hearing if the guilt phase jury is discharged for"good cause," requires the District Court to impanel a secondjury and hold a second sentencing hearing in the event ofjury deadlock. Id., at 243. The Government interprets thestatute the same way (although its reading is more nuanced)and urges that the judgment below be affirmed on thisground.Petitioner, however, reads the Act differently. In hisview, whenever the jury reaches a result other than a unanimous verdict recommending a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility of release, the duty ofsentencing falls upon the district court pursuant to $ 3594,which reads:"Upon a recommendation under section 3593(e) thatthe defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility of release, the court shallsentence the defendant accordingly. Otherwise, thecourt shall impose any lesser sentence that is authorizedby law. Notwithstanding any other law, if the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense is life imprisonment, the court may impose a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release."527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN381Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner's argument is based on his construction of theterm "[o]therwise." He argues that this term means thatwhen the jury, after retiring for deliberations, reports itselfas unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the sentencing determination passes to the court.As the dissent also concludes, post, at 417-418, petitioner'sview of the statute is the better one. The phrase "goodcause" in $ 3593(b)(2)(C) plainly encompasses events such asjuror disqualification, but cannot be read so expansively asto include the jury's failure to reach a unanimous decision.Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment does not require thatthe jurors be instructed as to the consequences of their failure to agree.To be sure, we have said that the Eighth Amendment requires that a sentence of death not be imposed arbitrarily.See, e. g., Buchanan v. Angelone, 522 U. S. 269, 275 (1998).In order for a capital sentencing scheme to pass constitutional muster, it must perform a narrowing function withrespect to the class of persons eligible for the death penaltyand must also ensure that capital sentencing decisions restupon an individualized inquiry. Ibid. The instruction thatpetitioner requested has no bearing on what we have calledthe "eligibility phase" of the capital sentencing process. Asfor what we have called the "selection phase," our cases haveheld that in order to satisfy the requirement that capital sentencing decisions rest upon an individualized inquiry, ascheme must allow a "broad inquiry" into all "constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence." Id., at 276. Petitionerdoes not argue, nor could he, that the District Court's failureto give the requested instruction prevented the jury fromconsidering such evidence.In theory, the District Court's failure to instruct the juryas to the consequences of deadlock could give rise to anEighth Amendment problem of a different sort: We also haveheld that a jury cannot be "affirmatively misled regarding its527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN382 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtrole in the sentencing process." Romano v. Oklahoma, 512U. S. 1, 9 (1994). In no way, however, was the jury affirmatively misled by the District Court's refusal to give petition-er's proposed instruction. The truth of the matter is thatthe proposed instruction has no bearing on the jury's role inthe sentencing process. Rather, it speaks to what happensin the event that the jury is unable to fulfill its role--whendeliberations break down and the jury is unable to producea unanimous sentence recommendation. Petitioner's argu-ment, although less than clear, appears to be that a deathsentence is arbitrary within the meaning of the EighthAmendment if the jury is not given any bit of informationthat might possibly influence an individual juror's voting be-havior. That contention has no merit. We have never suggested, for example, that the Eighth Amendment requires ajury be instructed as to the consequences of a breakdown inthe deliberative process. On the contrary, we have longbeen of the view that "[t]he very object of the jury systemis to secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by ar-guments among the jurors themselves."Allen v. UnitedStates, 164 U. S. 492, 501 (1896).5 We further have recognized that in a capital sentencing proceeding, the Govern-ment has "a strong interest in having the jury express theconscience of the community on the ultimate question of lifeor death."Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 238 (1988)(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We are ofthe view that a charge to the jury of the sort proposed bypetitioner might well have the effect of undermining thisstrong governmental interest.65 We have thus approved of the use of a supplemental charge to encourage a jury reporting itself as deadlocked to engage in further deliberations, see Allen v. United States, 164 U. S., at 501, even capital sentencingjuries, see Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 237-241 (1988).6 It is not insignificant that the Courts of Appeals to have addressed thisquestion, as far as we are aware, are uniform in rejecting the argumentthat the Constitution requires an instruction as to the consequences of ajury's inability to agree. See, e. g., Coe v. Bell, 161 F. 3d 320, 339-340527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the CourtWe similarly decline to exercise our supervisory powers torequire that an instruction on the consequences of deadlockbe given in every capital case. In drafting the Act, Con-gress chose not to require such an instruction. Cf. $ 3593(f)(district court "shall instruct the jury that, in consideringwhether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not considerthe race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of thedefendant or of any victim and that the jury is not to recommend a sentence of death unless it has concluded that itwould recommend a sentence of death for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, nationalorigin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim may be").Petitioner does point us to a decision from the New JerseySupreme Court requiring, in an exercise of that court's supervisory authority, that the jury be informed of the sentenc-ing consequences of nonunanimity. See New Jersey v. Ramseur, 106 N. J. 123, 304-315, 524 A. 2d 188, 280-286 (1987).Of course, New Jersey's practice has no more relevance toour decision than the power to persuade. Several otherStates have declined to require a similar instruction. See,e. g., North Carolina v. McCarver, 341 N. C. 364, 394, 462S. E. 2d 25, 42 (1995);Brogie v. Oklahoma, 695 P. 2d 538, 547(Okla. Crim. App. 1985); Calhoun v. Maryland, 297 Md. 563,593-595, 468 A. 2d 45, 58-60 (1983); Coulter v. Alabama, 438So. 2d 336, 346 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); Justus v. Virginia,220 Va. 971, 979, 266 S. E. 2d 87, 92-93 (1980). We find thereasoning of the Virginia Supreme Court inJustus far morepersuasive than that of the New Jersey Supreme Court, especially in light of the strong governmental interest thatwe have recognized in having the jury render a unanimoussentence recommendation:(CA6 1998); Green v. French, 143 F. 3d 865, 890 (CA4 1998); United Statesv. Chandler, 996 F. 2d 1073, 1088-1089 (CA11 1993); Evans v. Thompson,881 F. 2d 117, 123-124 (CA4 1989). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit, in the alternative, reached the same conclusion in this very case. See 132 F. 3d 232,245 (1998).527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN384 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"The court properly refused an instruction offered bythe defendant which would have told the jury that if itcould not reach agreement as to the appropriate punish-ment, the court would dismiss it and impose a life sentence. While this was a correct statement of law it concerned a procedural matter and was not one whichshould have been the subject of an instruction. Itwould have been an open invitation for the jury to avoidits responsibility and to disagree."Id., at 979, 266 S. E.2d, at 92.In light of the legitimate reasons for not instructing the juryas to the consequences of deadlock, and in light of congres-sional silence, we will not exercise our supervisory powersto require that an instruction of the sort petitioner soughtbe given in every case. Cf.Shannon v. United States, 512U. S. 573, 587 (1994). BPetitioner further argues that the jury was led to believethat if it could not reach a unanimous sentence recommendation he would receive a judge-imposed sentence less severethan life imprisonment, and his proposed instruction as tothe consequences of deadlock was necessary to correct thejury's erroneous impression. Moreover, he contends thatthe alleged confusion independently warrants reversal of hissentence under the Due Process Clause, the Eighth Amendment, and the Act itself. He grounds his due process claimin the assertion that sentences may not be based on materially untrue assumptions, his Eighth Amendment claim in hiscontention that the jury is entitled to accurate sentencinginformation, and his statutory claim in an argument that juryconfusion over the available sentencing options constitutesan "arbitrary factor" under $ 3595(c)(2)(A).To put petitioner's claim in the proper context, we mustbriefly review the jury instructions and sentencing proce527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN385Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the Courtdures used at trial. After instructing the jury on the aggravating and mitigating factors and explaining the processof weighing those factors, the District Court gave the following instructions pertaining to the jury's sentencingrecommendation:"Based upon this consideration, you the jury, by unanimous vote, shall recommend whether the defendantshould be sentenced to death, sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, or sentenced tosome other lesser sentence."If you unanimously conclude that the aggravatingfactors found to exist sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factor or factors found to exist, or in the absence ofany mitigating factors, that the aggravating factors arethemselves sufficient to justify a sentence of death, youmay recommend a sentence of death. Keep in mind,however, that regardless of your findings with respectto aggravating and mitigating factors, you are neverrequired to recommend a death sentence."If you recommend the imposition of a death sentence,the court is required to impose that sentence. If yourecommend a sentence of life without the possibility ofrelease, the court is required to impose that sentence.If you recommend that some other lesser sentence beimposed, the court is required to impose a sentence thatis authorized by the law. In deciding what recommendation to make, you are not to be concerned with thequestion of what sentence the defendant might receivein the event you determine not to recommend a deathsentence or a sentence of life without the possibility ofrelease. That is a matter for the court to decide inthe event you conclude that a sentence of death or lifewithout the possibility of release should not be recommended." App. 43-44.527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe District Court also provided the jury with four de-cision forms on which to record its recommendation.7 Inits instructions explaining those forms, the District Courttold the jury that its choice of form depended on itsrecommendation:"The forms are self-explanatory: Decision Form Ashould be used if you determine that a sentence of deathshould not be imposed because the government failed toprove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of therequired intent on the part of the defendant or a re-quired aggravating factor. Decision Form B should beused if you unanimously recommend that a sentence ofdeath should be imposed. Decision Form C or DecisionForm D should be used if you determine that a sentenceof death should not be imposed because: (1) you do notunanimously find that the aggravating factor or factorsfound to exist sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factoror factors found to exist; (2) you do not unanimously findthat the aggravating factor or factors found to exist are7 The decision forms read as follows:"DECISION FORM A"We the jury have determined that a sentence of death should not beimposed because the government has failed to prove beyond a reasonabledoubt the existence of the required intent on the part of the defendant ora required aggravating factor.""DECISION FORM B"Based upon consideration of whether the aggravating factor or factorsfound to exist sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factor or factors foundto exist, or in the absence of any mitigating factors, whether the aggravating factor or factors are themselves sufficient to justify a sentence ofdeath, we recommend, by unanimous vote, that a sentence of death beimposed.""DECISION FORM C"We the jury recommend, by unanimous verdict, a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.""DECISION FORM D"We the jury recommend some other lesser sentence." App. 57-59.527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the Courtthemselves sufficient to justify a sentence of deathwhere no mitigating factor has been found to exist; or(3) regardless of your findings with respect to aggravat-ing and mitigating factors you are not unanimous in recommending that a sentence of death should be imposed.Decision Form C should be used if you unanimously recommend that a sentence of imprisonment for life withoutthe possibility of release should be imposed."Decision Form D should be used if you recommendthat some other lesser sentence should be imposed."Id., at 47-48.Petitioner maintains that the instructions in combinationwith the decision forms led the jury to believe that ifit failed to recommend unanimously a sentence of death orlife imprisonment without the possibility of release, then itwould be required to use Decision Form D and the courtwould impose a sentence less than life imprisonment.8 Thescope of our review is shaped by whether petitioner properlyraised and preserved an objection to the instructions at trial.A party generally may not assign error to a jury instructionif he fails to object before the jury retires or to "stat[e] distinctly the matter to which that party objects and thegrounds of the objection." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 30.These timeliness and specificity requirements apply duringthe sentencing phase as well as the trial. See 18 U. S. C.$ 3595(c)(2)(C); see also Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 1, 54(a).They enable a trial court to correct any instructional mis8 Petitioner does not argue that the District Court's instructions on thelesser sentence option, standing alone, constituted reversible error although the parties agree that, after the jury found petitioner guilty ofkidnaping resulting in death, the only possible sentences were death anda life sentence. See Brief for Petitioner 18-19; Brief for United States13, n. 2; see also 18 U. S. C. $ 1201. Petitioner made such an argumentbelow; the Fifth Circuit, however, concluded that the instructions as tothe lesser sentence option did not rise to the level of plain error. 132F. 3d, at 246-248.527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttakes before the jury retires and in that way help to avoidthe burdens of an unnecessary retrial. While an objectionin a directed verdict motion before the jury retires can pre-serve a claim of error,Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6,32 (1969), objections raised after the jury has completed itsdeliberations do not. See Singer v. United States, 380 U. S.24, 38 (1965);Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 436 (1963);cf. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150,238-239 (1940). Nor does a request for an instruction beforethe jury retires preserve an objection to the instruction actu-ally given by the court. Otherwise, district judges wouldhave to speculate on what sorts of objections might be implied through a request for an instruction and issue rulingson "implied" objections that a defendant never intends toraise. Such a rule would contradict Rule 30's mandate thata party state distinctly his grounds for objection.Petitioner did not voice the objections to the instructionsand decision forms that he now raises before the jury retired.See App. 16-33. While Rule 30 could be read literally tobar any review of petitioner's claim of error, our decisionsinstead have held that an appellate court may conduct a limited review for plain error. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b);Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 465-466 (1997);United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731-732 (1993); Lopez,supra, at 436-437; Namet v. United States, 373 U. S. 179,190-191 (1963). Petitioner, however, contends that the Federal Death Penalty Act creates an exception. He relies onlanguage in the Act providing that an appellate court shallremand a case where it finds that "the sentence of death wasimposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or anyother arbitrary factor." $ 3595(c)(2)(A). According to petitioner, the alleged jury confusion over the available sentencing options is an arbitrary factor and thus warrants resentencing even if he did not properly preserve the objection.This argument rests on an untenable reading of the Act.The statute does not explicitly announce an exception to527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the Courtplain-error review, and a congressional intent to create suchan exception cannot be inferred from the overall scheme.Statutory language must be read in context and a phrase"gathers meaning from the words around it."Jarecki v.G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961); see also Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995). Here, the samesubsection that petitioner relies upon further provides thatreversal is warranted where "the proceedings involvedany other legal error requiring reversal of the sentence thatwas properly preserved for appeal under the rules of crimi-nal procedure." $ 3595(c)(2)(C). This language makes clearthat Congress sought to impose a timely objection requirement at sentencing and did not intend to equate the phrase"arbitrary factor" with legal error. Petitioner's broad interpretation of $ 3595(c)(2)(A) would drain $ 3595(c)(2)(C) of anyindependent meaning.We review the instructions, then, for plain error. Underthat review, relief is not warranted unless there has been(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights.Johnson, supra, at 467; Olano, supra, at 732. Appellate review under the plain-error doctrine, of course, is circumscribed and we exercise our power under Rule 52(b) sparingly. See United States v. Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15 (1985);United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 163, and n. 14 (1982);cf. Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U. S. 145, 154 (1977) ("It is therare case in which an improper instruction will justify reversal of a criminal conviction when no objection has been madein the trial court"). An appellate court should exercise itsdiscretion to correct plain error only if it "seriously affect[s]the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings." Olano, supra, at 732 (internal quotation marksomitted); Young, supra, at 15; United States v. Atkinson, 297U. S. 157, 160 (1936).Petitioner's argument--which depends on the premisethat the instructions and decision forms led the jury to believe that it did not have to recommend unanimously a lesser527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsentence--falls short of satisfying even the first requirementof the plain-error doctrine, for we cannot see that any erroroccurred. We have considered similar claims that allegedlyambiguous instructions caused jury confusion. See, e. g.,Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U. S. 1 (1994); Estelle v. McGuire,502 U. S. 62 (1991); Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990).The proper standard for reviewing such claims is " `whetherthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied thechallenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution." Estelle, supra, at 72 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380);see also Victor, supra, at 6 (applying reasonable likelihoodstandard to direct review of state criminal conviction).9There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied theinstructions incorrectly. The District Court did not expressly inform the jury that it would impose a lesser sentence in case of deadlock. It simply told the jury that, ifit recommended a lesser sentence, the court would imposea sentence "authorized by the law." App. 44. Nor did theDistrict Court expressly require the jury to select DecisionForm D if it could not reach agreement. Instead, it exhorted the jury "to discuss the issue of punishment with one9 Petitioner concedes that the Boyde standard applies to the extent thathe is advancing a constitutional claim, but relying on our prior decision inAndres v. United States, 333 U. S. 740, 752 (1948), he contends that a morelenient standard applies to the extent that he seeks relief under the statute directly. Our decisions in Boyde and Estelle, however, foreclose thatreading of Andres. In Boyde we noted that our prior decisions, includingAndres, had been "less than clear" in articulating a single workable standard for evaluating claims that an instruction prevented the jury's consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence. 494 U. S., at 378. In order tosupply "a single formulation for this Court and other courts to employin deciding this kind of federal question," we announced the "reasonablelikelihood" standard. Id., at 379. We made this same point later in Estelle, noting that "[i]n Boyde . . . we made it a point to settle on a singlestandard of review for jury instructions--the `reasonable likelihood' standard--after considering the many different phrasings that had previouslybeen used by this Court." 502 U. S., at 72-73, n. 4.527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the Courtanother in an effort to reach agreement, if you can do so."Id., at 46.Notwithstanding the absence of an explicit instruction onthe consequences of nonunanimity, petitioner identifies several passages which, he believes, support the inference thatthe jury was confused on this point. He trains on that por-tion of the instructions telling the jurors that the courtwould decide the sentence if they did not recommend a sen-tence of death or life without the possibility of release. Petitioner argues that this statement, coupled with two earlierreferences to a "lesser sentence" option, caused the jurors toinfer that the District Court would impose a lesser sentenceif they could not unanimously agree on a sentence of deathor life without the possibility of release. He maintains thatthis inference is strengthened by a later instruction: "Inorder to bring back a verdict recommending the punishmentof death or life without the possibility of release, all twelveof you must unanimously vote in favor of such specific penalty." Id., at 45. According to petitioner, the failure tomention the "lesser sentence" option in this statementstrongly implied that, in contradistinction to the first twooptions, the "lesser sentence" option did not require juryunanimity.Petitioner parses these passages too finely. Our decisionsrepeatedly have cautioned that instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.See, e. g., Bryan v. United States, 524 U. S. 184, 199 (1998);United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658, 674 (1975); Cupp v.Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973); Boyd v. United States,271 U. S. 104, 107 (1926). We agree with the Fifth Circuitthat when these passages are viewed in the context of theentire instructions, they lack ambiguity and cannot be giventhe reading that petitioner advances. See 132 F. 3d, at 244.We previously have held that instructions that might be ambiguous in the abstract can be cured when read in conjunction with other instructions. Bryan, supra, at 199; Victor,527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN392 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsupra, at 14-15; Estelle, supra, at 74-75. Petitioner's claimis far weaker than those we evaluated in Bryan, Victor, andEstelle because the jury in this case received an explicit in-struction that it had to be unanimous. Just prior to its admonition that the jury should not concern itself with the ulti-mate sentence if it does not recommend death or life withoutthe possibility of release, the trial court expressly instructedthe jury in unambiguous language that any sentencing recommendation had to be by a unanimous vote. Specifically,it stated that "you the jury, by unanimous vote, shall recommend whether the defendant should be sentenced to death,sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, or sentenced to some other lesser sentence." App. 43.Other instructions, by contrast, specified when the jury didnot have to act unanimously. For example, the DistrictCourt explicitly told the jury that its findings on the mitigating circumstances, unlike those on the aggravating circum-stances, did not have to be unanimous.10 To be sure, theDistrict Court could have used the phrase "unanimously"more frequently. But when read alongside an unambiguouscharge that any sentencing recommendation be unanimousand other instructions explicitly identifying when the juryneed not be unanimous, the passages identified by petitionerdo not create a reasonable likelihood that the jury believedthat deadlock would cause the District Court to impose alesser sentence.10 The relevant portion of the instruction read: "You will also recall thatI previously told you that all twelve of you had to unanimously agree thata particular aggravating circumstance was proved beyond a reasonabledoubt before you consider it. Quite the opposite is true with regard tomitigating factors. A finding with respect to a mitigating factor may bemade by any one or more of the members of the jury, and any memberwho finds by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of a mitigatingfactor may consider such factor established for his or her weighing ofaggravating and mitigating factors regardless of the number of other jurors who agree that such mitigating factor has been established." App.43.527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN393Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner also relies on alleged ambiguities in the decisionforms and the explanatory instructions. He stresses thefact that Decision Form D (lesser sentence recommendation),unlike Decision Forms B (death sentence) and C (life withoutthe possibility of release), did not contain the phrase "byunanimous vote" and required only the foreperson's signa-ture. These features of Decision Form D, according to petitioner, led the jury to conclude that nonunanimity wouldresult in a lesser sentence. According to petitioner, the instructions accompanying Decision Form D, unlike those re-specting Decision Forms B and C, did not mention unanimity,thereby increasing the likelihood of confusion.With respect to this aspect of petitioner's argument, weagree with the Fifth Circuit that "[a]lthough the verdictforms standing alone could have persuaded a jury to conclude that unanimity was not required for the lesser sentenceoption, any confusion created by the verdict forms was clarified when considered in light of the entire jury instruction."132 F. 3d, at 245. The District Court's explicit instructionthat the jury had to be unanimous and its exhortation to thejury to discuss the punishment and attempt to reach agreement, App. 46, make it doubtful that the jury thought itwas compelled to employ Decision Form D in the event ofdisagreement.Petitioner also places too much weight on the fact thatDecision Form D required only the foreperson's signature.Although it only contained a space for the foreperson's signature, Form D, like the others, used the phrase "We the juryrecommend . . . ," thereby signaling that Form D representedthe jury's recommendation. Id., at 59. Moreover, elsewhere, the jury foreperson alone signed the jury forms toindicate the jury's unanimous agreement. Specifically, onlythe jury foreperson signed the special findings form on whichthe jury was required to indicate its unanimous agreementthat an aggravating factor had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 51-53. In these circumstances, we do527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN394 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtnot think that the decision forms or accompanying instructions created a reasonable likelihood of confusion over theeffect of nonunanimity.11Even assuming, arguendo, that an error occurred (and thatit was plain), petitioner cannot show that it affected his substantial rights. Any confusion among the jurors over theeffect of a lesser sentence recommendation was allayed bythe District Court's admonition that the jury should not concern itself with the effect of such a recommendation. Seesupra, at 390 (quoting App. 44). The jurors are presumedto have followed these instructions. See Shannon, 512U. S., at 585; Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987).Even if the jurors had some lingering doubts about the effect of deadlock, therefore, the instructions made clear thatthey should set aside their concerns and either report thatthey were unable to reach agreement or recommend a lessersentence if they believed that this was the only option.Moreover, even assuming that the jurors were confusedover the consequences of deadlock, petitioner cannot showthe confusion necessarily worked to his detriment. It is justas likely that the jurors, loath to recommend a lesser sentence, would have compromised on a sentence of life imprisonment as on a death sentence. Where the effect of an al11 Petitioner also urges us to take cognizance of two affidavits preparedafter the jury had returned its sentencing recommendation. One affidavit, attached to petitioner's new trial motion, was executed by an investigator for the federal public defender after a juror had contacted the publicdefender's office. Id., at 66-68. The other affidavit, attached to petitioner's motion to reconsider the District Court's order denying his motion fora new trial, was executed by one of the jurors. Id., at 78-80. The FifthCircuit ruled that petitioner could not rely on these affidavits to undermine the jury's sentencing recommendation. 132 F. 3d, at 245-246. Petitioner did not raise this independent determination in any of his questionspresented, and we do not believe that the issue is fairly included withinthem. We therefore decline review of this ruling by the Fifth Circuit.See this Court's Rule 14.1(a); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 443,n. 38 (1984).527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN395Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of Thomas, J.leged error is so uncertain, a defendant cannot meet his burden of showing that the error actually affected his substantial rights. Cf. Romano, 512 U. S., at 14. In Romano, weconsidered a similar argument, namely, that jurors had disregarded a trial judge's instructions and given undue weightto certain evidence. In rejecting that argument, we notedthat, even assuming that the jury disregarded the trialjudge's instructions, "[i]t seems equally plausible that the evidence could have made the jurors more inclined to impose adeath sentence, or it could have made them less inclined todo so." Ibid. Any speculation on the effect of a lesser sentence recommendation, like the evidence in Romano, wouldhave had such an indeterminate effect on the outcome of theproceeding that we cannot conclude that any alleged error inthe District Court's instructions affected petitioner's substantial rights. See Park, 421 U. S., at 676; Lopez, 373 U. S.,at 436-437.IIIAApart from the claimed instructional error, petitioner argues that the nonstatutory aggravating factors found andconsidered by the jury, see n. 2, supra, were vague, overbroad, and duplicative in violation of the Eighth Amendment,and that the District Court's error in allowing the jury toconsider them was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.The Eighth Amendment, as the Court of Appeals correctlyrecognized, see 132 F. 3d, at 250, permits capital sentencingjuries to consider evidence relating to the victim's personalcharacteristics and the emotional impact of the murder onthe victim's family in deciding whether an eligible defendantshould receive a death sentence. See Payne v. Tennessee,501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991) ("A State may legitimately concludethat evidence about the victim and about the impact of themurder on the victim's family is relevant to the jury's decision as to whether or not the death penalty should be im527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN396 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Thomas, J.posed. There is no reason to treat such evidence differentlythan other relevant evidence is treated"). Petitioner doesnot dispute that, as a general matter, such evidence is appropriate for the sentencing jury's consideration. See ReplyBrief for Petitioner 15. His objection is that the two nonstatutory aggravating factors were duplicative, vague, andoverbroad so as to render their use in this case unconstitutional, a point with which the Fifth Circuit agreed, 132 F. 3d,at 250-251, although it ultimately ruled in the Government'sfavor on the ground that the alleged error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 251-252.The Government here renews its argument that the nonstatutory aggravators in this case were constitutionallyvalid. At oral argument, however, it was suggested thatthis case comes to us on the assumption that the nonstatutory aggravating factors were invalid because the Government did not cross-appeal on the question. Tr. of Oral Arg.25. As the prevailing party, the Government is entitled todefend the judgment on any ground that it properly raisedbelow. See, e. g., El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526U. S. 473, 479 (1999); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County ofKent, 510 U. S. 355, 364 (1994) ("A prevailing party need notcross-petition to defend a judgment on any ground properlyraised below, so long as that party seeks to preserve, andnot to change, the judgment"). It further was suggestedthat because we granted certiorari on the Government's rephrasing of petitioner's questions and because the thirdquestion--"whether the court of appeals correctly held thatthe submission of invalid nonstatutory aggravating factorswas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"--presumes error,we must assume the nonstatutory aggravating factors wereerroneous. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-27. We are not convincedthat the reformulated question presumes error. The question whether the nonstatutory aggravating factors were constitutional is fairly included within the third question pre527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN397Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of Thomas, J.sented--we might answer "no" to the question "[w]hetherthe Court of Appeals correctly held that the submission ofinvalid nonstatutory aggravating factors was harmless be-yond a reasonable doubt," 525 U. S. 809 (1998), by explainingthat the Fifth Circuit was incorrect in holding that there waserror. Without a doubt, the Government would have donebetter to call our attention to the fact that it planned toargue that the nonstatutory aggravating factors were validat the petitioning stage. But it did not affirmatively concede that the nonstatutory aggravators were invalid, seeBrief in Opposition 18-22, and absent such a concession,we think that the Government's argument is properlypresented.1212 The dissent would treat this aspect of the Government's argument aswaived. Post, at 420-421, n. 24. As Justice Ginsburg explained, for aunanimous Court, in Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 (1996): "Underthis Court's Rule 15.2, a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent's brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari `may bedeemed waived.' " Id., at 75, n. 13 (emphasis added). But we have notdone so when the issue not raised in the brief in opposition was "predicateto an intelligent resolution of the question presented." Ohio v. Robinette,519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 75, n. 13. In those instances, we have treated theissue not raised in opposition as fairly included within the question presented. This is certainly such a case. Assessing the error (includingwhether there was error at all) is essential to an intelligent resolution ofwhether any such error was harmless. Moreover, here, as in Caterpillar,"[t]he parties addressed the issue in their briefs and at oral argument."Ibid. By contrast, in the cases that the dissent looks to for support forits position, there were good reasons to decline to exercise our discretion.In Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1999) (per curiam),the "claims [we declined to consider did] not appear to have been sufficiently developed below for us to assess them," and in South Central BellTelephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999), the argument respondent raised for the first time in its merits brief was "so far-reachingan argument" that "[w]e would normally expect notice [of it]," especiallywhen, unlike this case, the respondent's argument did not appear to havebeen raised or considered below.527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN398 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Thomas, J.1We first address petitioner's contention that the two nonstatutory aggravating factors were impermissibly duplica-tive. The Fifth Circuit reasoned that "[t]he plain meaningof the term `personal characteristics,' used in [nonstatutoryaggravator] 3(C), necessarily includes `young age, slight stature, background, and unfamiliarity,' which the jury wasasked to consider in 3(B)." 132 F. 3d, at 250. The problem,the court thought, was that this duplication led to "doublecounting" of aggravating factors. Following a Tenth Circuitdecision,United States v. McCullah, 76 F. 3d 1087, 1111(1996), the Fifth Circuit was of the view that in a weighingscheme, "double counting" has a tendency to skew the process so as to give rise to the risk of an arbitrary, and thusunconstitutional, death sentence. 132 F. 3d, at 251. In theFifth Circuit's words, there may be a thumb on the scale infavor of death "[i]f the jury has been asked to weigh thesame aggravating factor twice." Ibid.We have never before held that aggravating factors couldbe duplicative so as to render them constitutionally invalid,nor have we passed on the "double counting" theory that theTenth Circuit advanced inMcCullah 13 and the Fifth Circuitappears to have followed here. What we have said is thatthe weighing process may be impermissibly skewed if thesentencing jury considers an invalid factor. See Stringer v.Black, 503 U. S. 222, 232 (1992). Petitioner's argument (andthe reasoning of the Fifth and Tenth Circuits) would have usreach a quite different proposition--that if two aggravatingfactors are "duplicative," then the weighing process neces-sarily is skewed, and the factors are therefore invalid.Even accepting, for the sake of argument, petitioner's"double counting" theory, there are nevertheless several13 The Tenth Circuit, in a decision subsequent to McCullah, has emphasized that factors do not impermissibly overlap unless one "necessarilysubsumes" the other. Cooks v. Ward, 165 F. 3d 1283, 1289 (1998).527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN399Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of Thomas, J.problems with the Fifth Circuit's application of the theory inthis case. The phrase "personal characteristics" as used infactor 3(C) does not obviously include the specific personalcharacteristics listed in 3(B)--"young age, her slight stature,her background, and her unfamiliarity with San Angelo"--especially in light of the fact that 3(C) went on to refer to theimpact of the crime on the victim's family. In the context ofconsidering the effect of the crime on the victim's family, itwould be more natural to understand "personal characteristics" to refer to those aspects of the victim's character andpersonality that her family would miss the most. More important, to the extent that there was any ambiguity arisingfrom how the factors were drafted, the Government's argument to the jury made clear that 3(B) and 3(C) went to entirely different areas of aggravation--the former clearlywent to victim vulnerability while the latter captured thevictim's individual uniqueness and the effect of the crime onher family. See, e. g., 25 Record 2733-2734 ("[Y]ou can consider [the victim's] young age, her slight stature, her background, her unfamiliarity with the San Angelo area. . . . Sheis barely five feet tall [and] weighs approximately 100pounds. [She is] the ideal victim"); id., at 2734 ("[Y]ou canconsider [the victim's] personal characteristics and the effects of the instant offense on her family. . . . You heard aboutthis young woman, you heard about her from her mother,you heard about her from her friends that knew her. Shewas special, she was unique, she was loving, she was caring,she had a lot to offer this world"). As such, even if thephrase "personal characteristics" as used in factor 3(C) wasunderstood to include the specific personal characteristicslisted in 3(B), the factors as a whole were not duplicative--at best, certain evidence was relevant to two different aggravating factors. Moreover, any risk that the weighing process would be skewed was eliminated by the District Court'sinstruction that the jury "should not simply count the number of aggravating and mitigating factors and reach a deci527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN400 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Thomas, J.sion based on which number is greater [but rather] shouldconsider the weight and value of each factor." App. 45.2We also are of the view that the Fifth Circuit incorrectlyconcluded that factors 3(B) and 3(C) were unconstitutionallyvague. In that court's view, the nonstatutory aggravatingfactors challenged here "fail[ed] to guide the jury's discretion, or [to] distinguish this murder from any other murder."132 F. 3d, at 251. The Court of Appeals, relying on our decision in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, 361-362 (1988),also was of the opinion that "[t]he use of the terms `background,' `personal characteristics,' and `unfamiliarity' with-out further definition or instruction left the jury with . . .open-ended discretion." 132 F. 3d, at 251 (internal quota-tion marks omitted).Ensuring that a sentence of death is not so infected withbias or caprice is our "controlling objective when we examineeligibility and selection factors for vagueness." Tuilaepa v.California, 512 U. S. 967, 973 (1994). Our vagueness review, however, is "quite deferential." Ibid. As long as anaggravating factor has a core meaning that criminal juriesshould be capable of understanding, it will pass consti-tutional muster.Ibid. Assessed under this deferentialstandard, the factors challenged here surely are not vague.The jury should have had no difficulty understanding thatfactor 3(B) was designed to ask it to consider whether thevictim was especially vulnerable to petitioner's attack. Norshould it have had difficulty comprehending that factor 3(C)asked it to consider the victim's personal traits and the effectof the crime on her family.14 Even if the factors as written14 Petitioner argues that the term "personal characteristics" was sovague that the jury may have thought it could consider the victim's raceand the petitioner's race under factor 3(C). In light of the remainder ofthe factor and the Government's argument with respect to the factor, wefail to see that possibility. In any event, in accordance with the Death527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN401Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of Thomas, J.were somewhat vague, the Fifth Circuit was wrong to con-clude that the factors were not given further definition, see132 F. 3d, at 251; as we have explained, the Government'sargument made absolutely clear what each nonstatutory factor meant.15 3Finally, we turn to petitioner's contention that the chal-lenged nonstatutory factors were overbroad. An aggravating factor can be overbroad if the sentencing jury "fairlycould conclude that an aggravating circumstance applies toevery defendant eligible for the death penalty." Arave v.Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993). We have not, however,specifically considered what it means for a factor to be overbroad when it is important only for selection purposes andespecially when it sets forth victim vulnerability or victimimpact evidence. Of course, every murder will have an im-pact on the victim's family and friends and victims are oftenchosen because of their vulnerability. It might seem, then,that the factors 3(B) and 3(C) apply to every eligible defendant and thus fall within the Eighth Amendment's proscription against overbroad factors. But that cannot be correct;if it were, we would not have decidedPayne as we did.Even though the concepts of victim impact and victim vul-nerability may well be relevant in every case,evidence ofvictim vulnerability and victim impact in a particular case isinherently individualized. And such evidence is surely relevant to the selection phase decision, given that the sentencerPenalty Act's explicit command in $ 3593(f), the District Court instructedthe jury not to consider race at all in reaching its decision. App. 47. Jurors are presumed to have followed their instructions. See Richardsonv. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987).15 We reiterate the point we made in Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U. S.967 (1994)--we have held only a few, quite similar factors vague, see, e. g.,Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988) (whether murder was "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"), while upholding numerous other factors against vagueness challenges, see 512 U. S., at 974 (collecting cases).527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN402 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtshould consider all of the circumstances of the crime in deciding whether to impose the death penalty. See Tuilaepa, 512U. S., at 976.What is of common importance at the eligibility and selection stages is that "the process is neutral and principled soas to guard against bias or caprice in the sentencing decision." Id., at 973. So long as victim vulnerability andvictim impact factors are used to direct the jury to the individual circumstances of the case, we do not think thatprinciple will be disturbed. Because factors 3(B) and 3(C)directed the jury to the evidence specific to this case, we donot think that they were overbroad in a way that offendedthe Constitution.BThe error in this case, if any, rests in loose drafting ofthe nonstatutory aggravating factors; as we have made clear,victim vulnerability and victim impact evidence are appropriate subjects for the capital sentencer's consideration.Assuming that use of these loosely drafted factors was indeed error, we conclude that the error was harmless.Harmless-error review of a death sentence may be performed in at least two different ways. An appellate courtmay choose to consider whether absent an invalid factor, thejury would have reached the same verdict or it may chooseinstead to consider whether the result would have been thesame had the invalid aggravating factor been precisely defined. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 753-754(1990). The Fifth Circuit chose to perform the first sort ofanalysis, and ultimately concluded that the jury would havereturned a recommendation of death even had it not considered the two supposedly invalid nonstatutory aggravatingfactors:"After removing the offensive non-statutory aggravating factors from the balance, we are left with two527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN403Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)Opinion of the Courtstatutory aggravating factors and eleven mitigating fac-tors to consider when deciding whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the death sentence would have been im-posed had the invalid aggravating factors never beensubmitted to the jury. At the sentencing hearing, thegovernment placed great emphasis on the two statutoryaggravating factors found unanimously by the jury--Jones caused the death of the victim during the commission of the offense of kidnapping; and the offense wascommitted in an especially heinous, cruel, and depravedmanner in that it involved torture or serious physicalabuse of the victim. Under part two of the SpecialFindings Form, if the jury had failed to find that thegovernment proved at least one of the statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, then the delib-erations would have ceased leaving the jury powerlessto recommend the death penalty. Therefore, the abilityof the jury to recommend the death penalty hinged ona finding of a least one statutory aggravating factor.Conversely, jury findings regarding the non-statutoryaggravating factors were not required before the jurycould recommend the death penalty. After removingthe two non-statutory aggravating factors from the mix,we conclude that the two remaining statutory aggravating factors unanimously found by the jury support thesentence of death, even after considering the eleven mitigating factors found by one or more jurors. Conse-quently, the error was harmless because the death sentence would have been imposed beyond a reasonabledoubt had the invalid aggravating factors never beensubmitted to the jury." 132 F. 3d, at 252.Petitioner claims that the court's analysis was so perfunctoryas to be infirm. His argument is largely based on the following passage from Clemons: "Under these circumstances, itwould require a detailed explanation based on the record for527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN404 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtus possibly to agree that the error in giving the invalid `especially heinous' instruction was harmless." 494 U. S., at 753-754 (emphasis added). Clemons, however, involved quitedifferent facts. There, an "especially heinous" aggravatingfactor was determined to be unconstitutionally vague. Theonly remaining aggravating factor was that the murder wascommitted during a robbery for pecuniary gain. The Statehad repeatedly emphasized the invalid factor and said littleabout the valid aggravator. See id., at 753. Despite this,all that the Mississippi Supreme Court said was: " `We likewise are of the opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that thejury's verdict would have been the same with or withoutthe "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel" aggravating circumstance.' " Ibid. (quoting Clemons v. State, 535 So. 2d1354, 1364 (Miss. 1988)). We quite understandably requireda "detailed explanation based on the record" in thosecircumstances.The same "detailed explanation . . . on the record" that werequired in Clemons may not have been necessary in thiscase. Cf. Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 540 (1992) (thereis no federal requirement that state courts adopt "a particular formulaic indication" before their review for harmlesserror will pass scrutiny). But even if the Fifth Circuit'sharmless-error analysis was too perfunctory, we think itplain, under the alternative mode of harmless-error analysis,that the error indeed was harmless beyond a reasonabledoubt. See $ 3595(c)(2) (federal death sentences are not tobe set aside on the basis of errors that are harmless beyond areasonable doubt). Had factors 3(B) and 3(C) been preciselydefined in writing, the jury surely would have reached thesame recommendation as it did. The Government's argument to the jury, see, e. g., 25 Record 2733-2734, cured thenonstatutory factors of any infirmity as written. We aresatisfied that the jury in this case actually understood whateach factor was designed to put before it, and therefore have527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN405Cite as: 527 U.
