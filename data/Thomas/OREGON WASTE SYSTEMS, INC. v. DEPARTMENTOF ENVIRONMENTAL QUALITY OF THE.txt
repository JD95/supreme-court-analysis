Two Terms ago, in Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992), we held that the negative Commerce Clause prohibited Alabama from imposing a higherfee on the disposal in Alabama landfills of hazardous wastefrom other States than on the disposal of identical wastefrom Alabama. In reaching that conclusion, however, weleft open the possibility that such a differential surchargemight be valid if based on the costs of disposing of wastefrom other States. Id., at 346, n. 9. Today, we must decidewhether Oregon's purportedly cost-based surcharge on thein-state disposal of solid waste generated in other Statesviolates the Commerce Clause.ILike other States, Oregon comprehensively regulates thedisposal of solid wastes within its borders.1 Respondent#A brief of amici curiae urging affirmance was filed for the State ofIndiana et al. by Pamela Carter, Attorney General of Indiana, and ArendJ.

DEPARTMENT OFENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.Opinion of the CourtOregon Department of Environmental Quality oversees theState's regulatory scheme by developing and executing plansfor the management, reduction, and recycling of solid wastes.To fund these and related activities, Oregon levies a widerange of fees on landfill operators. See, e. g., Ore. Rev. Stat.$$ 459.235(3), 459.310 (1991). In 1989, the Oregon Legislature imposed an additional fee, called a "surcharge," on"every person who disposes of solid waste generated out-ofstate in a disposal site or regional disposal site." $ 459.297(1)(effective Jan. 1, 1991). The amount of that surcharge wasleft to respondent Environmental Quality Commission (Com-mission) to determine through rulemaking, but the legislature did require that the resulting surcharge "be based onthe costs to the State of Oregon and its political subdivisionsof disposing of solid waste generated out-of-state which arenot otherwise paid for" under specified statutes. $ 459.298.At the conclusion of the rulemaking process, the Commissionset the surcharge on out-of-state waste at $2.25 per ton.Ore. Admin. Rule 340-97-120(7) (Sept. 1993).In conjunction with the out-of-state surcharge, the legislature imposed a fee on the in-state disposal of waste gener-ated within Oregon. See Ore. Rev. Stat. $$ 459A.110(1), (5)(1991). The in-state fee, capped by statute at $0.85 per ton(originally $0.50 per ton), is considerably lower than the feeimposed on waste from other States. $$ 459A.110(5) and459A.115. Subsequently, the legislature conditionally extended the $0.85 per ton fee to out-of-state waste, in additionto the $2.25 per ton surcharge, $ 459A.110(6), with the proviso that if the surcharge survived judicial challenge, the$0.85 per ton fee would again be limited to in-state waste.1991 Ore. Laws, ch. 385, $$ 91-92.22 As a result, shippers of out-of-state solid waste currently are beingcharged $3.10 per ton to dispose of such waste in Oregon landfills, as compared to the $0.85 per ton fee charged to dispose of Oregon waste in thosesame landfills.

(Oregon Waste),and Columbia Resource Company (CRC), joined by GilliamCounty, Oregon, sought expedited review of the out-of-statesurcharge in the Oregon Court of Appeals. Oregon Wasteowns and operates a solid waste landfill in Gilliam County, atwhich it accepts for final disposal solid waste generated inOregon and in other States. CRC, pursuant to a 20-yearcontract with Clark County, in neighboring WashingtonState, transports solid waste via barge from Clark Countyto a landfill in Morrow County, Oregon. Petitioners chal-lenged the administrative rule establishing the out-of-statesurcharge and its enabling statutes under both state law andthe Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the statutes and rule.Gilliam County v. Department of Environmental Quality,114 Ore. App. 369, 837 P. 2d 965 (1992).The State Supreme Court affirmed. Gilliam County v.Department of Environmental Quality of Oregon, 316 Ore.99, 849 P. 2d 500 (1993). As to the Commerce Clause, thecourt recognized that the Oregon surcharge resembled theAlabama fee invalidated inChemical Waste Management,Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992), in that both prescribedhigher fees for the disposal of waste from other States. Nev-ertheless, the court viewed the similarity as superficial only.Despite the explicit reference in $ 459.297(1) to out-of-statewaste's geographic origin, the court reasoned, the Oregonsurcharge is not facially discriminatory "[b]ecause of [its] ex-press nexus to actual costs incurred [by state and local government]." 316 Ore., at 112, 849 P. 2d, at 508. That nexusdistinguishedChemical Waste, supra, by rendering the sur-charge a "compensatory fee," which the court viewed as"prima facie reasonable," that is to say, facially constitu-tional. 316 Ore., at 112, 849 P. 2d, at 508. The court readwaste if the surcharge is upheld, 1991 Ore. Laws, ch. 385, $ 92, is not challenged here.511us1$33N 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT98 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v.

(quoting Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583, 599(1939)). Because Oregon law restricts the scope of judicialreview in expedited proceedings to deciding the facial legal-ity of administrative rules and the statutes underlying them,Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 183.400 (1991), the Oregon court deemeditself precluded from deciding the factual question whetherthe surcharge on out-of-state waste was disproportionate.316 Ore., at 112, 849 P. 2d, at 508.We granted certiorari, 509 U.

[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States." Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Though phrased as a grantof regulatory power to Congress, the Clause has long beenunderstood to have a "negative" aspect that denies theStates the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce. See, e. g.,Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 454 (1992); Welton v.Missouri, 91 U. S. 275 (1876). The Framers granted Congress plenary authority over interstate commerce in "theconviction that in order to succeed, the new Union wouldhave to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanizationthat had plagued relations among the Colonies and lateramong the States under the Articles of Confederation."Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325-326 (1979). Seegenerally The Federalist No. 42 (J. Madison).

S. 525,537-538 (1949).Consistent with these principles, we have held that the firststep in analyzing any law subject to judicial scrutiny underthe negative Commerce Clause is to determine whether it"regulates evenhandedly with only `incidental' effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate com-merce."Hughes, supra, at 336. See also Chemical Waste,504 U. S., at 340-341. As we use the term here, "discrimina-tion" simply means differential treatment of in-state andout-of-state economic interests that benefits the former andburdens the latter. If a restriction on commerce is discriminatory, it is virtually per se invalid. Id., at 344, n. 6. Seealso Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).By contrast, nondiscriminatory regulations that have onlyincidental effects on interstate commerce are valid unless"the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessivein relation to the putative local benefits." Pike v. BruceChurch, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970).In Chemical Waste, we easily found Alabama's surchargeon hazardous waste from other States to be facially discriminatory because it imposed a higher fee on the disposal ofout-of-state waste than on the disposal of identical in-statewaste. 504 U. S., at 342. We deem it equally obvious herethat Oregon's $2.25 per ton surcharge is discriminatory onits face. The surcharge subjects waste from other States toa fee almost three times greater than the $0.85 per toncharge imposed on solid in-state waste. The statutorydeterminant for which fee applies to any particular shipment of solid waste to an Oregon landfill is whether or notthe waste was "generated out-of-state." Ore. Rev. Stat.$ 459.297(1) (1991). It is well established, however, that alaw is discriminatory if it " `tax[es] a transaction or incidentmore heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occursentirely within the State.'

S. 266, 286 (1987).4Respondents argue, and the Oregon Supreme Court held,that the statutory nexus between the surcharge and "the[otherwise uncompensated] costs to the State of Oregon andits political subdivisions of disposing of solid waste generatedout-of-state," Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 459.298 (1991), necessarilyprecludes a finding that the surcharge is discriminatory. Wefind respondents' narrow focus on Oregon's compensatoryaim to be foreclosed by our precedents. As we reiteratedinChemical Waste, the purpose of, or justification for, a lawhas no bearing on whether it is facially discriminatory. See504 U. S., at 340-341. See also Philadelphia, supra, at 626.Consequently, even if the surcharge merely recoups the costsof disposing of out-of-state waste in Oregon, the fact remainsthat the differential charge favors shippers of Oregon wasteover their counterparts handling waste generated in otherStates. In making that geographic distinction, the surcharge patently discriminates against interstate commerce.IIIBecause the Oregon surcharge is discriminatory, the virtu-allyper se rule of invalidity provides the proper legal stand-ard here, not the Pike balancing test.

The State's burden of justificationis so heavy that "facial discrimination by itself may be a fataldefect." Ibid. See also Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Tully,466 U. S. 388, 406-407 (1984);Maryland v. Louisiana, 451U. S. 725, 759-760 (1981).At the outset, we note two justifications that respondentshavenot presented. No claim has been made that the dis-posal of waste from other States imposes higher costs onOregon and its political subdivisions than the disposal of in-state waste.5 Also, respondents have not offered any safetyor health reason unique to nonhazardous waste from otherStates for discouraging the flow of such waste into Oregon.Cf. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986) (upholding ban onimportation of out-of-state baitfish into Maine because suchbaitfish were subject to parasites completely foreign toMaine baitfish). Consequently, respondents must come forward with other legitimate reasons to subject waste fromother States to a higher charge than is levied against wastefrom Oregon.5 In fact, the Commission fixed the $2.25 per ton cost of disposing of solidwaste in Oregon landfills without reference to the origin of the waste, 3Record 665-690, and Oregon's economic consultant recognized that the perton costs are the same for both in-state and out-of-state waste. Id., at731-732, 744. Of course, if out-of-state waste did impose higher costs onOregon than in-state waste, Oregon could recover the increased costthrough a differential charge on out-of-state waste, for then there wouldbe a "reason, apart from its origin, why solid waste coming from outsidethe [State] should be treated differently."

DEPARTMENT OFENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.Opinion of the CourtRespondents offer two such reasons, each of which weaddress below.ARespondents' principal defense of the higher surcharge onout-of-state waste is that it is a "compensatory tax" necessary to make shippers of such waste pay their "fair share" ofthe costs imposed on Oregon by the disposal of their wastein the State. In Chemical Waste we noted the possibilitythat such an argument might justify a discriminatory surcharge or tax on out-of-state waste. See 504 U. S., at 346,n. 9. In making that observation, we implicitly recognizedthe settled principle that interstate commerce may be madeto " `pay its way.' " Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,430 U. S. 274, 281 (1977). See also Maryland, supra, at 754."It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relievethose engaged in interstate commerce from their just shareof state tax burden[s]."Western Live Stock v. Bureau ofRevenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938). See also Henneford v.Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577 (1937). Nevertheless, one ofthe central purposes of the Clause was to prevent Statesfrom "exacting more than a just share" from interstate com-merce. Department of Revenue of Wash. v. Association ofWash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734, 748 (1978) (emphasisadded). See alsoNorthwestern States Portland Cement Co.v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 462 (1959).At least since our decision in Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148(1869), these principles have found expression in the "compensatory" or "complementary" tax doctrine. Though ourcases sometimes discuss the concept of the compensatory taxas if it were a doctrine unto itself, it is merely a specificway of justifying a facially discriminatory tax as achievinga legitimate local purpose that cannot be achieved throughnondiscriminatory means. SeeChemical Waste, supra, at346, n. 9 (referring to the compensatory tax doctrine as a"justif[ication]" for a facially discriminatory tax). Underthat doctrine, a facially discriminatory tax that imposes on511us1$33N 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT103Cite as: 511 U. S. 93 (1994)Opinion of the Courtinterstate commerce the rough equivalent of an identifiableand "substantially similar" tax on intrastate commerce doesnot offend the negative Commerce Clause. Maryland,supra, at 758-759. See also Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v.Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232, 242-243(1987);Armco, 467 U. S., at 643.To justify a charge on interstate commerce as a compensatory tax, a State must, as a threshold matter, "identif[y] . . .the [intrastate tax] burden for which the State is attempting to compensate." Maryland, supra, at 758. Once thatburden has been identified, the tax on interstate commercemust be shown roughly to approximate--but not exceed--the amount of the tax on intrastate commerce. See,e. g.,Alaska v. Arctic Maid, 366 U. S. 199, 204-205 (1961). Finally, the events on which the interstate and intrastate taxesare imposed must be "substantially equivalent"; that is, theymust be sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutuallyexclusive "prox[ies]" for each other.Armco, supra, at 643.As Justice Cardozo explained for the Court in Henneford,under a truly compensatory tax scheme "the stranger fromafar is subject to no greater burdens as a consequence ofownership than the dweller within the gates. The one paysupon one activity or incident, and the other upon another,but the sum is the same when the reckoning is closed." 300U. S., at 584.66 The Oregon Supreme Court, though terming the out-of-state surchargea "compensatory fee," relied for its legal standard on our "user fee" cases.See 316 Ore. 99, 112, 849 P. 2d 500, 508 (1993) (citing, for example,Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc.,405 U. S. 707 (1972), and Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939)).The compensatory tax cases cited in the text, rather than the user feecases, are controlling here, as the latter apply only to "charge[s] imposedby the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportationor other facilities and services." Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,453 U. S. 609, 621 (1981). Because it is undisputed that, as in ChemicalWaste, the landfills in question are owned by private entities, includingOregon Waste, the out-of-state surcharge is plainly not a user fee. Nev511us1$33N 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT104 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OFENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.Opinion of the CourtAlthough it is often no mean feat to determine whether achallenged tax is a compensatory tax, we have little difficultyconcluding that the Oregon surcharge is not such a tax. Or-egon does not impose a specific charge of at least $2.25 perton on shippers of waste generated in Oregon, for which theout-of-state surcharge might be considered compensatory.In fact, the only analogous charge on the disposal of Oregonwaste is $0.85 per ton, approximately one-third of theamount imposed on waste from other States. See Ore. Rev.Stat. $$ 459A.110(5), 459A.115 (1991). Respondents' failureto identify a specific charge on intrastate commerce equalto or exceeding the surcharge is fatal to their claim. SeeMaryland, 451 U. S., at 758.Respondents argue that, despite the absence of a specific$2.25 per ton charge on in-state waste, intrastate commercedoes pay its share of the costs underlying the surchargethrough general taxation.7 Whether or not that is true isdifficult to determine, as "[general] tax payments are received for the general purposes of the [government], and are,upon proper receipt, lost in the general revenues." Flast v.Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 128 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Evenassuming, however, that various other means of general taxation, such as income taxes, could serve as an identifiableintrastate burden roughly equivalent to the out-of-state surcharge, respondents' compensatory tax argument fails be-cause the in-state and out-of-state levies are not imposed onsubstantially equivalent events.ertheless, even if the surcharge could somehow be viewed as a user fee,it could not be sustained as such, given that it discriminates against interstate commerce. See Evansville, supra, at 717; Guy v. Baltimore, 100U. S. 434 (1880). Cf. Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U. S.355, 369 (1994) (A user fee is valid only to the extent it "does not discriminate against interstate commerce").7 We would note that respondents, like the dissent, post, at 112, ignorethe fact that shippers of waste from other States in all likelihood payincome taxes in other States, a portion of which might well be used topay for waste reduction activities in those States.511us1$33N 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT105Cite as: 511 U. S. 93 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe prototypical example of substantially equivalent tax-able events is the sale and use of articles of trade. See Henneford, supra. In fact, use taxes on products purchased outof state are the only taxes we have upheld in recent memoryunder the compensatory tax doctrine. See ibid. Typifyingour recent reluctance to recognize new categories of compensatory taxes is Armco, where we held that manufacturingand wholesaling are not substantially equivalent events.467 U. S., at 643. In our view, earning income and disposingof waste at Oregon landfills are even less equivalent thanmanufacturing and wholesaling. Indeed, the very fact thatin-state shippers of out-of-state waste, such as OregonWaste, are charged the out-of-state surcharge even thoughthey pay Oregon income taxes refutes respondents' argument that the respective taxable events are substantiallyequivalent. See ibid. We conclude that, far from beingsubstantially equivalent, taxes on earning income and utiliz-ing Oregon landfills are "entirely different kind[s] of tax[es]."Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 546, n. 11 (1983).We are no more inclined here than we were inScheiner to"plunge . . . into the morass of weighing comparative taxburdens" by comparing taxes on dissimilar events. 483U. S., at 289 (internal quotation marks omitted).8BRespondents' final argument is that Oregon has an interestin spreading the costs of the in-state disposal of Oregonwaste to all Oregonians. That is, because all citizens of Ore8 Furthermore, permitting discriminatory taxes on interstate commerceto compensate for charges purportedly included in general forms of intrastate taxation "would allow a state to tax interstate commerce more heavily than in-state commerce anytime the entities involved in interstate commerce happened to use facilities supported by general state tax funds."Government Suppliers Consolidating Servs., Inc. v. Bayh, 975 F. 2d, at1284. We decline respondents' invitation to open such an expansive loophole in our carefully confined compensatory tax jurisprudence.511us1$33N 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT106 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OFENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.Opinion of the Courtgon benefit from the proper in-state disposal of waste fromOregon, respondents claim it is only proper for Oregon torequire them to bear more of the costs of disposing of suchwaste in the State through a higher general tax burden. Atthe same time, however, Oregon citizens should not be re-quired to bear the costs of disposing of out-of-state waste,respondents claim. The necessary result of that limited costshifting is to require shippers of out-of-state waste to bearthe full costs of in-state disposal, but to permit shippers ofOregon waste to bear less than the full cost.We fail to perceive any distinction between respondents'contention and a claim that the State has an interest in reducing the costs of handling in-state waste. Our cases con-demn as illegitimate, however, any governmental interestthat is not "unrelated to economic protectionism," Wyoming,502 U. S., at 454, and regulating interstate commerce in sucha way as to give those who handle domestic articles of com-merce a cost advantage over their competitors handling similar items produced elsewhere constitutes such protectionism.SeeNew Energy, 486 U. S., at 275.9 To give controlling ef-fect to respondents' characterization of Oregon's tax schemeas seemingly benign cost spreading would require us to over-look the fact that the scheme necessarily incorporates a protectionist objective as well. Cf. Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v.Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 273 (1984) (rejecting Hawaii's attempt tojustify a discriminatory tax exemption for local liquor pro9 We recognize that "[t]he Commerce Clause does not prohibit all stateaction designed to give its residents an advantage in the marketplace, butonly action of that description in connection with the State's regulationof interstate commerce."

Here, as in New Energy, we confront a patently discriminatory law that is plainly connected to the regulation of interstate commerce.We therefore have no occasion to decide whether Oregon could validlyaccomplish its limited cost spreading through the "market participant"doctrine, Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806-810 (1976),or other means unrelated to any regulation of interstate commerce.511us1$33N 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT107Cite as: 511 U.

It is true that by discouraging the flow ofout-of-state waste into Oregon landfills, the higher surchargeon waste from other States conserves more space in thoselandfills for waste generated in Oregon. Recharacterizingthe surcharge as resource protectionism hardly advancesrespondents' cause, however. Even assuming that landfillspace is a "natural resource," "a State may not accord itsown inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumersin other States to natural resources located within its borders." Philadelphia, 437 U. S., at 627. As we held morethan a century ago, "if the State, under the guise of exertingits police powers, should [impose a burden] . . . applicablesolely to articles [of commerce] . . . produced or manufacturedin other States, the courts would find no difficulty in holdingsuch legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution ofthe United States." Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434, 443(1880).Our decision in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458U. S. 941 (1982), is not to the contrary. There we held thata State may grant a "limited preference" for its citizens inthe utilization of ground water. Id., at 956. That holdingwas premised on several different factors tied to the simplefact of life that "water, unlike other natural resources, is essential for human survival." Id., at 952. Sporhase therefore provides no support for respondents' position thatStates may erect a financial barrier to the flow of waste fromother States into Oregon landfills. See Fort Gratiot, 504U. S., at 364-365, and n. 6.

All we intimatehere is that their discretion in this regard, as in all others,is bounded by any relevant limitations of the Federal Constitution, in these cases the negative Commerce Clause. Be-cause respondents have offered no legitimate reason to subject waste generated in other States to a discriminatorysurcharge approximately three times as high as that imposedon waste generated in Oregon, the surcharge is facially in-valid under the negative Commerce Clause. Accordingly,the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court is reversed, andthe cases are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.Landfill space evaporates as solid waste accumulates.State and local governments expend financial and politicalcapital to develop trash control systems that are efficient,lawful, and protective of the environment. The State ofOregon responsibly attempted to address its solid wastedisposal problem through enactment of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the management, disposal, reduction,and recycling of solid waste. For this Oregon should beapplauded. The regulatory scheme included a fee chargedon out-of-state solid waste. The Oregon Legislature directed the Environmental Quality Commission to determinethe appropriate surcharge "based on the costs . . . of disposing of solid waste generated out-of-state." Ore. Rev.

This seems asmall price to pay for the right to deposit your "garbage,rubbish, refuse . . . ; sewage sludge, septic tank and cesspoolpumpings or other sludge; . . . manure, . . . dead animals,[and] infectious waste" on your neighbors. Ore. Rev. Stat.$ 459.005(27) (1991).Nearly 20 years ago, we held that a State cannot ban allout-of-state waste disposal in protecting themselves fromhazardous or noxious materials brought across the State'sborders.Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978).Two Terms ago in Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992), in striking down the State of Alabama's $72 per ton fee on the disposal of out-of-state hazardous waste, the Court left open the possibility that such a feecould be valid if based on the costs of disposing of wastefrom other States. Id., at 346, n. 9. Once again, however,as in Philadelphia and Chemical Waste Management, theCourt further cranks the dormant Commerce Clause ratchetagainst the States by striking down such cost-based fees, andby so doing ties the hands of the States in addressing thevexing national problem of solid waste disposal. I dissent.1 The surcharge is composed of the following identified costs: $0.58--statewide activities for reducing environmental risks and improving solidwaste management; $0.66--reimbursements to the State for tax creditsand other public subsidies; $0.05--solid waste reduction activities relatedto the review and certification of waste reduction and recycling plans;$0.72--increased environmental liability; $0.20--lost disposal capacity;$0.03--publicly supported infrastructure; and $0.01--nuisance impactsfrom transportation. Pet. for Cert. in No. 93-108, p. 4.2 The $2.25 per ton fee imposed on out-of-state waste exceeds the $0.85per ton fee imposed on in-state waste by $1.40 per ton. One ton equals2,000 pounds. Assuming that the hypothetical nonresident generates 200pounds of garbage per month (1/10 of a ton), the nonresident's garbage billwould increase by $0.14 per month.511us1$33H 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT110 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v.

Environmental Protection Agency, Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 1992 Update, p. ES-3. Under current projections, Americans willproduce 222 million tons of garbage in the year 2000. Ibid.Generating solid waste has never been a problem. Findingenvironmentally safe disposal sites has. By 1991, it wasestimated that 45 percent of all solid waste landfills in theNation had reached capacity. 56 Fed. Reg. 50980 (1991).Nevertheless, the Court stubbornly refuses to acknowledgethat a clean and healthy environment, unthreatened by theimproper disposal of solid waste, is the commodity really atissue in cases such as these, see, e. g., Chemical Waste Management, supra, at 350 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting), andFort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. ofNatural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 368 (1992) (Rehnquist,C. J., dissenting).Notwithstanding the identified shortage of landfill space inthe Nation, the Court notes that it has "little difficulty,"ante, at 104, concluding that the Oregon surcharge does notoperate as a compensatory tax, designed to offset the loss ofavailable landfill space in the State caused by the influx ofout-of-state waste. The Court reaches this nonchalant conclusion because the State has failed "to identify a specificcharge on intrastate commerce equal to or exceeding the surcharge." Ibid. (emphasis added). The Court's myopic focuson "differential fees" ignores the fact that in-state producersof solid waste support the Oregon regulatory programthrough state income taxes and by paying, indirectly, the numerous fees imposed on landfill operators and the dumpingfee on in-state waste. Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 459.005 et seq. (1991).We confirmed in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas,458 U.

In the context of threatened ground waterdepletion, we stated that "[o]bviously, a State that imposessevere withdrawal and use restrictions on its own citizens isnot discriminating against interstate commerce when itseeks to prevent the uncontrolled transfer of water out ofthe State." Id., at 955-956. The same point could be madeabout a "clean and safe environment" in these cases: Wherea State imposes restrictions on the ability of its own citizensto dispose of solid waste in an effort to promote a "clean andsafe environment," it is not discriminating against interstatecommerce by preventing the uncontrolled transfer of out-ofstate solid waste into the State.The availability of safe landfill disposal sites in Oregon didnot occur by chance. Through its regulatory scheme, theState of Oregon inspects landfill sites, monitors wastestreams, promotes recycling, and imposes an $0.85 per tondisposal fee on in-state waste, Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 459.005 et seq.(1991), all in an effort to curb the threat that its residentswill harm the environment and create health and safetyproblems through excessive and unmonitored solid waste disposal. Depletion of a clean and safe environment will followif Oregon must accept out-of-state waste at its landfills without a sharing of the disposal costs. The Commerce Clausedoes not require a State to abide this outcome where the"natural resource has some indicia of a good publiclyproduced and owned in which a State may favor its owncitizens in times of shortage." Sporhase, supra, at 957. Ashortage of available landfill space is upon us, 56 Fed. Reg.50980 (1991), and with it comes the accompanying health andsafety hazards flowing from the improper disposal of solidwastes. We have long acknowledged a distinction betweeneconomic protectionism and health and safety regulationpromulgated by Oregon. See H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v.Du Mond, 336 U.

J., dissentingFar from neutralizing the economic situation for Oregonproducers and out-of-state producers, the Court's analysisturns the Commerce Clause on its head. Oregon's neighborswill operate under a competitive advantage against theirOregon counterparts as they can now produce solid wastewith reckless abandon and avoid paying concomitant statetaxes to develop new landfills and clean up retired landfillsites. While I understand that solid waste is an article ofcommerce,Philadelphia, 437 U. S., at 622-623, it is not acommodity sold in the marketplace; rather it is disposedof at a cost to the State. Petitioners do not buy garbage toput in their landfills; solid waste producers pay petitionersto take their waste. Oregon solid waste producers do notcompete with out-of-state businesses in the sale of solidwaste. Thus, the fees do not alter the price of a productthat is competing with other products for common purchasers. If anything, striking down the fees works to the disadvantage of Oregon businesses. They alone will have topay the "nondisposal" fees associated with solid waste: landfill siting, landfill cleanup, insurance to cover environmentalaccidents, and transportation improvement costs associatedwith out-of-state waste being shipped into the State. Whilewe once recognized that " `the collection and disposal of solidwastes should continue to be primarily the function of State,regional, and local agencies,' " id., at 621, n. 4, quoting 42U. S. C. $ 6901(a)(4) (1976 ed.), the Court today leaves Stateswith only two options: become a dumper and ship as muchwaste as possible to a less populated State, or become a dumpee, and stoically accept waste from more densely populated States.The Court asserts that the State has not offered "anysafety or health reason[s]" for discouraging the flow of solidwaste into Oregon. Ante, at 101. I disagree. The availability of environmentally sound landfill space and the properdisposal of solid waste strike me as justifiable "safety orhealth" rationales for the fee. As far back as the turn of the511us1$33H 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT113Cite as: 511 U. S. 93 (1994)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingcentury, the Court recognized that control over the collectionand disposal of solid waste was a legitimate, nonarbitraryexercise of police powers to protect health and safety. See,e. g., California Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction Works,199 U. S. 306 (1905) (holding that exclusive privilege to onecompany to dispose of the garbage in the city and county ofSan Francisco was not void as taking the property of householders for public use without compensation); and Gardnerv. Michigan, 199 U. S. 325 (1905) (holding that propertyrights of individuals must be subordinated to the generalgood and if the owner of garbage suffers any loss by its destruction he is compensated therefor in the common benefitsecured by the regulation requiring that all garbage bedestroyed).In exercising its legitimate police powers in regulatingsolid waste disposal, Oregon is not "needlessly obstruct[ing]interstate trade or attempt[ing] to place itself in a positionof economic isolation." Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 151(1986) (internal quotation marks omitted) (upholding Maine'sban on the importation of live baitfish on the ground thatit serves the legitimate governmental interest in protectingMaine's indigenous fish population from parasites prevalentin out-of-state baitfish). Quite to the contrary, Oregon accepts out-of-state waste as part of its comprehensive solidwaste regulatory program and it "retains broad regulatoryauthority to protect the health and safety of its citizens andthe integrity of its natural resources." Ibid. Moreover,Congress also has recognized taxes as an effective methodof discouraging consumption of natural resources in othercontexts. Cf. 26 U. S. C. $$ 4681, 4682 (1988 ed., Supp. IV)(tax on ozone-depleting chemicals); 26 U. S. C. $ 4064 (1988ed. and Supp. IV) (gas guzzler excise tax). Nothing shouldchange the analysis when the natural resource--landfillspace--was created or regulated by the State in the firstplace.511us1$33H 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT114 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OFENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingIn its sweeping ruling, the Court makes no distinction be-tween publicly and privately owned landfills. It rejects theargument that our "user fee" cases apply in this contextsince the landfills owned by the petitioners are private andour user fee analysis applies only to " `charge[s] imposed bythe State for the use of a state-owned or state-providedtransportation or other facilities and services.' "Ante, at103, n. 6, quoting Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,453 U. S. 609, 621 (1981). Rather than stopping there, however, the majority goes on to note that even if the Oregonsurcharge could be viewed as a user fee, "it could not besustained as such, given that it discriminates against interstate commerce." Ante, at 104, n. 6, citing EvansvilleVanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc.,405 U. S. 707, 717 (1972). There is no need to make thisdubious assertion. We specifically left unanswered thequestion whether a state or local government could regulatedisposal of out-of-state solid waste at landfills owned by thegovernment in Philadelphia, supra, at 627, n. 6.We will undoubtedly be faced with this question directlyin the future as roughly 80 percent of landfills receiving municipal solid waste in the United States are state or locallyowned. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, ResourceConservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D Study: Phase 1Report, p. 4-7 (Oct. 1986) (Table 4-2). We noted in SouthCentral Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S.82, 93 (1984): "[I]f a State is acting as a market participant,rather than as a market regulator, the dormant CommerceClause places no limitation on its activities." See also Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 459 (1992). Similarly, ifthe State owned and operated a park or recreational facility,it would be allowed to charge differential fees for in-stateand out-of-state users of the resource. See, e. g., Baldwin v.Fish and Game Comm'n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371 (1978) (upholding Montana's higher nonresident elk hunting licensefees to compensate the State for conservation expenditures511us1$33H 11-04-97 19:32:38 PAGES OPINPGT115Cite as: 511 U. S. 93 (1994)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingfrom taxes which only residents pay). More recently we up-held such differential fees under a reasonableness standardin Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U. S. 355(1994), despite the fact that the fees were not precisely tiedto the costs of the services provided at the publicly ownedairport. We relied on our Commerce Clause analysis fromEvansville, supra. We stated in Evansville:"At least so long as the toll is based on some fair approximation of use or privilege for use, . . . and is neitherdiscriminatory against interstate commerce nor excessive in comparison with the governmental benefit conferred, it will pass constitutional muster, even thoughsome other formula might reflect more exactly the relative use of the state facilities by individual users." Id.,at 716-717.I think that the $2.25 per ton fee that Oregon imposes onout-of-state waste works out to a similar "fair approximation" of the privilege to use its landfills. Even the Courtconcedes that our precedents do not demand anything beyond "substantia[l] equivalen[cy]" between the fees chargedon in-state and out-of-state waste.Ante, at 103 (internalquotation marks omitted). The $0.14 per week fee imposedon out-of-state waste producers qualifies as "substantiallyequivalent" under the reasonableness standard of NorthwestAirlines and Evansville.The Court begrudgingly concedes that interstate commerce may be made to "pay its way," ante, at 102 (internalquotation marks omitted), yet finds Oregon's nominal surcharge to exact more than a " `just share' " from interstatecommerce, ibid. It escapes me how an additional $0.14 perweek cost for the average solid waste producer constitutesanything but the type of "incidental effects on interstatecommerce" endorsed by the majority. Ante, at 99. Evenhanded regulations imposing such incidental effects on interstate commerce must be upheld unless "the burden imposed511us1$33H 11-04-97 19:32:38 PAGES OPINPGT116 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OFENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingon such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the puta-tive local benefits." Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S.137, 142 (1970). If the majority finds $0.14 per week beyondthe pale, one is left to wonder what the Court possibly couldhave contemplated when it stated:" `[I]n the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress,there is a residuum of power in the state to make lawsgoverning matters of local concern which neverthelessin some measure affect interstate commerce or even, tosome extent, regulate it.' " Hunt v. Washington StateApple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977),quoting Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sulli-van, 325 U. S. 761, 767 (1945).Surely $0.14 per week falls within even the most crabbeddefinition of "affect" or "regulate." Today the majority hasrendered this "residuum of power" a nullity.The State of Oregon is not prohibiting the export of solidwaste from neighboring States; it is only asking that thoseneighbors pay their fair share for the use of Oregon landfillsites. I see nothing in the Commerce Clause that compelsless densely populated States to serve as the low-cost dumping grounds for their neighbors, suffering the attendant risksthat solid waste landfills present. The Court, deciding otherwise, further limits the dwindling options available toStates as they contend with the environmental, health,safety, and political challenges posed by the problem of solidwaste disposal in modern society.For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.511us1$34z 06-11-96 17:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT117OCTOBER TERM, 1993SyllabusTICOR TITLE INSURANCE CO. et al. v.BROWN et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 92-1988.

The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that it would violate due process to accord res judicata effect to ajudgment involving money damages claims where a plaintiff to the previous suit had not been afforded a right to opt out.Held: Because deciding this case would require the Court to resolve aconstitutional question that may be entirely hypothetical, the writ isdismissed as improvidently granted. The Court would not have toreach the question whether absent class members have a constitutionalright to opt out of actions involving money damages if it turned out thatclasses in such actions can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), whichpermits opt out.

Pet. for Cert. i.IIThat certified question is of no general consequence if,whether or not absent class members have a constitutionalright to opt out of such actions, they have a right to do sounder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such a rightwould exist if, in actions seeking monetary damages, classescan be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits optout, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not.See Rules 23(c)(2) and (c)(3). That is at least a substantialpossibility--and we would normally resolve that preliminarynonconstitutional question before proceeding to the constitutional claim. See New York City Transit Authority v.Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 582-583 (1979). The law of res judi-cata, however, prevents that question from being litigatedhere. It was conclusively determined in the MDL No. 633litigation that respondents' class fit within Rules 23(b)(1)(A)and (b)(2); even though that determination may have beenwrong, it is conclusive upon these parties, and the alternativeof using the Federal Rules instead of the Constitution as themeans of imposing an opt-out requirement for this settlement is no longer available.The most obvious consequence of this unavailability is,as we have suggested, that our resolution of the posited con-stitutional question may be quite unnecessary in law, andof virtually no practical consequence in fact, except withrespect to these particular litigants. Another consequence,less apparent, is that resolving the constitutional question onthe assumption of proper certification under the Rules maylead us to the wrong result. If the Federal Rules, whichgenerally are not affirmatively enacted into law by Congress,see 28 U. S.

Indeciding the present case, we must assume either that thelack of opt-out opportunity in these circumstances was de-creed by the Rules or that it was not (though the partiesare bound by an erroneous holding that it was). If we makethe former assumption we may approve, in the mistakendeference to prior Supreme Court action and congressionalacquiescence, action that neither we nor Congress wouldindependently think constitutional. If we make the latterassumption, we may announce a constitutional rule that isgood for no other federal class action. Neither option isattractive.The one reason to proceed is to achieve justice in this particular case. Even if the constitutional question presentedis hypothetical as to everyone else, it would seem to be ofgreat practical importance to these litigants. But that isordinarily not sufficient reason for our granting certiorari--even when unnecessary constitutional pronouncements arenot in the picture. Moreover, as matters have developed itis not clear that our resolution of the constitutional questionwill make any difference even to these litigants. On the daywe granted certiorari we were informed that the parties hadreached a settlement designed to moot the petition, whichnow awaits the approval of the District Court.In these circumstances, we think it best to dismiss the writas improvidently granted.Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice andJustice Kennedy join, dissenting.We granted certiorari to consider one specific question:"Whether a federal court may refuse to enforce a prior federal class action judgment, properly certified under Rule 23,on grounds that absent class members have a constitutional511us1$34z 06-11-96 17:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT123Cite as: 511 U.

TheCourt decides not to answer this question based on its specu-lation about a nonconstitutional ground for decision that isneither presented on this record nor available to these parties. From that decision I respectfully dissent.Respondents are members of a class that reached a finalsettlement with petitioners in an antitrust action styledMDL No. 633.In re Real Estate Title and SettlementServices Antitrust Litigation, 1986-1 Trade Cases || 67,149,p. 62,921 (ED Pa. 1986), aff 'd, 815 F. 2d 695 (CA3 1987), cert.denied, 485 U. S. 909 (1988). Respondents subsequentlybrought this action against petitioners, asserting some of thesame claims. The District Court held that respondents hadbeen adequately represented in the MDL No. 633 action, andgranted summary judgment for petitioners because, giventhe identity of parties and claims, the MDL No. 633 settlement was res judicata. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-28a. TheCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 982 F. 2d386 (1992). The court agreed that respondents had been adequately represented in the MDL No. 633 action, id., at 390-391, but held that respondents could nevertheless relitigatethe same claims against petitioners: "Because [respondents]had no opportunity to opt out of the MDL No. 633 litigation,we hold there would be a violation of minimal due process if[respondents'] damage claims were held barred by res judicata." Id., at 392.The Court concludes that the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's constitutional interpretation "is of no general consequence if, . . . in actions seeking monetary damages, classescan be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits optout, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not."Ante, at 121. In other words, the Court declines to answerthe constitutional question because the MDL No. 633 actionmight not have been properly certified--an issue that waslitigated to a final determination in petitioners' favor more511us1$34z 06-11-96 17:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT124 TICOR TITLE INS. CO. v. BROWNO'Connor, J., dissentingthan five years ago, and on which we denied certiorari. Thenonconstitutional ground for decision about which the Courtspeculates is therefore unavailable to respondents. The con-stitutional ground on which the Court of Appeals relied, theone we granted certiorari to review and the parties havebriefed and argued, was necessary to the decision in thiscase. Our prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions has no application in these circumstances, and theCourt errs in relying on it.The Court's assertion that "our resolution of the positedconstitutional question may be . . . of virtually no practicalconsequence in fact," ibid., is unsound. The lower courtshave consistently held that the presence of monetary damages claims does not preclude class certification under Rules23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, &M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d $ 1775,pp. 463-470 (1986 and Supp. 1992). Whether or not thosedecisions are correct (a question we need not, and indeedshould not, decide today), they at least indicate that thereare a substantial number of class members in exactly thesame position as respondents. Under the Ninth Circuit'srationale in this case, every one of them has the right togo into federal court and relitigate their claims against thedefendants in the original action. The individuals, corporations, and governments that have successfully defendedagainst class actions or reached appropriate settlements, butare now subject to relitigation of the same claims withindividual class members, will rightly dispute the Court'scharacterization of the constitutional rule in this case asinconsequential.The Court is likewise incorrect in suggesting that a decision in this case "may be quite unnecessary in law." Ante,at 121. Unless and until a contrary rule is adopted, courtswill continue to certify classes under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2)notwithstanding the presence of damages claims; the constitutional opt-out right announced by the court below will be511us1$34z 06-11-96 17:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT125Cite as: 511 U. S. 117 (1994)O'Connor, J., dissentingimplicated in every such action, at least in the Ninth Circuit.Moreover, because the decision below is based on the DueProcess Clause, presumably it applies to the States; althoughwe held inPhillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797(1985), that there is a constitutional right to opt out of classactions brought in state court, that holding was expressly"limited to those class actions which seek to bind knownplaintiffs concerning claims wholly or predominately formoney judgments."Id., at 811, n. 3. The Ninth Circuit'srule, by contrast, applies whenever "substantial damageclaims" are asserted. See 982 F. 2d, at 392. The resolutionof a constitutional issue with such broad-ranging consequences is both necessary and appropriate.Finally, I do not agree with the Court's suggestion thatthe posture of the case could "lead us to the wrong result"with respect to the question whether the Due Process Clauserequires an opt-out right in federal class actions involvingclaims for money damages. See ante, at 121-122. As thecase comes to us, we must assume that the MDL No. 633class was properly certified under Rule 23, notwithstandingthe presence of claims for monetary relief. But this assumption, coupled with whatever presumption of constitutionalityto which the Rules are entitled, will not lead us to "approve. . . action that neither we nor Congress would independentlythink constitutional." Ante, at 122. Either an opt-outright is constitutionally required, or it is not. We can decidethis issue while reserving the question of how the Rulesshould be construed. While it might be convenient, and itwould certainly accord with our usual practice, to decide thenonconstitutional question first, that option is not availableto us in this case. The only question, then, is whether weshould dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. In myview, the importance of the constitutional question, as wellas the significant expenditures of resources by the litigants,amici, and this Court, outweighs the prudential concerns onwhich the Court relies.511us1$34z 06-11-96 17:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT126 TICOR TITLE INS.

B.certiorari to the court of civil appeals of alabamaNo. 92-1239. Argued November 2, 1993--Decided April 19, 1994At petitioner's paternity and child support trial, respondent State used9 of its 10 peremptory challenges to remove male jurors. The courtempaneled an all-female jury after rejecting petitioner's claim that thelogic and reasoning of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79--in which thisCourt held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits peremptory strikes based solely on race--extend to forbid gender-based peremptory challenges. The jury found petitioner tobe the father of the child in question and the trial court ordered him topay child support. The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed.Held: The Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender, or on the assumption that an individual willbe biased in a particular case solely because that person happens to bea woman or a man. Respondent's gender-based peremptory challengescannot survive the heightened equal protection scrutiny that this Courtaffords distinctions based on gender. Respondent's rationale--that itsdecision to strike virtually all males in this case may reasonably havebeen based on the perception, supported by history, that men otherwisetotally qualified to serve as jurors might be more sympathetic and receptive to the arguments of a man charged in a paternity action, whilewomen equally qualified might be more sympathetic and receptive tothe arguments of the child's mother--is virtually unsupported and isbased on the very stereotypes the law condemns. The conclusion thatlitigants may not strike potential jurors solely on the basis of genderdoes not imply the elimination of all peremptory challenges. So longas gender does not serve as a proxy for bias, unacceptable jurors maystill be removed, including those who are members of a group or classthat is normally subject to "rational basis" review and those who exhibitcharacteristics that are disproportionately associated with one gender.Pp. 131-146.606 So. 2d 156, reversed and remanded.Blackmun, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens,O'Connor, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.

Prendergast, Assistant Attorney General.*Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), this Court heldthat the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governs the exercise of peremptory challenges by aprosecutor in a criminal trial. The Court explained that although a defendant has "no right to a `petit jury composedin whole or in part of persons of his own race,' " id., at 85,quoting Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 305 (1880),the "defendant does have the right to be tried by a jurywhose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatorycriteria," 476 U. S., at 85-86. SinceBatson, we have reaf-firmed repeatedly our commitment to jury selection procedures that are fair and nondiscriminatory. We have recog-nized that whether the trial is criminal or civil, potentialjurors, as well as litigants, have an equal protection right tojury selection procedures that are free from state-sponsoredgroup stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prej-udice. SeePowers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991); Edmonsonv. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991); Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.

S. 127 (1994)Opinion of the Courtdefining the scope of Batson involved alleged racial discrimi-nation in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Today weare faced with the question whether the Equal ProtectionClause forbids intentional discrimination on the basis of gender, just as it prohibits discrimination on the basis of race.We hold that gender, like race, is an unconstitutional proxyfor juror competence and impartiality.IOn behalf of relator T. B., the mother of a minor child,respondent State of Alabama filed a complaint for paternityand child support against petitioner J. E. B. in the DistrictCourt of Jackson County, Alabama. On October 21, 1991,the matter was called for trial and jury selection began.The trial court assembled a panel of 36 potential jurors, 12males and 24 females. After the court excused three jurorsfor cause, only 10 of the remaining 33 jurors were male. TheState then used 9 of its 10 peremptory strikes to removemale jurors; petitioner used all but one of his strikes to remove female jurors. As a result, all the selected jurorswere female.Before the jury was empaneled, petitioner objected to theState's peremptory challenges on the ground that they wereexercised against male jurors solely on the basis of gender,in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. App. 22. Petitioner argued that the logic andreasoning of Batson v. Kentucky, which prohibits peremptory strikes solely on the basis of race, similarly forbids in-tentional discrimination on the basis of gender. The courtrejected petitioner's claim and empaneled the all-female jury.App. 23. The jury found petitioner to be the father of thechild, and the court entered an order directing him to paychild support. On postjudgment motion, the court reaffirmed its ruling that Batson does not extend to gender-based peremptory challenges. App. 33.

S. 127 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe Equal Protection Clause, particularly where, as here, thediscrimination serves to ratify and perpetuate invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes about the relative abilitiesof men and women.IIDiscrimination on the basis of gender in the exercise ofperemptory challenges is a relatively recent phenomenon.Gender-based peremptory strikes were hardly practicableduring most of our country's existence, since, until the 20thcentury, women were completely excluded from jury serv-ice.2 So well entrenched was this exclusion of women thatin 1880 this Court, while finding that the exclusion ofAfrican-American men from juries violated the FourteenthAmendment, expressed no doubt that a State "may confinethe selection [of jurors] to males." Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S., at 310; see also Fay v. New York, 332 U. S.261, 289-290 (1947).Many States continued to exclude women from jury serv-ice well into the present century, despite the fact that womenattained suffrage upon ratification of the Nineteenth Amend-ment in 1920.3 States that did permit women to serve onjuries often erected other barriers, such as registration re-quirements and automatic exemptions, designed to deterwomen from exercising their right to jury service. See, e. g.,2 There was one brief exception. Between 1870 and 1871, women werepermitted to serve on juries in Wyoming Territory. They were no longerallowed on juries after a new chief justice who disfavored the practice wasappointed in 1871. See Abrahamson, Justice and Juror, 20 Ga. L. Rev.257, 263-264 (1986).3 In 1947, women still had not been granted the right to serve on juriesin 16 States. See Rudolph, Women on Juries--Voluntary or Compulsory?,44 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 206 (1961). As late as 1961, three States, Alabama,Mississippi, and South Carolina, continued to exclude women from juryservice. See Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). Indeed, Alabamadid not recognize women as a "cognizable group" for jury-service purposesuntil after the 1966 decision in White v. Crook, 251 F. Supp. 401 (MD Ala.)(three-judge court).511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:02 PAGES OPINPGT132 J. E. B. v. ALABAMA ex rel. T. B.Opinion of the CourtFay v. New York, 332 U.

S. 57 (1961) (upholding affirmative registrationstatute that exempted women from mandatory jury service).The prohibition of women on juries was derived from theEnglish common law which, according to Blackstone, right-fully excluded women from juries under "the doctrine ofpropter defectum sexus, literally, the `defect of sex.' "United States v. De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433, 1438 (CA9 1992)(en banc), quoting 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *362.4 Inthis country, supporters of the exclusion of women from ju-ries tended to couch their objections in terms of the ostensible need to protect women from the ugliness and depravityof trials. Women were thought to be too fragile and virginalto withstand the polluted courtroom atmosphere. See Bailey v. State, 215 Ark. 53, 61, 219 S. W. 2d 424, 428 (1949)("Criminal court trials often involve testimony of the foulestkind, and they sometimes require consideration of indecentconduct, the use of filthy and loathsome words, references tointimate sex relationships, and other elements that wouldprove humiliating, embarrassing and degrading to a lady");In re Goodell, 39 Wis. 232, 245-246 (1875) (endorsing statu-tory ineligibility of women for admission to the bar because"[r]everence for all womanhood would suffer in the public4 In England there was at least one deviation from the general rule thatonly males could serve as jurors. If a woman was subject to capital punishment, or if a widow sought postponement of the disposition of her husband's estate until birth of a child, a writ de ventre inspiciendo permittedthe use of a jury of matrons to examine the woman to determine whethershe was pregnant. But even when a jury of matrons was used, the examination took place in the presence of 12 men, who also composed part ofthe jury in such cases. The jury of matrons was used in the United Statesduring the Colonial period, but apparently fell into disuse when the medical profession began to perform that function.

Man is, or should be, woman's protector and de-fender. The natural and proper timidity and delicacy whichbelongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of theoccupations of civil life. . . . The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices ofwife and mother. This is the law of the Creator"). Cf.Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 684 (1973) (pluralityopinion) (This "attitude of `romantic paternalism' . . . putwomen, not on a pedestal, but in a cage").This Court in Ballard v. United States, 329 U. S. 187(1946), first questioned the fundamental fairness of denyingwomen the right to serve on juries. Relying on its supervisory powers over the federal courts, it held that women maynot be excluded from the venire in federal trials in Stateswhere women were eligible for jury service under local law.In response to the argument that women have no superioror unique perspective, such that defendants are denied a fairtrial by virtue of their exclusion from jury panels, theCourt explained:"It is said . . . that an all male panel drawn from thevarious groups within a community will be as truly representative as if women were included. The thought isthat the factors which tend to influence the action ofwomen are the same as those which influence the actionof men--personality, background, economic status--andnot sex. Yet it is not enough to say that women whensitting as jurors neither act nor tend to act as a class.Men likewise do not act like a class. . . . The truth isthat the two sexes are not fungible; a community madeup exclusively of one is different from a community composed of both; the subtle interplay of influence one on511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT134 J.

Yet a flavor, a distinct quality is lostif either sex is excluded."Id., at 193-194 (footnotesomitted).Fifteen years later, however, the Court still was unwillingto translate its appreciation for the value of women's contribution to civic life into an enforceable right to equal treatment under state laws governing jury service. In Hoyt v.Florida, 368 U. S., at 61, the Court found it reasonable, "[d]espite the enlightened emancipation of women," to exemptwomen from mandatory jury service by statute, allowingwomen to serve on juries only if they volunteered to serve.The Court justified the differential exemption policy on theground that women, unlike men, occupied a unique position"as the center of home and family life." Id., at 62.In 1975, the Court finally repudiated the reasoning of Hoytand struck down, under the Sixth Amendment, an affirmative registration statute nearly identical to the one at issuein Hoyt. See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975).5We explained: "Restricting jury service to only specialgroups or excluding identifiable segments playing majorroles in the community cannot be squared with the constitutional concept of jury trial." Id., at 530. The diverse andrepresentative character of the jury must be maintained" `partly as assurance of a diffused impartiality and partlybecause sharing in the administration of justice is a phaseof civic responsibility.' " Id., at 530-531, quoting Thiel v.Southern Pacific Co., 328 U. S. 217, 227 (1946) (Frankfurter,5 Taylor distinguished Hoyt by explaining that that case "did not involvea defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from a fair crosssection of the community," 419 U. S., at 534. The Court now, however,has stated that Taylor "in effect" overruled Hoyt. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.

S. 357(1979).IIITaylor relied on Sixth Amendment principles, but theopinion's approach is consistent with the heightened equalprotection scrutiny afforded gender-based classifications.SinceReed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), this Court consist-ently has subjected gender-based classifications to heightened scrutiny in recognition of the real danger that govern-ment policies that professedly are based on reasonableconsiderations in fact may be reflective of "archaic and over-broad" generalizations about gender, seeSchlesinger v. Bal-lard, 419 U. S. 498, 506-507 (1975), or based on "outdatedmisconceptions concerning the role of females in the homerather than in the `marketplace and world of ideas.' " Craigv. Boren, 429 U.

Respondent suggests that "gender discrimination in this country . . .has never reached the level of discrimination" againstAfrican-Americans, and therefore gender discrimination,unlike racial discrimination, is tolerable in the courtroom.Brief for Respondent 9.While the prejudicial attitudes toward women in this country have not been identical to those held toward racial minor-ities, the similarities between the experiences of racial minorities and women, in some contexts, "overpower thosedifferences."

B.Opinion of the Court(1992). As a plurality of this Court observed in Frontierov.Richardson, 411 U. S., at 685:"[T]hroughout much of the 19th century the position ofwomen in our society was, in many respects, comparableto that of blacks under the pre-Civil War slave codes.Neither slaves nor women could hold office, serve onjuries, or bring suit in their own names, and marriedwomen traditionally were denied the legal capacity tohold or convey property or to serve as legal guardiansof their own children. . . . And although blacks wereguaranteed the right to vote in 1870, women weredenied even that right--which is itself `preservativeof other basic civil and political rights'--until adoptionof the Nineteenth Amendment half a century later."(Footnote omitted.)Certainly, with respect to jury service, African-Americansand women share a history of total exclusion, a history whichcame to an end for women many years after the embarrassingchapter in our history came to an end for African-Americans.We need not determine, however, whether women or racialminorities have suffered more at the hands of discriminatorystate actors during the decades of our Nation's history. Itis necessary only to acknowledge that "our Nation has had along and unfortunate history of sex discrimination," id., at684, a history which warrants the heightened scrutiny weafford all gender-based classifications today. Under ourequal protection jurisprudence, gender-based classificationsrequire "an exceedingly persuasive justification" in order tosurvive constitutional scrutiny. See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 273 (1979). See alsoMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724(1982); Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.

See Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724, n. 9; Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7, 13 (1975); Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510U. S. 17, 26, n. (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) ("[I]t remains an openquestion whether `classifications based on gender are inherently suspect' ")(citations omitted).7 Although peremptory challenges are valuable tools in jury trials, they"are not constitutionally protected fundamental rights; rather they are butone state-created means to the constitutional end of an impartial jury anda fair trial." Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57 (1992).8 Respondent argues that we should recognize a special state interest inthis case: the State's interest in establishing the paternity of a child bornout of wedlock. Respondent contends that this interest justifies the useof gender-based peremptory challenges, since illegitimate children arethemselves victims of historical discrimination and entitled to heightenedscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.What respondent fails to recognize is that the only legitimate interestit could possibly have in the exercise of its peremptory challenges is securing a fair and impartial jury. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,500 U. S. 614, 620 (1991) ("[The] sole purpose [of the peremptory challenge]is to permit litigants to assist the government in the selection of an impartial trier of fact"). This interest does not change with the parties or thecauses. The State's interest in every trial is to see that the proceedingsare carried out in a fair, impartial, and nondiscriminatory manner.511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT138 J. E. B. v.

Ohio, 499 U. S., at 410. Respondent's rationale,not unlike those regularly expressed for gender-basedstrikes, is reminiscent of the arguments advanced to justifythe total exclusion of women from juries.10 Respondent of9 Respondent cites one study in support of its quasi-empirical claim thatwomen and men may have different attitudes about certain issues justifying the use of gender as a proxy for bias. See R. Hastie, S. Penrod, &N. Pennington, Inside the Jury 140 (1983). The authors conclude: "Neither student nor citizen judgments for typical criminal case materials haverevealed differences between male and female verdict preferences. . . .The picture differs [only] for rape cases, where female jurors appear tobe somewhat more conviction-prone than male jurors." The majority ofstudies suggest that gender plays no identifiable role in jurors' attitudes.See, e. g., V. Hans & N. Vidmar, Judging the Jury 76 (1986) ("[I]n themajority of studies there are no significant differences in the way men andwomen perceive and react to trials; yet a few studies find women moredefense-oriented, while still others show women more favorable to theprosecutor"). Even in 1956, before women had a constitutional right toserve on juries, some commentators warned against using gender as aproxy for bias. See F. Busch, Law and Tactics in Jury Trials $ 143, p. 207(1949) ("In this age of general and specialized education, availed of generally by both men and women, it would appear unsound to base a peremptory challenge in any case upon the sole ground of sex . . .").10 A manual formerly used to instruct prosecutors in Dallas, Texas, provided the following advice: " `I don't like women jurors because I can'ttrust them. They do, however, make the best jurors in cases involvingcrimes against children. It is possible that their "women's intuition" canhelp you if you can't win your case with the facts.' " Alschuler, The Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and theReview of Jury Verdicts, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 153, 210 (1989).

S. 127 (1994)Opinion of the Courtfers virtually no support for the conclusion that gender aloneis an accurate predictor of juror's attitudes; yet it urges thisCourt to condone the same stereotypes that justified thewholesale exclusion of women from juries and the ballotbox.11 Respondent seems to assume that gross generalizations that would be deemed impermissible if made on theamount is to be proved by clearly demonstrated blackboard figures forexample, generally he would want a male juror.. . . . ."[But] women . . . are desired jurors when plaintiff is a man. A womanjuror may see a man impeached from the beginning of the case to the end,but there is at least the chance [with] the woman juror (particularly if theman happens to be handsome or appealing) [that] the plaintiff's derelictions in and out of court will be overlooked. A woman is inclined to forgive sin in the opposite sex; but definitely not her own." 3 M. Belli, Modern Trials $$ 51.67 and 51.68, pp. 446-447 (2d ed. 1982).11 Even if a measure of truth can be found in some of the gender stereotypes used to justify gender-based peremptory challenges, that fact alonecannot support discrimination on the basis of gender in jury selection.We have made abundantly clear in past cases that gender classificationsthat rest on impermissible stereotypes violate the Equal ProtectionClause, even when some statistical support can be conjured up for thegeneralization. See, e. g., Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 645(1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social Security Act classification authorizing benefits to widows but not to widowers despite the fact that thejustification for the differential treatment was "not entirely without empirical support"); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 201 (1976) (invalidating anOklahoma law that established different drinking ages for men andwomen, although the evidence supporting the age differential was "nottrivial in a statistical sense"). The generalization advanced by Alabamain support of its asserted right to discriminate on the basis of gender is,at the least, overbroad, and serves only to perpetuate the same "outmodednotions of the relative capabilities of men and women," Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 441 (1985), that we have invalidated in other contexts. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677(1973); Stanton v. Stanton, supra; Craig v. Boren, supra; MississippiUniv. for Women v. Hogan, supra. The Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted by decisions of this Court, acknowledges that a shred of truth maybe contained in some stereotypes, but requires that state actors look beyond the surface before making judgments about people that are likelyto stigmatize as well as to perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination.511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT140 J. E. B. v. ALABAMA ex rel. T. B.Opinion of the Courtbasis of race are somehow permissible when made on thebasis of gender.Discrimination in jury selection, whether based on race oron gender, causes harm to the litigants, the community, andthe individual jurors who are wrongfully excluded from participation in the judicial process. The litigants are harmedby the risk that the prejudice that motivated the discriminatory selection of the jury will infect the entire proceedings.See Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 628 (discrimination in the courtroom "raises serious questions as to the fairness of the proceedings conducted there"). The community is harmed bythe State's participation in the perpetuation of invidiousgroup stereotypes and the inevitable loss of confidence in ourjudicial system that state-sanctioned discrimination in thecourtroom engenders.When state actors exercise peremptory challenges in reliance on gender stereotypes, they ratify and reinforce prejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and women. Because these stereotypes have wreaked injustice in so manyother spheres of our country's public life, active discrimination by litigants on the basis of gender during jury selection"invites cynicism respecting the jury's neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law." Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S., at412. The potential for cynicism is particularly acute in caseswhere gender-related issues are prominent, such as cases involving rape, sexual harassment, or paternity. Discriminatory use of peremptory challenges may create the impressionthat the judicial system has acquiesced in suppressing fullparticipation by one gender or that the "deck has beenstacked" in favor of one side. See id., at 413 ("The verdictwill not be accepted or understood [as fair] if the jury is chosen by unlawful means at the outset").In recent cases we have emphasized that individual jurorsthemselves have a right to nondiscriminatory jury selection511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT141Cite as: 511 U.

Contrary to respondent's suggestion, this right extends to both men andwomen. SeeMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458U. S, at 723 (that a state practice "discriminates againstmales rather than against females does not exempt it fromscrutiny or reduce the standard of review"); cf. Brief for Respondent 9 (arguing that men deserve no protection fromgender discrimination in jury selection because they are notvictims of historical discrimination). All persons, whengranted the opportunity to serve on a jury, have the rightnot to be excluded summarily because of discriminatory andstereotypical presumptions that reflect and reinforce pat12 Given our recent precedent, the doctrinal basis for Justice Scalia'sdissenting opinion is a mystery. Justice Scalia points out that the discrimination at issue in this case was directed at men, rather than women,but then acknowledges that the Equal Protection Clause protects bothmen and women from intentional discrimination on the basis of gender.See post, at 157, citing Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.,at 723-724. He also appears cognizant of the fact that classificationsbased on gender must be more than merely rational, see post, at 160-161;they must be supported by an "exceedingly persuasive justification,"Hogan, 458 U. S., at 724. Justice Scalia further admits that the EqualProtection Clause, as interpreted by decisions of this Court, governs theexercise of peremptory challenges in every trial, and that potential jurors,as well as litigants, have an equal protection right to nondiscriminatoryjury selection procedures. See post, at 158-160, citing Batson, Powers,Edmonson, and McCollum. Justice Scalia does not suggest that weoverrule these cases, nor does he attempt to distinguish them. He intimates that discrimination on the basis of gender in jury selection may berational, see post, at 157, but offers no "exceedingly persuasive justification" for it. Indeed, Justice Scalia fails to advance any justification forhis apparent belief that the Equal Protection Clause, while prohibitingdiscrimination on the basis of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges, allows discrimination on the basis of gender. His dissenting opinion thus serves as a tacit admission that, short of overruling a decade ofcases interpreting the Equal Protection Clause, the result we reach todayis doctrinally compelled.511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT142 J. E. B. v. ALABAMA ex rel. T. B.Opinion of the Courtterns of historical discrimination.13 Striking individualjurors on the assumption that they hold particular viewssimply because of their gender is "practically a brand uponthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority."Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S., at 308. It denigratesthe dignity of the excluded juror, and, for a woman, reinvokes a history of exclusion from political participation.14The message it sends to all those in the courtroom, and allthose who may later learn of the discriminatory act, is thatcertain individuals, for no reason other than gender, are presumed unqualified by state actors to decide important ques-tions upon which reasonable persons could disagree.1513 It is irrelevant that women, unlike African-Americans, are not a numerical minority and therefore are likely to remain on the jury if each sideuses its peremptory challenges in an equally discriminatory fashion. Cf.United States v. Broussard, 987 F. 2d, at 220 (declining to extend Batsonto gender; noting that "[w]omen are not a numerical minority," and therefore are likely to be represented on juries despite the discriminatory useof peremptory challenges). Because the right to nondiscriminatory juryselection procedures belongs to the potential jurors, as well as to the litigants, the possibility that members of both genders will get on the jurydespite the intentional discrimination is beside the point. The exclusionof even one juror for impermissible reasons harms that juror and undermines public confidence in the fairness of the system.14 The popular refrain is that all peremptory challenges are based onstereotypes of some kind, expressing various intuitive and frequently erroneous biases. See post, at 161. But where peremptory challenges aremade on the basis of group characteristics other than race or gender (likeoccupation, for example), they do not reinforce the same stereotypes aboutthe group's competence or predispositions that have been used to preventthem from voting, participating on juries, pursuing their chosen professions, or otherwise contributing to civic life. See Babcock, A Place in thePalladium, Women's Rights and Jury Service, 61 U. Cinn. L. Rev. 1139,1173 (1993).15 Justice Scalia argues that there is no "discrimination and dishonor"in being subject to a race- or gender-based peremptory strike. Post, at160. Justice Scalia's argument has been rejected many times, see, e. g.,Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991), and we reject it once again. Theonly support Justice Scalia offers for his conclusion is the fact that raceand gender-based peremptory challenges have a long history in this coun511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT143Cite as: 511 U. S. 127 (1994)Opinion of the CourtIVOur conclusion that litigants may not strike potential ju-rors solely on the basis of gender does not imply the elimination of all peremptory challenges. Neither does it conflictwith a State's legitimate interest in using such challenges inits effort to secure a fair and impartial jury. Parties stillmay remove jurors who they feel might be less acceptablethan others on the panel; gender simply may not serve as aproxy for bias. Parties may also exercise their peremptorychallenges to remove from the venire any group or class ofindividuals normally subject to "rational basis" review. SeeCleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S., at 439-442; Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988). Even strikesbased on characteristics that are disproportionately associ-ated with one gender could be appropriate, absent a showingof pretext.16If conducted properly, voir dire can inform litigants aboutpotential jurors, making reliance upon stereotypical and pej-orative notions about a particular gender or race both unnecessary and unwise. Voir dire provides a means of discover-ing actual or implied bias and a firmer basis upon which thetry. Post, at 159 (discriminatory peremptory challenges have "coexistedwith the Equal Protection Clause for 120 years"); post, at 160 (there wasa "106-year interlude between our holding that exclusion from juries onthe basis of race was unconstitutional, [Strauder], and our holding thatperemptory challenges on the basis of race were unconstitutional, [Batson]"). We do not dispute that this Court long has tolerated the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, but this is not a reason to continueto do so. Many of "our people's traditions," see post, at 163, such as dejure segregation and the total exclusion of women from juries, are nowunconstitutional even though they once coexisted with the Equal Protection Clause.16 For example, challenging all persons who have had military experience would disproportionately affect men at this time, while challengingall persons employed as nurses would disproportionately affect women.Without a showing of pretext, however, these challenges may well not beunconstitutional, since they are not gender or race based. See Hernandezv. New York, 500 U. S. 352 (1991).511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT144 J. E. B. v. ALABAMA ex rel. T. B.Opinion of the Courtparties may exercise their peremptory challenges intelli-gently. See, e. g., Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.

Witt, 718 F. 2d 1494,1497 (CA10 1983) ("Without an adequate foundation [laid byvoir dire], counsel cannot exercise sensitive and intelligentperemptory challenges").The experience in the many jurisdictions that have barredgender-based challenges belies the claim that litigants andtrial courts are incapable of complying with a rule barringstrikes based on gender. See n. 1,supra (citing state andfederal jurisdictions that have extended Batson to gender).17As with race-based Batson claims, a party alleging genderdiscrimination must make a prima facie showing of inten17 Respondent argues that Alabama's method of jury selection wouldmake the extension of Batson to gender particularly burdensome. In Alabama, the "struck-jury" system is employed, a system which requireslitigants to strike alternately until 12 persons remain, who then constitutethe jury. See Ala. Rule Civ. Proc. 47 (1990). Respondent suggests that,in some cases at least, it is necessary under this system to continue striking persons from the venire after the litigants no longer have an articulable reason for doing so. As a result, respondent contends, some litigantsmay be unable to come up with gender-neutral explanations for theirstrikes.We find it worthy of note that Alabama has managed to maintain itsstruck-jury system even after the ruling in Batson, despite the fact thatthere are counties in Alabama that are predominately African-American.In those counties, it presumably would be as difficult to come up withrace-neutral explanations for peremptory strikes as it would be to advancegender-neutral explanations. No doubt the voir dire process aids litigantsin their ability to articulate race-neutral explanations for their peremptorychallenges. The same should be true for gender. Regardless, a State'schoice of jury-selection methods cannot insulate it from the stricturesof the Equal Protection Clause. Alabama is free to adopt whateverjury-selection procedures it chooses so long as they do not violate theConstitution.511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT145Cite as: 511 U.

New York, 500 U. S. 352 (1991).Failing to provide jurors the same protection against gender discrimination as race discrimination could frustrate thepurpose ofBatson itself. Because gender and race are over-lapping categories, gender can be used as a pretext for racialdiscrimination.18 Allowing parties to remove racial minori-ties from the jury not because of their race, but because oftheir gender, contravenes well-established equal protectionprinciples and could insulate effectively racial discriminationfrom judicial scrutiny. VEqual opportunity to participate in the fair administrationof justice is fundamental to our democratic system.19 It not18 The temptation to use gender as a pretext for racial discriminationmay explain why the majority of the lower court decisions extending Batson to gender involve the use of peremptory challenges to remove minority women. All four of the gender-based peremptory cases to reach theFederal Courts of Appeals and cited in n. 1, supra, involved the strikingof minority women.19 This Court almost a half century ago stated:"The American tradition of trial by jury, considered in connection witheither criminal or civil proceedings, necessarily contemplates an impartialjury drawn from a cross-section of the community. . . . This does not mean,of course, that every jury must contain representatives of all the economic,social, religious, racial, political and geographical groups of the community;frequently such complete representation would be impossible. But it doesmean that prospective jurors shall be selected by court officials withoutsystematic and intentional exclusion of any of these groups. Recognitionmust be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service are to befound in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individualrather than a group or class matter.

It reaffirms thepromise of equality under the law--that all citizens, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, have the chance to take partdirectly in our democracy. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.

Whenpersons are excluded from participation in our democraticprocesses solely because of race or gender, this promise ofequality dims, and the integrity of our judicial system isjeopardized.In view of these concerns, the Equal Protection Clauseprohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gen-der, or on the assumption that an individual will be biasedin a particular case for no reason other than the fact that theperson happens to be a woman or happens to be a man. Aswith race, the "core guarantee of equal protection, ensuringcitizens that their State will not discriminate . . . , would bemeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors onthe basis of such assumptions, which arise solely from thejurors' [gender]."
