A defendant convicted of a federal crime has a right under18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b) to receive credit for certain time spentin official detention before his sentence begins. In this case,we must decide whether the District Court calculates thecredit at the time of sentencing or whether the AttorneyGeneral computes it after the defendant has begun to servehis sentence.503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT331Cite as: 503 U. S. 329 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIIn the summer and early fall of 1988, respondent RichardWilson committed several crimes in Putnam County, Tennessee. The precise details of these crimes do not concern ushere. It suffices to state that Tennessee authorities arrested Wilson on October 5, 1988, and held him in jail pending the outcome of federal and state prosecutions. Aftercertain preliminary proceedings, Wilson eventually pleadedguilty to various federal and state criminal charges.On November 29, 1989, the United States District Courtfor the Middle District of Tennessee sentenced Wilson to 96months' imprisonment for violation of the Hobbs Act, 18U. S. C. $ 1951. The District Court denied Wilson's requestfor credit for time served during his presentence state custody. On December 12, 1989, a Tennessee trial court sentenced Wilson to several years' imprisonment for robberyand two other felonies. In contrast to the District Court,the state court granted Wilson 429 days of credit towardhis state sentence. Later that day, Tennessee authoritiestransferred Wilson to federal custody, and he began servinghis federal sentence.Wilson appealed the District Court's refusal to give himcredit for the time that he had spent in state custody. Reversing the District Court, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit held that Wilson had a right to creditand that the District Court should have awarded it to him.916 F. 2d 1115 (1990). We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 807(1991), and now reverse.IIThe Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons(BOP), has responsibility for imprisoning federal offenders.See 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(a). From 1966 until 1987, a provisioncodified at 18 U. S. C. $ 3568 (1982 ed.) required the AttorneyGeneral to award federal prisoners credit for certain time503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT332 UNITED STATES v. WILSONOpinion of the Courtspent in jail prior to the commencement of their sentences.This provision, in part, stated:"The Attorney General shall give any such personcredit toward service of his sentence for any days spentin custody in connection with the offense or acts forwhich sentence was imposed." Pub. L. 89-465, $ 4, 80Stat. 217 (emphasis added).The Attorney General implemented this provision by com-puting the amount of credit after taking custody of the sentenced federal offender. Although the federal courts couldreview the Attorney General's determination, the sentencingcourt did not participate in computation of the credit. See,e. g., United States v. Morgan, 425 F. 2d 1388, 1389-1390(CA5 1970).In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. $ 3551et seq., which became effective in 1987, Congress rewrote$ 3568 and recodified it at $ 3585(b). Unlike its predecessor,$ 3585(b) does not mention the Attorney General. Writtenin the passive voice, it states:"A defendant shall be given credit toward the serviceof a term of imprisonment for any time he has spentin official detention prior to the date the sentencecommences--"(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentencewas imposed; or"(2) as a result of any other charge for which the de-fendant was arrested after the commission of the offensefor which the sentence was imposed;"that has not been credited against another sentence."18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b) (emphasis added).In describing the defendant's right to receive jail-timecredit in this manner, the provision has created doubt aboutwhether district courts now may award credit when impos-ing a sentence. The question has significance in this case503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT333Cite as: 503 U. S. 329 (1992)Opinion of the Courtbecause the final clause of $ 3585(b) allows a defendant toreceive credit only for detention time "that has not beencredited against another sentence." When the DistrictCourt imposed Wilson's 96-month sentence on November 29,1989, Wilson had not yet received credit for his detentiontime from the Tennessee courts. However, by the time theAttorney General imprisoned Wilson on December 12, 1989,the Tennessee trial court had awarded Wilson 429 days ofcredit. As a result, Wilson could receive a larger credit ifthe statute permitted crediting at sentencing, and thus before the detention time had been credited against anothersentence.The United States argues that it is the Attorney Generalwho computes the amount of the credit after the defendantbegins his sentence and that the Court of Appeals erred inordering the District Court to award credit to Wilson. Wilson counters that $ 3585(b) authorizes the District Court tocompute the amount of the credit at sentencing. We agreewith the United States. AWe do not accept Wilson's argument that $ 3585(b) author-izes a district court to award credit at sentencing. Section3585(b) indicates that a defendant may receive credit againsta sentence that "was imposed." It also specifies that theamount of the credit depends on the time that the defendant"has spent" in official detention "prior to the date the sen-tence commences." Congress' use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes. See, e. g., Otte v. United States,419 U. S. 43, 49-50 (1974); Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 63-64, n. 4(1987). By using these verbs in the past and present perfecttenses, Congress has indicated that computation of the creditmust occur after the defendant begins his sentence. A district court, therefore, cannot apply $ 3585(b) at sentencing.Federal defendants do not always begin to serve their sentences immediately. In this case, the District Court sen503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT334 UNITED STATES v. WILSONOpinion of the Courttenced Wilson on November 29, 1989, but Wilson did notbegin his sentence until December 12, 1989. At sentencing,the District Court only could have speculated about theamount of time that Wilson would spend in detention priorto the commencement of his sentence; the court did not knowwhen the state-court proceedings would end or when the federal authorities would take Wilson into custody. Because$ 3585(b) bases the credit on how much time a defendant "hasspent" (not "will have spent") prior to beginning his sen-tence, the District Court could not compute the amount ofthe credit at sentencing.The final phrase of $ 3585(b) confirms this interpretation.As noted above, it authorizes credit only for time that "hasnot been credited against another sentence." Wilson arguesthat this phrase does not prevent him from receiving creditbecause his official detention "ha[d] not been credited"against the state sentence when the District Court imposedthe federal sentence. Under this logic, however, if the District Court had sentenced Wilson a few weeks later than itdid, he would not have received credit under $ 3585(b). Thisinterpretation of the statute would make the award of creditarbitrary, a result not to be presumed lightly. SeeUnitedStates v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 580 (1981) (absurd resultsare to be avoided). We can imagine no reason why Congresswould desire the presentence detention credit, which determines how much time an offender spends in prison, to dependon the timing of his sentencing. For these reasons, we conclude that $ 3585(b) does not authorize a district court tocompute the credit at sentencing.BWe agree with the United States that the Attorney Gen-eral must continue to compute the credit under $ 3585(b) ashe did under the former $ 3568. When Congress writes astatute in the passive voice, it often fails to indicate whomust take a required action. This silence can make the503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT335Cite as: 503 U. S. 329 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmeaning of a statute somewhat difficult to ascertain. See,e. g., E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112,128 (1977); Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441U. S. 91, 102-103 (1979). Yet, even though $ 3585(b) nolonger mentions the Attorney General, we do not see howhe can avoid determining the amount of a defendant's jail-time credit.After a district court sentences a federal offender, the At-torney General, through BOP, has the responsibility for administering the sentence. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(a) ("A per-son who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment . . .shall be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisonsuntil the expiration of the term imposed"). To fulfill thisduty, BOP must know how much of the sentence the offenderhas left to serve. Because the offender has a right to certain jail-time credit under $ 3585(b), and because the districtcourt cannot determine the amount of the credit at sentencing, the Attorney General has no choice but to make the determination as an administrative matter when imprisoningthe defendant.Crediting jail time against federal sentences long has operated in this manner. After Congress enacted $ 3568 in 1966,BOP developed detailed procedures and guidelines for determining the credit available to prisoners. See Federal PrisonSystem Program Statement No. 5880.24 (Sept. 5, 1979) andFederal Bureau of Prisons Operations Memorandum No.EMS DM 154-89 (Oct. 23, 1989), Apps. B and C to Brief forUnited States (stating BOP's procedures for computing jailtime credit determinations); see also United States v. Lucas,898 F. 2d 1554 (CA11 1990). Federal regulations have afforded prisoners administrative review of the computation oftheir credits, see 28 CFR $$ 542.10-542.16 (1990); Lucas,supra, at 1556, and prisoners have been able to seek judicialreview of these computations after exhausting their administrative remedies, see United States v. Bayless, 940 F. 2d 300,304-305 (CA8 1991); United States v. Flanagan, 868 F. 2d503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT336 UNITED STATES v. WILSONOpinion of the Court1544, 1546 (CA11 1989); United States v. Martinez, 837 F. 2d861, 865-866 (CA9 1988). Congress' conversion of an activesentence in $ 3568 into a passive sentence in $ 3585(b) strikesus as a rather slim ground for presuming an intention tochange these well-established procedures. "It is not lightlyto be assumed that Congress intended to depart from a longestablished policy." Robertson v. Railroad Labor Bd., 268U. S. 619, 627 (1925).CWilson argues that our conclusion conflicts with the familiar maxim that, when Congress alters the words of a statute,it must intend to change the statute's meaning. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23-24 (1983). He assertsthat, by removing the explicit reference to the Attorney General when it enacted $ 3585(b), Congress expressed a desireto remove the Attorney General from the process of computing sentences. Otherwise, Wilson contends, Congresswould have had no reason to modify the provision as it did.We have no difficulty with the general presumption thatCongress contemplates a change whenever it amends a statute. In this case, however, we find that presumption overcome by our conclusions that the District Court cannot perform the necessary calculation at the time of sentencing andthat the Attorney General, in implementing the defendant'ssentence, cannot avoid computing the credit.We candidly acknowledge that we do not know what happened to the reference to the Attorney General during therevision. We do know that Congress entirely rewrote $ 3568when it changed it to its present form in $ 3585(b). It rearranged its clauses, rephrased its central idea in the passivevoice, and more than doubled its length. In view of thesechanges, and because any other interpretation would requireus to stretch the meaning of the words that $ 3585(b) nowincludes, we think it likely that the former reference to theAttorney General was simply lost in the shuffle.503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT337Cite as: 503 U. S. 329 (1992)Stevens, J., dissentingOur interpretation of $ 3585(b), however, does not renderthe 1987 revision meaningless. Congress altered $ 3568 inat least three ways when it enacted $ 3585(b). First, Congress replaced the term "custody" with the term "officialdetention." Second, Congress made clear that a defendantcould not receive a double credit for his detention time.Third, Congress enlarged the class of defendants eligible toreceive credit. Under the old law, a defendant could receivecredit only for time spent in custody in connection with "theoffense . . . for which sentence was imposed." Under thenew law, a defendant may receive credit both for this timeand for time spent in official detention in connection with"any other charge for which the defendant was arrested afterthe commission of the offense for which the sentence wasimposed." In light of these revisions, and for the foregoingreasons, we conclude that the Attorney General may continue to compute the amount of the credit. The judgmentof the Court of Appeals is
