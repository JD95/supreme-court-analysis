EDWARDSOpinion of the Court"assistance unit" all needy children who live in the samehousehold under the care of one relative. Such groupingallows States to grant equal assistance to equally sizedneedy households, regardless of whether the children in thehousehold are all siblings. The Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit concluded that federal law forbids States toequalize assistance in this manner. We disagree and accord-ingly reverse.IAFDC is a joint federal-state public assistance programauthorized by Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, 49 Stat.627, 42 U. S. C. $ 601 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). As itsname indicates, the AFDC program "is designed to providefinancial assistance to needy dependent children and the par-ents or relatives who live with and care for them." Shea v.Vialpando, 416 U. S. 251, 253 (1974). The program "reim-burses each State which chooses to participate with a percentage of the funds it expends," so long as the State "admin-ister[s] its assistance program pursuant to a state plan thatconforms to applicable federal statutes and regulations."Heckler v. Turner, 470 U. S. 184, 189 (1985) (citing 42 U. S. C.$$ 602, 603).One applicable federal rule requires state plans to providethat all members of a nuclear family who live in the samehousehold must apply for AFDC assistance if any one ofthem applies; in addition, the income of all of these applicantsmust be aggregated in determining their eligibility andthe amount of their monthly benefits. See 42 U. S. C.$ 602(a)(38) (1988 ed., Supp. V); 45 CFR $ 206.10(a)(1)(vii)(1993). See generallyBowen v. Gilliard, 483 U. S. 587(1987) (upholding rule against constitutional challenges).This "family filing unit rule" requires that all cohabiting nu-clear family members be grouped into a single AFDC "assistance unit" (AU), defined by federal law as "the group of indi-viduals whose income, resources and needs are considered asa unit for purposes of determining eligibility and the amount514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT147Cite as: 514 U. S. 143 (1995)Opinion of the Courtof payment." 45 CFR $ 206.10(b)(5) (1993). The regulationat issue in this case--California's "non-sibling filing unitrule" (California Rule)--goes even further in this regard.It provides: "Two or more AUs in the same home shallbe combined into one AU when . . . [t]here is only one [adult]caretaker relative." Cal. Dept. of Social Servs., Manual ofPolicies & Procedures $ 82-824.1.13, App. to Pet. for Cert.52. In other words, the California Rule groups into a singleAU all needy children who live in the same household,whether or not they are siblings, if there is only one adultcaring for all of them.The consolidation of two or more AU's into a single AUpursuant to the California Rule results in a decrease in themaximum per capita AFDC benefits for which the affectedindividuals are eligible. This occurs because, while California (like many States) increases the amount of assistancefor each additional person added to an AU, the increase isnot proportional. Thus, as the number of persons in theAU increases, the per capita payment to the AU decreases.11 Between July 1, 1989, and August 31, 1991, California adhered to thefollowing schedule of maximum monthly AFDC payments:Number of Maximum aid Per capitapersons in AU payment payment1 $ 341 $341.002 560 280.003 694 231.334 824 206.005 940 188.006 1,057 176.177 1,160 165.718 1,265 158.139 1,366 151.7810 or more 1,468 146.80Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Plaintiffs'Motion for Summary Judgment in No. CV-S 91 1473 (ED Cal.), p. 7 (Feb.13, 1992).

EDWARDSOpinion of the CourtSee, e. g., Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 473-474(1970) (sustaining a Maryland AFDC regulation under which"the standard of need increases with each additional personin the household, but the increments become proportionately smaller").The situation of respondent Verna Edwards and her rela-tives illustrates the operation of these two rules. Initially,Mrs. Edwards received AFDC assistance on behalf of hergranddaughter, for whom she is the sole caretaker.2 As aone-person AU, the granddaughter was eligible to receive a"maximum aid payment" of $341 per month prior to September 1991. See n. 1, supra. Later, Mrs. Edwards began car-ing for her two grandnieces, who are siblings. Pursuant tothe federal family filing unit rule, the grandnieces aregrouped together in a two-person AU, which was eligible toreceive $560 per month in benefits prior to September 1991.See ibid. Because none of these children received any outside income, Mrs. Edwards received $901 per month inAFDC assistance on behalf of the three girls. In June 1991,however, Mrs. Edwards received notice that pursuant to theCalifornia Rule, her granddaughter and two grandnieceswould be grouped together into a single three-person AU,which was eligible to receive only $694 per month. See ibid.The California Rule thus reduced AFDC payments to theEdwards household by $207 per month.On behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, Mrs.Edwards, her three relatives, and other respondents broughtthis action against petitioners, the state officials chargedwith administering California's AFDC program, in the DisCal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann. $ 11450(a)(1) (West Supp. 1994), as modifiedby $$ 11450.01(a), (b) and 11450.015(a).2 Mrs. Edwards does not receive AFDC assistance for herself. As explained in the text, the family filing unit rule requires parents to apply forassistance along with their children. But apart from this rule, caretakerrelatives need not apply for assistance along with the needy children forwhom they care, although they may do so.514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT149Cite as: 514 U.

C. $ 1983, respondents sought adeclaration that the California Rule violates federal law andan injunction prohibiting petitioners from enforcing it. Oncross-motions for summary judgment, the District Courtgranted the requested relief. It found the California Ruleindistinguishable in relevant respects from the Washingtonregulation invalidated inBeaton v. Thompson, 913 F. 2d 701(CA9 1990).In a brief opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit affirmed. It found the California Rule "virtually identical" to the Washington regulation that Beaton had held tobe "inconsistent with federal law and regulation."Edwardsv. Healy, 12 F. 3d 154, 155 (1993). Since the Court of Appeals issued its decision, the Department of Health andHuman Services (HHS)--which administers the AFDC program on the federal level--determined that its own AFDCregulations "do not conflict with the State policy option toconsolidate assistance units in the same household."

EDWARDSOpinion of the Court(1993).4 See Beaton, supra, at 704. Respondents rely principally on these three regulations in their submission here.As we examine the regulations, we keep in mind that inAFDC cases, "the starting point of the . . . analysis must bea recognition that . . . federal law gives each State greatlatitude in dispensing its available funds." Dandridge,supra, at 478. Accord, Shea, 416 U. S., at 253 (States "aregiven broad discretion in determining both the standard ofneed and the level of benefits"). In light of this cardinal4 Section 233.20(a)(2)(viii) provides:"[T]he money amount of any need item included in the standard will notbe prorated or otherwise reduced solely because of the presence in thehousehold of a non-legally responsible individual; and the [state] agencywill not assume any contribution from such individual for the support ofthe assistance unit . . . ."Section 233.20(a)(3)(ii) provides in part:"[I]n determining need and the amount of the assistance payment, . . . :. . . . ."(D) Income . . . and resources available for current use shall be considered. To the extent not inconsistent with any other provision of thischapter, income and resources are considered available both when actuallyavailable and when the applicant or recipient has a legal interest in aliquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available forsupport and maintenance."Section 233.90(a)(1) provides:"The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, orphysical or mental incapacity of a parent, or (if the State plan includessuch cases) the unemployment of his or her parent who is the principalearner will be made only in relation to the child's natural or adoptiveparent, or in relation to the child's stepparent who is married, under Statelaw, to the child's natural or [adoptive] parent and is legally obligated tosupport the child under State law of general applicability which requiresstepparents to support stepchildren to the same extent that natural oradoptive parents are required to support their children. Under this requirement, the inclusion in the family, or the presence in the home, of a`substitute parent' or `man-in-the-house' or any individual other than onedescribed in this paragraph is not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming the availability of income by the State . . . ."514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT151Cite as: 514 U. S. 143 (1995)Opinion of the Courtprinciple, we conclude that the federal regulations do notpreclude the adoption of the California Rule.AAccording to $ 233.20(a)(2)(viii), States may not reduce theamount of assistance for which AFDC applicants are eligible"solely because of the presence in the household of a non-legally responsible individual." Using the example of Mrs.Edwards and her relatives, respondents observe that, al-though the granddaughter received AFDC benefits of $341per month before the two grandnieces came to live in Mrs.Edwards' household, she received only one-third of $694, or$231.33, per month after the grandnieces arrived and theCalifornia Rule took effect. See Brief for Respondents 6,22. This reduction in the granddaughter's per capita bene-fits occurred, according to respondents, "solely because of thepresence in the household of " the grandnieces, who are"non-legally responsible individual[s]" in relation to thegranddaughter.Respondents are simply wrong. It was not solely thepresence of the grandnieces that triggered the decline in percapita benefits paid to the granddaughter; rather, it was thegrandnieces' presence plus their application for AFDC as-sistance through Mrs. Edwards. Had the two grandnieces,after coming to live in Mrs. Edwards' home, either not ap-plied for assistance or applied through a different caretakerrelative living in that home, the California Rule would nothave affected the granddaughter's benefits at all.55 Although needy children will receive less in per capita benefits underthe California Rule, this reduction affects only children who share a household. California is simply recognizing the economies of scale that inherein such living arrangements. See, e. g., Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U. S. 587,599 (1987) (crediting " `the common sense proposition that individuals living with others usually have reduced per capita costs because many oftheir expenses are shared' " (quoting Termini v. Califano, 611 F. 2d 367,370 (CA2 1979))).514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT152 ANDERSON v. EDWARDSOpinion of the CourtBRespondents also argue that the California Rule violatesthe "availability" principle, which is implemented, in oneform or another, by all three federal regulations. Section233.90(a)(1) provides that "the inclusion in the family, or thepresence in the home, of a `substitute parent' or `man-in-the-house' or any individual other than [the child's parent] is notan acceptable basis for . . . assuming the availability of in-come" to a needy child. Likewise, $ 233.20(a)(2)(viii) provides that States may "not assume any contribution from[a nonlegally responsible] individual for the support of theassistance unit." Finally, $ 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D) provides gen-erally that States shall, "in determining need and the amountof the assistance payment," count only "[i]ncome . . . andresources available for current use"; the regulation adds that"income and resources are considered available both whenactually available and when [legally available]."According to respondents, the California Rule assumesthat income from relatives is contributed to, or otherwiseavailable to, a needy child without a determination that it isactually available. If Mrs. Edwards' granddaughter were tobegin receiving $75 per month in outside income, for exam-ple, the AU of which she is a part would receive $75 less inmonthly AFDC benefits, and the two grandnieces would eachaccordingly receive $25 less in per capita monthly benefits.Thus, the California Rule assertedly "assumes," in violationof all three federal regulations, that the granddaughter willcontribute $25 per month of her outside income to eachgrandniece and also that such income will therefore be available to each grandniece--without a case-specific determina-tion that such contribution will in fact occur.Respondents' argument fails for at least two reasons.First, its premise is questionable. Although in this example,the grandnieces each will nominally receive $25 less in percapita monthly benefits, they willactually receive less inbenefits only if one assumes that Mrs. Edwards will expend514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT153Cite as: 514 U. S. 143 (1995)Opinion of the Courtan equal amount of AFDC assistance on each of the threechildren--without regard to any other relevant circumstances, such as whether one of them receives outside in-come. Not only would such assumption fail to reflect reality,see, e. g., Gilliard, 483 U. S., at 600, n. 14, it would also beinconsistent with the duty imposed on caretakers by federallaw to spend AFDC payments "in the best interests of thechild[ren]" for whom they care, 42 U. S. C. $ 605, a duty spe-cifically implemented by California law, see,e. g., Cal. Welf. &Inst. Code Ann. $$ 11005.5, 11480 (West 1991). Thus, Cali-fornia may rationally assume that a caretaker will observeher duties to all the members of the AU and will take intoaccount the receipt of any outside income by one child whenexpending funds on behalf of the AU.Second, respondents' argument misperceives the operationof the California Rule. In the foregoing example, Californiawould simply add the monthly income of all members of theAU--$75 (granddaughter) plus $0 (first grandniece) plus $0(second grandniece) for a total of $75--and reduce themonthly assistance payment to the Edwards family AU accordingly. It should be clear from this example that themonthly payment to the AU is reduced not because the California Rule "assumes" that any income is available to thegrandnieces, but because it places the two grandnieces intothe same AU as the granddaughter (whose income is actuallyavailable to herself). What respondents are really attacking is the rule that the income of all members of the AU iscombined in order to determine the amount of the assistancepayment to the AU. This attack ignores the very definitionof an AU: the group of individuals whose income and resources are considered "as a unit" for purposes of determining the amount of the assistance payment. 45 CFR$ 206.10(b)(5) (1993). Accord, Brief for Respondents 4 ("Allof the income and resources of everyone in the assistanceunit are taken into consideration in establishing the benefitpayment").514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT154 ANDERSON v. EDWARDSOpinion of the CourtPerhaps respondents are arguing that the regulations simply forbid California to combine the incomes of all needy children in a household--whether by grouping them into thesame AU or otherwise. But whatever are the limits thatfederal law imposes on States' authority in this regard, thecombination of incomes effected by the California Rule isauthorized by the AFDC statute itself, which provides thata state agency "shall, in determining need, take into consideration any . . . income and resources of any child or relative claiming [AFDC assistance]." 42 U. S. C. $ 602(a)(7)(A)(1988 ed. and Supp. V). In light of the "great latitude,"Dandridge, 397 U. S., at 478, and the "broad discretion,"Shea, 416 U. S., at 253, that States have in administeringtheir AFDC programs, this statute is reasonably construedto allow States, in determining a child's need (and thereforehow much assistance she will receive), to take into consideration the income and resources of all cohabiting children andrelatives also claiming AFDC assistance.The availability regulations are addressed to an entirelydifferent problem, namely, the counting of income and resources controlled by persons outside the AU for the purposeof determining the amount of assistance to be provided tothe AU. The regulations were adopted to implement ourdecisions in three AFDC cases. See 42 Fed. Reg. 6583-6584(1977) (citing King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309 (1968); Lewis v.Martin, 397 U. S. 552 (1970); Van Lare v. Hurley, 421 U. S.338 (1975)). In all three cases, the State had counted asavailable to the AU income that was not actually or legallyavailable because it was controlled by a person who was nota member of the AU and who was not applying for AFDCassistance. See King, supra, at 311 (a " `substitute father,' "defined as any able-bodied man who cohabited with themother of the needy children in or outside her home); Lewis,supra, at 554 ("an adult male person assuming the role ofspouse to the mother," such as a common-law husband, or a514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT155Cite as: 514 U. S. 143 (1995)Opinion of the Courtnonadopting stepfather not legally obligated to support thechildren); Van Lare, supra, at 339, 340 (a "nonpayinglodge[r]," who was "a person not a recipient of AFDC"). Ac-cord, Bray v. Dowling, 25 F. 3d 135, 144 (CA2 1994) (thefederal availability regulations "were established to addressspecific concerns regarding the imputation of income fromnon-AFDC sources"), cert. pending, No. 94-5845.The California Rule has no such effect. The combined income of the three-person AU comprising the granddaughterand two grandnieces of Mrs. Edwards is not calculated withreference to the income either of Mrs. Edwards herself or ofanyone else inside or outside the Edwards household who isnot a member of the AU and who is not applying for AFDCassistance. In sum, the California Rule does not violate anyof the three federal regulations on which the Court of Ap-peals relied.66 We are aware that in certain situations in which a member of a consolidated AU begins to receive outside income (such as monthly child supportpayments, an inheritance, or even lottery winnings), the household wouldreceive a larger AFDC monthly payment if the recipient (along with allmembers of her nuclear family, as required by the federal family filingunit rule) terminated her participation in the AFDC program. See, e. g.,Gilliard, 483 U. S., at 591 (citing example from prior to federal rule's adoption). Were California law to forbid a person to "opt out" of the AFDCprogram in these situations, it might be said that the State had reducedAFDC assistance to the AU's remaining members based solely on thepresence or the income of a person who is not applying for such assistance.We find it unnecessary to determine whether California law ever forbidsa person who begins receiving outside income to opt out of the AFDCprogram. Certainly, nothing in the California Rule itself speaks to thisissue. Furthermore, because respondents challenged the California Ruleon its face by seeking to enjoin its enforcement altogether, see FirstAmended Complaint in No. CV-S 91 1473 (ED Cal.), pp. 16-17 (Jan. 10,1992), they could not sustain their burden even if they showed that a possible application of the rule (in concert with another statute or regulation)violated federal law. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745(1987) (a facial challenge is "the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances ex514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT156 ANDERSON v. EDWARDSOpinion of the CourtIIIRespondents offer two alternative grounds to support thejudgment below. Neither has merit, and we may dispose ofthem quickly.First, respondents argue that the California Rule is aninvalid expansion of the family filing unit rule, 42 U. S. C.$ 602(a)(38). According to respondents, when Congress de-creed that all members of a nuclear family must be groupedtogether in a single AU, it intended to prevent States fromincluding any additional persons in that AU (as does the Cali-fornia Rule). We reject the notion that Congress' directiveregarding the composition of assistance units "occupied thefield" and thereby pre-empted States from adopting anyadditional rules touching this area. What we said about"workfare" inNew York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S. 405, 414 (1973), applies here as well: "If Con-gress had intended to pre-empt state plans and efforts insuch an important dimension of the AFDC program . . . ,such intentions would in all likelihood have been expressedin direct and unambiguous language." The language of$ 602(a)(38) requires States to embrace the family filing unitrule; it does not further limit States' discretion in a direct orunambiguous manner.Second, respondents argue that the California Ruleviolates two other federal regulations that require equit-able treatment among AFDC recipients. See 45 CFR$ 233.10(a)(1) (1993) ("[T]he eligibility conditions imposed . . .must not result in inequitable treatment of individuals orgroups"); $ 233.20(a)(1)(i) ("[T]he determination of need andamount of assistance for all applicants [must] be made on anobjective and equitable basis"). Assuming that these provisions even "creat[e] a `federal right' that is enforceable underists under which the [rule] would be valid"). Though an as-applied challenge that presented the opt-out issue in a concrete factual setting mightrequire a court to decide it, such a challenge is not now before us.514us1$37N 06-11-98 18:24:41 PAGES OPINPGT157Cite as: 514 U. S. 143 (1995)Opinion of the Court[42 U. S. C.] $ 1983," Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496U. S. 498, 509 (1990), we find that the California Rule affirmatively fosters equitable treatment among AFDC recipients.For example, prior to September 1991 a caretaker relativeresponsible for three brothers having no outside incomewould have received AFDC benefits of $694 per month ontheir behalf. Yet before the California Rule was applied toher household, Mrs. Edwards received monthly benefits of$901 for the three girls for whom she cared. See supra, at148. The $207 difference is due solely to the fact that in onehousehold all of the children are siblings, while in the otherthey are not. The potential inequities in the absence of theCalifornia Rule are even greater. Six needy siblings livingin the same household in California could have received upto $1,057 per month in benefits before September 1991. Butprior to the California Rule's adoption, six needy nonsiblingswho lived in the same household could have received as muchas $2,046, or almost double. See n. 1, supra. The California Rule sensibly and equitably eliminates these disparitiesby providing that equally sized and equally needy householdswill receive equal AFDC assistance. Thus, the rule doesnot violate the equitable treatment regulations.77 In its 1994 Transmittal, see supra, at 149, HHS examined all of thefederal AFDC rules at issue in this case--the three availability regulations, the statutory family filing unit rule, and the equitable treatmentregulations. The agency concluded: "Apart from complying with [thefamily filing unit rule and a related rule], States are authorized to setthe State-wide policy, to be applied in all cases, whether and under whatconditions two or more assistance units in the same household are to beconsolidated or retained as separate units."
