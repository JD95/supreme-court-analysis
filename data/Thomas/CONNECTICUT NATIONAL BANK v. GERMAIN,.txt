In this case, we determine the appealability of an interloc-utory order issued by a district court sitting as a court ofappeals in bankruptcy. IIn 1984, O'Sullivan's Fuel Oil Co., Inc., filed a bankruptcypetition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut. Although the case began as a reorgani-zation under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in 1986the Bankruptcy Court converted it into a liquidation underChapter 7. Petitioner Connecticut National Bank (CNB) issuccessor in interest to one of O'Sullivan's creditors. Re-spondent Thomas M. Germain is trustee of O'Sullivan'sestate.On June 1, 1987, Germain sued CNB in Connecticut statecourt, seeking to hold the bank liable for various torts andbreaches of contract. CNB removed the suit to the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Connecticut, which,pursuant to local rule, automatically referred the proceedingto the Bankruptcy Court overseeing the liquidation. Ger-main then filed a demand for a jury trial. CNB moved tostrike Germain's demand. The Bankruptcy Court deniedCNB's motion,In re O'Sullivan's Fuel Oil Co., 103 B. R. 388(Conn. 1989), and the District Court affirmed,Germain v.Connecticut Nat. Bank, 112 B. R. 57 (Conn. 1990).CNB then tried to appeal to the Court of Appeals for theSecond Circuit, but the court dismissed for lack of jurisdic503us1$45z 11-13-95 23:12:28 PAGES OPINPGT251Cite as: 503 U. S. 249 (1992)Opinion of the Courttion. 926 F. 2d 191 (1991). The Second Circuit held that acourt of appeals may exercise jurisdiction over interlocutoryorders in bankruptcy only when a district court issues theorder after having withdrawn a proceeding or case from abankruptcy court, and not when the district court acts inits capacity as a bankruptcy court of appeals. We grantedcertiorari, 502 U. S. 905 (1991), and now reverse and remand.IICourts of appeals have jurisdiction over "[i]nterlocutoryorders of the district courts of the United States" under 28U. S. C. $ 1292.* CNB contends that $ 1292(b) applies by itsterms in this case, and that the Second Circuit thereforecould have exercised discretionary jurisdiction over its appeal. Germain argues that $ 1292 does not apply at all inthis case because Congress limited $ 1292 through 28 U. S. C.*That section provides in relevant part:"(a) . . . [T]he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from:"(1) Interlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States . . .or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, exceptwhere a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court;"(2) Interlocutory orders appointing receivers, or refusing orders towind up receiverships or to take steps to accomplish the purposesthereof . . . ;"(3) Interlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereofdetermining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases inwhich appeals from final decrees are allowed."(b) When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such orderinvolves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantialground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from theorder may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,he shall so state in writing in such order. The Court of Appeals whichwould have jurisdiction of an appeal of such action may thereupon, in itsdiscretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application ismade to it within ten days after the entry of the order. . . ."503us1$45z 11-13-95 23:12:28 PAGES OPINPGT252 CONNECTICUT NAT. BANK v. GERMAINOpinion of the Court$ 158(d), which deals with bankruptcy jurisdiction. CNBresponds that nothing in $ 158(d) limits $ 1292. We agreewith CNB.Bankruptcy appeals are governed for the most part by$ 158. This section comprises four subsections, three ofwhich concern us here. Subsection (a) gives the districtcourts authority to hear appeals from final and interlocutoryorders of the bankruptcy courts. The District Court, as wehave noted, had jurisdiction under this provision to hearCNB's appeal from the Bankruptcy Court. Subsection (b)permits the judicial council of any circuit to establish a bankruptcy appellate panel to fill the role of the district courtsunder subsection (a). Subsection (d), which is pivotal in thiscase, provides:"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appealsfrom all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decreesentered under subsections (a) and (b) of this section."Neither this subsection nor any other part of $ 158 mentionsinterlocutory orders entered by the district courts in bankruptcy. The parties agree, as they must, that $ 158 did notconfer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals.Germain contends that the Court of Appeals did not havejurisdiction under $ 1292 either, for $ 158(d), in his view, precludes jurisdiction under $ 1292 by negative implication. Germain reasons as follows: Although $$ 1291 and 1292 appearto cover the universe of decisions issued by the districtcourts--with $ 1291 conferring jurisdiction over appeals fromfinal decisions of the district courts, and $ 1292 conferringjurisdiction over certain interlocutory ones--that cannot infact be so. If $ 1291 did cover all final decisions by a districtcourt, he argues, that section would render $ 158(d) superfluous, since a final decision issued by a district court sittingas a bankruptcy appellate court is still a final decision of adistrict court. If $ 158(d) is to have effect, Germain contends, then that section must be exclusive within its own503us1$45z 11-13-95 23:12:28 PAGES OPINPGT253Cite as: 503 U. S. 249 (1992)Opinion of the Courtdomain, which he defines as the universe of orders issued bydistrict courts sitting pursuant to $ 158(a) as courts of appeals in bankruptcy. When a district court enters an orderin that capacity, Germain concludes, only $ 158(d) can conferjurisdiction, and if it does not, nothing else can. Germainclaims to find support for his view in his reading of the legis-lative history of $ 158(d).Contrary to Germain's contention, we need not choose be-tween giving effect on the one hand to $ 1291 and on theother to $ 158(d), for the statutes do not pose an either-orproposition. Section 1291 confers jurisdiction over appealsfrom "final decisions of the district courts" acting in any capacity. Section 158(d), in contrast, confers jurisdiction overappeals from final decisions of the district courts when theyact as bankruptcy appellate courts under $ 158(a), and alsoconfers jurisdiction over final decisions of the appellate panels in bankruptcy acting under $ 158(b). Sections 1291 and158(d) do overlap, therefore, but each section confers jurisdiction over cases that the other section does not reach.Redundancies across statutes are not unusual events indrafting, and so long as there is no "positive repugnancy"between two laws, Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 363(1842), a court must give effect to both. Because giving effect to both $$ 1291 and 158(d) would not render one or theother wholly superfluous, we do not have to read $ 158(d) asprecluding courts of appeals, by negative implication, fromexercising jurisdiction under $ 1291 over district courtssitting in bankruptcy. We similarly do not have to read$ 158(d) as precluding jurisdiction under $ 1292. Whilecourts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that renderlanguage superfluous, in this case that canon does not apply.In any event, canons of construction are no more thanrules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning oflegislation, and in interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before all others. Wehave stated time and again that courts must presume that a503us1$45z 11-13-95 23:12:28 PAGES OPINPGT254 CONNECTICUT NAT. BANK v. GERMAINOpinion of the Courtlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in astatute what it says there. See,e. g., United States v. RonPair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241-242 (1989); UnitedStates v. Goldenberg, 168 U. S. 95, 102-103 (1897); Oneale v.Thornton, 6 Cranch 53, 68 (1810). When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last:"judicial inquiry is complete."Rubin v. United States, 449U. S. 424, 430 (1981); see also Ron Pair Enterprises, supra,at 241.Germain says that legislative history points to a differentresult. But we think that judicial inquiry into the applicability of $ 1292 begins and ends with what $ 1292 does sayand with what $ 158(d) does not. Section 1292 provides forreview in the courts of appeals, in certain circumstances, of"[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the UnitedStates." Section 158(d) is silent as to review of interlocutory orders. Nowhere does $ 1292 limit review to orders issued by district courts sitting as trial courts in bankruptcyrather than appellate courts, and nowhere else, whether in$ 158(d) or any other statute, has Congress indicated that theunadorned words of $ 1292 are in some way limited by implication. "It would be dangerous in the extreme to infer . . .that a case for which the words of an instrument expresslyprovide, shall be exempted from its operation." Sturges v.Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 202 (1819); see also Regents ofUniv. of Cal. v. Public Employment Relations Bd., 485 U. S.589, 598 (1988). There is no reason to infer from either$ 1292 or $ 158(d) that Congress meant to limit appellate review of interlocutory orders in bankruptcy proceedings. Solong as a party to a proceeding or case in bankruptcy meetsthe conditions imposed by $ 1292, a court of appeals may relyon that statute as a basis for jurisdiction.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
