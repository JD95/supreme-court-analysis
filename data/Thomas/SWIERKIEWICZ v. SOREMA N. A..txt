This case presents the question whether a complaint inan employment discrimination lawsuit must contain specificfacts establishing a prima facie case of discrimination underthe framework set forth by this Court inMcDonnell Doug-las Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973). We hold that anemployment discrimination complaint need not include suchfacts and instead must contain only "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled torelief." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).IPetitioner Akos Swierkiewicz is a native of Hungary,who at the time of his complaint was 53 years old.1 In April1989, petitioner began working for respondent Sorema N. A.,a reinsurance company headquartered in New York andprincipally owned and controlled by a French parent corpo-ration. Petitioner was initially employed in the position ofsenior vice president and chief underwriting officer (CUO).Nearly six years later, Franc,ois M. Chavel, respondent'sChief Executive Officer, demoted petitioner to a marketingand services position and transferred the bulk of his under-writing responsibilities to Nicholas Papadopoulo, a 32-yearold who, like Mr. Chavel, is a French national. About a yearlater, Mr. Chavel stated that he wanted to "energize" theunderwriting department and appointed Mr. Papadopouloas CUO. Petitioner claims that Mr. Papadopoulo had onlyone year of underwriting experience at the time he was pro-moted, and therefore was less experienced and less qualifiedto be CUO than he, since at that point he had 26 years ofexperience in the insurance industry.1 Because we review here a decision granting respondent's motion todismiss, we must accept as true all of the factual allegations containedin the complaint. See, e. g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County NarcoticsIntelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164 (1993).534US2 Unit: $U24 [05-03-02 17:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN509Cite as: 534 U. S. 506 (2002)Opinion of the CourtFollowing his demotion, petitioner contends that he "wasisolated by Mr. Chavel . . . excluded from business decisions and meetings and denied the opportunity to reach histrue potential at SOREMA." App. 26. Petitioner unsuccessfully attempted to meet with Mr. Chavel to discuss hisdiscontent. Finally, in April 1997, petitioner sent a memoto Mr. Chavel outlining his grievances and requesting aseverance package. Two weeks later, respondent's gen-eral counsel presented petitioner with two options: He couldeither resign without a severance package or be dismissed.Mr. Chavel fired petitioner after he refused to resign.Petitioner filed a lawsuit alleging that he had been terminated on account of his national origin in violation ofTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V),and on account of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602,as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V).App. 28. The United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of New York dismissed petitioner's complaint because it found that he "ha[d] not adequately alleged a primafacie case, in that he ha[d] not adequately alleged circumstances that support an inference of discrimination." Id.,at 42. The United States Court of Appeals for the SecondCircuit affirmed the dismissal, relying on its settled precedent, which requires a plaintiff in an employment discrimination complaint to allege facts constituting a prima faciecase of discrimination under the framework set forth bythis Court in McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802. See, e. g.,Tarshis v. Riese Organization, 211 F. 3d 30, 35-36, 38 (CA22000); Austin v. Ford Models, Inc., 149 F. 3d 148, 152-153(CA2 1998). The Court of Appeals held that petitioner hadfailed to meet his burden because his allegations were "insufficient as a matter of law to raise an inference of discrimination." 5 Fed. Appx. 63, 65 (CA2 2001). We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 976 (2001), to resolve a split among the Courts534US2 Unit: $U24 [05-03-02 17:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN510 SWIERKIEWICZ v. SOREMA N. A.Opinion of the Courtof Appeals concerning the proper pleading standard foremployment discrimination cases,2 and now reverse.IIApplying Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals requiredpetitioner to plead a prima facie case of discrimination inorder to survive respondent's motion to dismiss. See 5 Fed.Appx., at 64-65. In the Court of Appeals' view, petitionerwas thus required to allege in his complaint: (1) membershipin a protected group; (2) qualification for the job in question;(3) an adverse employment action; and (4) circumstances thatsupport an inference of discrimination.Ibid.; cf. McDonnellDouglas, 411 U. S., at 802; Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253-254, n. 6 (1981).The prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas, however, is an evidentiary standard, not a pleading requirement.In McDonnell Douglas, this Court made clear that "[t]hecritical issue before us concern[ed] the order and allocationof proof in a private, non-class action challenging employ-ment discrimination." 411 U. S., at 800 (emphasis added).In subsequent cases, this Court has reiterated that theprima facie case relates to the employee's burden of presenting evidence that raises an inference of discrimination.See Burdine, supra, at 252-253 ("In [McDonnell Douglas,]we set forth the basic allocation of burdens and order of pres-entation of proof in a Title VII case alleging discriminatorytreatment. First, the plaintiff has the burden of provingby the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of2 The majority of Courts of Appeals have held that a plaintiff need notplead a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas Corp.v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), in order to survive a motion to dismiss.See, e. g., Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F. 3d 1111, 1114 (CADC2000); Bennett v. Schmidt, 153 F. 3d 516, 518 (CA7 1998); Ring v. FirstInterstate Mortgage, Inc., 984 F. 2d 924 (CA8 1993). Others, however,maintain that a complaint must contain factual allegations that supporteach element of a prima facie case. In addition to the case below, seeJackson v. Columbus, 194 F. 3d 737, 751 (CA6 1999).534US2 Unit: $U24 [05-03-02 17:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN511Cite as: 534 U. S. 506 (2002)Opinion of the Courtdiscrimination" (footnotes omitted)); 450 U. S., at 255, n. 8("This evidentiary relationship between the presumptioncreated by a prima facie case and the consequential burdenof production placed on the defendant is a traditional featureof the common law").This Court has never indicated that the requirements forestablishing a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglasalso apply to the pleading standard that plaintiffs must sat-isfy in order to survive a motion to dismiss. For instance,we have rejected the argument that a Title VII complaintrequires greater "particularity," because this would "toonarrowly constric[t] the role of the pleadings." McDonaldv. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U. S. 273, 283, n. 11 (1976).Consequently, the ordinary rules for assessing the sufficiencyof a complaint apply. See, e. g., Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S.232, 236 (1974) ("When a federal court reviews the sufficiencyof a complaint, before the reception of any evidence eitherby affidavit or admissions, its task is necessarily a limitedone. The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence tosupport the claims").In addition, under a notice pleading system, it is not appropriate to require a plaintiff to plead facts establishinga prima facie case because the McDonnell Douglas framework does not apply in every employment discriminationcase. For instance, if a plaintiff is able to produce directevidence of discrimination, he may prevail without provingall the elements of a prima facie case. See Trans WorldAirlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985) ("[T]heMcDonnell Douglas test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination"). Under theSecond Circuit's heightened pleading standard, a plaintiffwithout direct evidence of discrimination at the time of hiscomplaint must plead a prima facie case of discrimination,even though discovery might uncover such direct evidence.It thus seems incongruous to require a plaintiff, in order to534US2 Unit: $U24 [05-03-02 17:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN512 SWIERKIEWICZ v. SOREMA N. A.Opinion of the Courtsurvive a motion to dismiss, to plead more facts than he mayultimately need to prove to succeed on the merits if directevidence of discrimination is discovered.Moreover, the precise requirements of a prima facie casecan vary depending on the context and were "never intendedto be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic."Furnco Constr.Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567, 577 (1978); see also McDonnellDouglas, supra, at 802, n. 13 ("[T]he specification . . . ofthe prima facie proof required from respondent is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situa-tions");Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 358 (1977)(noting that this Court "did not purport to create an inflexible formulation" for a prima facie case); Ring v. FirstInterstate Mortgage, Inc., 984 F. 2d 924, 927 (CA8 1993)("[T]o measure a plaintiff 's complaint against a particularformulation of the prima facie case at the pleading stage isinappropriate"). Before discovery has unearthed relevantfacts and evidence, it may be difficult to define the preciseformulation of the required prima facie case in a particularcase. Given that the prima facie case operates as a flexibleevidentiary standard, it should not be transposed into a rigidpleading standard for discrimination cases.Furthermore, imposing the Court of Appeals' heightenedpleading standard in employment discrimination cases conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), which provides that a complaint must include only "a short and plainstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitledto relief." Such a statement must simply "give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff 's claim is and thegrounds upon which it rests." Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S.41, 47 (1957). This simplified notice pleading standard relies on liberal discovery rules and summary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to dispose ofunmeritorious claims. See id., at 47-48; Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,507 U. S. 163, 168-169 (1993). "The provisions for discov534US2 Unit: $U24 [05-03-02 17:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN513Cite as: 534 U. S. 506 (2002)Opinion of the Courtery are so flexible and the provisions for pretrial procedureand summary judgment so effective, that attempted surprisein federal practice is aborted very easily, synthetic issuesdetected, and the gravamen of the dispute brought franklyinto the open for the inspection of the court." 5 C. Wright& A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1202, p. 76(2d ed. 1990).Rule 8(a)'s simplified pleading standard applies to all civilactions, with limited exceptions. Rule 9(b), for example,provides for greater particularity in all averments of fraudor mistake.3 This Court, however, has declined to extendsuch exceptions to other contexts. InLeatherman westated: "[T]he Federal Rules do address in Rule 9(b) thequestion of the need for greater particularity in pleadingcertain actions, but do not include among the enumeratedactions any reference to complaints alleging municipal lia-bility under $ 1983. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius."507 U. S., at 168. Just as Rule 9(b) makes no mention ofmunicipal liability under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983(1994 ed., Supp. V), neither does it refer to employment dis-crimination. Thus, complaints in these cases, as in most others, must satisfy only the simple requirements of Rule 8(a).4Other provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedureare inextricably linked to Rule 8(a)'s simplified notice plead-ing standard. Rule 8(e)(1) states that "[n]o technical formsof pleading or motions are required," and Rule 8(f ) provides3 "In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constitutingfraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally."4 These requirements are exemplified by the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure Forms, which "are sufficient under the rules and are intendedto indicate the simplicity and brevity of statement which the rules contemplate." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 84. For example, Form 9 sets forth acomplaint for negligence in which plaintiff simply states in relevant part:"On June 1, 1936, in a public highway called Boylston Street in Boston,Massachusetts, defendant negligently drove a motor vehicle against plaintiff who was then crossing said highway."534US2 Unit: $U24 [05-03-02 17:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN514 SWIERKIEWICZ v. SOREMA N. A.Opinion of the Courtthat "[a]ll pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantialjustice." Given the Federal Rules' simplified standard forpleading, "[a] court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clearthat no relief could be granted under any set of facts thatcould be proved consistent with the allegations." Hishon v.King & Spalding, 467 U. S. 69, 73 (1984). If a pleading failsto specify the allegations in a manner that provides sufficientnotice, a defendant can move for a more definite statementunder Rule 12(e) before responding. Moreover, claims lacking merit may be dealt with through summary judgmentunder Rule 56. The liberal notice pleading of Rule 8(a) isthe starting point of a simplified pleading system, whichwas adopted to focus litigation on the merits of a claim. SeeConley, supra, at 48 ("The Federal Rules reject the approachthat pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principlethat the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decisionon the merits").Applying the relevant standard, petitioner's complainteasily satisfies the requirements of Rule 8(a) because it givesrespondent fair notice of the basis for petitioner's claims.Petitioner alleged that he had been terminated on account ofhis national origin in violation of Title VII and on account ofhis age in violation of the ADEA. App. 28. His complaintdetailed the events leading to his termination, provided relevant dates, and included the ages and nationalities of at leastsome of the relevant persons involved with his termination.Id., at 24-28. These allegations give respondent fair noticeof what petitioner's claims are and the grounds upon whichthey rest. See Conley, supra, at 47. In addition, they stateclaims upon which relief could be granted under Title VIIand the ADEA.Respondent argues that allowing lawsuits based on conclusory allegations of discrimination to go forward will burdenthe courts and encourage disgruntled employees to bringunsubstantiated suits. Brief for Respondent 34-40. What534US2 Unit: $U24 [05-03-02 17:35:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN515Cite as: 534 U. S. 506 (2002)Opinion of the Courtever the practical merits of this argument, the Federal Rulesdo not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits. A requirement of greater speci-ficity for particular claims is a result that "must be obtainedby the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not byjudicial interpretation." Leatherman, supra, at 168. Furthermore, Rule 8(a) establishes a pleading standard with-out regard to whether a claim will succeed on the merits."Indeed it may appear on the face of the pleadings that arecovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not thetest." Scheuer, 416 U. S., at 236.For the foregoing reasons, we hold that an employmentdiscrimination plaintiff need not plead a prima facie caseof discrimination and that petitioner's complaint is sufficient to survive respondent's motion to dismiss. Accord-ingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
