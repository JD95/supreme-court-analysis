Pp. 308-312, 315-317.(a) A defendant's right to present relevant evidence is subject to reasonable restrictions to accommodate other legitimate interests in thecriminal trial process. See, e. g., Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 55.State and federal rulemakers therefore have broad latitude under theConstitution to establish rules excluding evidence. Such rules do notabridge an accused's right to present a defense so long as they are not"arbitrary" or "disproportionate to the purposes they are designed toserve." E. g., id., at 56. This Court has found the exclusion of evidence to be unconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only whereit has infringed upon a weighty interest of the accused. See, e. g., id.,at 58. Rule 707 serves the legitimate interest of ensuring that onlyreliable evidence is introduced. There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable: The scientific community and the state andfederal courts are extremely polarized on the matter.

SCHEFFEROpinion of the Courtone of the OSI agents supervising respondent requested thathe submit to a urine test. Shortly after providing the urinesample, but before the results of the test were known, re-spondent agreed to take a polygraph test administered byan OSI examiner. In the opinion of the examiner, the test"indicated no deception" when respondent denied usingdrugs since joining the Air Force.1On April 30, respondent unaccountably failed to appear forwork and could not be found on the base. He was absentwithout leave until May 13, when an Iowa state patrolmanarrested him following a routine traffic stop and held him forreturn to the base. OSI agents later learned that respondent's urinalysis revealed the presence of methamphetamine.Respondent was tried by general court-martial on chargesof using methamphetamine, failing to go to his appointedplace of duty, wrongfully absenting himself from the base for13 days, and, with respect to an unrelated matter, uttering17 insufficient funds checks. He testified at trial on his ownbehalf, relying upon an "innocent ingestion" theory and de-nying that he had knowingly used drugs while working forOSI. On cross-examination, the prosecution attempted toimpeach respondent with inconsistencies between his trialtestimony and earlier statements he had made to OSI.Respondent sought to introduce the polygraph evidence insupport of his testimony that he did not knowingly usedrugs. The military judge denied the motion, relying onMilitary Rule of Evidence 707, which provides, in relevantpart:"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the re-sults of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an offer to take,1 The OSI examiner asked three relevant questions: (1) "Since you'vebeen in the [Air Force], have you used any illegal drugs?"; (2) "Have youlied about any of the drug information you've given OSI?"; and (3) "Besides your parents, have you told anyone you're assisting OSI?" Respondent answered "no" to each question. App. 12.523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN307Cite as: 523 U.

He further reasoned that the factfinder might giveundue weight to the polygraph examiner's testimony, andthat collateral arguments about such evidence could consume"an inordinate amount of time and expense." Ibid.Respondent was convicted on all counts and was sentencedto a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 30 months, totalforfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Air Force Court of Criminal Ap-peals affirmed in all material respects, explaining that Rule707 "does not arbitrarily limit the accused's ability to presentreliable evidence." 41 M.

Withoutpointing to any particular language in the Sixth Amendment,the Court of Appeals held that "[a] per se exclusion of polygraph evidence offered by an accused to rebut an attack onhis credibility . . . violates his Sixth Amendment right topresent a defense."

S. 303 (1998)Opinion of the CourtRule 707 serves several legitimate interests in the crimi-nal trial process. These interests include ensuring that onlyreliable evidence is introduced at trial, preserving the courtmembers' role in determining credibility, and avoiding litigation that is collateral to the primary purpose of the trial.5The Rule is neither arbitrary nor disproportionate in promoting these ends. Nor does it implicate a sufficientlyweighty interest of the defendant to raise a constitutionalconcern under our precedents.AState and Federal Governments unquestionably have a le-gitimate interest in ensuring that reliable evidence is presented to the trier of fact in a criminal trial. Indeed, theexclusion of unreliable evidence is a principal objective ofmany evidentiary rules. See, e. g., Fed. Rules Evid. 702, 802,901; see alsoDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,509 U. S. 579, 589 (1993).The contentions of respondent and the dissent notwith-standing, there is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable. To this day, the scientific community re-mains extremely polarized about the reliability of polygraphtechniques. 1 D. Faigman, D. Kaye, M. Saks, & J. Sanders,Modern Scientific Evidence 565, n. #, $ 14-2.0 to $ 14-7.0(1997); see also 1 P. Giannelli & E. Imwinkelried, Scientific5 These interests, among others, were recognized by the drafters of Rule707, who justified the Rule on the following grounds: the risk that courtmembers would be misled by polygraph evidence; the risk that the traditional responsibility of court members to ascertain the facts and adjudgeguilt or innocence would be usurped; the danger that confusion of theissues " `could result in the court-martial degenerating into a trial of thepolygraph machine;' " the likely waste of time on collateral issues; and thefact that the " `reliability of polygraph evidence has not been sufficientlyestablished.'

See Iacono &Lykken, The Scientific Status of Research on PolygraphTechniques: The Case Against Polygraph Tests, in 1 Mod-ern Scientific Evidence,supra, $ 14-5.3, at 629 (hereinafterIacono & Lykken).6This lack of scientific consensus is reflected in the disagreement among state and federal courts concerning both the6 The United States notes that in 1983 Congress' Office of TechnologyAssessment evaluated all available studies on the reliability of polygraphsand concluded that " `[o]verall, the cumulative research evidence suggeststhat when used in criminal investigations, the polygraph test detects deception better than chance, but with error rates that could be consideredsignificant.'

Even if the basic debate aboutthe reliability of polygraph technology itself were resolved, however, therewould still be controversy over the efficacy of countermeasures, or deliberately adopted strategies that a polygraph examinee can employ to provokephysiological responses that will obscure accurate readings and thus "fool"the polygraph machine and the examiner.

Posado, 57 F. 3d 428, 434(CA5 1995);United States v. Cordoba, 104 F. 3d 225, 228(CA9 1997), at least one Federal Circuit has recently reaffirmed its per se ban, see United States v. Sanchez, 118 F. 3d192, 197 (CA4 1997), and another recently noted that it has"not decided whether polygraphy has reached a sufficientstate of reliability to be admissible." United States v. Messina, 131 F. 3d 36, 42 (CA2 1997). Most States maintain perse rules excluding polygraph evidence. See, e. g., State v.Porter, 241 Conn. 57, 92-95, 698 A. 2d 739, 758-759 (1997);People v. Gard, 158 Ill. 2d 191, 202-204, 632 N. E. 2d 1026,1032 (1994); In re Odell, 672 A. 2d 457, 459 (RI 1996) (percuriam); Perkins v. State, 902 S. W. 2d 88, 94-95 (Ct. App.Tex. 1995). New Mexico is unique in making polygraph evidence generally admissible without the prior stipulation ofthe parties and without significant restriction. See N. M.7 Until quite recently, federal and state courts were uniform in categorically ruling polygraph evidence inadmissible under the test set forth inFrye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (CADC 1923), which held that scientificevidence must gain the general acceptance of the relevant expert community to be admissible. In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,509 U. S. 579 (1993), we held that Frye had been superseded by the Federal Rules of Evidence and that expert testimony could be admitted if thedistrict court deemed it both relevant and reliable.Prior to Daubert, neither federal nor state courts found any SixthAmendment obstacle to the categorical rule. See, e. g., Bashor v. Risley,730 F. 2d 1228, 1238 (CA9), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 838 (1984); People v.Price, 1 Cal. 4th 324, 419-420, 821 P. 2d 610, 663 (1991), cert. denied, 506U. S. 851 (1992). Nothing in Daubert foreclosed, as a constitutional matter, per se exclusionary rules for certain types of expert or scientific evidence. It would be an odd inversion of our hierarchy of laws if alteringor interpreting a rule of evidence worked a corresponding change in themeaning of the Constitution.523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN312 UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFEROpinion of Thomas, J.Rule Evid. $ 11-707.8 Whatever their approach, state andfederal courts continue to express doubt about whether suchevidence is reliable. See, e. g., United States v. Messina,supra, at 42; United States v. Posado, supra, at 434; State v.Porter, supra, at 126-127, 698 A. 2d, at 774; Perkins v. State,supra, at 94; People v. Gard, supra, at 202-204, 632 N. E. 2d,at 1032; In re Odell, supra, at 459.The approach taken by the President in adopting Rule707--excluding polygraph evidence in all military trials--is arational and proportional means of advancing the legitimateinterest in barring unreliable evidence. Although the degree of reliability of polygraph evidence may depend upon avariety of identifiable factors, there is simply no way to knowin a particular case whether a polygraph examiner's conclu-sion is accurate, because certain doubts and uncertaintiesplague even the best polygraph exams. Individual jurisdic-tions therefore may reasonably reach differing conclusionsas to whether polygraph evidence should be admitted. Wecannot say, then, that presented with such widespread uncertainty, the President acted arbitrarily or disproportion-ately in promulgating a per se rule excluding all polygraphevidence. BIt is equally clear that Rule 707 serves a second legitimategovernmental interest: Preserving the court members' core8 Respondent argues that because the Government--and in particularthe Department of Defense--routinely uses polygraph testing, the Government must consider polygraphs reliable. Governmental use of polygraph tests, however, is primarily in the field of personnel screening, andto a lesser extent as a tool in criminal and intelligence investigations, butnot as evidence at trials. See Brief for United States 34, n. 17; Barland,The Polygraph Test in the USA and Elsewhere, in The Polygraph Test 76(A. Gale ed. 1988). Such limited, out of court uses of polygraph techniques obviously differ in character from, and carry less severe consequences than, the use of polygraphs as evidence in a criminal trial. Theydo not establish the reliability of polygraphs as trial evidence, and they donot invalidate reliability as a valid concern supporting Rule 707's categorical ban.523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN313Cite as: 523 U. S. 303 (1998)Opinion of Thomas, J.function of making credibility determinations in criminaltrials. A fundamental premise of our criminal trial systemis that "the jury is the lie detector." United States v. Barnard, 490 F. 2d 907, 912 (CA9 1973) (emphasis added), cert.denied, 416 U. S. 959 (1974). Determining the weight andcredibility of witness testimony, therefore, has long beenheld to be the "part of every case [that] belongs to the jury,who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and theways of men." Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 140 U. S. 76, 88(1891).By its very nature, polygraph evidence may diminish thejury's role in making credibility determinations. The common form of polygraph test measures a variety of physiological responses to a set of questions asked by the examiner,who then interprets these physiological correlates of anxietyand offers an opinion to the jury about whether the witness--often, as in this case, the accused--was deceptive inanswering questions about the very matters at issue in thetrial. See 1 McCormick $ 206.9 Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors'knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, orDNA found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supplythe jury only with another opinion, in addition to its own,about whether the witness was telling the truth. Jurisdictions, in promulgating rules of evidence, may legitimately beconcerned about the risk that juries will give excessive9 The examiner interprets various physiological responses of the examinee, including blood pressure, perspiration, and respiration, while askinga series of questions, commonly in three categories: direct accusatoryquestions concerning the matter under investigation, irrelevant or neutralquestions, and more general "control" questions concerning wrongdoingby the subject in general. The examiner forms an opinion of the subject'struthfulness by comparing the physiological reactions to each set of questions. See generally Giannelli & Imwinkelried 219-222; Honts & Quick,The Polygraph in 1995: Progress in Science and the Law, 71 N. D. L. Rev.987, 990-992 (1995).523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN314 UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFEROpinion of Thomas, J.weight to the opinions of a polygrapher, clothed as they arein scientific expertise and at times offering, as in respondent's case, a conclusion about the ultimate issue in the trial.Such jurisdictions may legitimately determine that the auraof infallibility attending polygraph evidence can lead jurorsto abandon their duty to assess credibility and guilt. Thosejurisdictions may also take into account the fact that a judgecannot determine, when ruling on a motion to admit polygraph evidence, whether a particular polygraph expert islikely to influence the jury unduly. For these reasons, thePresident is within his constitutional prerogative to promulgate a per se rule that simply excludes all such evidence.CA third legitimate interest served by Rule 707 is avoidinglitigation over issues other than the guilt or innocence of theaccused. Such collateral litigation prolongs criminal trialsand threatens to distract the jury from its central functionof determining guilt or innocence. Allowing proffers ofpolygraph evidence would inevitably entail assessments ofsuch issues as whether the test and control questions wereappropriate, whether a particular polygraph examiner wasqualified and had properly interpreted the physiological responses, and whether other factors such as countermeasuresemployed by the examinee had distorted the exam results.Such assessments would be required in each and everycase.10 It thus offends no constitutional principle for thePresident to conclude that a per se rule excluding all polygraph evidence is appropriate. Because litigation over theadmissibility of polygraph evidence is by its very nature col10 Although some of this litigation could take place outside the presenceof the jury, at the very least a foundation must be laid for the jury toassess the qualifications and skill of the polygrapher and the validity ofthe exam, and significant cross-examination could occur on these issues.523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN315Cite as: 523 U. S. 303 (1998)Opinion of the Courtlateral, a per se rule prohibiting its admission is not an arbitrary or disproportionate means of avoiding it.11DThe three of our precedents upon which the Court of Appeals principally relied, Rock v. Arkansas, Washington v.Texas, and Chambers v. Mississippi, do not support a rightto introduce polygraph evidence, even in very narrow circumstances. The exclusions of evidence that we declaredunconstitutional in those cases significantly undermined fundamental elements of the defendant's defense. Such is notthe case here.In Rock, the defendant, accused of a killing to which shewas the only eyewitness, was allegedly able to remember thefacts of the killing only after having her memory hypnotically refreshed. See Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S., at 46.Because Arkansas excluded all hypnotically refreshed testimony, the defendant was unable to testify about certain relevant facts, including whether the killing had been accidental.See id., at 47-49. In holding that the exclusion of this evidence violated the defendant's "right to present a defense,"we noted that the rule deprived the jury of the testimony ofthe only witness who was at the scene and had firsthandknowledge of the facts. See id., at 57. Moreover, the ruleinfringed upon the defendant's interest in testifying in herown defense--an interest that we deemed particularly significant, as it is the defendant who is the target of any crimi11 Although the Court of Appeals stated that it had "merely remove[d]the obstacle of the per se rule against admissibility" of polygraph evidencein cases where the accused wishes to proffer an exculpatory polygraph torebut an attack on his credibility, 44 M. J. 442, 446 (1996), and respondentthus implicitly argues that the Constitution would require collateral litigation only in such cases, we cannot see a principled justification whereby aright derived from the Constitution could be so narrowly contained.523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN316 UNITED STATES v. SCHEFFEROpinion of the Courtnal prosecution. See id., at 52. For this reason, we statedthat a defendant ought to be allowed "to present his ownversion of events in his own words." Ibid.In Washington, the statutes involved prevented codefendants or coparticipants in a crime from testifying forone another and thus precluded the defendant from introducing his accomplice's testimony that the accomplice had in factcommitted the crime. SeeWashington v. Texas, 388 U. S.,at 16-17. In reversing Washington's conviction, we heldthat the Sixth Amendment was violated because "the Statearbitrarily denied [the defendant] the right to put on thestand a witness who was physically and mentally capable oftestifying to events that he had personally observed."Id.,at 23.12In Chambers, we found a due process violation in thecombined application of Mississippi's common-law "voucherrule," which prevented a party from impeaching his own wit-ness, and its hearsay rule that excluded the testimony ofthree persons to whom that witness had confessed. SeeChambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S., at 302. Chambers specifically confined its holding to the "facts and circumstances"presented in that case; we thus stressed that the ruling didnot "signal any diminution in the respect traditionally ac-corded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial rules and procedures." Id.,at 302-303.Chambers therefore does not stand for theproposition that the defendant is denied a fair opportunityto defend himself whenever a state or federal rule excludesfavorable evidence.Rock, Washington, and Chambers do not require that Rule707 be invalidated, because, unlike the evidentiary rules atissue in those cases, Rule 707 does not implicate any signifi12 In addition, we noted that the State of Texas could advance no legitimate interests in support of the evidentiary rules at issue, and those rulesburdened only the defense and not the prosecution. See 388 U. S., at 22-23. Rule 707 suffers from neither of these defects.523US1 Unit: $U46 [05-09-00 11:31:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN317Cite as: 523 U.

Moreover, in contrast to the rule at issue in Rock, Rule 707 did not prohibitrespondent from testifying on his own behalf; he freely exercised his choice to convey his version of the facts to thecourt-martial members. We therefore cannot conclude thatrespondent's defense was significantly impaired by the exclu-sion of polygraph evidence. Rule 707 is thus constitutionalunder our precedents.* * *For the foregoing reasons, Military Rule of Evidence 707does not unconstitutionally abridge the right to present adefense. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
