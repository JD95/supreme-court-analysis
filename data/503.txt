CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1991

HUDSON v. McMILLIAN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 90-6531. Argued November 13, 1991--Decided February 25, 1992
Petitioner Hudson, a Louisiana prison inmate, testified that minor bruises,

facial swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate he had suffered resulted from a beating by respondent prison guards McMillian
and Woods while he was handcuffed and shackled following an argument with McMillian, and that respondent Mezo, a supervisor on duty,
watched the beating but merely told the officers "not to have too much
fun." The Magistrate trying Hudson's District Court suit under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 found that the officers used force when there was no need
to do so and that Mezo expressly condoned their actions, ruled that
respondents had violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel
and unusual punishments, and awarded Hudson damages. The Court
of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that inmates alleging use of
excessive force in violation of the Amendment must prove "significant
injury" and that Hudson could not prevail because his injuries were
"minor" and required no medical attention.

Held: The use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not
suffer serious injury. Pp. 5-12.

(a) Whenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force constituting "the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain"
violative of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out in Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 320-321:
whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore

1

2 HUDSON v. McMILLIAN

Syllabus
discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm. Extending
Whitley's application of the "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain"
standard to all allegations of force, whether the prison disturbance is a
riot or a lesser disruption, works no innovation. See, e. g., Johnson v.
Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028, cert. denied, 414 U. S. 1033. Pp. 5-7.

(b) Since, under the Whitley approach, the extent of injury suffered
by an inmate is one of the factors to be considered in determining
whether the use of force is wanton and unnecessary, 475 U. S., at 321,
the absence of serious injury is relevant to, but does not end, the Eighth
Amendment inquiry. There is no merit to respondents' assertion that
a significant injury requirement is mandated by what this Court termed,
in Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298, the "objective component" of
Eighth Amendment analysis: whether the alleged wrongdoing is objectively "harmful enough" to establish a constitutional violation, id., at
303. That component is contextual and responsive to "contemporary
standards of decency." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 103. In the
excessive force context, such standards always are violated when prison
officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, see Whitley, 475 U. S., at 327, whether or not significant injury is evident. Moreover, although the Amendment does not reach de minimis uses of physical force, provided that such use is not of a sort repugnant to the
conscience of mankind, ibid., the blows directed at Hudson are not de
minimis, and the extent of his injuries thus provides no basis for dismissal of his $ 1983 claim. Pp. 7-10.

(c) The dissent's theory that Wilson requires an inmate who alleges
excessive force to show significant injury in addition to the unnecessary
and wanton infliction of pain misapplies Wilson and ignores the body of
this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. Wilson did not involve
an allegation of excessive force and, with respect to the "objective component" of an Eighth Amendment claim, suggested no departure from
Estelle and its progeny. The dissent's argument that excessive force
claims and conditions-of-confinement claims are no different in kind is
likewise unfounded. To deny the difference between punching a prisoner in the face and serving him unappetizing food is to ignore the
concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment. See Estelle, supra, at 102. Pp. 10-11.

(d) This Court takes no position on respondents' legal argument that
their conduct was isolated, unauthorized, and against prison policy and
therefore beyond the scope of "punishment" prohibited by the Eighth
Amendment. That argument is inapposite on the record, since the
Court of Appeals left intact the Magistrate's determination that the
violence at issue was not an isolated assault, and ignores the Magistrate's finding that supervisor Mezo expressly condoned the use of force.

4 HUDSON v. McMILLIAN

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to decide whether the use of exces-sive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel

and unusual punishment when the inmate does not sufferserious injury. We answer that question in the affirmative.

I
At the time of the incident that is the subject of this suit,petitioner Keith Hudson was an inmate at the state penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana. Respondents Jack McMillian,Marvin Woods, and Arthur Mezo served as corrections security officers at the Angola facility. During the early morn-ing hours of October 30, 1983, Hudson and McMillian argued.
Assisted by Woods, McMillian then placed Hudson in hand-cuffs and shackles, took the prisoner out of his cell, and
walked him toward the penitentiary's "administrative lock-down" area. Hudson testified that, on the way there, McMillian punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomachwhile Woods held the inmate in place and kicked and
punched him from behind. He further testified that Mezo,the supervisor on duty, watched the beating but merely told
the officers "not to have too much fun." App. 23. As a re-sult of this episode, Hudson suffered minor bruises and swelling of his face, mouth, and lip. The blows also loosened Hud-son's teeth and cracked his partial dental plate, rendering it
unusable for several months.Hudson sued the three corrections officers in Federal
District Court under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,alleging a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments and seeking com-pensatory damages. The parties consented to disposition of
the case before a Magistrate, who found that McMillianand Woods used force when there was no need to do so
and that Mezo expressly condoned their actions. App. 26.The Magistrate awarded Hudson damages of $800.

Id.,at 29.

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 929F. 2d 1014 (1990). It held that inmates alleging use of excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment must prove:(1) significant injury; (2) resulting "directly and only from
the use of force that was clearly excessive to the need"; (3)the excessiveness of which was objectively unreasonable; and
(4) that the action constituted an unnecessary and wantoninfliction of pain.

Id., at 1015. The court determined thatrespondents' use of force was objectively unreasonable because no force was required. Furthermore, "[t]he conductof McMillian and Woods qualified as clearly excessive and
occasioned unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain." Ibid.However, Hudson could not prevail on his Eighth Amendment claim because his injuries were "minor" and requiredno medical attention.

Ibid.We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 958 (1991), to determine

whether the "significant injury" requirement applied by theCourt of Appeals accords with the Constitution's dictate that
cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted.

II
In Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312 (1986), the principalquestion before us was what legal standard should govern

the Eighth Amendment claim of an inmate shot by a guardduring a prison riot. We based our answer on the settled
rule that " `the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . .constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the
Eighth Amendment.' " Id., at 319 (quoting Ingraham v.Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 670 (1977)) (internal quotation marks
omitted).What is necessary to establish an "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain," we said, varies according to the natureof the alleged constitutional violation. 475 U. S., at 320.
For example, the appropriate inquiry when an inmate allegesthat prison officials failed to attend to serious medical needs
is whether the officials exhibited "deliberate indifference."

6 HUDSON v. McMILLIAN

Opinion of the Court
See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104 (1976). This stand-ard is appropriate because the State's responsibility to provide inmates with medical care ordinarily does not conflictwith competing administrative concerns.

Whitley, supra,
at 320.

By contrast, officials confronted with a prison disturbancemust balance the threat unrest poses to inmates, prison

workers, administrators, and visitors against the harm in-mates may suffer if guards use force. Despite the weight of
these competing concerns, corrections officials must maketheir decisions "in haste, under pressure, and frequently
without the luxury of a second chance." 475 U. S., at 320.
We accordingly concluded in Whitley that application of the
deliberate indifference standard is inappropriate when authorities use force to put down a prison disturbance. Instead, "the question whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering ultimately turns on
`whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain
or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the
very purpose of causing harm.' " Id., at 320-321 (quoting
Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028, 1033 (CA2), cert. denied
sub nom. John v. Johnson, 414 U. S. 1033 (1973)).

Many of the concerns underlying our holding in Whitley
arise whenever guards use force to keep order. Whether
the prison disturbance is a riot or a lesser disruption, corrections officers must balance the need "to maintain or restore
discipline" through force against the risk of injury to inmates. Both situations may require prison officials to act
quickly and decisively. Likewise, both implicate the principle that " `[p]rison administrators . . . should be accorded
wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of
policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to
preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.' " 475 U. S., at 321-322 (quoting Bell v.
Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547 (1979)). In recognition of these
similarities, we hold that whenever prison officials stand ac503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT

7Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
cused of using excessive physical force in violation of theCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out in Whitley: whether force was appliedin a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.Extending

Whitley's application of the "unnecessary andwanton infliction of pain" standard to all allegations of excessive force works no innovation. This Court derived theWhitley test from one articulated by Judge Friendly in Johnson v. Glick, supra, a case arising out of a prisoner's claimto have been beaten and harassed by a guard. Moreover,
many Courts of Appeals already apply the Whitley standardto allegations of excessive force outside of the riot situation.
See Corselli v. Coughlin, 842 F. 2d 23, 26 (CA2 1988); Millerv.

Leathers, 913 F. 2d 1085, 1087 (CA4 1990) (en banc), cert.denied, 498 U. S. 1109 (1991); Haynes v. Marshall, 887 F. 2d

700, 703 (CA6 1989); Stenzel v. Ellis, 916 F. 2d 423, 427 (CA81990); Brown v. Smith, 813 F. 2d 1187, 1188 (CA11 1987).
But see Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F. 2d 124, 130 (CA1 1988)(rejecting application of

Whitley standard absent "an actualdisturbance").

A
Under the Whitley approach, the extent of injury sufferedby an inmate is one factor that may suggest "whether the

use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary" ina particular situation, "or instead evinced such wantonness
with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is tanta-mount to a knowing willingness that it occur." 475 U. S., at
321. In determining whether the use of force was wantonand unnecessary, it may also be proper to evaluate the need
for application of force, the relationship between that needand the amount of force used, the threat "reasonably perceived by the responsible officials," and "any efforts madeto temper the severity of a forceful response." Ibid. The
absence of serious injury is therefore relevant to the EighthAmendment inquiry, but does not end it.

8 HUDSON v. McMILLIAN

Opinion of the Court
Respondents nonetheless assert that a significant injuryrequirement of the sort imposed by the Fifth Circuit is mandated by what we have termed the "objective component" ofEighth Amendment analysis. See

Wilson v. Seiter, 501
U. S. 294, 298 (1991). Wilson extended the deliberate indifference standard applied to Eighth Amendment claims in-volving medical care to claims about conditions of confinement. In taking this step, we suggested that the subjectiveaspect of an Eighth Amendment claim (with which the Court
was concerned) can be distinguished from the objective facetof the same claim. Thus, courts considering a prisoner's
claim must ask both if "the officials act[ed] with a sufficiently
culpable state of mind" and if the alleged wrongdoing was
objectively "harmful enough" to establish a constitutional violation. Id., at 298, 303.

With respect to the objective component of an Eighth
Amendment violation, Wilson announced no new rule. Instead, that decision suggested a relationship between the requirements applicable to different types of Eighth Amendment claims. What is necessary to show sufficient harm for
purposes of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause depends upon the claim at issue, for two reasons. First, "[t]he
general requirement that an Eighth Amendment claimant
allege and prove the unnecessary and wanton infliction of
pain should . . . be applied with due regard for differences in
the kind of conduct against which an Eighth Amendment
objection is lodged." Whitley, supra, at 320. Second, the
Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments " `draw[s] its meaning from the evolving standards
of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,' "
and so admits of few absolute limitations. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 346 (1981) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356
U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).

The objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim
is therefore contextual and responsive to "contemporary
standards of decency." Estelle, supra, at 103. For in503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT

9Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
stance, extreme deprivations are required to make out aconditions-of-confinement claim. Because routine discomfort is "part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay fortheir offenses against society,"

Rhodes, supra, at 347, "only
those deprivations denying `the minimal civilized measure of
life's necessities' are sufficiently grave to form the basis ofan Eighth Amendment violation."

Wilson, supra, at 298
(quoting Rhodes, supra, at 347) (citation omitted). A similaranalysis applies to medical needs. Because society does not

expect that prisoners will have unqualified access to healthcare, deliberate indifference to medical needs amounts to an
Eighth Amendment violation only if those needs are "serious." See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S., at 103-104.

In the excessive force context, society's expectations are
different. When prison officials maliciously and sadistically
use force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decency
always are violated. See Whitley, supra, at 327. This is
true whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical
punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting
less than some arbitrary quantity of injury. Such a result
would have been as unacceptable to the drafters of the
Eighth Amendment as it is today. See Estelle, supra, at
102 (proscribing torture and barbarous punishment was "the
primary concern of the drafters" of the Eighth Amendment);
Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879) ("[I]t is safe to
affirm that punishments of torture . . . and all others in the
same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by [the
Eighth Amendment]").

That is not to say that every malevolent touch by a prison
guard gives rise to a federal cause of action. See Johnson
v. Glick, 481 F. 2d, at 1033 ("Not every push or shove, even
if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's
chambers, violates a prisoner's constitutional rights"). The
Eighth Amendment's prohibition of "cruel and unusual" punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition

503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT
10 HUDSON v. McMILLIAN

Opinion of the Court
de minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use offorce is not of a sort " `repugnant to the conscience of mankind.' " Whitley, 475 U. S., at 327 (quoting Estelle, supra,at 106) (internal quotation marks omitted).

In this case, the Fifth Circuit found Hudson's claim untena-ble because his injuries were "minor." 929 F. 2d, at 1015.
Yet the blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises,swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are not
de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes. The extentof Hudson's injuries thus provides no basis for dismissal of
his $ 1983 claim. B

The dissent's theory that Wilson requires an inmate whoalleges excessive use of force to show serious injury

in addi-tion to the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain misapplies Wilson and ignores the body of our Eighth Amendmentjurisprudence. As we have already suggested, the question
before the Court in Wilson was "[w]hether a prisoner claim-ing that conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment must show a culpable state of mind on thepart of prison officials, and, if so, what state of mind is required." Wilson, supra, at 296. Wilson presented neitheran allegation of excessive force nor any issue relating to what
was dubbed the "objective component" of an Eighth Amend-ment claim.

Wilson did touch on these matters in the course of summa-rizing our prior holdings, beginning with Estelle v. Gamble,
supra. Estelle, we noted, first applied the Cruel and Un-usual Punishments Clause to deprivations that were not
specifically part of the prisoner's sentence. Wilson, supra,at 297. As might be expected from this primacy,

Estellestated the principle underlying the cases discussed in Wilson: Punishments "incompatible with the evolving standardsof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society" or
"involv[ing] the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain"are "repugnant to the Eighth Amendment." Estelle, supra,

503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT

11Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
at 102-103 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is thesame rule the dissent would reject. With respect to the objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim, however,Wilson suggested no departure from Estelle and its progeny.

The dissent's argument that claims based on excessiveforce and claims based on conditions of confinement are no
different in kind, post, at 24-25, and n. 4, is likewise un-founded. Far from rejecting

Whitley's insight that the un-necessary and wanton infliction of pain standard must be

applied with regard for the nature of the alleged EighthAmendment violation, the Wilson Court adopted it. See
Wilson, 501 U. S., at 302-303. How could it be otherwisewhen the constitutional touchstone is whether punishment is
cruel and unusual? To deny, as the dissent does, the differ-ence between punching a prisoner in the face and serving
him unappetizing food is to ignore the " `concepts of dignity,civilized standards, humanity, and decency' " that animate
the Eighth Amendment. Estelle, supra, at 102 (quoting
Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F. 2d 571, 579 (CA8 1968)).

C
Respondents argue that, aside from the significant injurytest applied by the Fifth Circuit, their conduct cannot constitute an Eighth Amendment violation because it was "isolatedand unauthorized." Brief for Respondents 28. The beating
of Hudson, they contend, arose from "a personal dispute be-tween correctional security officers and a prisoner," and was
against prison policy. Ibid. Respondents invoke the rea-soning of courts that have held the use of force by prison
officers under such circumstances beyond the scope of "pun-ishment" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. See

John-son v. Glick, supra, at 1032 ("[A]lthough a spontaneous attack by a guard is `cruel' and, we hope, `unusual,' it does notfit any ordinary concept of `punishment' "); George v. Evans,
633 F. 2d 413, 416 (CA5 1980) ("[A] single, unauthorized as-sault by a guard does not constitute cruel and unusual pun503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT

ishment . . ."). But see Duckworth v. Franzen, 780 F. 2d645, 652 (CA7 1985) ("If a guard decided to supplement a

prisoner's official punishment by beating him, this would bepunishment . . ."), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 816 (1986).

We take no position on respondents' legal argument be-cause we find it inapposite on this record. The Court of
Appeals left intact the Magistrate's determination that theviolence at issue in this case was "not an isolated assault."
App. 27, n. 1. Indeed, there was testimony that McMillianand Woods beat another prisoner shortly after they finished
with Hudson. Ibid. To the extent that respondents rely onthe unauthorized nature of their acts, they make a claim not
addressed by the Fifth Circuit, not presented by the ques-tion on which we granted certiorari, and, accordingly, not
before this Court. Moreover, respondents ignore the Mag-istrate's finding that Lieutenant Mezo, acting as a supervisor,
"expressly condoned the use of force in this instance."App. 26.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

In Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312 (1986), the Court heldthat injuries to prisoners do not constitute cruel and unusual
punishment when they are inflicted during a prison disturb-ance that "indisputably poses significant risks to the safety
of inmates and prison staff " unless force was applied " `mali-ciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing
harm.' " Id., at 320-321 (citation omitted). The Court's
opinion explained that the justification for that particularlyhigh standard of proof was required by the exigencies present during a serious prison disturbance. "When the `ever-present potential for violent confrontation and conflagration'
ripens into actual unrest and conflict," id., at 321 (citationomitted), then prison officials must be permitted to "take

13Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)
Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
into account the very real threats the unrest presents toinmates and prison officials alike."

Id., at 320.
Absent such special circumstances, however, the lessdemanding standard of " `unnecessary and wanton infliction

of pain' " should be applied. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97,
104 (1976) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 173 (1976)( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.)); see
Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F. 2d 124, 135 (CA1 1988) (opinionof Campbell, C. J.) ("[W]here institutional security is not at

stake, the officials' license to use force is more limited; tosucceed, a plaintiff need not prove malicious and sadistic intent"); see also Wyatt v. Delaney, 818 F. 2d 21, 23 (CA8 1987).This approach is consistent with the Court's admonition in
Whitley that the standard to be used is one that gives "due
regard for differences in the kind of conduct against which
an Eighth Amendment objection is lodged." 475 U. S., at
320. In this case, because there was no prison disturbance
and "no need to use any force since the plaintiff was already
in restraints," App. 27, the prison guards' attack upon petitioner resulted in the infliction of unnecessary and wanton
pain. Id., at 28.

Although I think that the Court's reliance on the malicious
and sadistic standard is misplaced, I agree with the Court
that even this more demanding standard was met here. Accordingly, I concur in Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the
Court's opinion and in its judgment.

Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment.
The Court today appropriately puts to rest a seriously
misguided view that pain inflicted by an excessive use of
force is actionable under the Eighth Amendment only when
coupled with "significant injury," e. g., injury that requires
medical attention or leaves permanent marks. Indeed, were
we to hold to the contrary, we might place various kinds of
state-sponsored torture and abuse--of the kind ingeniously
designed to cause pain but without a telltale "significant

503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT
14 HUDSON v. McMILLIAN

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
injury"--entirely beyond the pale of the Constitution. Inother words, the constitutional prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishments" then might not constrain prison officialsfrom lashing prisoners with leather straps, whipping them
with rubber hoses, beating them with naked fists, shockingthem with electric currents, asphyxiating them short of
death, intentionally exposing them to undue heat or cold,or forcibly injecting them with psychosis-inducing drugs.
These techniques, commonly thought to be practiced onlyoutside this Nation's borders, are hardly unknown within
this Nation's prisons. See, e. g., Campbell v. Grammer, 889F. 2d 797, 802 (CA8 1989) (use of high-powered fire hoses);
Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F. 2d 571, 574-575 (CA8 1968) (use ofthe "Tucker Telephone," a hand-cranked device that generated electric shocks to sensitive body parts, and floggingwith leather strap). See also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,
682, n. 5 (1978).Because I was in the dissent in Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S.
312, 328 (1986), I do not join the Court's extension of Whitley's malicious-and-sadistic standard to all allegations of ex-cessive force, even outside the context of a prison riot. Nevertheless, I otherwise join the Court's solid opinion andjudgment that the Eighth Amendment does not require a
showing of "significant injury" in the excessive-force context.I write separately to highlight two concerns not addressed
by the Court in its opinion. I

Citing rising caseloads, respondents, represented by theAttorney General of Louisiana, and joined by the States of
Texas, Hawaii, Nevada, Wyoming, and Florida as amici curiae, suggest that a "significant injury" requirement is neces-sary to curb the number of court filings by prison inmates.

We are informed that the "significant injury requirement hasbeen very effective in the Fifth Circuit in helping to control
its system-wide docket management problems." Brief forTexas et al. as Amici Curiae 15.

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
This audacious approach to the Eighth Amendment as-sumes that the interpretation of an explicit constitutional

protection is to be guided by pure policy preferences for theparing down of prisoner petitions. Perhaps judicial overload is an appropriate concern in determining whether statutory standing to sue should be conferred upon certain plain-tiffs. See,

e. g., Associated General Contractors of Cal.,
Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 529-546 (1983) (identifying"judge-made rules" circumscribing persons entitled to sue

under $ 4 of the Clayton Act); Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor
Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 737-749 (1975) (identifying judicial "policy" considerations limiting standing under $ 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). But this inherently
self-interested concern has no appropriate role in interpreting the contours of a substantive constitutional right.

Since the burden on the courts is presumably worth bearing when a prisoner's suit has merit, the States' "concern" is
more aptly termed a "conclusion" that such suits are simply
without merit. One's experience on the federal bench
teaches the contrary. Moreover, were particular classes of
cases to be nominated for exclusion from the federal courthouse, we might look first to cases in which federal law is
not sensitively at issue rather than to those in which fundamental constitutional rights are at stake. The right to file
for legal redress in the courts is as valuable to a prisoner
as to any other citizen. Indeed, for the prisoner it is more
valuable. Inasmuch as one convicted of a serious crime and
imprisoned usually is divested of the franchise, the right to
file a court action stands, in the words of Yick Wo v. Hopkins,
118 U. S. 356, 370 (1886), as his most "fundamental political
right, because preservative of all rights."

Today's ruling, in any event, does not open the floodgates
for filings by prison inmates. By statute, prisoners--alone
among all other $ 1983 claimants--are required to exhaust
administrative remedies. See 94 Stat. 352, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1997e(a); Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S.

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
496, 507-512 (1982). Moreover, prison officials are entitled
to a determination before trial whether they acted in an objectively reasonable manner, thereby entitling them to a
qualified immunity defense. Procunier v. Navarette, 434
U. S. 555, 561-562 (1978); see also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S. 800, 817-818 (1982) (unsubstantiated allegations of malice are insufficient to overcome pretrial qualified immunity).
Additionally, a federal district court is authorized to dismiss
a prisoner's complaint in forma pauperis "if satisfied that
the action is frivolous or malicious." 28 U. S. C. $ 1915(d).
These measures should be adequate to control any docketmanagement problems that might result from meritless prisoner claims.

I do not read anything in the Court's opinion to limit injury cognizable under the Eighth Amendment to physical injury. It is not hard to imagine inflictions of psychological
harm--without corresponding physical harm--that might
prove to be cruel and unusual punishment. See, e. g., Wisniewski v. Kennard, 901 F. 2d 1276, 1277 (CA5) (guard placing a revolver in inmate's mouth and threatening to blow
prisoner's head off), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 926 (1990). The
issue was not presented here, because Hudson did not allege
that he feared that the beating incident would be repeated or
that it had caused him anxiety and depression. See App. 29.

As the Court makes clear, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the unnecessary and wanton infliction of "pain," rather
than "injury." Ante, at 5. "Pain" in its ordinary meaning
surely includes a notion of psychological harm. I am unaware of any precedent of this Court to the effect that psychological pain is not cognizable for constitutional purposes.
If anything, our precedent is to the contrary. See Sierra
Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 734 (1972) (recognizing Article
III standing for "aesthetic" injury); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 494 (1954) (identifying schoolchildren's

feelings of psychological inferiority from segregation in thepublic schools).

To be sure, as the Court's opinion intimates, ante, at 9, deminimis or nonmeasurable pain is not actionable under the
Eighth Amendment. But psychological pain can be morethan

de minimis. Psychological pain often may be clinicallydiagnosed and quantified through well-established methods,

as in the ordinary tort context where damages for pain andsuffering are regularly awarded. I have no doubt that to
read a "physical pain" or "physical injury" requirement intothe Eighth Amendment would be no less pernicious and
without foundation than the "significant injury" requirementwe reject today.

We granted certiorari in this case "limited to the followingquestion," which we formulated for the parties:

" `Did the Fifth Circuit apply the correct legal test whendetermining that petitioner's claim that his Eighth
Amendment rights under the Cruel and Unusual Punish-ments Clause were not violated as a result of a single
incident of force by respondents which did not cause asignificant injury?' " 500 U. S. 903 (1991).

Guided by what it considers "the evolving standards of de-cency that mark the progress of a maturing society," ante,
at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court today an-swers that question in the negative. I would answer it in
the affirmative, and would therefore affirm the judgment ofthe Fifth Circuit. I respectfully dissent.

appeal did not disturb that assessment, and it has not beenchallenged here. The sole issue in this case, as it comes to

us, is a legal one: Must a prisoner who claims to have beensubjected to "cruel and unusual punishments" establish at a
minimum that he has suffered a significant injury? TheCourt today not only responds in the negative, but broadly
asserts that any "unnecessary and wanton" use of physicalforce against a prisoner

automatically amounts to cruel andunusual punishment, whenever more than de minimis force

is involved. Even a de minimis use of force, the Court goeson to declare, inflicts cruel and unusual punishment where it
is "repugnant to the conscience of mankind." Ante, at 10(internal quotation marks omitted).

1 The extent to which a

prisoner is injured by the force--indeed, whether he is in-jured at all--is in the Court's view irrelevant.

In my view, a use of force that causes only insignificantharm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it
may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under otherprovisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not cruel and
unusual punishment. In concluding to the contrary, theCourt today goes far beyond our precedents.

A
Until recent years, the Cruel and Unusual PunishmentsClause was not deemed to apply at all to deprivations that

were not inflicted as part of the sentence for a crime. Forgenerations, judges and commentators regarded the Eighth
Amendment as applying only to torturous punishmentsmeted out by statutes or sentencing judges, and not generally to any hardship that might befall a prisoner duringincarceration. In Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349
(1910), the Court extensively chronicled the background ofthe Amendment, discussing its English antecedents, its adoption by Congress, its construction by this Court, and the in1 This point is pure dictum, because the force here was surely not de
minimis.

terpretation of analogous provisions by state courts. No-where does

Weems even hint that the Clause might regulate
not just criminal sentences but the treatment of prisoners.Scholarly commentary also viewed the Clause as governing

punishments that were part of the sentence. See T. Cooley,
Constitutional Limitations *329 ("It is certainly difficult todetermine precisely what is meant by cruel and unusual punishments. Probably any punishment declared by statute foran offence which was punishable in the same way at the common law, could not be regarded as cruel or unusual in theconstitutional sense. And probably any new statutory offence may be punished to the extent and in the mode permitted by the common law for offences of similar nature. But
those degrading punishments which in any State had become
obsolete before its existing constitution was adopted, we
think may well be held forbidden by it as cruel and unusual")
(emphasis added). See also 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the
Constitution of the United States 750-751 (1833).

Surely prison was not a more congenial place in the early
years of the Republic than it is today; nor were our judges
and commentators so naive as to be unaware of the often
harsh conditions of prison life. Rather, they simply did not
conceive of the Eighth Amendment as protecting inmates
from harsh treatment. Thus, historically, the lower courts
routinely rejected prisoner grievances by explaining that the
courts had no role in regulating prison life. "[I]t is well settled that it is not the function of the courts to superintend
the treatment and discipline of prisoners in penitentiaries,
but only to deliver from imprisonment those who are illegally
confined." Stroud v. Swope, 187 F. 2d 850, 851-852 (CA9),

was not until 1976--185 years after the Eighth Amendmentwas adopted--that this Court first applied it to a prisoner's

complaint about a deprivation suffered in prison. Estelle v.Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976).

B
We made clear in Estelle that the Eighth Amendmentplays a very limited role in regulating prison administration.

The case involved a claim that prison doctors had inade-quately attended an inmate's medical needs. We rejected
the claim because the inmate failed to allege "acts or omis-sions sufficiently harmful to evidence

deliberate indifferenceto serious medical needs." Id., at 106 (emphasis added).

From the outset, thus, we specified that the Eighth Amend-ment does not apply to every deprivation, or even every unnecessary deprivation, suffered by a prisoner, but only thatnarrow class of deprivations involving "serious" injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a culpable state of mind.We have since described these twin elements as the "objective" and "subjective" components of an Eighth Amendmentprison claim. See

Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 298 (1991).We have never found a violation of the Eighth Amendment

in the prison context when an inmate has failed to establisheither of these elements. In

Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S.337 (1981), for instance, we upheld a practice of placing two

inmates in a single cell on the ground that the injury allegedwas insufficiently serious. Only where prison conditions
deny an inmate "the minimal civilized measure of life's ne-cessities," id., at 347, we said, could they be considered cruel
and unusual punishment. Similarly, in Whitley v. Albers,475 U. S. 312 (1986), we held that a guard did not violate the
Eighth Amendment when he shot an inmate during a prisonriot because he had not acted with a sufficiently culpable
state of mind. When an official uses force to quell a riot, wesaid, he does not violate the Eighth Amendment unless he
acts " `maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of

sub
nom. John v. Johnson, 414 U. S. 1033 (1973)).We synthesized our Eighth Amendment prison jurisprudence last Term in Wilson, supra. There the inmate alleged
that the poor conditions of his confinement per se amountedto cruel and unusual punishment, and argued that he should

not be required in addition to establish that officials actedculpably. We rejected that argument, emphasizing that
an inmate seeking to establish that a prison deprivationamounts to cruel and unusual punishment always must satisfy both the "objective component . . . (Was the deprivation
sufficiently serious?)" and the "subjective component (Did
the officials act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind?)"
of the Eighth Amendment. Id., at 298. Both are necessary
components; neither suffices by itself.

These subjective and objective components, of course, are
implicit in the traditional Eighth Amendment jurisprudence,
which focuses on penalties meted out by statutes or sentencing judges. Thus, if a State were to pass a statute ordering
that convicted felons be broken at the wheel, we would not
separately inquire whether the legislature had acted with
"deliberate indifference," since a statute, as an intentional
act, necessarily satisfies an even higher state-of-mind threshold. Likewise, the inquiry whether the deprivation is objectively serious would be encompassed within our determination whether it was "cruel and unusual."

When we cut the Eighth Amendment loose from its historical moorings and applied it to a broad range of prison deprivations, we found it appropriate to make explicit the limitations described in Estelle, Rhodes, Whitley, and Wilson. "If
the pain inflicted is not formally meted out as punishment
by the statute or the sentencing judge, some mental element
must be attributed to the inflicting officer before it can qualify," Wilson, 501 U. S., at 300 (emphasis in original)--thus,
the subjective component. Similarly, because deprivations

Thomas, J., dissenting
of all sorts are the very essence of imprisonment, we madeexplicit the serious deprivation requirement to ensure that

the Eighth Amendment did not transfer wholesale the regu-lation of prison life from executive officials to judges. That
is why, in Wilson, we described the inquiry mandated by theobjective component as: "[W]as the deprivation

sufficientlyserious?" Id., at 298 (emphasis added). That formulation

plainly reveals our prior assumption that a serious depriva-tion is always required. Under that analysis, a court's task
in any given case was to determine whether the challengeddeprivation was "sufficiently" serious. It was not, as the
Court's interpretation today would have it, to determinewhether a "serious" deprivation

is required at all.2

C
Given Estelle, Rhodes, Whitley, and Wilson, one mighthave assumed that the Court would have little difficulty answering the question presented in this case by upholding theFifth Circuit's "significant injury" requirement.

3 Instead,

the Court announces that "[t]he objective component of anEighth Amendment claim is . . . contextual and responsive

to contemporary standards of decency." Ante, at 8 (internalquotation marks omitted). In the context of claims alleging
the excessive use of physical force, the Court then asserts,the serious deprivation requirement is satisfied by no serious
deprivation at all. "When prison officials maliciously and

2 While granting petitioner relief on his Eighth Amendment claim, the
Court leaves open the issue whether isolated and unauthorized acts are
"punishment" at all. This will, of course, be the critical question in future
cases of this type. If we ultimately decide that isolated and unauthorized
acts are not "punishment," then today's decision is a dead letter. That
anomaly simply highlights the artificiality of applying the Eighth Amendment to prisoner grievances, whether caused by the random misdeeds of
prison officials or by official policy.

3 I do not believe that there is any substantive difference between the

"serious deprivation" requirement found in our precedents and the Fifth
Circuit's "significant injury" requirement.

sadistically use force to cause harm, contemporary standardsof decency always are violated."

Ante, at 9. Ascertaining
prison officials' state of mind, in other words, is the onlyrelevant inquiry in deciding whether such cases involve cruel

and unusual punishment. In my view, this approach is an
unwarranted and unfortunate break with our Eighth Amend-ment prison jurisprudence.

The Court purports to derive the answer to this case from
Whitley. The sum and substance of an Eighth Amendment
violation, the Court asserts, is " ` "the unnecessary and wan-ton infliction of pain." ' "

Ante, at 5 (quoting Whitley, 475
U. S., at 319). This formulation has the advantage, from the
Court's perspective, of eliminating the objective component.
As noted above, however, the only dispute in Whitley concerned the subjective component; the prisoner, who had been
shot, had self-evidently been subjected to an objectively serious injury. Whitley did not say, as the Court does today,
that the objective component is contextual, and that an
Eighth Amendment claim may succeed where a prisoner is
not seriously injured. Rather, Whitley stands for the proposition that, assuming the existence of an objectively serious
deprivation, the culpability of an official's state of mind depends on the context in which he acts. "Whitley teaches
that, assuming the conduct is harmful enough to satisfy the
objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim, see
Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337 (1981), whether it can be
characterized as `wanton' depends upon the constraints facing the official." Wilson, supra, at 303 (emphasis modified).
Whether officials subject a prisoner to the "unnecessary and
wanton infliction of pain" is simply one way to describe the
state of mind inquiry that was at issue in Whitley itself.
As Wilson made clear, that inquiry is necessary but not sufficient when a prisoner seeks to show that he has been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.

Perhaps to compensate for its elimination of the objective
component in excessive force cases, the Court simultane503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT
24 HUDSON v. McMILLIAN

Thomas, J., dissenting
ously makes it harder for prisoners to establish the subjec-tive component. As we explained in Wilson, "deliberate indifference" is the baseline mental state required to establishan Eighth Amendment violation. 501 U. S., at 303. Departure from this baseline is justified where, as in Whitley,prison officials act in response to an emergency; in such situations their conduct cannot be characterized as "wanton" un-less it is taken "maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm." 475 U. S., at 320-321 (internalquotation marks omitted). The Court today extends the
heightened mental state applied in Whitley to all excessiveforce cases, even where no competing institutional concerns
are present. The Court simply asserts that "[m]any ofthe concerns underlying our holding in Whitley arise whenever guards use force to keep order." Ante, at 6 (emphasisadded). I do not agree. Many excessive force cases do not
arise from guards' attempts to "keep order." (In this verycase, the basis for petitioner's Eighth Amendment claim is
that the guards hit him when there was no need for them touse any force at all.) The use of excessive physical force is
by no means invariably (in fact, perhaps not even predomi-nantly) accompanied by a "malicious and sadistic" state of
mind. I see no justification for applying the extraordinary
Whitley standard to all excessive force cases, without regardto the constraints facing prison officials. The Court's unwarranted extension of Whitley, I can only suppose, is drivenby the implausibility of saying that minor injuries imposed
upon prisoners with anything less than a "malicious andsadistic" state of mind can amount to cruel and unusual
punishment. D

The Court's attempts to distinguish the cases expresslyresting upon the objective component are equally unconvincing. As noted above, we have required an extreme depriva-tion in cases challenging conditions of confinement,

Rhodesv. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337 (1981). Why should such an ob503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., dissenting
jectively serious deprivation be required there and not here?
The Court's explanation is that "routine discomfort is `part
of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses
against society.' " Ante, at 9 (quoting Rhodes, supra, at
347). But there is quite a gap between "routine discomfort"
and the denial of "the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities" required to establish an Eighth Amendment violation. In the Court's view, then, our society's standards of
decency are not violated by anything short of uncivilized conditions of confinement (no matter how malicious the mental
state of the officials involved), but are automatically violated
by any malicious use of force, regardless of whether it even
causes an injury. This is puzzling. I see no reason why our
society's standards of decency should be more readily offended when officials, with a culpable state of mind, subject
a prisoner to a deprivation on one discrete occasion than
when they subject him to continuous deprivations over time.
If anything, I would think that a deprivation inflicted continuously over a long period would be of greater concern
to society than a deprivation inflicted on one particular
occasion.4

The Court's attempted distinction of Estelle is also unpersuasive: "Because society does not expect that prisoners will

4 Moreover, by distinguishing this case from "conditions" cases, the
Court resurrects a distinction that we have repudiated as "not only unsupportable in principle but unworkable in practice." Wilson v. Seiter, 501
U. S. 294, 299, and n. 1 (1991). When officials use force against a prisoner,
whether once or every day, that is a "condition" of his confinement. It is
unwise, in my view, to make the very existence of the serious deprivation
requirement depend on whether a particular claim is characterized as one
challenging a "condition" or one challenging a "specific act." Cf. McCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U. S. 136, 139, 143 (1991) ("[C]onditions of confinement" under 28 U. S. C. $ 636(b)(1)(B) include not only challenges to
ongoing prison conditions but also challenges to "isolated incidents" of
excessive force, in part because "the distinction between cases challenging
ongoing conditions and those challenging specific acts of alleged misconduct will often be difficult to identify").

Thomas, J., dissenting
have unqualified access to health care, deliberate indiffer-ence to medical needs amounts to an Eighth Amendment violation only if those needs are `serious.' " Ante, at 9. In myview, our society similarly has no expectation that prisoners
will have "unqualified" freedom from force, since forcibly
keeping prisoners in detention is what prisons are all about.Why should the seriousness of injury matter when doctors

maliciously decide not to treat an inmate, but not whenguards maliciously decide to strike him?

At bottom, of course, there is no conclusive way to refutethe Court's assertions about our society's "contemporary notions of decency." That is precisely why this Court has long
insisted that determinations of whether punishment is cruel
and unusual "should be informed by objective factors to the
maximum possible extent," Rhodes, supra, at 346 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

The Court attempts to justify its departure from precedent by saying that if a showing of serious injury were required, "the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical
punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting
less than some arbitrary quantity of injury." Ante, at 9.
That statement, in my view, reveals a central flaw in the
Court's reasoning. "[D]iabolic or inhuman" punishments by
definition inflict serious injury. That is not to say that the
injury must be, or always will be, physical. "Many things--
beating with a rubber truncheon, water torture, electric
shock, incessant noise, reruns of `Space 1999'--may cause
agony as they occur yet leave no enduring injury. The state
is not free to inflict such pains without cause just so long as
it is careful to leave no marks." Williams v. Boles, 841 F. 2d
181, 183 (CA7 1988). Surely a prisoner who alleges that
prison officials tortured him with a device like the notorious
"Tucker Telephone" described by Justice Blackmun, ante,
at 14, has alleged a serious injury. But petitioner has not
alleged a deprivation of this type; the injuries he has alleged
are entirely physical and were found below to be "minor."

Thomas, J., dissenting
Furthermore, to characterize the serious injury requirement as "arbitrary" is not to explain why it should be eliminated in this particular context while it remains applicable
to all other prison deprivations. To be sure, it will not always be obvious which injuries are "serious." But similarly, it will not always be obvious which medical needs are
"serious," or which conditions of confinement deny "the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities." These determinations are, however, required by the Eighth Amendment,
which prohibits only those punishments that are "cruel and
unusual." As explained above, I think our precedents
clearly establish that a prisoner seeking to prove that he
has been subjected to "cruel and unusual" punishment must
always show that he has suffered a serious deprivation.

If the Court is to be taken at its word that "the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain" upon a prisoner per se
amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, the implications
of today's opinion are sweeping. For this formulation replaces the objective component described in our prior cases
with a "necessity" component. Many prison deprivations,
however, are not "necessary," at least under any meaningful definition of that word. Thus, under today's analysis,
Rhodes was wrongly decided. Surely the "double celling"
of inmates was not "necessary" to fulfill the State's penal
mission; in fact, the prison in that case had been designed
for individual cells, but was simply overcrowded. 452 U. S.,
at 343. We rejected the prisoners' claim in Rhodes not because we determined that double celling was "necessary,"
but because the deprivations alleged were not sufficiently
serious to state a claim of cruel and unusual punishment.
After today, the "necessity" of a deprivation is apparently
the only relevant inquiry beyond the wantonness of official
conduct. This approach, in my view, extends the Eighth
Amendment beyond all reasonable limits.

Thomas, J., dissenting

II
Today's expansion of the Cruel and Unusual PunishmentsClause beyond all bounds of history and precedent is, I suspect, yet another manifestation of the pervasive view thatthe Federal Constitution must address all ills in our society.
Abusive behavior by prison guards is deplorable conductthat properly evokes outrage and contempt. But that does
not mean that it is invariably unconstitutional. The EighthAmendment is not, and should not be turned into, a National
Code of Prison Regulation. To reject the notion that theinfliction of concededly "minor" injuries can be considered
either "cruel" or "unusual" punishment (much less cruel andunusual punishment) is not to say that it amounts to acceptable conduct. Rather, it is to recognize that primary re-sponsibility for preventing and punishing such conduct rests
not with the Federal Constitution but with the laws and reg-ulations of the various States.

Petitioner apparently could have, but did not, seek redressfor his injuries under state law.

UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 90-1629. Argued December 9, 1991--Decided February 25, 1992
After respondent Nordic Village, Inc., filed a petition for relief under

Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, one of its officers withdrew funds
from the company's corporate account. He sent part of the money to
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), directing it to apply the funds
against his individual tax liability, which it did. In a subsequent adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court permitted Nordic Village's
trustee to recover the transfer and entered a monetary judgment
against the IRS. The District Court affirmed, as did the Court of Appeals, which rejected a jurisdictional defense that sovereign immunity
barred the judgment.

Held:

1. Section 106(c) of the Code does not waive the United States' sovereign immunity from an action seeking monetary recovery in bankruptcy. Pp. 32-37.

(a) Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492
U. S. 96, does not control this case, since the plurality and the dissent
therein were evenly divided over the issue whether $ 106(c) authorizes
a monetary recovery against a State, and since the deciding vote of
the concurrence, denying amenability to suit, rested upon the Eleventh
Amendment, which is applicable only to the States. However, the plurality's reasoning is relevant and is relied on here. Pp. 32-33.

(b) Section 106(c) does not "unequivocally express" a waiver of
the Government's immunity from actions for monetary relief, as is necessary for such a waiver to be effective. See, e. g., Irwin v. Department
of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95. In contrast to $$ 106(a) and (b),
which plainly waive immunity with regard to monetary relief as to specified claims, $ 106(c) is susceptible of at least two plausible interpretations
that do not authorize monetary relief. Legislative history has no bearing on this point, for the "unequivocal expression" of waiver must be an
expression in statutory text. Hoffman, supra, at 104. Pp. 33-37.

2. Respondent's several alternative grounds for affirming the judgment below--that 28 U. S. C. $ 1334(d)'s broad jurisdictional grant provides the necessary waiver, that a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction
overrides sovereign immunity, and that a waiver of sovereign immunity
is supported by trust law principles--are unpersuasive. Pp. 37-39.

915 F. 2d 1049, reversed.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents a narrow question: Does $ 106(c) of theBankruptcy Code waive the sovereign immunity of the

United States from an action seeking monetary recovery inbankruptcy?

I
Respondent Nordic Village, Inc., filed a petition for reliefunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in March 1984.

About four months later, Josef Lah, an officer and share-holder of Nordic Village, drew a $26,000 check on the company's corporate account, $20,000 of which was used to obtaina cashier's check in that amount payable to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Lah delivered this check to the IRSand directed it to apply the funds against his individual tax
liability, which it did.In December 1984, the trustee appointed for Nordic Village commenced an adversary proceeding in the BankruptcyCourt for the Northern District of Ohio, seeking to recover,
among other transfers, the $20,000 paid by Lah to the IRS.The Bankruptcy Court permitted the recovery. The unauthorized, postpetition transfer, the court determined, couldbe avoided under $ 549(a) and recovered from the IRS under

$ 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. It entered a judgmentagainst the IRS in the amount of $20,000, which the District
Court affirmed.

32 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 915 F. 2d 1049 (1990). It upheld
the reasoning of the lower courts and rejected a jurisdictional defense (raised for the first time on appeal) that sovereign immunity barred the judgment entered against the Government. We granted certiorari. 501 U. S. 1216 (1991).

II
Section 106 of the Bankruptcy Code provides:

"(a) A governmental unit is deemed to have waived
sovereign immunity with respect to any claim against
such governmental unit that is property of the estate
and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence
out of which such governmental unit's claim arose.

"(b) There shall be offset against an allowed claim or
interest of a governmental unit any claim against such
governmental unit that is property of the estate.

"(c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of
this section and notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity--

"(1) a provision of this title that contains `creditor,'
`entity,' or `governmental unit' applies to governmental
units; and

"(2) a determination by the court of an issue arising
under such a provision binds governmental units." 11
U. S. C. $ 106.

Three Terms ago we construed this provision in Hoffman
v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96
(1989). The issue there was whether $ 106(c) authorizes a
monetary recovery against a State. We held that it does
not, though the Justices supporting that judgment failed to
agree as to why. A plurality of the Court determined that

$ 106(c) does not permit a bankruptcy court to issue mone503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tary relief against a State. Id., at 102 (White, J., joined by
Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ.). Thatconclusion, the plurality said, was compelled by the language

of $ 106(c), the relationship between that subsection and therest of the statute, and the requirement that congressional
abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity beclearly expressed. The concurrence found it unnecessary to
construe the statute, concluding that Congress lacks author-ity under the Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate the States' immunity from money-damages actions. Id., at 105 (Scalia,
J., concurring in judgment). Like the Court of Appealshere, a dissent determined that the language of $ 106(c),

particularly that of paragraph (c)(1), supplies the necessarywaiver. Id., at 106 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan,

Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ.).Contrary to the Government's suggestion, Hoffman does

not control today's decision. It is true, to be sure, that Con-gress made clear in $ 106 that (insofar as is within Congress'
power) state and federal sovereigns are to be treated thesame for immunity purposes. See 11 U. S. C. $ 101(27) (1982
ed., Supp. II) (" `governmental unit' means United States[and] State"). Since, however, the Court in

Hoffman wasevenly divided over what that treatment was as to the

States; and since the deciding vote of the concurrence, deny-ing amenability to suit, rested upon a ground (the Eleventh
Amendment) applicable only to the States and not to theFederal Government, see

Federal Housing Authority v.Burr, 309 U. S. 242, 244 (1940); the holding in Hoffman has

no binding force here. The separate opinions dealing withthe statutory question are relevant, however, and we shall
in fact rely on the reasoning of the plurality.

III
Waivers of the Government's sovereign immunity, to beeffective, must be " `unequivocally expressed.' "

Irwin v.

503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT
34 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990)(quoting

United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, 538 (1980),
and United States v. King, 395 U. S. 1, 4 (1969)). Contraryto respondent's suggestion, moreover, they are not generally

to be "liberally construed." We have on occasion narrowly
construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunitywhere that was consistent with Congress' clear intent, as in

the context of the "sweeping language" of the Federal TortClaims Act,

United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543,
547 (1951), see, e. g., id., at 554-555, Block v. Neal, 460 U. S.289, 298 (1983),

United States v. Aetna Casualty & Surety
Co., 338 U. S. 366, 383 (1949), or as in the context of equally
broad "sue and be sued" clauses, see, e. g., Franchise Tax Bd.
of California v. United States Postal Service, 467 U. S. 512,
517-519 (1984), FHA v. Burr, supra, at 245. These cases
do not, however, eradicate the traditional principle that the
Government's consent to be sued "must be `construed strictly
in favor of the sovereign,' McMahon v. United States, 342
U. S. 25, 27 (1951), and not `enlarge[d] . . . beyond what
the language requires,' " Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463
U. S. 680, 685 (1983) (quoting Eastern Transportation Co. v.
United States, 272 U. S. 675, 686 (1927)), a rule of construction that we have had occasion to reaffirm once already this
Term, see Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 137 (1991).

Subsections (a) and (b) of $ 106 meet this "unequivocal expression" requirement with respect to monetary liability.
Addressing "claim[s]," which the Code defines as "right[s] to
payment," $ 101(4)(A), they plainly waive sovereign immunity with regard to monetary relief in two settings: compulsory counterclaims to governmental claims, $ 106(a); and permissive counterclaims to governmental claims capped by a
setoff limitation, $ 106(b). Next to these models of clarity
stands subsection (c). Though it, too, waives sovereign immunity, it fails to establish unambiguously that the waiver
extends to monetary claims. It is susceptible of at least two
interpretations that do not authorize monetary relief.

Opinion of the Court
Under one interpretation, $ 106(c) permits the bankruptcycourt to issue "declaratory and injunctive"--though not monetary--relief against the Government. Hoffman, 492 U. S.,at 102. This conclusion is reached by reading the two paragraphs of subsection (c) as complementary rather than independent: The first paragraph identifies the subject matter ofdisputes that courts may entertain under the subsection and

the second paragraph describes the relief that courts maygrant in such disputes. That is to say, the second paragraph
specifies the manner in which there shall be applied to gov-ernmental units the provisions identified by the first paragraph, i. e., a manner that permits declaratory or injunctive
relief but not an affirmative monetary recovery.

Several factors favor this construction. The distinction it
establishes--between suits for monetary claims and suits for
other relief--is a familiar one, and is suggested by the contrasting language used in subsections (a) and (b) ("claim[s]")
and in subsection (c) ("determination[s]" of "issue[s]"), Hoffman, 492 U. S., at 102. It also avoids eclipsing the carefully
drawn limitations placed on the waivers in subsections (a)
and (b). The principal provision of the Code permitting the
assertion of claims against persons other than the estate itself is $ 542(b), which provides that "an entity that owes a
debt that is property of the estate and that is matured, payable on demand, or payable on order, shall pay such debt to,
or on the order of, the trustee." If the first paragraph of

$ 106(c) means that, by reason of use of the trigger word "entity," this provision applies in all respects to governmental
units, then the Government may be sued on all alleged debts,
despite the prior specification in subsections (a) and (b) that
claims against the Government will lie only when the Government has filed a proof of claim, and even then only as a
setoff unless the claim is a compulsory counterclaim. Those
earlier limitations are reduced to trivial application if paragraph (c)(1) stands on its own. See id., at 101-102. This
construction also attaches practical consequences to para503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
graph (c)(2), whereas respondent's interpretation violates thesettled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed in

such fashion that every word has some operative effect. See
id., at 103; United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539
(1955). Respondent has suggested no function to be performed by paragraph (2) if paragraph (1) operates to treatthe Government like any other "entity" or "creditor," regardless of the type of relief authorized by an applicable Codeprovision.

Under this interpretation, $ 106(c), though not authorizingclaims for monetary relief, would nevertheless perform a significant function. It would permit a bankruptcy court to determine the amount and dischargeability of an estate's liability to the Government, such as unpaid federal taxes, see 11
U. S. C. $ 505(a)(1) (permitting the court to "determine the
amount or legality of any tax") (emphasis added), whether or
not the Government filed a proof of claim. See 492 U. S., at
102-103. Cf. Neavear v. Schweiker, 674 F. 2d 1201, 1203-
1204 (CA7 1982) (holding that under $ 106(c) a bankruptcy
court could discharge a debt owed to the Social Security Administration). The Government had repeatedly objected, on
grounds of sovereign immunity, to being bound by such determinations before $ 106(c) was enacted in 1978. See, e. g.,
McKenzie v. United States, 536 F. 2d 726, 728-729 (CA7
1976); Bostwick v. United States, 521 F. 2d 741, 742-744 (CA8
1975); Gwilliam v. United States, 519 F. 2d 407, 410 (CA9
1975); In re Durensky, 377 F. Supp. 798, 799-800 (ND Tex.
1974), appeal dism'd, 519 F. 2d 1024 (CA5 1975).

Subsection (c) is also susceptible of another construction
that would not permit recovery here. If the two paragraphs
of $ 106(c) are read as being independent, rather than the
second as limiting the first, then, pursuant to the first paragraph, Code provisions using the triggering words enumerated in paragraph (c)(1) would apply fully to governmental
units. But that application of those provisions would be limited by the requirements of subsections (a) and (b), in accord503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT

37Cite as: 503 U. S. 30 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
ance with the phrase that introduces subsection (c) ("Exceptas provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section"). This

exception, in other words, could be read to mean that therules established in subsections (a) and (b) for waiver of Government "claim[s]" that are "property of the estate" are ex-clusive, and preclude any resort to subsection (c) for that
purpose. That reading would bar the present suit, since theright to recover a postpetition transfer under $ 550 is clearly
a "claim" (defined in $ 101(4)(A)) and is "property of the es-tate" (defined in $ 541(a)(3)). (The dissent appears to read
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) as being independent but pro-vides no explanation of what the textual exception could
mean under that reading.)The foregoing are assuredly not the only readings of subsection (c), but they are plausible ones--which is enough toestablish that a reading imposing monetary liability on the
Government is not "unambiguous" and therefore should notbe adopted. Contrary to respondent's suggestion, legislative history has no bearing on the ambiguity point. As inthe Eleventh Amendment context, see

Hoffman, supra, at104, the "unequivocal expression" of elimination of sovereign

immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutorytext. If clarity does not exist there, it cannot be supplied
by a committee report. Cf. Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223,228-229 (1989).

IV
Respondent proposes several alternative grounds for af-firming the judgment below, all unpersuasive. First, it

claims that the necessary waiver can be found in 28 U. S. C.$ 1334(d), which grants the district court in which a bankruptcy case is initiated "exclusive jurisdiction of all of theproperty, wherever located, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate." Re-spondent urges us to construe this language as empowering
a bankruptcy court to compel the United States or a Stateto return any property, including money, that passes into the

503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT
38 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
estate upon commencement of the bankruptcy proceed-ing. Under this theory, a sovereign's exposure to suit

would not be governed by the specific language of $ 106,but would be concealed in the broad jurisdictional grant
of $ 1334(d). Besides being unprecedented and running
afoul of the unequivocal-expression requirement, this theoryclosely resembles an argument we rejected just last Term.

In Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775,786 (1991), the argument was made that Alaska's Eleventh
Amendment immunity to suit was abrogated by 28 U. S. C.$ 1362, a jurisdictional grant, akin to $ 1334(d), that gives district courts jurisdiction over "all civil actions, brought by
any Indian tribe . . . aris[ing] under the Constitution, laws,
or treaties of the United States." Rejecting that contention, we observed: "The fact that Congress grants jurisdiction to hear a claim does not suffice to show Congress has
abrogated all defenses to that claim. The issues are wholly
distinct." Id., at 787, n. 4.

Equally unpersuasive is respondent's related argument
that a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction overrides sovereign immunity. As an initial matter, the premise for that
argument is missing here, since respondent did not invoke,
and the Bankruptcy Court did not purport to exercise, in
rem jurisdiction. Respondent sought to recover a sum of
money, not "particular dollars," cf. Begier v. IRS, 496 U. S.
53, 62 (1990) (emphasis deleted), so there was no res to which
the court's in rem jurisdiction could have attached, see Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm'n v. McGinnes, 268 F. 2d 65, 66-67
(CA3), cert. denied, 361 U. S. 829 (1959). In any event, we
have never applied an in rem exception to the sovereignimmunity bar against monetary recovery, and have suggested that no such exception exists, see United States v.
Shaw, 309 U. S. 495, 502-503 (1940). Nor does United States
v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U. S. 198 (1983), establish such
an exception, or otherwise permit the relief requested here.
That case upheld a Bankruptcy Court order that the IRS

Stevens, J., dissenting
turn over tangible property of the debtor it had seized beforethe debtor filed for bankruptcy protection. A suit for payment of funds from the Treasury is quite different from asuit for the return of tangible property in which the debtor
retained ownership. The Court's opinion in Whiting Pools
contains no discussion of $ 106(c), and nothing in it suggeststhat an order granting monetary recovery from the United

States would be proper.Resort to the principles of trust law is also of no help to
respondent. Most of the trust decisions respondent citesare irrelevant, since they involve private entities, not the
Government. The one that does involve the Government,
Bull v. United States, 295 U. S. 247 (1935), concerns equitable
recoupment, a doctrine that has been substantially narrowed
by later cases, see United States v. Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 608(1990), and has no application here.

* * *
Neither $ 106(c) nor any other provision of law establishes
an unequivocal textual waiver of the Government's immunity
from a bankruptcy trustee's claims for monetary relief.Since Congress has not empowered a bankruptcy court to

order a recovery of money from the United States, the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.

The injustice that the Court condones today demonstratesthat it is time to reexamine the wisdom of the judge-made
rules that drive its decision.An officer of an insolvent corporation appropriated corporate funds and used them to discharge a personal tax obliga-tion. Because the Federal Government was the ultimate
recipient of the stolen property, the Court holds that the

503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT
40 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.

Stevens, J., dissenting
bankruptcy trustee cannot avoid the transfer. The interest
in a rigid interpretation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity outweighs the interest in equitable treatment of general
creditors and shareholders of the corporate debtor. This result is neither necessary nor just.

It is not necessary because both the text and the legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code support a contrary result. It is not just because nothing more than a misguided
interest in adherence to obsolete judge-made rules is at
stake. I shall comment first on the laws enacted by Congress and then on the rules that the Court itself has
ordained.

I

The text of $ 106 is straightforward. Because the case
does not involve either a counterclaim or an offset, subsections (a) and (b) are not applicable. Subsection (c) provides:

"(c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of
this section and notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity--

"(1) a provision of this title that contains `creditor,'
`entity,' or `governmental unit' applies to governmental
units; and

"(2) a determination by the court of an issue arising
under such a provision binds governmental units." 11
U. S. C. $ 106(c).

The United States is a "governmental unit," 1 and therefore
any provision of the Bankruptcy Code that contains one of
the "trigger words" listed in paragraph (c)(1) applies to the
United States. Section 550(a) is undoubtedly one such pro1 Section 101(27) defines the term "governmental unit" to include the
"United States [and any] department, agency, or instrumentality of the
United States." 11 U. S. C. $ 101(27) (1988 ed., Supp. II).

vision.2 Thus, "notwithstanding any assertion of sovereignimmunity," paragraph (c)(1) provides that $ 550(a) "applies"

to the United States, and paragraph (c)(2) provides that theGovernment is bound by the court's determination of the
issues arising under that provision. The literal text ofthe Act unquestionably forecloses the defense of sovereign
immunity.The legislative history unambiguously demonstrates that
Congress intended the statute to be read literally. The im-mediate purpose of $ 106(c) was to enable the bankruptcy
court to determine the amount and the dischargeability ofthe debtor's tax liabilities, but the sponsors of the amendment clearly stated that it covered "other matters as well,"specifically including the avoidance of preferential transfers.
124 Cong. Rec. 32394 (1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards); id.,at 33993 (statement of Sen. DeConcini).

3 The congressional

purpose to waive sovereign immunity is pellucidly clear.The Court evades this conclusion by hypothesizing "plausible" alternative constructions of the statute,4 by refusingto consider its legislative history,

5 and by reiterating the

2 Section 550(a) provides:
"(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to the extent that a
transfer is avoided under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, 553(b), or 724(a)
of this title, the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the
property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property, from--

"(1) the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit
such transfer was made; or

"(2) any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee."
3 See also the material summarized and quoted in my dissenting opinion

in Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96,

permits a trustee or debtor in possession to assert avoiding powers under
Title 11 against a governmental unit,' " id., at 112, and the comment that as
a result of $ 106(c) " `the government is subject to avoidance of preferential
transfers,' " id., at 113.

Court's view that waivers of sovereign immunity must bestrictly construed.

6 I shall not comment on the plausible alternatives except to note that they are obviously less satis-factory--both as a matter of sound bankruptcy policy and as

a principled interpretation of the English language--than aliteral reading of the statute. I shall, however, add a few
words about the Court's love affair with the doctrine of sov-ereign immunity.

II
Despite its ancient lineage, the doctrine of sovereign im-munity is nothing but a judge-made rule that is sometimes

favored 7 and sometimes disfavored.8 Its original relianceon the notion that a divinely ordained monarch "can do no
wrong" 9 is, of course, thoroughly discredited.10 Moreover,

it must be strictly construed' ") (quoting United States v. N. Y. Rayon Importing Co., 329 U. S. 654, 659 (1947)); Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463
U. S. 680, 685 (1983) ("Waivers of immunity must be `construed strictly in

(Because "a relinquishment of a sovereign immunity . . . must be strictly
interpreted," we construe the statutory language with "conservatism").

its persistent threat to the impartial administration of justicehas been repeatedly acknowledged and recognized.

11 Thus,

in Federal Housing Authority v. Burr, 309 U. S. 242, 245(1940), we remarked on "the current disfavor of the doctrine

of governmental immunity from suit." 12Time after time Congress has taken action to ameliorate
the hardship of the doctrine. A half century ago thisCourt observed:

"A sense of justice has brought a progressive relaxationby legislative enactments of the rigor of the immunity
rule. As representative governments attempt to ame-liorate inequalities as necessities permit, prerogatives of
the government yield to the needs of the citizen. . . .When authority is given, it is liberally construed."

Liability in Tort, 34 Yale L. J. 1, 1-2, 31, 33 (1924).

12 Many legal scholars have been similarly critical of the doctrine. See,

e. g., Comment, Sovereign Immunity--An Anathema to the "Constitutional Tort," 12 Santa Clara Law. 543, 553, and n. 60 (1972) (collecting

(1970); Davis, supra n. 11; Pugh, supra n. 11, at 494.

Recognizing the lack of current justification for and the inequities
caused by this judicially created doctrine, several state courts have abrogated or limited the immunity of state and local governments. See Note,

differently from any other secured creditor.13 Its interestsare adequately protected by specific statutory provisions

governing discharges and priorities. As the Commission onthe Bankruptcy Laws of the United States observed, unanimously, in 1973:

"The Commission also recommends that unpaid taxesentitled to priority be reduced from those accruing

within three years prior to bankruptcy to those accruingwithin one year prior to bankruptcy and that the government be given no other priority for taxes in a bank-ruptcy proceeding (including those secured by a `tax
lien'). Data submitted to the Commission by the Treas-ury Department establishes that the total amount collected by the Federal Government as a result of all ofits liens and priorities in bankruptcy proceedings is insignificant in the total federal budget. It is the viewof the Commission that it is unseemly for the Federal
Government to insist upon collecting its taxes at the ex-pense of other creditors of the taxpayer, and that the

13 In United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U. S. 198, 209 (1983), the
Court first held that "the reorganization estate includes property of the
debtor that has been seized by a creditor prior to the filing of a petition
for reorganization." The Court then explained:

"We see no reason why a different result should obtain when the IRS
is the creditor. The Service is bound by $ 542(a) to the same extent as
any other secured creditor. The Bankruptcy Code expressly states that
the term `entity,' used in $ 542(a), includes a governmental unit. $ 101(14).
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. Moreover, Congress carefully considered the
effect of the new Bankruptcy Code on tax collection, see generally S. Rep.
No. 95-1106 (1978) (Report of Senate Finance Committee), and decided to
provide protection to tax collectors, such as the IRS, through grants of
enhanced priorities for unsecured tax claims, $ 507(a)(6), and by the nondischarge of tax liabilities, $ 523(a)(1). S. Rep. No. 95-989, pp. 14-15 (1978).
Tax collectors also enjoy the generally applicable right under $ 363(e) to
adequate protection for property subject to their liens. Nothing in the
Bankruptcy Code or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended a special exception for the tax collector in the form of an exclusion
from the estate of property seized to satisfy a tax lien." Ibid.

only possible justification for this would be a plea of ne-cessity in order to keep the government functioning.

As indicated above, such a plea would be totally withoutfoundation in fact.

". . . When the Federal Government enters into busi-ness transactions, it should be prepared to deal upon a
basis of equality with other creditors of the bankruptbusiness." Report of Commission on Bankruptcy Laws
of the United States, H. R. Doc. No. 93-137, pt. 1, p. 22(1973).

If these comments by the experts who played a major rolein formulating the policies embodied in the Bankruptcy Code
are sound--as I believe they are--one must ask what validreason supports a construction of the waiver in $ 106(c) that
is so "strict" that the Court will not even examine its legisla-tive history.

Surely the interest in requiring the Congress to draft itslegislation with greater clarity or precision does not justify
a refusal to make a good-faith effort to ascertain the actualmeaning of the message it tried to convey in a statutory provision that is already on the books. The Court's stubborninsistence on "clear statements" burdens the Congress with
unnecessary reenactment of provisions that were alreadyplain enough when read literally.

14 One scholar's comment on the countermajoritarian thrust of the
Court's fascination with clear statement rules is illustrative:

"In Dellmuth v. Muth, [491 U. S. 223 (1989),] the Court held that the
Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA) of 1975 did not abrogate state
immunity. The Court reached this result even though the law imposed
substantive obligations directly on the states, included the states in its
jurisdictional grant, and included legislative discussion assuming that the
states could be sued. After the Supreme Court changed the clear statement rule in 1985, Congress responded in 1986 with a broad textual abrogation of state immunity for statutes protecting the disabled. Yet in
Dellmuth, the Court held not only that the EHA did not meet the more
stringent test for abrogation, but that the 1986 statute made clear
Congress' `intent' not to abrogate state immunity in lawsuits filed before

on individual citizens engaged in litigation against the sover-eign is tragic.

The fact that Congress has ample power to correct theCourt's unfortunate error does not justify this refusal to

HOLYWELL CORP. et al. v. SMITH et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 90-1361. Argued December 4, 1991--Decided February 25, 1992*
Petitioner debtors, four affiliated corporate entities and Theodore B.

Gould, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions after one of the entities
defaulted on a real estate loan. The Bankruptcy Court consolidated the
cases and the debtors represented their own bankruptcy estates as debtors in possession. Creditors approved a Chapter 11 plan that provided,
inter alia, for placement of the debtors' property into a trust and appointment of a trustee to liquidate all of the trust property and to distribute it to the creditors of the various bankruptcy estates. The plan
said nothing about whether the trustee had to file income tax returns
or pay any income tax due, but the United States did not object to the
plan's confirmation. The plan took effect in October 1985. One of the
corporate debtors filed a tax return for the fiscal year ending July 31,
1985, including as income capital gains earned in the postbankruptcy
sale of certain properties in its estate, but requested respondent Smith,
the appointed trustee, to pay the taxes owed. Neither the corporate
debtors nor Smith filed income tax returns for succeeding fiscal years,
in which there was capital gains and interest income. Over the objections of the United States and the debtors, the Bankruptcy Court
granted Smith's request for a declaratory judgment that he had no duty
under the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to file income tax returns or
pay income taxes. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals
affirmed.

Held: Smith is required by the Code to file income tax returns and pay

taxes on the income attributable to the property of both the corporate
debtors and Gould. Pp. 52-59.

(a) Smith is an "assignee" of "all" or "substantially all" of the "property . . . of a corporation" and therefore is required by $ 6012(b)(3) of
the Code to file returns that the corporate debtors would have filed
had their property not been assigned to him. The plan transferred the
corporate debtors' estates to Smith as trustee, and it is undisputed that
he meets the usual definition of the word "assignee" in both ordinary
and legal usage. Nothing in $ 6012(b)(3) limits the definition of an "as*Together with No. 90-1484, United States v. Smith et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

signee" to persons who wind up a dissolving corporation or manage the
day-to-day business of a distressed corporation. Pp. 52-54.

(b) With respect to the income attributable to Gould's property, Smith
is required by $ 6012(b)(4) to make a return not, as the United States
argues, because he is the "fiduciary" of the "estate . . . of an individual,"
but because he is the "fiduciary" of a "trust." Since the plan declared
and established a separate and distinct trust and vested the property of
Gould's estate in Smith, it did not simply substitute Smith for Gould as
the fiduciary of Gould's "estate." However, the trust here--which the
plan described as a trust and created for the express purpose of liquidating Gould's estate and distributing it to creditors--clearly fits the description of a liquidating trust in 26 CFR $ 301.7701-4(d). Moreover,
when the plan assigned the property of Gould's estate to Smith, it gave
him powers consistent with the definition of "fiduciary" in $ 7701(a)(6) of
the Code and 26 CFR $ 301.7701-6. Respondents' argument that it is
Gould who must pay the trust's taxes under the Code's "grantor trust"
rules is rejected. In re Sonner, 53 B. R. 859, distinguished. Also rejected is their contention that Smith lacked sufficient discretion in performing his duties under the plan to be a fiduciary, since the liquidating
trust is a trust under the Code and Smith's duties satisfy the regulations' description of a fiduciary. Pp. 54-58.

(c) Respondents also err in asserting that Smith may ignore the duties imposed by the Code because the plan does not require him to pay
taxes. Section 1141(a) of the Bankruptcy Code--which states that "the
provisions of a confirmed plan bind . . . any creditor"--does not preclude
the United States from seeking payment of any taxes. Even if $ 1141(a)
binds creditors with respect to claims that arose before confirmation,
it does not bind them with regard to postconfirmation claims. Cf. 11
U. S. C. $ 101(10). Here, the United States is not seeking taxes due
prior to Smith's appointment, but is merely asserting that Smith, after
his appointment, must make tax returns in the same manner as the
assignee of the property of any corporation or the trustee of any trust.
Pp. 58-59.

50 HOLYWELL CORP. v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
These cases require us to decide whether a trustee ap-pointed to liquidate and distribute property as part of a

Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan must file income tax returns andpay income tax under the Internal Revenue Code.

I
Miami Center Limited Partnership borrowed money fromthe Bank of New York (Bank) to develop "Miami Center," a

hotel and office building complex in Miami, Florida. In Au-gust 1984, after it defaulted on the loan, MCLP and four
affiliated debtors--Holywell Corporation, Chopin Associates,Miami Center Corporation, and Theodore B. Gould--each
filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions. The BankruptcyCourt consolidated the five cases.

Prior to confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan, the debtorsrepresented their own bankruptcy estates as debtors in possession. See 11 U. S. C. $ 1101(1). The estates of Gould andHolywell contained two principal assets: equity in Miami
Center and cash proceeds from the postbankruptcy sale ofcertain real estate in Washington, D. C., known as the Washington Properties.In August 1985, the Bank and other creditors approved a
"Consolidated Plan of Reorganization." The plan requiredthe debtors to give up their interests in Miami Center and
the proceeds from the sale of the Washington Properties, butotherwise permitted them to remain in business. Part V of
the plan provided:

"1. A Trust is hereby declared and established on be-half of the Debtors . . . and an individual to be appointed

by the Court . . . is designated as Trustee of all propertyof the estates of the Debtors . . . , including but not
limited to, Miami Center [and] the Washington Proceeds. . . , to hold, liquidate, and distribute such Trust Property according to the terms of this Plan. The Trustshall be known as the `Miami Center Liquidating Trust.'

"2. . . . [A]ll right, title and interest of the Debtors inand to the Trust Property, including Miami Center, shall

vest in the Trustee, without further act or deed by theDebtors . . . ." App. 41.

The plan required the trustee to liquidate and distributeall of the trust property to the creditors of the various bankruptcy estates. It empowered the trustee to "[m]anage, op-erate, improve, and protect the Trust Property"; to "[r]elease, convey, or assign any right, title or interest in or aboutthe Trust Property"; and to perform other, similar actions.
Id., at 42. The plan said nothing about whether the trusteehad to file income tax returns or pay any income tax due.
The United States did not object to its confirmation.The plan took effect on October 10, 1985. The trustee appointed by the court, respondent Fred Stanton Smith, imme-diately sold Miami Center to the Bank in consideration for
cash and cancellation of the Bank's claim. The trustee thendistributed these and other assets to third-party creditors.
Holywell Corporation filed a tax return for the fiscal yearending July 31, 1985. The income for this fiscal year included capital gains earned in the sale of the WashingtonProperties. Holywell asked the trustee to pay the taxes
owed. Neither the corporate debtors nor the trustee filedfederal income tax returns for any fiscal year ending after
July 31, 1985. The income for these years included the capi-tal gains earned in the sale of Miami Center and interest
earned by reinvesting the proceeds.In December 1987, the trustee sought a declaratory judgment from the Bankruptcy Court that he had no duty to fileincome tax returns or pay income tax under the federal income tax laws. The United States and the debtors opposedthe action. The Bankruptcy Court declared that the trustee
did not have to make any federal tax returns or pay anytaxes. 85 B. R. 898 (SD Fla. 1988). The District Court, in
an unreported opinion, and the Court of Appeals, 911 F. 2d1539 (CA11 1990), both affirmed. The United States, in No.

90-1484, and the debtors, in No. 90-1361, each petitioned thisCourt for a writ of certiorari. We granted review. 500

U. S. 941 (1991). II

The Internal Revenue Code ties the duty to pay federalincome taxes to the duty to make an income tax return. See
26 U. S. C. $ 6151(a) ("[W]hen a return of a tax is required. . . the person required to make such return shall . . . pay
such tax"). We conclude in this case that the trustee mustpay the tax due on the income attributable to the corporate
debtors' property because $ 6012(b)(3) requires him to makea return as the "assignee" of the "property . . . of a corporation." We further hold that the trustee must pay the taxdue on the income attributable to the individual debtor's
property because $ 6012(b)(4) requires him to make a returnas the "fiduciary" of a "trust." Finally, we decide that the
United States did not excuse the trustee from these dutiesby failing to object to the plan.

A
We first consider the trustee's duties with respect to thecorporate debtors. Section 6012(b)(3) provides:

"(3) Receivers, trustees and assignees for corporations"In a case where a receiver, trustee in a case under
title 11 of the United States Code, or assignee, by orderof a court of competent jurisdiction, by operation of law
or otherwise, has possession of or holds title to all orsubstantially all the property or business of a corporation, whether or not such property or business is beingoperated, such receiver, trustee, or assignee shall make
the return of income for such corporation in the samemanner and form as corporations are required to make
such returns."
The parties disagree about whether the trustee in thiscase is a "receiver," a "trustee in a case under title 11 of

503us1$34z 11-13-95 20:58:37 PAGES OPINPGT

53Cite as: 503 U. S. 47 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
the United States Code [i. e., the Bankruptcy Code]," or an"assignee." We hold that the trustee is an "assignee" of the

corporate debtors under $ 6012(b)(3). Because the partiesdo not argue that the trustee's duties would differ under another characterization, we decline to consider whether the
trustee would qualify as a receiver or bankruptcy trustee.The plan, as noted above, transferred the corporate debtors' estates to respondent Smith as trustee for the MiamiCenter Liquidating Trust. The respondents do not dispute
that the trustee meets the usual definition of the word "as-signee" in both ordinary and legal usage. See Webster's
Third New International Dictionary 132 (1986) (defining an
"assignee" as "one to whom a right or property is legally
transferred"); Black's Law Dictionary 118-119 (6th ed.
1990) (defining an "assignee" as "[a] person to whom an assignment is made" and an "assignment" as "[t]he act of transferring to another all or part of one's property, interest, or
rights"); cf. 26 CFR $ 301.6036-1(a)(3) (1991) (defining an "assignee for the benefit of . . . creditors" as any person who
takes possession of and liquidates property of a debtor for
distribution to creditors). They argue, however, that courts
have applied $ 6012(b)(3) only in situations in which a person
winds up the business of a dissolving corporation, see, e. g.,
First Nat. Bank of Greeley, Colo. v. United States, 86 F. 2d
938, 942 (CA10 1936), or a person stands in the place of management in operating the day-to-day business of a distressed
corporation, see, e. g., Louisville Property Co. v. Commissioner, 140 F. 2d 547, 548 (CA6 1944). They conclude that

$ 6012(b)(3) cannot apply to the trustee in this case because
he did neither. We find this argument unpersuasive.

Nothing in $ 6012(b)(3) suggests that the word "assignee"
is limited in the manner proposed by the respondents. The
statute does not make dissolution necessary; it applies
whether the corporation transfers "all" or "substantially all"
of its property. It does not require the assignee to manage
the corporation's business after the transfer of property; it

503us1$34z 11-13-95 20:58:37 PAGES OPINPGT
54 HOLYWELL CORP. v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
expressly requires the assignee to make a return "whetheror not [the assigned] property or business is being operated."

Ibid. We therefore conclude that $ 6012(b)(3) applies to thetrustee in this case. As the assignee of "all" or "substantially all" of the property of the corporate debtors, thetrustee must file the returns that the corporate debtors
would have filed had the plan not assigned their property tothe trustee.

B
We next consider the trustee's duties with respect to theindividual debtor, Theodore B. Gould. The parties agree

that $ 6012(b)(3) does not require the trustee to file a returnas the "assignee" of Gould's estate because the section applies only to the assignee of the property of a corporation.Section $ 6012(b)(4), however, provides:

"(4) Returns of estates and trusts"Returns of an estate, a trust, or an estate of an individual under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the UnitedStates Code shall be made by the fiduciary thereof."

The United States argues that the trustee must file under$ 6012(b)(4) as the fiduciary of Gould's Chapter 11 "estate."
The debtors join the United States' argument and also con-tend in the alternative that the trustee must file under the
section as the fiduciary of a "trust." The respondents insistthat the trustee is not acting as the fiduciary of either a
bankruptcy estate or a trust within the meaning of$ 6012(b)(4). Accordingly, they assert, the section does not
require the trustee to file a return on behalf of Gould. Weagree with the debtors that the trustee must file a return
because he is the fiduciary of a trust of an individual.The parties agree that Gould originally served as the fiduciary of his own bankruptcy estate when he became debtorin possession. See 11 U. S. C. $ 1107(a). At confirmation,
according to the United States, the bankruptcy plan substi-tuted the trustee for Gould but did not alter the bankruptcy

55Cite as: 503 U. S. 47 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
estate. In other words, the United States argues, thetrustee took Gould's place as the fiduciary of "an estate of an

individual under chapter . . . 11." The United States pointsout that the Bankruptcy Code explicitly provides that a
fiduciary may hold and administer property of the estateafter confirmation of the plan, see 11 U. S. C. $ 1123(b)(3), and
that nothing prohibits the substitution of a third-partytrustee for the debtor in possession. The United States,
therefore, maintains that the trustee must file a returnunder $ 6012(b)(4).

Whether or not the Bankruptcy Code permits a plan toplace a new fiduciary in charge of an estate after confirmation, as the United States contends, we do not believe that amere substitution occurred in this case. The plan, as quoted
above, "declared and established" the new Miami Center Liq-uidating Trust. It then vested all of the assets of Gould's
estate to respondent Smith as trustee. The plan did notsimply substitute the trustee for Gould as the fiduciary of
the estate. Rather, it created a separate and distinct trustholding the property of the estate and gave the trustee control of this property. The Bankruptcy Code expressly per-mits this arrangement. See $ 1123(a)(5)(B) (authorizing a
plan to transfer "all or any part of the property of the estateto one or more entities, whether organized before or after
the confirmation of such plan"). The trustee, therefore, isnot acting as the fiduciary of Gould's bankruptcy estate.

The trustee, nonetheless, must make a return. Section6012(b)(4), as the debtors assert, applies to the fiduciary of a
trust as well as the fiduciary of a bankruptcy estate. We seeno way for the respondents to deny that the Miami Center
Liquidating Trust is a "trust" and that respondent Smith isits "fiduciary." A Treasury Regulation states:

"Certain organizations which are commonly known asliquidating trusts are treated as trusts for purposes of
the Internal Revenue Code. An organization will beconsidered a liquidating trust if it is organized for the

primary purpose of liquidating and distributing theassets transferred to it, and if its activities are all reasonably necessary to, and consistent with, the accom-plishment of that purpose." 26 CFR $ 301.7701-4(d)
(1991).
The Miami Center Liquidating Trust clearly fits this descrip-tion. The plan not only describes the entity as a trust, but

also created it for the express purpose of liquidating Gould'sestate and distributing it to creditors.

Respondent Smith, moreover, acted as the fiduciary of thistrust. The Internal Revenue Code defines "fiduciary" as a
"guardian, trustee, executor, administrator, receiver, conser-vator, or any person acting in any fiduciary capacity for any
person." 26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(6). A Treasury Regulationfurther specifies:

" `Fiduciary' is a term which applies to persons whooccupy positions of peculiar confidence toward others,
such as trustees, executors, and administrators. A fi-duciary is a person who holds in trust an estate to which
another has the beneficial title or in which another hasa beneficial interest, or receives and controls income
of another, as in the case of receivers." 26 CFR$ 301.7701-6 (1991).

The bankruptcy plan, as noted above, assigned the propertyof Gould's estate to the trustee and gave him powers consistent with this definition. Smith therefore acted as the fidu-ciary of a trust within the meaning of $ 6012(b)(4).

The respondents raise two principal objections to this con-clusion. First, they argue that Gould must pay the Miami
Center Liquidating Trust's income taxes under the so-called"grantor trust" rules in the Internal Revenue Code. See 26
U. S. C. $$ 671-677. They note, in particular, that TreasuryRegulation $ 1.677(a)-1(d) specifies that "a grantor is, in general, treated as the owner of a portion of a trust whose in503us1$34z 11-13-95 20:58:37 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
come is . . . applied in discharge of a legal obligation of the
grantor." 26 CFR $ 1.667(a)-1(d) (1991). They assert that
Gould is the grantor of the liquidating trust and that, under
this regulation, he owns the trust's income and must pay
taxes on it. To support this position, the respondents cite
In re Sonner, 53 B. R. 859 (ED Va. 1985), which applied the
grantor trust provisions to a postconfirmation liquidating
trust.

While we express no opinion on the results in Sonner, the
facts are distinguishable. In Sonner, the property of the
bankruptcy estate by the terms of the plan appears to have
revested in the debtor upon confirmation. The debtor pursuant to a plan then placed some of this property in a trust
created to pay his creditors. Under these circumstances,
the Bankruptcy Court concluded, the debtor had created
a grantor trust under Treasury Regulation $ 1.677(a)-1(d).
See Sonner, supra, at 860, 864. In this case, however, the
property of Gould's bankruptcy estate did not revest in
Gould. The plan, instead, placed all of the estate's property
directly in the Miami Center Liquidating Trust. Gould himself did not contribute anything to the trust, and we thus fail
to see how the respondents can characterize him as the
grantor.

Second, the respondents argue that the trustee did not act
as a fiduciary because he had almost no discretion in performing his duties under the plan. They assert that the
trustee merely acted as a "disbursing agent" who distributed
liquidated funds to the creditors. As the dissenting judge
noted below, labels and characterizations cannot alter the
trustee's status for the purpose of the tax law. 911 F. 2d,
at 1547. Because the liquidating trust is a trust under the
Internal Revenue Code and because respondent Smith's duties under the plan satisfy the description of a fiduciary in

503us1$34z 11-13-95 20:58:38 PAGES OPINPGT
58 HOLYWELL CORP. v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
the regulations, the restrictions on the trustee's discretiondo not remove him from coverage under $ 6012(b)(4).*

C
The respondents finally assert that the trustee may ignorethe duties imposed by $$ 6012 and 6151 because the Chapter

11 plan does not require him to pay taxes. They note that$ 1141(a) of the Bankruptcy Code states that "the provisions
of a confirmed plan bind . . . any creditor" whether or not thecreditor has accepted the plan. They conclude that $ 1141(a)
precludes the United States, as a creditor, from seeking pay-ment of any taxes. They add that the United States should
have objected to the plan if it had wanted a different result.We disagree.

The United States is not seeking from the trustee anytaxes that became due prior to his appointment. See Reply
Brief for United States 13, n. 16. It simply asserts that thetrustee, after his appointment, must make tax returns under

$ 6012(b) in the same manner as the assignee of the propertyof any corporation or the trustee of any trust. No tax liability becomes due under $ 6151 until the time required for mak-ing those returns. See

Hartman v. Lauchli, 238 F. 2d 881,887 (CA8 1956); Pan American Van Lines v. United States,

607 F. 2d 1299, 1301 (CA9 1979). Even if $ 1141(a) bindscreditors of the corporate and individual debtors with respect to claims that arose before confirmation, we do not seehow it can bind the United States or any other creditor with
respect to postconfirmation claims. Cf. 11 U. S. C. $ 101(10)

*The respondents also argue that the trustee does not have to pay taxes
because the petitioners conceded in the Bankruptcy Court that "the trust
is not a separate taxable entity." 85 B. R. 898, 900 (SD Fla. 1988). This
"concession" cannot help the respondents. The petitioners asserted that
the trust was not a separate taxable entity when they argued that the
plan did not create a new trust but instead simply substituted the trustee
for Gould as the fiduciary of the bankruptcy estate. If the respondents
accept this position, which we reject above, then they would have to agree
that respondent Smith has to make a return as the fiduciary of an estate.

FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLICSCHOOLS

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 90-918. Argued December 11, 1991--Decided February 26, 1992
Petitioner Franklin, a student in a high school operated by respondent

school district, filed an action for damages in Federal District Court
under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, alleging, inter
alia, that she had been subjected to continual sexual harassment and
abuse by a teacher, Andrew Hill. After the complaint was filed, Hill
resigned on the condition that all matters pending against him be
dropped, and the school thereupon closed its investigation. The District Court subsequently dismissed the complaint on the ground that
Title IX does not authorize an award of damages, and the Court of
Appeals affirmed.

Held: A damages remedy is available for an action brought to enforce

Title IX. Pp. 65-76.

(a) Title IX is enforceable through an implied right of action. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677. P. 65.

(b) The longstanding general rule is that absent clear direction to the
contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any
appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a
federal statute. See, e. g., Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684; Davis v.
Passman, 442 U. S. 228, 246-247. Pp. 65-68.

(c) This Court's adherence to the general rule has not eroded since
Bell. See, e. g., J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426, 433-435. In declaring that "the question of who may enforce a statutory right is fundamentally different from the question of who may enforce a [constitutionally protected] right," Davis, 442 U. S., at 241, was not limiting the
traditional presumption in favor of all appropriate relief to actions
claiming constitutional violations. Rather it was merely attempting to
decide whether a litigant had a "cause of action," a question that is
analytically distinct from, and prior to, the one at issue: what relief, if
any a litigant is entitled to receive, see id., at 239. Nor did Guardians
Assn. v. Civil Service Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582, and
Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone, 465 U. S. 624, erode the traditional presumption. In fact, those cases support it, since a clear majority in Guardians expressed the view that damages were available in
an action seeking remedies for an intentional violation of a statute

61Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)
Syllabus
closely analogous to Title IX, while a unanimous Court in Darrone held
that another such statute authorized the award of backpay. Pp. 68-71.

(d) Congress did not intend to limit the remedies available in a Title
IX suit. Because the Cannon Court inferred a cause of action upon
concluding that Title IX supported no express right of action, the silence
of the pre-Cannon statutory text and legislative history on the issue of
available remedies is neither surprising nor enlightening. Rather, the
appropriate inquiry for the pre-Cannon period is the state of the law
when Congress passed Title IX. Since, at that time, the traditional
presumption in favor of all available remedies was firmly established,
and this Court had recently found implied rights of action in six cases
and approved a damages remedy in three of them, the lack of any legislative intent to abandon the traditional presumption is amply demonstrated. For the post-Cannon period, when Congress was legislating
with full cognizance of that decision, analysis of the text and history of
the two statutes enacted to amend Title IX--the Civil Rights Remedies
Equalization Amendment of 1986 and the Civil Rights Restoration Act
of 1987--establishes that Congress validated Cannon's holding and
made no effort to alter the traditional presumption. Pp. 71-73.

(e) The argument that a damages award would unduly expand the
federal courts' power into a sphere properly reserved to the Executive
and Legislative Branches in violation of separation of powers principles
misconceives the difference between a cause of action and a remedy.
Unlike the finding of a cause of action, which authorizes a court to hear
a case or controversy, the discretion to award appropriate relief involves
no such increase in judicial power and, in fact, historically has been
thought necessary to provide an important safeguard against legislative
and executive abuses and to insure an independent Judiciary. Moreover, selective adjudication of the sort advocated here would harm separation of powers by giving judges the power to render inutile causes of
action authorized by Congress through a decision that no remedy is
available. Pp. 73-74.

(f) Also rejected is the contention that the normal presumption in
favor of all appropriate remedies should not apply because Title IX was
enacted pursuant to Congress' Spending Clause power. The Court's
observation in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451
U. S. 1, 28-29, that remedies are limited under Spending Clause statutes
when the alleged violation is unintentional is based on the theory that
an entity receiving federal funds lacks notice that it will be liable for
damages for such a violation, see id., at 17. This notice problem does
not arise in a case such as the present, where intentional discrimination
is alleged and is proscribed by the statute in question. Moreover, the
notion that Spending Clause statutes do not authorize monetary awards

503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:41 PAGES OPINPGT
62 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Opinion of the Court
for intentional violations is belied by the unanimous holding in Darrone,
supra, at 628. Pp. 74-75.

(g) The assertion that Title IX remedies should nevertheless be limited to backpay and prospective relief diverges from this Court's traditional approach to deciding what remedies are available for violation of
a federal right. Both suggested remedies are equitable in nature, and
it is axiomatic that a court should determine the adequacy of damages
at law before resorting to equitable relief. Moreover, both suggested
remedies are clearly inadequate in that they would provide Franklin no
relief: backpay because she was a student when the alleged discrimination occurred, and prospective relief because she no longer attends
school in respondent system and Hill no longer teaches there. Pp. 75-76.

I
Petitioner Christine Franklin was a student at NorthGwinnett High School in Gwinnett County, Georgia, between

September 1985 and August 1989. Respondent GwinnettCounty School District operates the high school and receives
federal funds. According to the complaint filed on Decem-ber 29, 1988, in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia, Franklin was subjected to con-tinual sexual harassment beginning in the autumn of her
tenth grade year (1986) from Andrew Hill, a sports coach andteacher employed by the district. Among other allegations,

In this action,3 the District Court dismissed the complainton the ground that Title IX does not authorize an award of
damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 911 F. 2d 617(CA11 1990). The court noted that analysis of Title IX and
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d
et seq. (Title VI), has developed along similar lines. Citingas binding precedent

Drayden v. Needville IndependentSchool Dist., 642 F. 2d 129 (CA5 1981), a decision rendered

prior to the division of the Fifth Circuit, the court concludedthat Title VI did not support a claim for monetary damages.
The court then analyzed this Court's decision in GuardiansAssn. v. Civil Service Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S.
582 (1983), to determine whether it implicitly overruled
Drayden. The court stated that the absence of a majorityopinion left unresolved the question whether a court could

award such relief upon a showing of intentional discrimina-tion. As a second basis for its holding that monetary damages were unavailable, the court reasoned that Title IX wasenacted under Congress' Spending Clause powers and that

3 Prior to bringing this lawsuit, Franklin filed a complaint with the Office
for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education (OCR) in
August 1988. After investigating these charges for several months, OCR
concluded that the school district had violated Franklin's rights by subjecting her to physical and verbal sexual harassment and by interfering with
her right to complain about conduct proscribed by Title IX. OCR determined, however, that because of the resignations of Hill and respondent
William Prescott and the implementation of a school grievance procedure,
the district had come into compliance with Title IX. It then terminated
its investigation. First Amended Complaint, Exh. A, pp. 7-9.

"[u]nder such statutes, relief may frequently be limited tothat which is equitable in nature, with the recipient of federal funds thus retaining the option of terminating such re-ceipt in order to rid itself of an injunction." 911 F. 2d, at
621.4 The court closed by observing it would "proceed withextreme care" to afford compensatory relief absent express
provision by Congress or clear direction from this Court.
Id., at 622. Accordingly, it held that an action for monetarydamages could not be sustained for an alleged intentional

violation of Title IX, and affirmed the District Court's rulingto that effect. Ibid.

Because this opinion conflicts with a decision of the Courtof Appeals for the Third Circuit, see Pfeiffer v. Marion Center Area School Dist., 917 F. 2d 779, 787-789 (1990), wegranted certiorari, 501 U. S. 1204 (1991). We reverse.

II
In Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979),the Court held that Title IX is enforceable through an implied right of action. We have no occasion here to recon-sider that decision. Rather, in this case we must decide
what remedies are available in a suit brought pursuant tothis implied right. As we have often stated, the question of
what remedies are available under a statute that provides aprivate right of action is "analytically distinct" from the issue

4 The court also rejected an argument by Franklin that the terms of
outright prohibition of Title VII, 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000e to 2000e-17, apply by
analogy to Title IX's antidiscrimination provision, and that the remedies
available under the two statutes should also be the same. 911 F. 2d, at
622. Because Franklin does not pursue this contention here, we need not
address whether it has merit.

5 Judge Johnson concurred specially, writing that the result was controlled by Drayden v. Needville Independent School Dist., 642 F. 2d 129
(CA5 1981), and that there was no need to address whether Titles VI and
IX are grounded solely in the Spending Clause and whether Title VII
analysis should apply to an action under Titles VI or IX. See 911 F. 2d,
at 622-623.

Opinion of the Court
of whether such a right exists in the first place. Davis v.
Passman, 442 U. S. 228, 239 (1979). Thus, although we examine the text and history of a statute to determine whether
Congress intended to create a right of action, Touche Ross &
Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 575-576 (1979), we presume
the availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress
has expressly indicated otherwise. Davis, supra, at 246-
247. This principle has deep roots in our jurisprudence.

A
"[W]here legal rights have been invaded, and a federal
statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion,
federal courts may use any available remedy to make good
the wrong done." Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946).
The Court explained this longstanding rule as jurisdictional
and upheld the exercise of the federal courts' power to award
appropriate relief so long as a cause of action existed under
the Constitution or laws of the United States. Ibid.

The Bell Court's reliance on this rule was hardly revolutionary. From the earliest years of the Republic, the Court
has recognized the power of the Judiciary to award appropriate remedies to redress injuries actionable in federal
court, although it did not always distinguish clearly between
a right to bring suit and a remedy available under such a
right. In Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803), for
example, Chief Justice Marshall observed that our Government "has been emphatically termed a government of laws,
and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high
appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation
of a vested legal right." This principle originated in the
English common law, and Blackstone described it as "a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right,
there is also a legal remedy, by suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded." 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
23 (1783). See also Ashby v. White, 1 Salk. 19, 21, 87 Eng.

Opinion of the Court
Rep. 808, 816 (Q. B. 1702) ("If a statute gives a right, thecommon law will give a remedy to maintain that right . . .").

In Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524(1838), the Court applied these principles to an Act of Congress that accorded a right of action in mail carriers to sue
for adjustment and settlement of certain claims for extraservices but which did not specify the precise remedy available to the carriers. After surveying possible remedies,which included an action against the Postmaster General for
monetary damages, the Court held that the carriers wereentitled to a writ of mandamus compelling payment under
the terms of the statute. "It cannot be denied but that congress had the power to command that act to be done," the
Court stated; "and the power to enforce the performance of
the act must rest somewhere, or it will present a case which
has often been said to involve a monstrous absurdity in a
well organized government, that there should be no remedy,
although a clear and undeniable right should be shown to
exist. And if the remedy cannot be applied by the circuit
court of this district, it exists nowhere." Id., at 624.
Dooley v. United States, 182 U. S. 222, 229 (1901), also restated "the principle that a liability created by statute without a remedy may be enforced by a common-law action."

The Court relied upon this traditional presumption again
after passage of the Federal Safety Appliance Act of 1893,
ch. 196, 27 Stat. 531. In Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby,
241 U. S. 33 (1916), the Court first had to determine whether
the Act supported an implied right of action. After answering that question in the affirmative, the Court then upheld a
claim for monetary damages: "A disregard of the command
of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute
was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the
party in default is implied, according to a doctrine of the
common law . . . ." Id., at 39. The foundation upon which
the Bell v. Hood Court articulated this traditional presump503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion, therefore, was well settled. See also Texas & New Or-leans R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, 281 U. S. 548, 569 (1930).

B
Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae,however, maintain that whatever the traditional presumption may have been when the Court decided Bell v. Hood, ithas disappeared in succeeding decades. We do not agree.
In J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426 (1964), the Courtadhered to the general rule that all appropriate relief is

available in an action brought to vindicate a federal rightwhen Congress has given no indication of its purpose with
respect to remedies. Relying on Bell v. Hood, the BorakCourt specifically rejected an argument that a court's remedial power to redress violations of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 was limited to a declaratory judgment. 377
U. S., at 433-434. The Court concluded that the federalcourts "have the power to grant all necessary remedial
relief " for violations of the Act. Id., at 435. As JusticeClark's opinion for the Court observed, this holding closely
followed the reasoning of a similar case brought under theSecurities Act of 1933, in which the Court had stated:

" `The power to enforce implies the power to make effec-tive the right of recovery afforded by the Act. And the
power to make the right of recovery effective impliesthe power to utilize any of the procedures or actions
normally available to the litigant according to the exi-gencies of the particular case.' "

Id., at 433-434 (quot-ing Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U. S. 282,

288 (1940)).
That a statute does not authorize the remedy at issue "in somany words is no more significant than the fact that it does

not in terms authorize execution to issue on a judgment."
Id., at 288. Subsequent cases have been true to this posi503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion. See, e. g., Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396
U. S. 229, 239 (1969), stating that the "existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies"; Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 255 (1978),
upholding damages remedy under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, even though the enacting Congress had not
specifically provided such relief.

The United States contends that the traditional presumption in favor of all appropriate relief was abandoned by the
Court in Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), and that
the Bell v. Hood rule was limited to actions claiming constitutional violations. The United States quotes language in
Davis to the effect that "the question of who may enforce a
statutory right is fundamentally different from the question
of who may enforce a right that is protected by the Constitution." Davis, 442 U. S., at 241. The Government's position,
however, mirrors the very misunderstanding over the difference between a cause of action and the relief afforded under
it that sparked the confusion we attempted to clarify in
Davis. Whether Congress may limit the class of persons
who have a right of action under Title IX is irrelevant to the
issue in this lawsuit. To reiterate, "the question whether a
litigant has a `cause of action' is analytically distinct and
prior to the question of what relief, if any, a litigant may
be entitled to receive." Id., at 239. Davis, therefore, did
nothing to interrupt the long line of cases in which the Court
has held that if a right of action exists to enforce a federal
right and Congress is silent on the question of remedies, a
federal court may order any appropriate relief. See id., at
247, n. 26 (contrasting Brown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820 (1976)).6

6 Cases cited by respondents and the United States since Davis are inapposite, either because they involved holdings that plaintiffs had no right
of action, see, e. g., Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083
(1991); Karahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U. S. 527 (1989); Thompson

Opinion of the Court
Contrary to arguments by respondents and the United
States that Guardians Assn. v. Civil Service Comm'n of
New York City, 463 U. S. 582 (1983), and Consolidated Rail
Corporation v. Darrone, 465 U. S. 624 (1984), eroded this traditional presumption, those cases in fact support it. Though
the multiple opinions in Guardians suggest the difficulty of
inferring the common ground among the Justices in that
case, a clear majority expressed the view that damages were
available under Title VI in an action seeking remedies for an
intentional violation, and no Justice challenged the traditional presumption in favor of a federal court's power to
award appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action.

the Rehabilitation Act of 1973--which had expressly incorporated the "remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title
VI" (29 U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(2))--authorizes an award of backpay. In Darrone, the Court observed that a majority in
Guardians had "agreed that retroactive relief is available to
private plaintiffs for all discrimination . . . that is actionable

Opinion of the Court
Congress, the federal courts have the power to award anyappropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought

pursuant to a federal statute.

III
We now address whether Congress intended to limit appli-cation of this general principle in the enforcement of Title

IX. See Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 378 (1983); Wyandotte
Transportation Co. v. United States, 389 U. S. 191, 200(1967). Because the cause of action was inferred by the

Court in Cannon, the usual recourse to statutory text andlegislative history in the period prior to that decision necessarily will not enlighten our analysis. Respondents and theUnited States fundamentally misunderstand the nature of
the inquiry, therefore, by needlessly dedicating large por-tions of their briefs to discussions of how the text and legislative intent behind Title IX are "silent" on the issue of avail-able remedies. Since the Court in Cannon concluded that
this statute supported no express right of action, it is hardlysurprising that Congress also said nothing about the applicable remedies for an implied right of action.During the period prior to the decision in Cannon, the
inquiry in any event is not " `basically a matter of statutoryconstruction,' " as the United States asserts. Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 8 (quoting Transamerica
Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15 (1979)).Rather, in determining Congress' intent to limit application

of the traditional presumption in favor of all appropriate re-lief, we evaluate the state of the law when the Legislature
passed Title IX. Cf. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 378 (1982). In theyears before and after Congress enacted this statute, the

Court "follow[ed] a common-law tradition [and] regarded thedenial of a remedy as the exception rather than the rule."
Id., at 375 (footnote omitted). As we outlined in Part II,this has been the prevailing presumption in our federal

Opinion of the Court
courts since at least the early 19th century. In Cannon, themajority upheld an implied right of action in part because in

the decade immediately preceding enactment of Title IX in1972, this Court had found implied rights of action in six
cases.7 In three of those cases, the Court had approved adamages remedy. See, e. g., J. I. Case Co., 377 U. S., at 433;
Wyandotte Transportation Co., supra, at 207; Sullivan v.
Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229 (1969). Whollyapart from the wisdom of the Cannon holding, therefore, the

same contextual approach used to justify an implied right ofaction more than amply demonstrates the lack of any legislative intent to abandon the traditional presumption in favorof all available remedies.

In the years after the announcement of Cannon, on the
other hand, a more traditional method of statutory analysisis possible, because Congress was legislating with full cognizance of that decision. Our reading of the two amendmentsto Title IX enacted after

Cannon leads us to conclude that
Congress did not intend to limit the remedies available ina suit brought under Title IX. In the Rehabilitation Act

Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7,Congress abrogated the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity under Title IX, Title VI, $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. This stat-ute cannot be read except as a validation of

Cannon's holding. A subsection of the 1986 law provides that in a suitagainst a State, "remedies (including remedies both at law

and in equity) are available for such a violation to the sameextent as such remedies are available for such a violation in
the suit against any public or private entity other than a

State." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(2). While it is true thatthis saving clause says nothing about the nature of those

other available remedies, cf. Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S.304, 329, n. 22 (1981), absent any contrary indication in the
text or history of the statute, we presume Congress enactedthis statute with the prevailing traditional rule in mind.

In addition to the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986,Congress also enacted the Civil Rights Restoration Act of
1987, Pub. L. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28. Without in any wayaltering the existing rights of action and the corresponding
remedies permissible under Title IX, Title VI, $ 504 of theRehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act, Congress broadened the coverage of these antidiscriminationprovisions in this legislation. In seeking to correct what
it considered to be an unacceptable decision on our part inGrove City College v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555 (1984), Congress
made no effort to restrict the right of action recognized inCannon and ratified in the 1986 Act or to alter the traditional
presumption in favor of any appropriate relief for violationof a federal right. We cannot say, therefore, that Congress
has limited the remedies available to a complainant in a suitbrought under Title IX.

IV
Respondents and the United States nevertheless suggestthree reasons why we should not apply the traditional presumption in favor of appropriate relief in this case.

A
First, respondents argue that an award of damages vio-lates separation of powers principles because it unduly expands the federal courts' power into a sphere properlyreserved to the Executive and Legislative Branches. Brief
for Respondents 22-25. In making this argument, respond-ents misconceive the difference between a cause of action
and a remedy. Unlike the finding of a cause of action, whichauthorizes a court to hear a case or controversy, the discre503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT
74 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Opinion of the Court
tion to award appropriate relief involves no such increasein judicial power. See generally Note, Federal Jurisdiction

in Suits for Damages Under Statutes Not Affording SuchRemedy, 48 Colum. L. Rev. 1090, 1094-1095 (1948). Federal
courts cannot reach out to award remedies when the Consti-tution or laws of the United States do not support a cause of
action. Indeed, properly understood, respondents' positioninvites us to

abdicate our historic judicial authority to awardappropriate relief in cases brought in our court system. It

is well to recall that such authority historically has beenthought necessary to provide an important safeguard against
abuses of legislative and executive power, see Kendall v.
United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524 (1838), as well as toensure an independent Judiciary. See generally Katz, The

Jurisprudence of Remedies: Constitutional Legality and theLaw of Torts in Bell v. Hood, 117 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 16-17
(1968). Moreover, selective abdication of the sort advocatedhere would harm separation of powers principles in another
way, by giving judges the power to render inutile causes ofaction authorized by Congress through a decision that

noremedy is available.

B
Next, consistent with the Court of Appeals' reasoning, re-spondents and the United States contend that the normal

presumption in favor of all appropriate remedies should notapply because Title IX was enacted pursuant to Congress'
Spending Clause power. In Pennhurst State School and
Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 28-29 (1981), the Courtobserved that remedies were limited under such Spending

Clause statutes when the alleged violation was unintentional. Respondents and the United States maintain thatthis presumption should apply equally to intentional violations. We disagree. The point of not permitting monetarydamages for an unintentional violation is that the receiving
entity of federal funds lacks notice that it will be liable for amonetary award. See id., at 17. This notice problem does

503us1$35D 11-13-95 21:15:42 PAGES OPINPGT

75Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
not arise in a case such as this, in which intentional discrimi-nation is alleged. Unquestionably, Title IX placed on the

Gwinnett County Public Schools the duty not to discriminateon the basis of sex, and "when a supervisor sexually harasses
a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that super-visor `discriminate[s]' on the basis of sex."

Meritor Sav.Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 64 (1986). We believe

the same rule should apply when a teacher sexually harassesand abuses a student. Congress surely did not intend for
federal moneys to be expended to support the intentionalactions it sought by statute to proscribe. Moreover, the
notion that Spending Clause statutes do not authorize mone-tary awards for intentional violations is belied by our unanimous holding in Darrone. See 465 U. S., at 628. Respond-ents and the United States characterize the backpay remedy
in Darrone as equitable relief, but this description is irrele-vant to their underlying objection: that application of the
traditional rule in this case will require state entities to paymonetary awards out of their treasuries for intentional violations of federal statutes.8 C

Finally, the United States asserts that the remedies per-missible under Title IX should nevertheless be limited to
backpay and prospective relief. In addition to divergingfrom our traditional approach to deciding what remedies are
available for violation of a federal right, this position con-flicts with sound logic. First, both remedies are equitable
in nature, and it is axiomatic that a court should determine

8 Franklin argues that, in any event, Title IX should not be viewed solely
as having been enacted under Congress' Spending Clause powers and that
it also rests on powers derived from $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
See Brief for Petitioner 19, n. 10. Because we conclude that a money
damages remedy is available under Title IX for an intentional violation
irrespective of the constitutional source of Congress' power to enact the
statute, we need not decide which power Congress utilized in enacting
Title IX.

76 FRANKLIN v. GWINNETT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
the adequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to equita-ble relief. Under the ordinary convention, the proper inquiry would be whether monetary damages provided anadequate remedy, and if not, whether equitable relief would
be appropriate. Whitehead v. Shattuck, 138 U. S. 146, 150(1891). See generally C. McCormick, Damages 1 (1935).
Moreover, in this case the equitable remedies suggested byrespondent and the Federal Government are clearly inadequate. Backpay does nothing for petitioner, because shewas a student when the alleged discrimination occurred.
Similarly, because Hill--the person she claims subjected herto sexual harassment--no longer teaches at the school and
she herself no longer attends a school in the Gwinnett sys-tem, prospective relief accords her no remedy at all. The
Government's answer that administrative action helps othersimilarly situated students in effect acknowledges that its
approach would leave petitioner remediless.

V
In sum, we conclude that a damages remedy is availablefor an action brought to enforce Title IX. The judgment of

the Court of Appeals, therefore, is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion. So ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.

The substantive right at issue here is one that Congressdid not expressly create, but that this Court found to be "implied." See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677(1979). Quite obviously, the search for what was Congress'
remedial intent as to a right whose very existence Congressdid not expressly acknowledge is unlikely to succeed, see
ante, at 71; it is "hardly surprising," as the Court says, ibid.,that the usual sources yield no explicit answer.

77Cite as: 503 U. S. 60 (1992)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
The Court finds an implicit answer, however, in the legisla-tors' presumptive awareness of our practice of using "any

available remedy" to redress violations of legal rights. Bellv.

Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946); see ante, at 72-73. This
strikes me as question begging. We can plausibly assume
acquiescence in our Bell v. Hood presumption when the Leg-islature says nothing about remedy in expressly creating a

private right of action; perhaps even when it says nothingabout remedy in creating a private right of action by clear
textual implication; but not, I think, when it says nothingabout remedy in a statute in which the courts divine a private right of action on the basis of "contextual" evidence
such as that in Cannon, which charged Congress with knowledge of a court of appeals' creation of a cause of action under
a similarly worded statute. See Cannon, supra, at 696-698.
Whatever one thinks of the validity of the last approach, it
surely rests on attributed rather than actual congressional
knowledge. It does not demonstrate an explicit legislative
decision to create a cause of action, and so could not be expected to be accompanied by a legislative decision to alter
the application of Bell v. Hood. Given the nature of Cannon
and some of our earlier "implied right of action" cases, what
the Court's analytical construct comes down to is this: Unless
Congress expressly legislates a more limited remedial policy
with respect to rights of action it does not know it is creating, it intends the full gamut of remedies to be applied.

In my view, when rights of action are judicially "implied,"
categorical limitations upon their remedial scope may be
judicially implied as well. Cf. Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66,
84-85 (1975). Although we have abandoned the expansive
rights-creating approach exemplified by Cannon, see Touche
Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 575-576 (1979);
Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S.
11, 18, 23-24 (1979)--and perhaps ought to abandon the notion of implied causes of action entirely, see Thompson v.
Thompson, 484 U. S. 174, 191 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
in judgment)--causes of action that came into existenceunder the ancien regime should be limited by the same logic

that gave them birth. To require, with respect to a rightthat is not consciously and intentionally created, that any
limitation of remedies must be express, is to provide, in ef-fect, that the most questionable of private rights will also
be the most expansively remediable. As the United Statesputs it, "[w]hatever the merits of `implying' rights of action
may be, there is no justification for treating [congressional]silence as the equivalent of the broadest imaginable grant
of remedial authority." Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 12-13.I nonetheless agree with the Court's disposition of this

case. Because of legislation enacted subsequent to Cannon,it is too late in the day to address whether a judicially implied exclusion of damages under Title IX would be appro-priate. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42
U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(2), must be read, in my view, not only"as a validation of

Cannon's holding," ante, at 72, but also asan implicit acknowledgment that damages are available.

See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7(a)(1) (withdrawing the States' Elev-enth Amendment immunity); $ 2000d-7(a)(2) (providing that,
in suits against States, "remedies (including remedies bothat law and in equity) are available for [violations of Title IX]
to the same extent as such remedies are available for such aviolation in the suit against any public or private entity other
than a State"). I therefore concur in the judgment.

Syllabus

INDOPCO, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNALREVENUE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 90-1278. Argued November 12, 1991--Decided February 26, 1992
On its 1978 federal income tax return, petitioner corporation claimed a

deduction for certain investment banking fees and expenses that it incurred during a friendly acquisition in which it was transformed from a
publicly held, freestanding corporation into a wholly owned subsidiary.
After respondent Commissioner disallowed the claim, petitioner sought
reconsideration in the Tax Court, adding to its claim deductions for legal
fees and other acquisition-related expenses. The Tax Court ruled that
because long-term benefits accrued to petitioner from the acquisition,
the expenditures were capital in nature and not deductible under

$ 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as "ordinary and necessary" business expenses. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's
argument that, because the expenses did not "create or enhance . . . a
separate and distinct additional asset," see Commissioner v. Lincoln
Savings & Loan Assn., 403 U. S. 345, 354, they could not be capitalized
under $ 263 of the Code.

Held: Petitioner's expenses do not qualify for deduction under $ 162(a).

Deductions are exceptions to the norm of capitalization and are allowed
only if there is clear provision for them in the Code and the taxpayer
has met the burden of showing a right to the deduction. Commissioner
v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn., supra, holds simply that the creation
of a separate and distinct asset may be a sufficient condition for classification as a capital expenditure, not that it is a prerequisite to such classification. Nor does Lincoln Savings prohibit reliance on future benefit
as means of distinguishing an ordinary business expense from a capital
expenditure. Although the presence of an incidental future benefit may
not warrant capitalization, a taxpayer's realization of benefits beyond
the year in which the expenditure is incurred is important in determining whether the appropriate tax treatment is immediate deduction or
capitalization. The record in the instant case amply supports the lower
courts' findings that the transaction produced significant benefits to
petitioner extending beyond the tax year in question. Pp. 83-90.

In this case we must decide whether certain professional

Internal Revenue Code.

I

Most of the relevant facts are stipulated. See App. 12,
149. Petitioner INDOPCO, Inc., formerly named National
Starch and Chemical Corporation and hereinafter referred
to as National Starch, is a Delaware corporation that manufactures and sells adhesives, starches, and specialty chemical
products. In October 1977, representatives of Unilever
United States, Inc., also a Delaware corporation (Unilever),1
expressed interest in acquiring National Starch, which was
one of its suppliers, through a friendly transaction. National Starch at the time had outstanding over 6,563,000 common shares held by approximately 3,700 shareholders. The
stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Frank
and Anna Greenwall were the corporation's largest shareholders and owned approximately 14.5% of the common.
The Greenwalls, getting along in years and concerned about

their estate plans, indicated that they would transfer their
shares to Unilever only if a transaction tax free for them
could be arranged.

Lawyers representing both sides devised a "reverse subsidiary cash merger" that they felt would satisfy the Greenwalls' concerns. Two new entities would be created--National Starch and Chemical Holding Corp. (Holding), a
subsidiary of Unilever, and NSC Merger, Inc., a subsidiary
of Holding that would have only a transitory existence. In
an exchange specifically designed to be tax free under $ 351
of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. $ 351, Holding
would exchange one share of its nonvoting preferred stock
for each share of National Starch common that it received
from National Starch shareholders. Any National Starch
common that was not so exchanged would be converted into
cash in a merger of NSC Merger, Inc., into National Starch.

In November 1977, National Starch's directors were formally advised of Unilever's interest and the proposed transaction. At that time, Debevoise, Plimpton, Lyons & Gates,
National Starch's counsel, told the directors that under Delaware law they had a fiduciary duty to ensure that the proposed transaction would be fair to the shareholders. National Starch thereupon engaged the investment banking
firm of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., to evaluate its shares, to
render a fairness opinion, and generally to assist in the event
of the emergence of a hostile tender offer.

Although Unilever originally had suggested a price between $65 and $70 per share, negotiations resulted in a final
offer of $73.50 per share, a figure Morgan Stanley found to
be fair. Following approval by National Starch's board and
the issuance of a favorable private ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service that the transaction would be tax free
under $ 351 for those National Starch shareholders who ex503us1$36F 02-24-99 09:33:28 PAGES OPINPGT

$18,000 for legal fees. The Debevoise firm charged NationalStarch $490,000, along with $15,069 for out-of-pocket expenses. National Starch also incurred expenses aggregat-ing $150,962 for miscellaneous items--such as accounting,
printing, proxy solicitation, and Securities and ExchangeCommission fees--in connection with the transaction. No
issue is raised as to the propriety or reasonableness ofthese charges.

On its federal income tax return for its short taxable yearended August 15, 1978, National Starch claimed a deduction
for the $2,225,586 paid to Morgan Stanley, but did not deductthe $505,069 paid to Debevoise or the other expenses. Upon
audit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed theclaimed deduction and issued a notice of deficiency. Petitioner sought redetermination in the United States TaxCourt, asserting, however, not only the right to deduct the
investment banking fees and expenses but, as well, the legaland miscellaneous expenses incurred.

The Tax Court, in an unreviewed decision, ruled that theexpenditures were capital in nature and therefore not deductible under $ 162(a) in the 1978 return as "ordinary andnecessary expenses."

Code allows no deduction for a capital expenditure--an"amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value ofany property or estate." $ 263(a)(1). The primary effect of
characterizing a payment as either a business expense or acapital expenditure concerns the timing of the taxpayer's

Ellis Banking Corp. v. Commissioner, 688 F. 2d 1376,1379 (CA11 1982), cert. denied, 463 U. S. 1207 (1983).

In exploring the relationship between deductions and capi-tal expenditures, this Court has noted the "familiar rule"
that "an income tax deduction is a matter of legislative graceand that the burden of clearly showing the right to the
claimed deduction is on the taxpayer." Interstate Transit
Lines v. Commissioner, 319 U. S. 590, 593 (1943); Deputy v.Du Pont, 308 U. S. 488, 493 (1940); New Colonial Ice Co. v.

Helvering, 292 U. S. 435, 440 (1934). The notion that deduc-tions are exceptions to the norm of capitalization finds support in various aspects of the Code. Deductions are specifi-cally enumerated and thus are subject to disallowance in
favor of capitalization. See $$ 161 and 261. Nondeductiblecapital expenditures, by contrast, are not exhaustively enumerated in the Code; rather than providing a "complete listof nondeductible expenditures,"

Lincoln Savings, 403 U. S.,at 358, $ 263 serves as a general means of distinguishing capital expenditures from current expenses. See Commissionerv.

Idaho Power Co., 418 U. S., at 16. For these reasons, de-ductions are strictly construed and allowed only "as there is

a clear provision therefor." New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helve-ring, 292 U. S., at 440; Deputy v. Du Pont, 308 U. S., at 493.

Opinion of the Court
The Court also has examined the interrelationship be-tween the Code's business expense and capital expenditure

provisions.5 In so doing, it has had occasion to parse $ 162(a)and explore certain of its requirements. For example, in
Lincoln Savings, we determined that, to qualify for deduc-tion under $ 162(a), "an item must (1) be `paid or incurred
during the taxable year,' (2) be for `carrying on any trade orbusiness,' (3) be an `expense,' (4) be a `necessary' expense,
and (5) be an `ordinary' expense." 403 U. S., at 352. Seealso

the type of business involved"). The Court has recognized,however, that the "decisive distinctions" between current expenses and capital expenditures "are those of degree and notof kind,"

Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S., at 114, and that because each case "turns on its special facts," Deputy v. Du
Pont, 308 U. S., at 496, the cases sometimes appear difficultto harmonize. See

Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S., at 116.
National Starch contends that the decision in Lincoln Savings changed these familiar backdrops and announced an exclusive test for identifying capital expenditures, a test inwhich "creation or enhancement of an asset" is a prerequisite

to capitalization, and deductibility under $ 162(a) is the rule
rather than the exception. Brief for Petitioner 16. We do
not agree, for we conclude that National Starch has overread
Lincoln Savings.

In Lincoln Savings, we were asked to decide whether certain premiums, required by federal statute to be paid by a
savings and loan association to the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), were ordinary and necessary expenses under $ 162(a), as Lincoln Savings argued and
the Court of Appeals had held, or capital expenditures under

$ 263, as the Commissioner contended. We found that the
"additional" premiums, the purpose of which was to provide
FSLIC with a secondary reserve fund in which each insured
institution retained a pro rata interest recoverable in certain
situations, "serv[e] to create or enhance for Lincoln what is
essentially a separate and distinct additional asset." 403
U. S., at 354. "[A]s an inevitable consequence," we concluded, "the payment is capital in nature and not an expense,
let alone an ordinary expense, deductible under $ 162(a)."
Ibid.

Lincoln Savings stands for the simple proposition that a
taxpayer's expenditure that "serves to create or enhance . . .
a separate and distinct" asset should be capitalized under

$ 263. It by no means follows, however, that only expenditures that create or enhance separate and distinct assets are

87Cite as: 503 U. S. 79 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
to be capitalized under $ 263. We had no occasion in Lincoln
Savings to consider the tax treatment of expenditures that,
unlike the additional premiums at issue there, did not createor enhance a specific asset, and thus the case cannot be read

to preclude capitalization in other circumstances. In short,
Lincoln Savings holds that the creation of a separate anddistinct asset well may be a sufficient, but not a necessary,

condition to classification as a capital expenditure. See General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326 F. 2d 712, 716
(CA8) (although expenditures may not "resul[t] in the acqui-sition or increase of a corporate asset, . . . these expenditures

are not, because of that fact, deductible as ordinary and nec-essary business expenses"), cert. denied, 379 U. S. 832 (1964).

Nor does our statement in Lincoln Savings, 403 U. S., at
354, that "the presence of an ensuing benefit that may havesome future aspect is not controlling" prohibit reliance on

future benefit as a means of distinguishing an ordinary business expense from a capital expenditure.6 Although the
mere presence of an incidental future benefit--"some future
aspect"--may not warrant capitalization, a taxpayer's realization of benefits beyond the year in which the expenditure
is incurred is undeniably important in determining whether
the appropriate tax treatment is immediate deduction or
capitalization. See United States v. Mississippi Chemical
Corp., 405 U. S. 298, 310 (1972) (expense that "is of value
in more than one taxable year" is a nondeductible capital
expenditure); Central Texas Savings & Loan Assn. v. United
States, 731 F. 2d 1181, 1183 (CA5 1984) ("While the period of
the benefits may not be controlling in all cases, it nonetheless

6 Petitioner contends that, absent a separate-and-distinct-asset requirement for capitalization, a taxpayer will have no "principled basis" upon
which to differentiate business expenses from capital expenditures. Brief
for Petitioner 37-41. We note, however, that grounding tax status on the
existence of an asset would be unlikely to produce the bright-line rule that
petitioner desires, given that the notion of an "asset" is itself flexible and
amorphous. See Johnson, 53 Tax Notes, at 477-478.

Opinion of the Court
remains a prominent, if not predominant, characteristic of acapital item"). Indeed, the text of the Code's capitalization

provision, $ 263(a)(1), which refers to "permanent improve-ments or betterments," itself envisions an inquiry into the
duration and extent of the benefits realized by the taxpayer.

III
In applying the foregoing principles to the specific expend-itures at issue in this case, we conclude that National Starch

has not demonstrated that the investment banking, legal, andother costs it incurred in connection with Unilever's acquisition of its shares are deductible as ordinary and necessarybusiness expenses under $ 162(a).

Although petitioner attempts to dismiss the benefits thataccrued to National Starch from the Unilever acquisition as
"entirely speculative" or "merely incidental," Brief for Peti-tioner 39-40, the Tax Court's and the Court of Appeals' findings that the transaction produced significant benefits to Na-tional Starch that extended beyond the tax year in question
are amply supported by the record. For example, in com-menting on the merger with Unilever, National Starch's 1978
"Progress Report" observed that the company would "bene-fit greatly from the availability of Unilever's enormous resources, especially in the area of basic technology." App. 43.See also id., at 46 (Unilever "provides new opportunities
and resources"). Morgan Stanley's report to the NationalStarch board concerning the fairness to shareholders of a
possible business combination with Unilever noted that Na-tional Starch management "feels that some synergy may
exist with the Unilever organization given a) the nature ofthe Unilever chemical, paper, plastics and packaging operations . . . and b) the strong consumer products orientation ofUnilever United States, Inc."

Id., at 77-78.In addition to these anticipated resource-related benefits,

National Starch obtained benefits through its transformationfrom a publicly held, freestanding corporation into a wholly

Opinion of the Court
owned subsidiary of Unilever. The Court of Appeals noted
that National Starch management viewed the transaction as
" `swapping approximately 3500 shareholders for one.' " 918
F. 2d, at 427; see also App. 223. Following Unilever's acquisition of National Starch's outstanding shares, National
Starch was no longer subject to what even it terms the "substantial" shareholder-relations expenses a publicly traded
corporation incurs, including reporting and disclosure obligations, proxy battles, and derivative suits. Brief for Petitioner 24. The acquisition also allowed National Starch, in
the interests of administrative convenience and simplicity, to
eliminate previously authorized but unissued shares of preferred and to reduce the total number of authorized shares
of common from 8,000,000 to 1,000. See 93 T. C., at 74.

Courts long have recognized that expenses such as these,
" `incurred for the purpose of changing the corporate structure for the benefit of future operations are not ordinary and
necessary business expenses.' " General Bancshares Corp.
v. Commissioner, 326 F. 2d, at 715 (quoting Farmers Union
Corp. v. Commissioner, 300 F. 2d 197, 200 (CA9), cert. denied, 371 U. S. 861 (1962)). See also B. Bittker & J. Eustice,
Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders
5-33 to 5-36 (5th ed. 1987) (describing "well-established
rule" that expenses incurred in reorganizing or restructuring corporate entity are not deductible under $ 162(a)). Deductions for professional expenses thus have been disallowed
in a wide variety of cases concerning changes in corporate
structure.7 Although support for these decisions can be

Opinion of the Court
found in the specific terms of $ 162(a), which require that de-ductible expenses be "ordinary and necessary" and incurred

"in carrying on any trade or business," 8 courts more fre-quently have characterized an expenditure as capital in nature because "the purpose for which the expenditure is madehas to do with the corporation's operations and betterment,
sometimes with a continuing capital asset, for the durationof its existence or for the indefinite future or for a time somewhat longer than the current taxable year." General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326 F. 2d, at 715. See alsoMills Estate, Inc. v. Commissioner, 206 F. 2d 244, 246 (CA2

1953). The rationale behind these decisions applies equallyto the professional charges at issue in this case.

IV
The expenses that National Starch incurred in Unilever'sfriendly takeover do not qualify for deduction as "ordinary

and necessary" business expenses under $ 162(a). The factthat the expenditures do not create or enhance a separate
and distinct additi onal asset is not controlling; theacquisition-related expenses bear the indicia of capital expenditures and are to be treated as such.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

"ordinary and necessary business activities," and concluding that expenses
are therefore not deductible); Greenstein, The Deductibility of Takeover

facilitate transfer of business ownership do not satisfy the "carrying on [a]

Syllabus

ARKANSAS et al. v. OKLAHOMA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 90-1262. Argued December 11, 1991--Decided February 26, 1992*
The Clean Water Act provides for two sets of water quality measures:

effluent limitations, which are promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency), and water quality standards, which
are promulgated by the States. The Act generally prohibits the discharge of effluent into a navigable body of water unless the point source
obtains a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit from a State with an EPA-approved permit program or from the
EPA itself. A Fayetteville, Arkansas, sewage treatment plant received
an EPA-issued permit, authorizing it to discharge effluent into a stream
that ultimately reaches the Illinois River upstream from the Oklahoma
border. Respondents, Oklahoma and other Oklahoma parties, challenged the permit before the EPA, alleging, inter alia, that the discharge violated Oklahoma water quality standards, which allow no degradation of water quality in the upper Illinois River. The EPA's Chief
Judicial Officer remanded the initial affirmance of the permit by the
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), ruling that the Act requires an
NPDES permit to impose any effluent limitations necessary to comply
with applicable state water quality standards, and that those standards
would be violated only if the record shows by a preponderance of the
evidence that the discharge would cause an actual detectable violation
of Oklahoma's water quality standards. The ALJ then made detailed
findings of fact, concluding that Fayetteville had satisfied the Chief Judicial Officer's standard, and the Chief Judicial Officer sustained the permit's issuance. The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the Act does
not allow a permit to be issued where a proposed source would discharge
effluent that would contribute to conditions currently constituting a violation of applicable water quality standards. It concluded that the Illinois River was already degraded, that the Fayetteville effluent would
reach the river in Oklahoma, and that the effluent would contribute to
the river's deterioration even though it would not detectably affect the
river's water quality.

*Together with No. 90-1266, Environmental Protection Agency v.

92 ARKANSAS v. OKLAHOMA

Syllabus
Held: The EPA's action was authorized by the Clean Water Act.

Pp. 98-114.

(a) Where interstate discharge is involved, both federal common law
of nuisance, Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, and an affected State's
common law, International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 493, are
pre-empted. Affected States may not block a permit, but must apply to
the EPA Administrator, who may disapprove a plan if he concludes that
the discharge will have an undue impact on interstate waters. Id., at
490-491. Pp. 98-101.

(b) The EPA has construed the Act as requiring that EPA-issued permits comply with the requirements for a permit issued under an approved state plan and with $ 401(a) of the Act, which appears to prohibit
the issuance of a federal permit over the objection of an affected State
unless compliance with the affected State's water quality requirements
can be insured. Pp. 101-103.

(c) The EPA's requirement that the Fayetteville discharge comply
with Oklahoma's water quality standards is a reasonable exercise of the
substantial statutory discretion Congress has vested in the Agency.
There is no need to address the question whether the Act requires compliance with affected States' standards, for it clearly does not limit the
EPA's authority to mandate such compliance. EPA regulations, which
since 1973 have required that an NPDES permit not be issued when
compliance with affected States' water quality standards cannot be insured, are a reasonable exercise of the Agency's discretion and are a
well-tailored means of reaching the Act's goal of achieving state water
quality standards. The EPA's authority is not constrained by the limits
in Ouellette, supra, concerning an affected State's direct input into the
permit process, does not conflict with the Act's legislative history and
statutory scheme, and is not incompatible with the balance among
competing policies and interests that Congress struck in the Act.
Pp. 104-107.

(d) Contrary to the Court of Appeals' interpretation, nothing in the
Act mandates a complete ban on discharges into a waterway that is in
violation of existing water quality standards. Instead, the Act vests in
the EPA and the States broad authority to develop long-range, areawide programs to alleviate and eliminate existing pollution. Pp. 107-108.

(e) The Court of Appeals exceeded the legitimate scope of judicial
review of an agency adjudication when it invalidated the EPA's issuance
of the permit on the ground that the Agency misinterpreted Oklahoma's
water quality standards. It substituted its own reading of the law for
the EPA's. Thus, it failed to give substantial deference to the Agency's
reasonable, consistently held interpretation of its own regulations,
which incorporate the Oklahoma standards. It also disregarded well503us1$37z 02-24-99 09:35:52 PAGES OPINPGT

established standards for reviewing factual findings of agencies by making its own factual findings when the ALJ's findings were supported by
substantial evidence. See generally Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,
340 U. S. 474. As a result, the court's conclusion that the river's degradation was an important and relevant factor which the EPA failed to
consider was based on its own erroneous interpretation of the controlling law. Had it been properly respectful of the EPA's permissible
reading of the Act--that what matters is not the river's current status,
but whether the proposed discharge will have a detectable effect on that
status--it would not have adjudged the Agency's decision arbitrary and
capricious. Pp. 109-114.

Opinion of the Court
ma's water quality standards satisfied the EPA's duty to pro-tect the interests of the downstream State. Disagreeing

with the Court of Appeals, we hold that the Agency's actionwas authorized by the statute.

I
In 1985, the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas, applied to theEPA, seeking a permit for the city's new sewage treatment

plant under the National Pollution Discharge EliminationSystem (NPDES). After the appropriate procedures, the
EPA, pursuant to $ 402(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U. S. C.$ 1342(a)(1), issued a permit authorizing the plant to discharge up to half of its effluent (to a limit of 6.1 milliongallons per day) into an unnamed stream in northwestern
Arkansas.1 That flow passes through a series of threecreeks for about 17 miles, and then enters the Illinois River
at a point 22 miles upstream from the Arkansas-Oklahomaborder.

The permit imposed specific limitations on the quantity,content, and character of the discharge and also included a
number of special conditions, including a provision that if astudy then underway indicated that more stringent limitations were necessary to ensure compliance with Oklahoma'swater quality standards, the permit would be modified to
incorporate those limits. App. 84.Respondents challenged this permit before the EPA, alleging, inter alia, that the discharge violated the Oklahomawater quality standards. Those standards provide that "no
degradation [of water quality] shall be allowed" in the upperIllinois River, including the portion of the river immediately
downstream from the state line.2

1 The permit also authorized the plant to discharge the remainder of its
effluent into the White River, a river that does not flow into Oklahoma;
this aspect of the permit is not at issue in this litigation.

2 Section 5 of the Oklahoma water quality standards provides:

"All streams and bodies of water designated as (a) are protected by
prohibition of any new point source discharge of wastes or increased load

Opinion of the Court
Following a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)concluded that the Oklahoma standards would not be implicated unless the contested discharge had "something morethan a mere de minimis impact" on the State's waters. He
found that the discharge would not have an "undue impact"on Oklahoma's waters and, accordingly, affirmed the issuance of the permit. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 90-1262,pp. 101a-103a (emphasis deleted).

On a petition for review, the EPA's Chief Judicial Officerfirst ruled that $ 301(b)(1)(C) of the Clean Water Act "requires an NPDES permit to impose any effluent limitationsnecessary to comply with applicable state water quality
standards." 3 Id., at 116a-117a. He then held that the Act
from an existing point source except under conditions described in Section 3.

"All streams designated by the State as `scenic river areas,' and such
tributaries of those streams as may be appropriate will be so designated.
Best management practices for control of nonpoint source discharge should
be initiated when feasible." App. 46-47.

Oklahoma has designated the portion of the Illinois River immediately
downstream from the state line as a "scenic river." Okla. Stat., Tit. 82,

$ 1452(b)(1) (Supp. 1989); see also App. 54.

Section 3 of the Oklahoma water quality standards provides, in relevant part:

"The intent of the Anti-degradation Policy is to protect all waters of the
State from quality degradation. Existing instream water uses shall be
maintained and protected. No further water quality degradation which
would interfere with or become injurious to existing instream water uses
shall be allowed. Oklahoma's waters constitute a valuable State resource
and shall be protected, maintained and improved for the benefit of all
the citizens.. . . . .

"No degradation shall be allowed in high quality waters which constitute an outstanding resource or in waters of exceptional recreational or

and EPA regulations offered greater protection for thedownstream State than the ALJ's "undue impact" standard

suggested. He explained the proper standard as follows:

"[A] mere theoretical impairment of Oklahoma's waterquality standards--

i. e., an infinitesimal impairment pre-dicted through modeling but not expected to be actually

detectable or measurable--should not by itself block theissuance of the permit. In this case, the permit should
be upheld if the record shows by a preponderance of theevidence that the authorized discharges would not cause
an actual detectable violation of Oklahoma's water qual-ity standards."

Id., at 117a (emphasis in original).

On remand, the ALJ made detailed findings of fact andconcluded that the city had satisfied the standard set forth

by the Chief Judicial Officer. Specifically, the ALJ foundthat there would be no detectable violation of any of the
components of Oklahoma's water quality standards. Id., at127a-143a. The Chief Judicial Officer sustained the issuance
of the permit. Id., at 145a-153a.Both the petitioners in No. 90-1262 (collectively Arkansas)
and the respondents in this litigation sought judicial review.4Arkansas argued that the Clean Water Act did not require
an Arkansas point source to comply with Oklahoma's waterquality standards. Oklahoma challenged the EPA's determination that the Fayetteville discharge would not producea detectable violation of the Oklahoma standards.

The Court of Appeals did not accept either of these argu-ments. The court agreed with the EPA that the statute required compliance with Oklahoma's water quality standards,

"(C) not later than July 1, 1977, any more stringent limitation, including
those necessary to meet water quality standards . . . established pursuant

the Fayetteville plant would not produce a detectable viola-tion of those standards. Id., at 631-633. Nevertheless, relying on a theory that neither party had advanced, the Courtof Appeals reversed the Agency's issuance of the Fayetteville permit. The court first ruled that the statute requiresthat "where a proposed source would discharge effluents that
would contribute to conditions currently constituting a viola-tion of applicable water quality standards, such [a] proposed
source may not be permitted." Id., at 620. Then the courtfound that the Illinois River in Oklahoma was "already degraded," that the Fayetteville effluent would reach the Illi-nois River in Oklahoma, and that that effluent could "be expected to contribute to the ongoing deterioration of thescenic [Illinois R]iver" in Oklahoma even though it would not
detectably affect the river's water quality. Id., at 621-629.The importance and the novelty of the Court of Appeals'
decision persuaded us to grant certiorari. 499 U. S. 946(1991). We now reverse.

Interstate waters have been a font of controversy sincethe founding of the Nation.

E. g., Gibbons v. Ogden, 9Wheat. 1 (1824). This Court has frequently resolved disputes between States that are separated by a common river,see,

e. g., Ohio v. Kentucky, 444 U. S. 335 (1980), that borderthe same body of water, see, e. g., New York v. New Jersey,

256 U. S. 296 (1921), or that are fed by the same river basin,see, e. g., New Jersey v. New York, 283 U. S. 336 (1931).

Among these cases are controversies between a State thatintroduces pollutants to a waterway and a downstream State
that objects. See, e. g., Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496(1906). In such cases, this Court has applied principles of
common law tempered by a respect for the sovereignty ofthe States. Compare

id., at 521, with Georgia v. TennesseeCopper Co., 206 U. S. 230, 237 (1907). In forging what "may

however, we remained aware "that new federal laws and newfederal regulations may in time pre-empt the field of federal
common law of nuisance." Id., at 107.In

Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304 (1981) (MilwaukeeII), we held that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act

Amendments of 1972 did just that. In addressing Illinois'claim that Milwaukee's discharges into Lake Michigan constituted a nuisance, we held that the comprehensive regulatoryregime created by the 1972 amendments pre-empted Illinois'
federal common law remedy. We observed that Congresshad addressed many of the problems we had identified in
Milwaukee I by providing a downstream State with an op-portunity for a hearing before the source State's permitting
agency, by requiring the latter to explain its failure to acceptany recommendations offered by the downstream State, and
by authorizing the EPA, in its discretion, to veto a sourceState's issuance of any permit if the waters of another State
may be affected. Milwaukee II, 451 U. S., at 325-326.In Milwaukee II, the Court did not address whether the
1972 amendments had supplanted state common law reme-dies as well as the federal common law remedy. See id., at
310, n. 4. On remand, Illinois argued that $ 510 of the CleanWater Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 1370, expressly preserved the State's
right to adopt and enforce rules that are more stringent thanfederal standards.

This Court subsequently endorsed that analysis in International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481 (1987), in whichVermont property owners claimed that the pollution discharged into Lake Champlain by a paper company located inNew York constituted a nuisance under Vermont law. The
Court held the Clean Water Act taken "as a whole, its pur-poses and its history" pre-empted an action based on the law
of the affected State and that the only state law applicableto an interstate discharge is "the law of the State in which
the point source is located." Id., at 493, 487. Moreover, inreviewing $ 402(b) of the Act, the Court pointed out that
when a new permit is being issued by the source State'spermit-granting agency, the downstream State

"does not have the authority to block the issuance of thepermit if it is dissatisfied with the proposed standards.
An affected State's only recourse is to apply to the EPAAdministrator, who then has the discretion to disapprove the permit if he concludes that the dischargeswill have an undue impact on interstate waters.

$ 1342(d)(2). . . . Thus the Act makes it clear that affectedStates occupy a subordinate position to source States in
the federal regulatory program." Id., at 490-491.6
6 This description of the downstream State's role in the issuance of a
new permit by a source State was apparently consistent with the EPA's
interpretation of the Act at the time. The Government's amicus curiae
brief in Ouellette stated that "the affected neighboring state [has] only an
advisory role in the formulation of applicable effluent standards or limitations. The affected state may try to persuade the federal government
or the source state to increase effluent requirements, but ultimately
possesses no statutory authority to compel that result, even when its
waters are adversely affected by out-of-state pollution. See 33 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court
Unlike the foregoing cases, this litigation involves not astate-issued permit, but a federally issued permit. To explain the significance of this distinction, we comment furtheron the statutory scheme before addressing the specific issues
raised by the parties. III

The Clean Water Act anticipates a partnership betweenthe States and the Federal Government, animated by a
shared objective: "to restore and maintain the chemical,physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters."
33 U. S. C. $ 1251(a). Toward this end, the Act provides fortwo sets of water quality measures. "Effluent limitations"
are promulgated by the EPA and restrict the quantities,rates, and concentrations of specified substances which
are discharged from point sources. See $$ 1311, 1314."[W]ater quality standards" are, in general, promulgated by
the States and establish the desired condition of a waterway.See $ 1313. These standards supplement effluent limitations "so that numerous point sources, despite individualcompliance with effluent limitations, may be further regulated to prevent water quality from falling below acceptablelevels." EPA v. California ex rel. State Water Resources
Control Bd., 426 U. S. 200, 205, n. 12 (1976).The EPA provides States with substantial guidance in the
drafting of water quality standards. See generally 40 CFRpt. 131 (1991) (setting forth model water quality standards).
Moreover, $ 303 of the Act requires, inter alia, that stateauthorities periodically review water quality standards and
secure the EPA's approval of any revisions in the standards.If the EPA recommends changes to the standards and the
State fails to comply with that recommendation, the Act au-thorizes the EPA to promulgate water quality standards for
the State. 33 U. S. C. $ 1313(c).The primary means for enforcing these limitations and
standards is the NPDES, enacted in 1972 as a critical partof Congress' "complete rewriting" of federal water pollution

law. Milwaukee II, 451 U. S., at 317. Section 301(a) of theAct, 33 U. S. C. $ 1311(a), generally prohibits the discharge of

any effluent into a navigable body of water unless the pointsource has obtained an NPDES permit. Section 402 establishes the NPDES permitting regime, and describes two
types of permitting systems: state permit programs thatmust satisfy federal requirements and be approved by the

EPA, and a federal program administered by the EPA.

Section 402(b) authorizes each State to establish "its own
permit program for discharges into navigable waters within
its jurisdiction." 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(b). Among the requirements the state program must satisfy are the procedural protections for downstream States discussed in Ouellette and
Milwaukee II. See $$ 1342(b)(3), (5).7 Although these provisions do not authorize the downstream State to veto the
issuance of a permit for a new point source in another State,
the Administrator retains authority to block the issuance of
any state-issued permit that is "outside the guidelines and
requirements" of the Act. $ 1342(d)(2).8

7 Section 402(b) requires state permit programs
"(3) [t]o insure that . . . any other State the waters of which may be
affected . . . receive notice of each application for a permit and to provide
an opportunity for public hearing before a ruling on each such application;. . . . .

"(5) [t]o insure that any State (other than the permitting State), whose
waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may submit written
recommendations to the permitting State (and the Administrator) with
respect to any permit application and, if any part of such written recommendations are not accepted by the permitting State, that the permitting
State will notify such affected State (and the Administrator) in writing of
its failure to so accept such recommendations together with its reasons for
so doing." 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(b).

Although $ 402(b) focuses on state-issued permits, $ 402(a)(3) requires
that, in issuing an NPDES permit, the Administrator follow the same procedures required of state permit programs. See 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(a)(3);
see also $ 1341(a)(2).

8 Section 402(d)(2) provides:

of the date of his notification under subsection (b)(5) of this section objects

Opinion of the Court
In the absence of an approved state program, the EPAmay issue an NPDES permit under $ 402(a) of the Act. (In

these cases, for example, because Arkansas had not been au-thorized to issue NPDES permits when the Fayetteville
plant was completed, the permit was issued by the EPA it-self.) The EPA's permit program is subject to the "same
terms, conditions, and requirements" as a state permit pro-gram. 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(a)(3). Notwithstanding this general symmetry, the EPA has construed the Act as requiringthat EPA-issued NPDES permits also comply with $ 401(a).
That section, which predates $ 402 and the NPDES, appliesto a broad category of federal licenses, and sets forth requirements for "[a]ny applicant for a Federal license orpermit to conduct any activity including, but not limited to,
the construction or operation of facilities, which may resultin any discharge into the navigable waters." 33 U. S. C.

ninety days of the date of transmittal of the proposed permit by the State
objects in writing to the issuance of such permit as being outside the
guidelines and requirements of this chapter. Whenever the Administrator objects to the issuance of a permit under this paragraph such written
objection shall contain a statement of the reasons for such objection and
the effluent limitations and conditions which such permit would include if
it were issued by the Administrator." 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(d)(2).

9 Section 401(a)(2) provides, in relevant part:

"Whenever such a discharge may affect, as determined by the Administrator, the quality of the waters of any other State, the Administrator . . .
shall so notify such other State, the licensing or permitting agency, and
the applicant. If, within sixty days after receipt of such notification, such
other State determines that such discharge will affect the quality of its
waters so as to violate any water quality requirements in such State, and
within such sixty-day period notifies the Administrator and the licensing
or permitting agency in writing of its objection to the issuance of such
license or permit and requests a public hearing on such objection, the

Opinion of the Court

IV
The parties have argued three analytically distinct questions concerning the interpretation of the Clean Water Act.
First, does the Act require the EPA, in crafting and issuing
a permit to a point source in one State, to apply the water
quality standards of downstream States? Second, even if
the Act does not require as much, does the Agency have the
statutory authority to mandate such compliance? Third,
does the Act provide, as the Court of Appeals held, that once
a body of water fails to meet water quality standards no
discharge that yields effluent that reach the degraded waters
will be permitted?

In these cases, it is neither necessary nor prudent for us
to resolve the first of these questions. In issuing the Fayetteville permit, the EPA assumed it was obligated by both
the Act and its own regulations to ensure that the Fayetteville discharge would not violate Oklahoma's standards. See
App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 90-1262, pp. 116a-117a, and
n. 14. As we discuss below, this assumption was permissible
and reasonable and therefore there is no need for us to address whether the Act requires as much. Moreover, much
of the analysis and argument in the briefs of the parties relies on statutory provisions that govern not only federal permits issued pursuant to $$ 401(a) and 402(a), but also state
permits issued under $ 402(b). It seems unwise to evaluate
those arguments in a case such as these, which only involve
a federal permit.

tor shall at such hearing submit his evaluation and recommendations with
respect to any such objection to the licensing or permitting agency. Such
agency, based upon the recommendations of such State, the Administrator,
and upon any additional evidence, if any, presented to the agency at the
hearing, shall condition such license or permit in such manner as may be
necessary to insure compliance with applicable water quality requirements. If the imposition of conditions cannot insure such compliance such
agency shall not issue such license or permit." 33 U. S. C. $ 1341(a)(2).

105Cite as: 503 U. S. 91 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Our decision not to determine at this time the scope of theAgency's statutory obligations does not affect our resolution

of the second question, which concerns the Agency's statu-tory authority. Even if the Clean Water Act itself does not
require the Fayetteville discharge to comply with Oklaho-ma's water quality standards, the statute clearly does not
limit the EPA's authority to mandate such compliance.Since 1973, EPA regulations have provided that an
NPDES permit shall not be issued "[w]hen the imposition ofconditions cannot ensure compliance with the applicable
water quality requirements of all affected States." 10 40CFR $ 122.4(d) (1991); see also 38 Fed. Reg. 13533 (1973);
40 CFR $ 122.44(d) (1991). Those regulations--relied uponby the EPA in the issuance of the Fayetteville permit--

constitute a reasonable exercise of the Agency's statutoryauthority.

Congress has vested in the Administrator broad discretionto establish conditions for NPDES permits. Section 402(a)
(2) provides that for EPA-issued permits "[t]he Administra-tor shall prescribe conditions . . . to assure compliance with
the requirements of [$ 402(a)(1)] and such other requirementsas he deems appropriate." 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(a)(2) (emphasis
added). Similarly, Congress preserved for the Administra-tor broad authority to oversee state permit programs:

"No permit shall issue . . . if the Administrator . . .objects in writing to the issuance of such permit as being
outside the guidelines and requirements of this chap-ter." $ 1342(d)(2).

The regulations relied on by the EPA were a perfectlyreasonable exercise of the Agency's statutory discretion.
The application of state water quality standards in the inter-state context is wholly consistent with the Act's broad purpose "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and

by an approved state program. See 40 CFR $ 123.25 (1991).

Opinion of the Court
biological integrity of the Nation's waters." 33 U. S. C.$ 1251(a). Moreover, as noted above, $ 301(b)(1)(C) expressly

identifies the achievement of state water quality standardsas one of the Act's central objectives. The Agency's regulations conditioning NPDES permits are a well-tailored meansof achieving this goal.

Notwithstanding this apparent reasonableness, Arkansasargues that our description in

Ouellette of the role of affectedStates in the permit process and our characterization of the

affected States' position as "subordinate," see 479 U. S., at490-491, indicates that the EPA's application of the Oklahoma standards was error. We disagree. Our statement in
Ouellette concerned only an affected State's input into thepermit process; that input is clearly limited by the plain language of $ 402(b). Limits on an affected State's direct par-ticipation in permitting decisions, however, do not in any way
constrain the EPA's authority to require a point source tocomply with downstream water quality standards.

Arkansas also argues that regulations requiring compli-ance with downstream standards are at odds with the legislative history of the Act and with the statutory scheme es-tablished by the Act. Although we agree with Arkansas
that the Act's legislative history indicates that Congress in-tended to grant the Administrator discretion in his oversight
of the issuance of NPDES permits,11 we find nothing in thathistory to indicate that Congress intended to preclude the
EPA from establishing a general requirement that such per-mits be conditioned to ensure compliance with downstream
water quality standards.Similarly, we agree with Arkansas that in the Clean Water
Act Congress struck a careful balance among competing poli-cies and interests, but do not find the EPA regulations con11 See, e. g., 1 Legislative History of Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on
Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93-1, pp. 322, 388-389,

Opinion of the Court
cerning the application of downstream water quality stand-ards at all incompatible with that balance. Congress, in

crafting the Act, protected certain sovereign interests of theStates; for example, $ 510 allows States to adopt more demanding pollution-control standards than those establishedunder the Act. Arkansas emphasizes that $ 510 preserves
such state authority only as it is applied to the waters of theregulating State. Even assuming Arkansas' construction of

$ 510 is correct, cf. id., at 493, that section only concerns stateauthority and does not constrain the

EPA's authority to pro-mulgate reasonable regulations requiring point sources in

one State to comply with water quality standards in down-stream States.

For these reasons, we find the EPA's requirement that theFayetteville discharge comply with Oklahoma's water quality
standards to be a reasonable exercise of the Agency's sub-stantial statutory discretion. Cf.

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-

845 (1984). V

The Court of Appeals construed the Clean Water Act toprohibit any discharge of effluent that would reach waters
already in violation of existing water quality standards.12We find nothing in the Act to support this reading.

12 "[W]e hold that the Clean Water Act prohibits granting an NPDES
permit under the circumstances of this case (i. e., where applicable water
quality standards have already been violated) and reverse EPA's decision
to permit Fayetteville to discharge any part of its effluent to the Illinois
River Basin." 908 F. 2d 595, 616 (CA10 1990).

"Congress cannot reasonably be presumed to have intended to exclude
from the CWA's `all-encompassing program,' 451 U. S., at 318, a permitting

more unfathomable that Congress fashioned a `comprehensive . . . policy
for the elimination of water pollution,' id., which sanctions continued pollution once minimum water quality standards have been transgressed.
More likely, Congress simply never contemplated that EPA or a state
would consider it permissible to authorize further pollution under such

108 ARKANSAS v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
The interpretation of the statute adopted by the court had
not been advanced by any party during the Agency or court
proceedings. Moreover, the Court of Appeals candidly acknowledged that its theory "has apparently never before
been addressed by a federal court." 908 F. 2d, at 620, n. 39.
The only statutory provision the court cited to support its
legal analysis was $ 402(h), see id., at 633, which merely authorizes the EPA (or a state permit program) to prohibit a
publicly owned treatment plant that is violating a condition
of its NPDES permit from accepting any additional pollutants for treatment until the ongoing violation has been corrected. See 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(h).

Although the Act contains several provisions directing
compliance with state water quality standards, see, e. g.,

$ 1311(b)(1)(C), the parties have pointed to nothing that mandates a complete ban on discharges into a waterway that is
in violation of those standards. The statute does, however,
contain provisions designed to remedy existing water quality
violations and to allocate the burden of reducing undesirable
discharges between existing sources and new sources. See,
e. g., $ 1313(d). Thus, rather than establishing the categorical ban announced by the Court of Appeals--which might
frustrate the construction of new plants that would improve
existing conditions--the Clean Water Act vests in the EPA
and the States broad authority to develop long-range, areawide programs to alleviate and eliminate existing pollution.
See, e. g., $ 1288(b)(2).

To the extent that the Court of Appeals relied on its interpretation of the Act to reverse the EPA's permitting decision, that reliance was misplaced.

or the irrational purpose necessary to uphold EPA's action in this case."

Opinion of the Court

VI
The Court of Appeals also concluded that the EPA's issu-ance of the Fayetteville permit was arbitrary and capricious

because the Agency misinterpreted Oklahoma's water qual-ity standards. The primary difference

13 between the court's

and the Agency's interpretation of the standards derivesfrom the court's construction of the Act. Contrary to the

EPA's interpretation of the Oklahoma standards, the Courtof Appeals read those standards as containing the same categorical ban on new discharges that the court had found inthe Clean Water Act itself. Although we do not believe the
text of the Oklahoma standards supports the court's reading(indeed, we note that Oklahoma itself had not advanced that
interpretation in its briefs in the Court of Appeals), we re-ject it for a more fundamental reason--namely, that the
Court of Appeals exceeded the legitimate scope of judicialreview of an agency adjudication. To emphasize the importance of this point, we shall first briefly assess the soundnessof the EPA's interpretation and application of the Oklahoma

13 The court identified three errors in the EPA's reading of the Oklahoma
standards. First, the court correctly observed that the ALJ and the
Chief Judicial Officer misinterpreted $ 4.10(c) of the standards as governing only the discharge of phosphorus into lakes, rather than the discharge
of phosphorus into lakes and into all "perennial and intermittent streams."
Id., at 617 (emphasis omitted). This error was harmless because the ALJ
found that the discharge into Lake Francis would comply with $ 4.10(c)
and it is undisputed that that discharge produced a greater threat to the
slow-moving water of the lake than to the rapid flow in the river.

The second flaw identified by the court was the ALJ's mistaken reliance
on the 1985, rather than the 1982 version, of the Oklahoma standards. We
agree with the Chief Judicial Officer, who also noted this error, that the
portions of the two versions relevant to this case "do not differ materially."
App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 90-1262, p. 150a. Therefore, this error was
also harmless.

Because these two errors were harmless, we have focused in the text
on the major difference between the court's and the EPA's readings of the
Oklahoma standards: the "no degradation" provision.

standards and then comment more specifically on the Courtof Appeals' approach.

As discussed above, an EPA regulation requires anNPDES permit to comply "with the applicable water quality requirements of all affected States." 40 CFR $ 122.4(d)(1991). This regulation effectively incorporates into federal
law those state-law standards the Agency reasonably deter-mines to be "applicable." In such a situation, then, state
water quality standards--promulgated by the States withsubstantial guidance from the EPA

14 and approved by the

Agency--are part of the federal law of water pollutioncontrol.

Two features of the body of law governing water pollutionsupport this conclusion. First, as discussed more thoroughly above, we have long recognized that interstate waterpollution is controlled by

federal law. See supra, at 98-100.Recognizing that the system of federally approved state

standards as applied in the interstate context constitutesfederal law is wholly consistent with this principle. Second,
treating state standards in interstate controversies as fed-eral law accords with the Act's purpose of authorizing the
EPA to create and manage a uniform system of interstatewater pollution regulation.

Because we recognize that, at least insofar as they affectthe issuance of a permit in another State, the Oklahoma
standards have a federal character, the EPA's reasonable,consistently held interpretation of those standards is entitled
to substantial deference. Cf. INS v. National Center forImmigrants' Rights, 502 U. S. 183, 189-190 (1991); Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467U. S. 837 (1984). In these cases, the Chief Judicial Officer
ruled that the Oklahoma standards--which require thatthere be "no degradation" of the upper Illinois River--would

14 See supra, at 101. Oklahoma's water quality standards closely track
the EPA's model standards in effect at that time. Compare $ 3 of the
Oklahoma standards with 40 CFR $ 35.1550(e)(1) (1981).

only be violated if the discharge effected an "actually detect-able or measurable" change in water quality. App. to Pet.

for Cert. in No. 90-1262, p. 117a.This interpretation of the Oklahoma standards is certainly
reasonable and consistent with the purposes and principlesof the Clean Water Act. As the Chief Judicial Officer noted,
"unless there is some method for measuring compliance,there is no way to ensure compliance."

Id., at 118a, n. 16(internal quotation marks omitted; citation omitted). Moreover, this interpretation of the Oklahoma standards makeseminent sense in the interstate context: If every discharge
that had some theoretical impact on a downstream Statewere interpreted as "degrading" the downstream waters,
downstream States might wield an effective veto over up-stream discharges.

The EPA's application of those standards in these caseswas also sound. On remand, the ALJ scrutinized the record
and made explicit factual findings regarding four primarymeasures of water quality under the Oklahoma standards:
eutrophication,15 esthetics,16 dissolved oxygen,17 and met15 Eutrophication is the "normally slow aging process by which a lake
evolves into a bog or marsh . . . . During eutrophication the lake becomes
so rich in nutritive compounds (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) that
algae and other microscopic plant life become superabundant, thereby
`choking' the lake . . . ." App. 57-58. With regard to eutrophication,
the ALJ found that the Fayetteville plant would discharge 30 pounds of
phosphorus per day, only about 6 pounds of which would reach the
Arkansas/Oklahoma border, and that such a small amount would not result
in an increase in eutrophication. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 90-1262,
p. 129a.

16 With regard to esthetics, the ALJ concluded that the only discharged

compound that would affect esthetics was phosphorus and that, again, the
amount of that substance crossing the border would not affect the esthetic
quality of Oklahoma's waters. Id., at 135a-136a.

17 With regard to dissolved oxygen, the ALJ found that in the 39 miles

between discharge and the border the effluent would experience "complete
oxygen recovery" and therefore would not affect the dissolved oxygen levels in the river. Id., at 140a.

Opinion of the Court
als.18 In each case, the ALJ found that the Fayetteville dis-charge would not lead to a detectable change in water quality. He therefore concluded that the Fayetteville dischargewould not violate the Oklahoma water quality standards. Because we agree with the Agency's Chief Judicial Officer thatthese findings are supported by substantial evidence, we conclude that the Court of Appeals should have affirmed boththe EPA's construction of the regulations and the issuance
of the Fayetteville permit.In its review of the EPA's interpretation and application
of the Oklahoma standards, the Court of Appeals committedthree mutually compounding errors.

First, the court failed to give due regard to the EPA'sinterpretation of its own regulations, as those regulations
incorporate the Oklahoma standards. Instead the courtvoiced its own interpretation of the governing law and concluded that "where a proposed source would discharge efflu-ents that would contribute to conditions currently constituting a violation of applicable water quality standards, such [a]proposed source may not be permitted." 908 F. 2d, at 620.
As we have already pointed out, that reading of the law isnot supported by the statute or by any EPA regulation.
The Court of Appeals sat in review of an agency action andshould have afforded the EPA's interpretation of the governing law an appropriate level of deference. See generally
Chevron, supra, at 842-844.Second, the court disregarded well-established standards

for reviewing the factual findings of agencies and insteadmade its own factual findings. The troubling nature of the
court's analysis appears on the face of the opinion itself: Atleast four times, the court concluded that "there was substantial evidence before the ALJ to support" particular find-ings which the court thought appropriate, but which were

18 With regard to metals, the ALJ concluded that the concentrations of
metals would be so low as not to violate the Oklahoma standards. Id.,
at 143a.

Opinion of the Court
contrary to those actually made by the ALJ. 908 F. 2d, at620, 625, 627, 629. Although we have long recognized the

"substantial evidence" standard in administrative law, thecourt below turned that analysis on its head. A court reviewing an agency's adjudicative action should accept the
agency's factual findings if those findings are supported bysubstantial evidence on the record as a whole. See generally Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474 (1951).The court should not supplant the agency's findings merely
by identifying alternative findings that could be supportedby substantial evidence.

Third, the court incorrectly concluded that the EPA's decision was arbitrary and capricious. This error is derivative
of the court's first two errors. Having substituted its reading of the governing law for the Agency's, and having made
its own factual findings, the Court of Appeals concluded that
the EPA erred in not considering an important and relevant
fact--namely, that the upper Illinois River was (by the
court's assessment) already degraded.

As we have often recognized, an agency ruling is "arbitrary and capricious if the agency has . . . entirely failed to
consider an important aspect of the problem." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut.
Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983). However, in
these cases, the degraded status of the river is only an "important aspect" because of the Court of Appeals' novel and
erroneous interpretation of the controlling law. Under the
EPA's interpretation of that law, what matters is not the
river's current status, but rather whether the proposed
discharge will have a "detectable effect" on that status. If
the Court of Appeals had been properly respectful of the
Agency's permissible reading of the Act and the Oklahoma
standards, the court would not have adjudged the Agency's
decision arbitrary and capricious for this reason.

In sum, the Court of Appeals made a policy choice that it
was not authorized to make. Arguably, as that court sug503us1$37I 02-24-99 09:35:52 PAGES OPINPGT
114 ARKANSAS v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
gested, it might be wise to prohibit any discharge into theIllinois River, even if that discharge would have no adverse

impact on water quality. But it was surely not arbitrary forthe EPA to conclude--given the benefits to the river from
the increased flow of relatively clean water 19 and the benefitsachieved in Arkansas by allowing the new plant to operate
as designed--that allowing the discharge would be evenwiser. It is not our role, or that of the Court of Appeals, to
decide which policy choice is the better one, for it is clearthat Congress has entrusted such decisions to the Environmental Protection Agency.Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

19 Justice Holmes recognized this potential benefit years ago:
"There is no pretence that there is a nuisance of the simple kind that was
known to the older common law. There is nothing which can be detected
by the unassisted senses--no visible increase of filth, no new smell. On
the contrary, it is proved that the great volume of pure water from Lake
Michigan which is mixed with the sewage at the start has improved the
Illinois River in these respects to a noticeable extent. Formerly it was
sluggish and ill smelling. Now it is a comparatively clear stream to which
edible fish have returned. Its water is drunk by the fisherman, it is said,
without evil results." Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496, 522 (1906).

COLLINS v. CITY OF HARKER HEIGHTS, TEXAS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 90-1279. Argued November 5, 1991--Decided February 26, 1992
Larry Collins, an employee in respondent city's sanitation department,

died of asphyxia after entering a manhole to unstop a sewer line. Petitioner, his widow, brought this action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging,
inter alia, that Collins had a right under the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment "to be free from unreasonable risks of harm . . .
and . . . to be protected from the [city's] custom and policy of deliberate
indifference toward [its employees'] safety"; that the city had violated
that right by following a custom and policy of not training its employees
about the dangers of working in sewers and not providing safety equipment and warnings; and that the city had systematically and intentionally failed to provide the equipment and training required by a Texas
statute. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that
it did not allege a constitutional violation. Without reaching the question whether the city had violated Collins' constitutional rights, the
Court of Appeals affirmed on the theory that there had been no "abuse
of governmental power," which the court found to be a necessary element of a $ 1983 action.

Held: Because a city's customary failure to train or warn its employees

about known hazards in the workplace does not violate the Due Process
Clause, $ 1983 does not provide a remedy for a municipal employee who
is fatally injured in the course of his employment as a result of the city's
failure. Pp. 119-130.

(a) This Court's cases do not support the Court of Appeals' reading
of $ 1983 as requiring an abuse of governmental power separate and
apart from the proof of a constitutional violation. Contrary to that
court's analysis, neither the fact that Collins was a government employee nor the characterization of the city's deliberate indifference to
his safety as something other than an "abuse of governmental power"
is a sufficient reason for refusing to entertain petitioner's federal claim
under $ 1983. Proper analysis requires that two issues be separated
when a $ 1983 claim is asserted against a municipality: (1) whether plaintiff's harm was caused by a constitutional violation, and (2) if so,
whether the city is responsible for that violation. Pp. 119-120.

(b) It is assumed for the purpose of decision that the complaint's use
of the term "deliberate indifference" to characterize the city's failure to

503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:03 PAGES OPINPGT
116 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTS

Syllabus
train its sanitation department employees is sufficient to hold the city
responsible if the complaint has also alleged a constitutional violation.
See Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378. Pp. 120-124.

(c) The complaint has not alleged a constitutional violation. Neither
the Due Process Clause's text--which, inter alia, guarantees due process in connection with any deprivation of liberty by a State--nor its
history supports petitioner's unprecedented claim that the Clause imposes an independent substantive duty upon municipalities to provide
certain minimal levels of safety and security in the workplace. Although the "process" that the Clause guarantees includes a continuing
obligation to satisfy certain minimal custodial standards for those who
have already been deprived of their liberty, petitioner cannot maintain
that the city deprived Collins of his liberty when it made, and he voluntarily accepted, an employment offer. Also unpersuasive is petitioner's
claim that the city's alleged failure to train its employees, or to warn
them about known risks of harm, was an omission that can properly be
characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional
sense. Petitioner's claim is analogous to a fairly typical tort claim
under state law, which is not supplanted by the Due Process Clause,
see, e. g., Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 332-333, particularly in the
area of public employment, see, e. g., Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 350.
In light of the presumption that the administration of government programs is based on a rational decisionmaking process that takes account
of competing forces, decisions concerning the allocation of resources to
individual programs, such as sewer maintenance, and to particular aspects of those programs, such as employee training, involve a host of
policy choices that must be made by locally elected representatives,
rather than by federal judges interpreting the country's basic charter of
Government. For the same reasons, petitioner's suggestion that the
Texas Hazard Communication Act supports her substantive due process
claim is rejected. Pp. 125-130.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented is whether $ 1 of the Civil RightsAct of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, provides a

remedy for a municipal employee who is fatally injured inthe course of his employment because the city customarily
failed to train or warn its employees about known hazardsin the workplace. Even though the city's conduct may be
actionable under state law, we hold that $ 1983 does notapply because such conduct does not violate the Due Process Clause.On October 21, 1988, Larry Michael Collins, an employee
in the sanitation department of the city of Harker Heights,Texas, died of asphyxia after entering a manhole to unstop a
sewer line. Petitioner, his widow, brought this action alleg-ing that Collins "had a constitutional right to be free from
unreasonable risks of harm to his body, mind and emotionsand a constitutional right to be protected from the City of
Harker Heights' custom and policy of deliberate indifferencetoward the safety of its employees." App. 7. Her complaint alleged that the city violated that right by following acustom and policy of not training its employees about the
dangers of working in sewer lines and manholes, not provid-ing safety equipment at jobsites, and not providing safety
warnings. The complaint also alleged that a prior incident

had given the city notice of the risks of entering the sewer
lines 1 and that the city had systematically and intentionally
failed to provide the equipment and training required by a
Texas statute. Ibid. The District Court dismissed the
complaint on the ground that a constitutional violation had
not been alleged. No. W-89-CA-168 (WD Tex., Oct. 30,
1988), App. 20. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed on a different theory. 916 F. 2d 284 (1990). It did
not reach the question whether the city had violated Collins'
constitutional rights because it denied recovery on the
ground that there had been no "abuse of governmental
power," which the Fifth Circuit had found to be a necessary
element of a $ 1983 action.2 Id., at 287-288, and n. 3.

1 In particular, the complaint alleged that "[p]rior to October, 1988, the
City of Harker Heights was on notice of the dangers to which the employees were exposed because Larry Michael Collins' supervisor had been rendered unconscious in a manhole several months prior to October, 1988, in
fact, several months before Larry Michael Collins began work at the City
of Harker Heights." App. 7.

2 The Court of Appeals explained:

"The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff seeking recovery under $ 1983 for injury to a governmental employee must demonstrate, inter alia, that the conduct in issue was an abuse of governmental
power. More particularly, does alleged wrongful conduct by government--in its capacity as employer rather than as a governing authority--
that deprives its employee of an alleged constitutional right give rise to a

$ 1983 action? We base our holding on the abuse of government power
standard, separate from the constitutional deprivation element or standard. The district court appears to have merged those two standards,
which are among those necessary for bringing $ 1983 into play here. In
reviewing this Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we will keep them separate.. . . . .

"In this Circuit, there is a separate standard that must also be satisfied--
an abuse of government power. While this element is in many ways similar to, and often blends with, other necessary elements for a $ 1983 action,
such as deprivation of a constitutional right, and springs from the same
sources as the deprivation element, it is separate nonetheless." 916 F. 2d,
at 286-287.

Opinion of the Court
The contrary decision in Ruge v. Bellevue, 892 F. 2d 738(CA8 1989), together with our concern about the Court of

Appeals' interpretation of the statute, prompted our grantof certiorari, 499 U. S. 958 (1991).

I
Our cases do not support the Court of Appeals' reading of$ 1983 as requiring proof of an abuse of governmental power

separate and apart from the proof of a constitutional viola-tion. Although the statute provides the citizen with an effective remedy against those abuses of state power that vio-late federal law, it does not provide a remedy for abuses that
do not violate federal law, see, e. g., Martinez v. California,444 U. S. 277 (1980);

DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept.of Social Services, 489 U. S. 189 (1989). More importantly,

the statute does not draw any distinction between abusiveand nonabusive federal violations.

The Court of Appeals' analysis rests largely on the factthat the city had, through allegedly tortious conduct, harmed
one of its employees rather than an ordinary citizen overwhom it exercised governmental power. The employment
relationship, however, is not of controlling significance. Onthe one hand, if the city had pursued a policy of equally deliberate indifference to the safety of pedestrians that re-sulted in a fatal injury to one who inadvertently stepped into
an open manhole, the Court of Appeals' holding would notspeak to this situation at all, although it would seem that a
claim by such a pedestrian should be analyzed in a similarmanner as the claim by this petitioner. On the other hand,
a logical application of the holding might also bar potentiallymeritorious claims by employees if, for example, the city had
given an employee a particularly dangerous assignment inretaliation for a political speech, cf.

St. Louis v. Praprotnik,485 U. S. 112 (1988), or because of his or her gender, cf. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658(1978). The First Amendment, the Equal Protection and

503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT
120 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTS

Opinion of the Court
Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, andother provisions of the Federal Constitution afford protection to employees who serve the government as well as tothose who are served by them, and $ 1983 provides a cause
of action for all citizens injured by an abridgment of thoseprotections. Neither the fact that petitioner's decedent was
a government employee nor the characterization of the city'sdeliberate indifference to his safety as something other than
an "abuse of governmental power" is a sufficient reason forrefusing to entertain petitioner's federal claim under $ 1983.

Nevertheless, proper analysis requires us to separate twodifferent issues when a $ 1983 claim is asserted against a municipality: (1) whether plaintiff 's harm was caused by a con-stitutional violation, and (2) if so, whether the city is responsible for that violation. See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle,471 U. S. 808, 817 (1985) (opinion of

Rehnquist, J.); id., at828-829 (opinion of Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because most of our opinions discuss-ing municipal policy have involved the latter issue, it is
appropriate to discuss it before considering the questionwhether petitioner's complaint has alleged a constitutional
violation. II

Section 1983 provides a remedy against "any person" who,under color of state law, deprives another of rights protected
by the Constitution.3 In Monell, the Court held that Con-gress intended municipalities and other local government
entities to be included among those persons to whom $ 1983applies. 436 U. S., at 690. At the same time, the Court

3 The section states, in relevant part:
"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,
custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any
citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,
or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the
party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding
for redress. . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.

Opinion of the Court
made it clear that municipalities may not be held liable "un-less action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort." Id., at 691.4 The Courtemphasized that

"a municipality cannot be held liable solely because itemploys a tortfeasor--or, in other words, a municipality
cannot be held liable under $ 1983 on a respondeat supe-rior theory.

. . . . .
"[T]herefore, . . . a local government may not be suedunder $ 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a gov-ernment's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly besaid to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that
the government as an entity is responsible under$ 1983."

Id., at 691, 694 (emphasis in original).

In a series of later cases, the Court has consideredwhether an alleged injury caused by municipal employees

acting under color of state law provided a proper basis forimposing liability on a city. In each of those cases the Court
assumed that a constitutional violation had been adequatelyalleged or proved and focused its attention on the separate
issue of municipal liability. Thus, for example, in Oklahoma
City v. Tuttle, supra, it was assumed that a police officer hadviolated the decedent's constitutional rights, but we held that

the wrongful conduct of a single officer without any policy-making authority did not establish municipal policy. And in
St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112 (1988), without reach4 Petitioners in Monell, a class of female employees of the New York
City Department of Social Services and Board of Education, alleged that
the board and department violated their due process rights by implementing an official policy that compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid
leaves of absences before such leaves were required for medical reasons.

Opinion of the Court
ing the question whether the adverse employment actiontaken against the plaintiff violated his First Amendment

rights, the Court concluded that decisions by subordinateemployees did not necessarily reflect official policy. On the
other hand, in Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469 (1986),the Court held that a county was responsible for unconstitutional actions taken pursuant to decisions made by thecounty prosecutor and the county sheriff because they were
the "officials responsible for establishing final policy with re-spect to the subject matter in question,"

id., at 483-484.Our purpose in citing these cases is to emphasize the separate character of the inquiry into the question of municipalresponsibility and the question whether a constitutional violation occurred. It was necessary to analyze whether execu-tion of a municipal policy inflicted the injury in these cases
because, unlike ordinary tort litigation, the doctrine of respondeat superior was inapplicable. The city is not vicari-ously liable under $ 1983 for the constitutional torts of its

agents: It is only liable when it can be fairly said that thecity itself is the wrongdoer. Because petitioner in this case
relies so heavily on our reasoning in Canton v. Harris, 489U. S. 378 (1989)--and in doing so, seems to assume that the
case dealt with the constitutional issue--it is appropriate tocomment specifically on that case.

In Canton we held that a municipality can, in some cir-cumstances, be held liable under $ 1983 "for constitutional
violations resulting from its failure to train municipal em-ployees." Id., at 380. Among the claims advanced by the
plaintiff in that case was a violation of the "right, under theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to receive necessary medical attention while in police custody."Id., at 381.

Opinion of the Court
tiff 's constitutional right to receive medical care had beendenied, id., at 388-389, n. 8, our opinion addressed only the

question whether the constitutional deprivation was attrib-utable to a municipal policy or custom.

We began our analysis by plainly indicating that we werenot deciding the constitutional issue.

"In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,436 U. S. 658 (1978), we decided that a municipality can
be found liable under $ 1983 only where the municipality
itself causes the constitutional violation at issue. Re-spondeat superior or vicarious liability will not attach

under $ 1983. Id., at 694-695. `It is only when the"execution of the government's policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury" that the municipality may be heldliable under $ 1983.'

Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U. S. 257,267 (1987) (
O'Connor, J., dissenting) (quoting Monell,
supra, at 694)."Thus, our first inquiry in any case alleging municipal

liability under $ 1983 is the question whether there is adirect causal link between a municipal policy or custom
and the alleged constitutional deprivation." Id., at 385.
We did not suggest that all harm-causing municipal policiesare actionable under $ 1983 or that all such policies are unconstitutional. Moreover, we rejected the city's argumentthat only unconstitutional policies can create municipal liability under the statute. Id., at 387. Instead, we concludedthat if a city employee violates another's constitutional
rights, the city may be liable if it had a policy or custom offailing to train its employees and that failure to train caused
the constitutional violation. In particular, we held that theinadequate training of police officers could be characterized
as the cause of the constitutional tort if--and only if--the
cal treatment while in custody." Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S., at 382 (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
failure to train amounted to "deliberate indifference" to the
rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.
Id., at 388.6

Although the term "deliberate indifference" has been used
in other contexts to define the threshold for finding a violation of the Eighth Amendment, see Estelle v. Gamble, 429
U. S. 97, 104 (1976), as we have explained, that term was
used in the Canton case for the quite different purpose of
identifying the threshold for holding a city responsible for
the constitutional torts committed by its inadequately
trained agents.7 In this case, petitioner has used that term
to characterize the city's failure to train the employees in
its sanitation department. We assume for the purpose of
decision that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient
to provide a substitute for the doctrine of respondeat superior as a basis for imposing liability on the city for the tortious conduct of its agents, but that assumption does not confront the question whether the complaint has alleged a
constitutional violation. To that question we now turn.

6 We added:
"Only where a municipality's failure to train its employees in a relevant
respect evidences a `deliberate indifference' to the rights of its inhabitants
can such a shortcoming be properly thought of as a city `policy or custom'
that is actionable under $ 1983.. . . . .

"Consequently, while claims such as respondent's--alleging that the
city's failure to provide training to municipal employees resulted in the
constitutional deprivation she suffered--are cognizable under $ 1983, they
can only yield liability against a municipality where that city's failure to
train reflects deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its inhabitants." Id., at 389, 392.

7 Indeed, we expressly stated: "The `deliberate indifference' standard we

fault (if any) that a plaintiff must show to make out an underlying claim
of a constitutional violation." Id., at 388, n. 8.

Opinion of the Court

III
Petitioner's constitutional claim rests entirely on the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.8 The mostfamiliar office of that Clause is to provide a guarantee of fair

procedure in connection with any deprivation of life, liberty,or property by a State. Petitioner, however, does not advance a procedural due process claim in this case. Instead,she relies on the substantive component of the Clause that
protects individual liberty against "certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used toimplement them."

Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331
(1986).As a general matter, the Court has always been reluctant

to expand the concept of substantive due process becauseguideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended. Regents of Univ. of
Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225-226 (1985). The doctrine
of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost
care whenever we are asked to break new ground in thisfield. It is important, therefore, to focus on the allegations

in the complaint to determine how petitioner describes the
constitutional right at stake and what the city allegedly did
to deprive her husband of that right.

A fair reading of petitioner's complaint does not charge
the city with a willful violation of Collins' rights. Petitioner
does not claim that the city or any of its agents deliberately
harmed her husband. In fact, she does not even allege that
his supervisor instructed him to go into the sewer when the
supervisor knew or should have known that there was a significant risk that he would be injured. Instead, she makes
the more general allegation that the city deprived him of

shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law."

Opinion of the Court
life and liberty by failing to provide a reasonably safe work
environment.9 Fairly analyzed, her claim advances two theories: that the Federal Constitution imposes a duty on the
city to provide its employees with minimal levels of safety
and security in the workplace, or that the city's "deliberate
indifference" to Collins' safety was arbitrary government
action that must "shock the conscience" of federal judges.
Cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 172 (1952).

Neither the text nor the history of the Due Process Clause
supports petitioner's claim that the governmental employer's
duty to provide its employees with a safe working environment is a substantive component of the Due Process Clause.
"[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
was intended to prevent government `from abusing [its]
power, or employing it as an instrument of oppression.' " DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489
U. S., at 196 (quoting Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U. S. 344, 348
(1986)). As we recognized in DeShaney:

"The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State's
power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security. It forbids the State itself to
deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without
`due process of law,' but its language cannot fairly be
extended to impose an affirmative obligation on the
State to ensure that those interests do not come to harm
through other means. Nor does history support such

9 Petitioner alleges that her husband had "a constitutional right to be
free from unreasonable risks of harm to his body, mind and emotions and
a constitutional right to be protected from the City of Harker Heights'
custom and policy of deliberate indifference toward the safety of its employees." App. 7. The city's policy and custom of not training its employees and not warning them of the danger allegedly caused Collins'
death and thus deprived him of those rights. Id., at 8.

an expansive reading of the constitutional text." 489U. S., at 195.

Petitioner's submission that the city violated a federal constitutional obligation to provide its employees with certain
minimal levels of safety and security is unprecedented. Itis quite different from the constitutional claim advanced by

plaintiffs in several of our prior cases who argued that theState owes a duty to take care of those who have already
been deprived of their liberty. We have held, for example,that apart from the protection against cruel and unusual punishment provided by the Eighth Amendment, cf. Hutto v.
Finney, 437 U. S. 678 (1978), the Due Process Clause of itsown force requires that conditions of confinement satisfy certain minimal standards for pretrial detainees, see Bell v.
Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 535, n. 16, 545 (1979), for persons in
mental institutions, Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 315-316 (1982), for convicted felons,

Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S.
78, 94-99 (1987), and for persons under arrest, see Revere v.
Massachusetts General Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 244-245
(1983). The "process" that the Constitution guarantees in

10 "Historically, this guarantee of due process has been applied to deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty,
or property. E. g., Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97 (1878) (assessment of real estate); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952) (stomach
pumping); Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S. 535 (1971) (suspension of driver's license); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977) (paddling student); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984) (intentional destruction of inmate's
property). No decision of this Court before Parratt [v. Taylor, 451 U. S.
527 (1981),] supported the view that negligent conduct by a state official,
even though causing injury, constitutes a deprivation under the Due Process Clause. This history reflects the traditional and common-sense notion
that the Due Process Clause, like its forebear in the Magna Carta, see
Corwin, The Doctrine of Due Process of Law Before the Civil War, 24
Harv. L. Rev. 366, 368 (1911), was `intended to secure the individual from
the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government,' Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 527 (1884)." Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331
(1986).

128 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTS

Opinion of the Court
connection with any deprivation of liberty thus includes acontinuing obligation to satisfy certain minimal custodial

standards. See DeShaney, 489 U. S., at 200. Petitionercannot maintain, however, that the city deprived Collins of
his liberty when it made, and he voluntarily accepted, an
offer of employment.We also are not persuaded that the city's alleged failure to

train its employees, or to warn them about known risks ofharm, was an omission that can properly be characterized as
arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.Petitioner's claim is analogous to a fairly typical state-law
tort claim: The city breached its duty of care to her husband
by failing to provide a safe work environment. Because the
Due Process Clause "does not purport to supplant traditional
tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability
for injuries that attend living together in society," Daniels
v. Williams, 474 U. S., at 332, we have previously rejected
claims that the Due Process Clause should be interpreted to
impose federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law, see, e. g., id., at 332-333;
Baker v. McCollan, 443 U. S. 137, 146 (1979); Paul v. Davis,
424 U. S. 693, 701 (1976). The reasoning in those cases applies with special force to claims asserted against public employers because state law, rather than the Federal Constitution, generally governs the substance of the employment
relationship. See, e. g., Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 350
(1976); Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S.
564, 577-578 (1972).

Our refusal to characterize the city's alleged omission in
this case as arbitrary in a constitutional sense rests on the
presumption that the administration of government programs is based on a rational decisionmaking process that
takes account of competing social, political, and economic
forces. Cf. Walker v. Rowe, 791 F. 2d 507, 510 (CA7 1986).
Decisions concerning the allocation of resources to individual
programs, such as sewer maintenance, and to particular as503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
pects of those programs, such as the training and compensa-tion of employees, involve a host of policy choices that must

be made by locally elected representatives, rather than byfederal judges interpreting the basic charter of Government
for the entire country. The Due Process Clause "is not aguarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions." Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S., at 350. Nor does it guar-antee municipal employees a workplace that is free of unreasonable risks of harm.Finally, we reject petitioner's suggestion that the Texas
Hazard Communication Act 11 supports her substantive dueprocess claim. We assume that the Act imposed a duty on
the city to warn its sanitation employees about the dangersof noxious gases in the sewers and to provide safety training
and protective equipment to minimize those dangers.12 Wealso assume, as petitioner argues, that the Act created an
entitlement that qualifies as a "liberty interest" protected bythe Due Process Clause. But even with these assumptions,
petitioner's claim must fail for she has not alleged that thedeprivation of this liberty interest was arbitrary in the constitutional sense. Cf. Harrah Independent School Dist. v.

11 Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Art. 5182b (Vernon 1987).
12 Section 10(a) of the Act states, for example:

"Every employer shall provide, at least annually, an education and training program for employees using or handling hazardous chemicals. . . .
Additional instruction shall be provided when the potential for exposure
to hazardous chemicals is altered or when new and significant information
is received by the employer concerning the hazards of a chemical. New
or newly assigned employees shall be provided training before working
with or in a work area containing hazardous chemicals."

And $ 15(a)states:

"Employees who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals shall be informed of the exposure and shall have access to the workplace chemical
list and [material safety data sheets] for the hazardous chemicals. . . . In
addition, employees shall receive training on the hazards of the chemicals
and on measures they can take to protect themselves from those hazards
and shall be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.
These rights are guaranteed on the effective date of this Act."

Opinion of the Court
Martin, 440 U. S. 194, 198-199 (1979). The reasons why thecity's alleged failure to train and warn did not constitute a

constitutionally arbitrary deprivation of Collins' life, seesupra, at 128-129, apply a fortiori to the less significant liberty interest created by the Texas statute.In sum, we conclude that the Due Process Clause does not
impose an independent federal obligation upon municipalitiesto provide certain minimal levels of safety and security in

131OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

WILLY v. COASTAL CORP. et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 90-1150. Argued December 3, 1991--Decided March 3, 1992
After petitioner Willy sued respondent Coastal Corporation in Texas state

court, alleging that Coastal fired him for refusing to participate in its
violation of federal and state environmental laws, Coastal removed the
case to Federal District Court. That court rejected Willy's argument
that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and dismissed the case for failure to state a claim. It also imposed sanctions against him, pursuant
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, based on conduct in the case that
was unrelated to petitioner's effort to convince the court that it lacked
jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court
lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, but upheld the court's decision to
award sanctions and remanded the case for the court to determine the
amount. On a second appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected Willy's
argument that the District Court had no authority to impose sanctions
in the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Held: A court may impose Rule 11 sanctions in a case in which the district

court is later determined to be without subject-matter jurisdiction.
Pp. 134-139.

(a) While the expansive language of Rules 1 and 81(c) indicates a clear
intent to have the Rules, including Rule 11, apply to all district court
civil proceedings, the Rules must be deemed to apply only if their application will not impermissibly expand the judicial authority conferred by
Article III, see Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1. Pp. 134-135.

(b) The District Court's order in this case does not lie outside the
range of action constitutionally permitted to an Article III court. Willy
concedes that Congress has the power to regulate the courts and to
authorize the imposition of sanctions. He errs in contending that Rule
11 sanctions must be aborted whenever it is determined that a court
lacked jurisdiction at the time the objectionable conduct occurred. A
court's concern with the maintenance of orderly procedure, even in the
wake of a jurisdictional ruling later found to be mistaken, justifies the
conclusion that the sanction here need not be upset. See, e. g., United
States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258. Because it deals with the issue
whether the court's rules were violated, the instant order is collateral
to the merits of the case. Thus, it implicates no constitutional concern
because it does not deal with the court's assessment of the complaint's

legal merits, over which the court lacked jurisdiction. See Cooter &
Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384. And the District Court's interest in having rules of procedure obeyed did not disappear with the
subsequent determination that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.

Carter G. Phillips, Mark D.Hopson, Lawrence P. Ellsworth, and Robert C. DeMoss.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
We granted certiorari to decide whether a federal districtcourt may impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a case in which the districtcourt is later determined to be without subject-matter jurisdiction. 501 U. S. 1216 (1991). We conclude that in the cir-cumstances presented here it may do so.

Petitioner Willy sued respondent Coastal Corporation(Coastal or respondent) in Texas state court, raising a variety of claims relating to Coastal's decision to terminate hisemployment as "in-house" counsel. Petitioner alleged that
he had been fired due to his refusal to participate in respond-ent's violation of various federal and state environmental
laws. Respondent removed the case to Federal DistrictCourt, claiming original federal-question jurisdiction under
28 U. S. C. $$ 1331, 1441. Petitioner objected to the removal,claiming that his case did not "arise under" federal law, see

$ 1331, but the District Court disagreed and concluded that ithad subject-matter jurisdiction. The District Court subsequently granted respondent's motion to dismiss for failure to

state a claim, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), and dismissedpetitioner's pendent state claims.

At the same time, the District Court granted respondent'smotion for Rule 11 sanctions, awarding attorney's fees of
$22,625 against Willy and his attorney, Young, jointly and
severally. The District Court found that the filings made byplaintiff 's counsel "create[d] a blur of absolute confusion."

App. to Pet. for Cert. A-7. These included a 1,200-page,unindexed, unnumbered pile of materials that the District
Court determined "to be a conscious and wanton affront tothe judicial process, this Court, and opposing counsel" that
was "irresponsible at a minimum and at worst intentionally
harassing." Ibid. Petitioner's sanctionable behavior also
included careless pleading, such as reliance on a nonexistent
Federal Rule of Evidence. Ibid. None of the sanctionable
conduct was related to petitioner's initial effort to convince
the District Court that it was w ithout subject-matter
jurisdiction.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that the District Court had lacked subject-matter
jurisdiction because the complaint raised no claims arising
under federal law. 855 F. 2d 1160 (1988). It therefore reversed the District Court order dismissing the claims and
instructed that the case be remanded to state court. The
court also upheld the District Court's decision to award Rule
11 sanctions, although it remanded the case to the District
Court to determine the amount. On remand the District
Court recomputed the Rule 11 sanctions and imposed sanctions in the amount of $19,307, the amount of attorney's fees
that respondent had incurred in responding to petitioner's
sanctionable conduct. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 915
F. 2d 965 (CA5 1990).

On this second appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's contention that, in the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction, the District Court was constitutionally without

Opinion of the Court
authority to impose Rule 11 sanctions. It concluded that
the authority to impose Rule 11 sanctions rested in the "inherent powers" of the federal courts--those powers " `necessary to the exercise of all others.' " Id., at 966 (quoting
Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U. S. 752, 764 (1980)).
The court concluded that the exercise of Rule 11 powers was
an example of such inherent powers. It principally relied
on our recent decision in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,
496 U. S. 384 (1990), in which we upheld a Rule 11 sanction
imposed for filing a frivolous complaint even though the sanction order was entered after the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its suit.

Before this Court, petitioner advances two claims. The
first is that Congress, in acquiescing in the adoption of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, did not "authoriz[e] recovery of fees or costs against parties who prevail on jurisdictional grounds." Brief for Petitioner 18. Petitioner finds
in both the Rules Enabling Act and the Rules the "implicit
premise . . . that rules of practice and procedure are not
necessary for disputes beyond the judicial power conferred
by Article III." Id., at 28. Phrased this way, the petitioner's contention is correct, but it does not dispose of this case.

The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2072, authorizes the
Court to "prescribe general rules of practice and procedure
and rules of evidence for cases in the United States district
courts . . . ." Those rules may not "abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right." In response, we have adopted
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 1 governs their
scope. It provides that "[t]hese rules govern the procedure
in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil
nature . . . ." Rule 81(c) specifically provides that the Rules
"apply to civil actions removed to the United States district
courts from the state courts and govern procedure after removal." This expansive language contains no express ex503us1$39z 11-13-95 21:56:12 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ceptions and indicates a clear intent to have the Rules, in-cluding Rule 11, apply to all district court civil proceedings.

1

But in Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1 (1941), we ob-served that federal courts, in adopting rules, were not free

to extend or restrict the jurisdiction conferred by a statute.
Id., at 10. Such a caveat applies a fortiori to any effort toextend by rule the judicial power of the United States described in Article III of the Constitution. The Rules, then,must be deemed to apply only if their application will not
impermissibly expand the judicial authority conferred by Ar-ticle III. We must therefore examine petitioner's second,
and related contention, that the District Court action in thiscase lies outside the range of action constitutionally permitted to an Article III court.Petitioner begins by pointing out that Article III limits
the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts to cer-tain "cases or controversies." Brief for Petitioner 11. He
then contends that the District Court's exercise of judicialpower to grant Rule 11 sanctions must have been an unconstitutional act because, in the absence of subject-matter ju1 Rule 11 requires that every paper filed with the District Court be
signed by an attorney or by the party. The signature constitutes a certificate by the signer that

"to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after
reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing
law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal
of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose,
such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the
cost of litigation."

A pleading determined to be in contravention of the Rule subjects both
the signer and the party he represents to "an appropriate sanction, which
may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of
the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading,
motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee." Ibid. We
take as given that the District Court correctly determined that petitioner's filings were insufficiently well grounded to satisfy the Rule, the payment of attorney's fees was a reasonable sanction in response, and the
imposition of joint and several liability was appropriate.

503us1$39z 11-13-95 21:56:12 PAGES OPINPGT
136 WILLY v. COASTAL CORP.

Opinion of the Court
risdiction, the district court lacks "a substantive source of
judicial power, beyond that conferred by Article III." Id.,
at 18. Thus, according to petitioner, even had Congress attempted to grant the courts authority to impose sanctions in
a case such as this, the grant would run afoul of Article III.

In making this claim, petitioner acknowledges that there
are some circumstances in which federal courts may impose
attorney's fees or costs, even where the court eventually
proves to be without subject-matter jurisdiction.2 He contends, however, that such instances are limited to a narrowly
prescribed category of cases and do not include the situation
in which sanctions are imposed against a party who has successfully contested jurisdiction.

We think petitioner's contentions flawed in several respects. Article I, $ 8, cl. 9, authorizes Congress to establish
the lower federal courts. From almost the founding days of
this country, it has been firmly established that Congress,
acting pursuant to its authority to make all laws "necessary
and proper" 3 to their establishment, also may enact laws
regulating the conduct of those courts and the means
by which their judgments are enforced. See Wayman v.
Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 21-22 (1825); Hanna v. Plumer, 380
U. S. 460, 473 (1965) (describing "long-recognized power of
Congress to prescribe housekeeping rules for federal
courts"). Indeed, in acknowledging the many circumstances
in which sanctions can be imposed, several of which have a
statutory basis, petitioner effectively concedes both Congress' general power to regulate the courts and its specific

2 See Brief for Petitioner 18, n. 14, acknowledging 28 U. S. C. $ 1919 (authorizing "payment of just costs" in any action or suit dismissed for lack
of jurisdiction) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(c) (authorizing attorney's fees and
costs for wrongful removal). See also Brief for Petitioner 22-27, admitting federal-court authority to exercise "inherent powers" to sanction
through attorney's fees and costs or criminal contempt those who obstruct
a court's effort to determine its jurisdiction.

Opinion of the Court
power to authorize the imposition of sanctions. See n. 2,
supra.

This leaves only petitioner's contention that Rule 11 sanc-tions must be aborted because at a time after the sanctionable conduct occurred, it was determined by the Court of
Appeals that the District Court lacked subject-matter juris-diction. A final determination of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction of a case in a federal court, of course, precludesfurther adjudication of it. But such a determination does
not automatically wipe out all proceedings had in the districtcourt at a time when the district court operated under the
misapprehension that it had jurisdiction. In Chicot County
Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U. S. 371 (1940),
we held that a judgment rendered in a case in which it was
ultimately concluded that the District Court was without
jurisdiction was nonetheless res judicata on collateral attack
made by one of the parties. See also Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305
U. S. 165 (1938). In Stoll, we observed that the practical
concern with providing an end to litigation justifies a rule
preventing collateral attack on subject-matter jurisdiction.
Id., at 172.

In United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258 (1947), we
upheld a criminal contempt citation even on the assumption
that the District Court issuing the citation was without
jurisdiction over the underlying action. In that case, the
question was raised on direct review and not collateral attack. We think the same concern expressed in these cases--
the maintenance of orderly procedure, even in the wake of a
jurisdiction ruling later found to be mistaken--justifies the
conclusion that the sanction ordered here need not be upset.

The District Court order which the petitioner seeks to
upset is one that is collateral to the merits. We recently
had occasion to examine Rule 11's scope and purpose in great
detail in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384
(1990). The challenge in that case was to an order imposing
Rule 11 sanctions for filing a frivolous complaint, entered

503us1$39z 11-13-95 21:56:12 PAGES OPINPGT
138 WILLY v. COASTAL CORP.

Opinion of the Court
after the plaintiff had voluntarily dismissed his action. Inthe course of our discussion we noted that "[i]t is well established that a federal court may consider collateral issuesafter an action is no longer pending. . . . [An] imposition of a
Rule 11 sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action.
Rather, it requires the determination of a collateral issue:whether the attorney has abused the judicial process, and, if

so, what sanction would be appropriate." Id., at 395-396.Such an order implicates no constitutional concern because
it "does not signify a district court's assessment of the legalmerits of the complaint."

Id., at 396. It therefore does not
raise the issue of a district court adjudicating the merits ofa "case or controversy" over which it lacks jurisdiction.

Petitioner places great weight on our decision in United
States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization,
Inc., 487 U. S. 72 (1988), a case involving a civil contempt
order entered by the District Court. The contemnors, two
nonparty witnesses, refused to comply with a District Court
document subpoena. The District Court found them in civil
contempt and ordered them to pay a fine of $50,000 per day.
The contemnors, as was their right, immediately appealed
the contempt order, challenging the District Court's subjectmatter jurisdiction. We held that the Court of Appeals was
obligated to consider the jurisdictional challenge in full,
rather than simply contenting itself with an inquiry into
whether the District Court colorably had jurisdiction. We
further concluded that if the District Court was found to be
lacking subject-matter jurisdiction, that the contempt order
would also fall. Focusing on this second part of our decision, petitioner cites Catholic Conference as establishing the
proposition that a sanction must fall if imposed when jurisdiction is in fact absent.4

Catholic Conference does not stand for such a broad assertion. A civil contempt order has much different purposes

than a Rule 11 sanction. Civil contempt is designed to forcethe contemnor to comply with an order of the court, id., at

79; Rule 11 is designed to punish a party who has alreadyviolated the court's rules. Cooter & Gell, supra, at 396.
Given that civil contempt is designed to coerce compliancewith the court's decree, it is logical that the order itself
should fall with a showing that the court was without author-ity to enter the decree. Accord,

United States v. MineWorkers, supra.

The interest in having rules of procedure obeyed, by con-trast, does not disappear upon a subsequent determination
that the court was without subject-matter jurisdiction.Courts do make mistakes; in cases such as

Catholic Confer-ence it may be possible immediately to seek relief in an appellate tribunal. But where such an immediate appeal is notauthorized, there is no constitutional infirmity under Article
III in requiring those practicing before the courts to conductthemselves in compliance with the applicable procedural
rules in the interim, and to allow the courts to impose Rule11 sanctions in the event of their failure to do so.

5

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is

Affirmed.

5 Our conclusion that the District Court acted within the scope of the
Federal Rules and that the sanction may constitutionally be applied even
when subject-matter jurisdiction is eventually found lacking makes it unnecessary for us to consider respondent's alternative contention that the
sanction may be upheld as an appropriate exercise of the District Court's
"inherent powers."

McCARTHY v. MADIGAN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 90-6861. Argued December 9, 1991--Decided March 4, 1992
While a federal prisoner, petitioner McCarthy filed a damages action

under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388,
alleging that respondent prison officials had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by their deliberate indifference to his needs and medical
condition resulting from a back operation and a history of psychiatric
problems. The District Court dismissed his complaint on the ground
that he had failed to exhaust the Federal Bureau of Prisons' administrative remedy procedure, which, inter alia, includes rapid filing and response timetables to promote efficient dispute resolution but does not
provide for any kind of hearing or for the granting of any particular type
of relief. The court then denied McCarthy's motion for reconsideration,
rejecting his argument that exhaustion was not required because he
sought only money damages, which the Bureau could not provide. The
Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Exhaustion of the Bureau of Prisons' administrative procedure is

not required before a federal prisoner can initiate a Bivens action solely
for money damages. Pp. 144-156.

(a) Exhaustion serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative
agency authority and promoting judicial efficiency. Where Congress
specifically mandates, exhaustion is required. Otherwise, the federal
courts must exercise sound judicial discretion, determining whether to
require exhaustion by balancing the individual's interest in retaining
prompt access to a federal judicial forum against countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion. Individual interests have weighed
heavily where resort to the administrative remedy would occasion
undue prejudice to subsequent assertion of a court action, where there
is some doubt as to whether the agency is empowered to grant effective
relief, or where the administrative body is shown to be biased or has
otherwise predetermined the issue before it. Pp. 144-149.

(b) Congress has not required exhaustion of a federal prisoner's Bivens claim. And, given the type of claim McCarthy raises and the
particular characteristics of the Bureau's general grievance procedure,
McCarthy's individual interests outweigh countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion. The procedure's short, successive filing
deadlines and the absence of any monetary remedy heavily burden a

Opinion of the Court
petitioning inmate's individual interests. In contrast, while the Bureau
has a substantial interest in encouraging internal resolution of grievances and in preventing the undermining of its authority by unnecessary
resort of prisoners to the federal courts, other institutional concerns do
not weigh heavily in favor of exhaustion. The Bureau's alleged failure
to render medical care implicates only tangentially its authority to carry
out the control and management of the federal prisons, and the Bureau
does not bring to bear any special expertise on the type of issue presented for resolution here. Nor are the interests of judicial economy
advanced substantially by the grievance procedure, which does not create a formal factual record of the type that can be relied on conclusively
by a court for disposition of a prisoner's claim on the pleadings or at
summary judgment without the aid of affidavits. Pp. 149-156.

Opinion of the Court

I
While he was a prisoner in the federal penitentiary at
Leavenworth, petitioner John J. McCarthy filed a pro se com-plaint in the United States District Court for the District of

Kansas against four prison employees: the hospital adminis-trator, the chief psychologist, another psychologist, and a
physician. McCarthy alleged that respondents had violatedhis constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment by
their deliberate indifference to his needs and medical condi-tion resulting from a back operation and a history of psychiatric problems. On the first page of his complaint, he wrote:
"This Complaint seeks Money Damages Only." App. 7.

The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground
that petitioner had failed to exhaust prison administrative
remedies. Id., at 12. Under 28 CFR pt. 542 (1991), setting
forth the general "Administrative Remedy Procedure for Inmates" at federal correctional institutions, a prisoner may
"seek formal review of a complaint which relates to any aspect of his imprisonment." $ 542.10.2 When an inmate files
a complaint or appeal, the responsible officials are directed
to acknowledge the filing with a "signed receipt" which
is returned to the inmate, to "[c]onduct an investigation,"
and to "[r]espond to and sign all complaints or appeals."

1982) (same).

2 Certain categories of filings, however, "will not be accepted" under the

general procedure. These include, among others, "tort claims." See 28
CFR $ 542.12 (1991). The Bureau of Prisons has interpreted this "tort
claims" exception to include claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act,
but not constitutional claims for relief recognized under the Bivens case.

are governed by a separate administrative procedure. See $$ 543.30 to

Opinion of the Court
To promote efficient dispute resolution, the procedure in-cludes rapid filing and response timetables. An inmate first

seeks informal resolution of his claim by consulting prisonpersonnel. $ 542.13(a). If this informal effort fails, the
prisoner "may file a formal written complaint on the appro-priate form, within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date
on which the basis of the complaint occurred." $ 542.13(b).Should the warden fail to respond to the inmate's satisfaction
within 15 days, the inmate has 20 days to appeal to the Bu-reau's Regional Director, who has 30 days to respond. If
the inmate still remains unsatisfied, he has 30 days to makea final appeal to the Bureau's general counsel, who has another 30 days to respond. $$ 542.14 and 542.15. If the in-mate can demonstrate a "valid reason for delay," he "shall
be allowed" an extension of any of these time periods forfiling. $ 542.13(b).

Petitioner McCarthy filed with the District Court a motionfor reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
60(b), arguing that he was not required to exhaust his admin-istrative remedies, because he sought only money damages
which, he claimed, the Bureau could not provide.3 1 Record,Exh. 7. The court denied the motion. App. 14.

The Court of Appeals, in affirming, observed that becauseBivens actions are a creation of the judiciary, the courts may
impose reasonable conditions upon their filing. 914 F. 2d,at 1412. The exhaustion rule, the court reasoned, "is not
keyed to the type of relief sought, but to the need for prelim3 McCarthy actually had initiated a grievance prior to filing his complaint in the District Court. Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 7. But he did not
exhaust the procedures at that time and, in any event, he concedes that
that grievance related to his request for a private cell and not to the
medical issues at the heart of his federal complaint. After his initial
grievance was dismissed, he filed a grievance with respect to the medical
issues. It was accepted, even though it was late, but was denied by the
warden on the merits. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. McCarthy's subsequent appeal to the Bureau's regional office was rejected because it was filed late.

Opinion of the Court
inary fact-finding" to determine "whether there is a possibleBivens cause of action." Ibid. Accordingly, " `[a]lthough

the administrative apparatus could not award money dam-ages . . . , administrative consideration of the possibility of
corrective action and a record would have aided a court inmeasuring liability and determining the

extent of the dam-ages.' " Ibid., quoting Goar v. Civiletti, 688 F. 2d 27, 29

(CA6 1982) (emphasis in original). Exhaustion of the gen-eral grievance procedure was required notwithstanding the
fact that McCarthy's request was solely for money damages.

II
The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies isone among related doctrines--including abstention, finality,

and ripeness--that govern the timing of federal-court deci-sionmaking. Of "paramount importance" to any exhaustion
inquiry is congressional intent. Patsy v. Board of Regentsof Florida, 457 U. S. 496, 501 (1982). Where Congress specifically mandates, exhaustion is required. Coit Independ-ence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S. 561, 579 (1989);
Patsy, 457 U. S., at 502, n. 4. But where Congress has notclearly required exhaustion, sound judicial discretion governs. McGee v. United States, 402 U. S. 479, 483, n. 6 (1971).See also

Patsy, 457 U. S., at 518 (White, J., concurring inpart) ("[E]xhaustion is `a rule of judicial administration,' . . .

and unless Congress directs otherwise, rightfully subject tocrafting by judges"). Nevertheless, even in this field of judicial discretion, appropriate deference to Congress' powerto prescribe the basic procedural scheme under which a claim
may be heard in a federal court requires fashioning of ex-haustion principles in a manner consistent with congressional intent and any applicable statutory scheme. Id., at501-502, and n. 4.

A
This Court long has acknowledged the general rule thatparties exhaust prescribed administrative remedies before

145Cite as: 503 U. S. 140 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
seeking relief from the federal courts. See, e. g., Myers v.
Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U. S. 41, 50-51, and n. 9
(1938) (discussing cases as far back as 1898). Exhaustionis required because it serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicial
efficiency.As to the first of these purposes, the exhaustion doctrine

recognizes the notion, grounded in deference to Congress'delegation of authority to coordinate branches of Government, that agencies, not the courts, ought to have primaryresponsibility for the programs that Congress has charged
them to administer. Exhaustion concerns apply with particular force when the action under review involves exercise of
the agency's discretionary power or when the agency proceedings in question allow the agency to apply its special
expertise. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 194
(1969). See also Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467,
484 (1986). The exhaustion doctrine also acknowledges the
commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an agency
ought to have an opportunity to correct its own mistakes
with respect to the programs it administers before it is
haled into federal court. Correlatively, exhaustion principles apply with special force when "frequent and deliberate flouting of administrative processes" could weaken an
agency's effectiveness by encouraging disregard of its procedures. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S., at 195.

As to the second of the purposes, exhaustion promotes judicial efficiency in at least two ways. When an agency has
the opportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial controversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal appeals may
be avoided. See, e. g., Parisi v. Davidson, 405 U. S. 34, 37
(1972); McKart v. United States, 395 U. S., at 195. And even
where a controversy survives administrative review, exhaustion of the administrative procedure may produce a useful
record for subsequent judicial consideration, especially in a
complex or technical factual context. See, e. g., Weinberger

503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT
146 McCARTHY v. MADIGAN

Opinion of the Court
v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 765 (1975) (exhaustion may allowagency "to compile a record which is adequate for judicial

review"). B

Notwithstanding these substantial institutional interests,federal courts are vested with a "virtually unflagging obligation" to exercise the jurisdiction given them. Colorado
River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S.800, 817-818 (1976). "We have no more right to decline the

exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp thatwhich is not given." Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404
(1821). Accordingly, this Court has declined to require ex-haustion in some circumstances even where administrative
and judicial interests would counsel otherwise. In deter-mining whether exhaustion is required, federal courts must
balance the interest of the individual in retaining promptaccess to a federal judicial forum against countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion. "[A]dministrativeremedies need not be pursued if the litigant's interests in
immediate judicial review outweigh the government's inter-ests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the
exhaustion doctrine is designed to further." West v. Berg-land, 611 F. 2d 710, 715 (CA8 1979), cert. denied, 449 U. S.
821 (1980). Application of this balancing principle is "in-tensely practical," Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S., at
484, citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 331, n. 11(1976), because attention is directed to both the nature of
the claim presented and the characteristics of the particularadministrative procedure provided.

C
This Court's precedents have recognized at least threebroad sets of circumstances in which the interests of the individual weigh heavily against requiring administrative ex-haustion. First, requiring resort to the administrative remedy may occasion undue prejudice to subsequent assertion

147Cite as: 503 U. S. 140 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
of a court action. Such prejudice may result, for example,from an unreasonable or indefinite timeframe for administrative action. See Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U. S. 564, 575, n. 14(1973) (administrative remedy deemed inadequate "[m]ost
often . . . because of delay by the agency"). See also Coit
Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S., at 587 ("Be-cause the Bank Board's regulations do not place a reasonable

time limit on FSLIC's consideration of claims, Coit cannot berequired to exhaust those procedures");

Walker v. Southern
R. Co., 385 U. S. 196, 198 (1966) (possible delay of 10 years inadministrative proceedings makes exhaustion unnecessary);

Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 270 U. S. 587, 591-592
(1926) (claimant "is not required indefinitely to await a decision of the rate-making tribunal before applying to a federal
court for equitable relief "). Even where the administrative
decisionmaking schedule is otherwise reasonable and definite, a particular plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm if unable to secure immediate judicial consideration of his claim.
Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S., at 483 (disabilitybenefit claimants "would be irreparably injured were the
exhaustion requirement now enforced against them"); Aircraft & Diesel Equipment Corp. v. Hirsch, 331 U. S. 752, 773
(1947) ("impending irreparable injury flowing from delay incident to following the prescribed procedure" may contribute
to finding that exhaustion is not required). By the same
token, exhaustion principles apply with less force when an
individual's failure to exhaust may preclude a defense to
criminal liability. Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494,
497, n. 5 (1977) (plurality opinion); McKart v. United States,
395 U. S., at 197.

Second, an administrative remedy may be inadequate "because of some doubt as to whether the agency was empowered to grant effective relief." Gibson v. Berryhill, 411
U. S., at 575, n. 14. For example, an agency, as a preliminary
matter, may be unable to consider whether to grant relief
because it lacks institutional competence to resolve the par503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ticular type of issue presented, such as the constitutionalityof a statute. See,

e. g., Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S.,
at 497, n. 5; Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 76 (1976). Ina similar vein, exhaustion has not been required where the

challenge is to the adequacy of the agency procedure itself,
such that " `the question of the adequacy of the administra-tive remedy . . . [is] for all practical purposes identical with

the merits of [the plaintiff 's] lawsuit.' " Barry v. Barchi, 443U. S. 55, 63, n. 10 (1979) (quoting

Gibson v. Berryhill, 411
U. S., at 575). Alternatively, an agency may be competentto adjudicate the issue presented, but still lack authority

to grant the type of relief requested. McNeese v. Board of
Ed. for Community Unit School Dist. 187, 373 U. S. 668,
675 (1963) (students seeking to integrate public school need
not file complaint with school superintendent because the
"Superintendent himself apparently has no power to order
corrective action" except to request the Attorney General to
bring suit); Montana National Bank of Billings v. Yellowstone County, 276 U. S. 499, 505 (1928) (taxpayer seeking
refund not required to exhaust where "any such application
[would have been] utterly futile since the county board of
equalization was powerless to grant any appropriate relief "
in face of prior controlling court decision).

Third, an administrative remedy may be inadequate where
the administrative body is shown to be biased or has otherwise predetermined the issue before it. Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U. S., at 575, n. 14; Houghton v. Shafer, 392
U. S. 639, 640 (1968) (in view of Attorney General's submission that the challenged rules of the prison were "validly
and correctly applied to petitioner," requiring administrative
review through a process culminating with the Attorney
General "would be to demand a futile act"); Association of
National Advertisers, Inc. v. FTC, 201 U. S. App. D. C. 165,
170-171, 627 F. 2d 1151, 1156-1157 (1979) (bias of Federal
Trade Commission chairman), cert. denied, 447 U. S. 921

634 F. 2d 900, 912-913 (CA5 1981) (en banc) (administrativeprocedures must "not be used to harass or otherwise discourage those with legitimate claims"), rev'd on other groundssub nom. Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S.
496 (1982). III

In light of these general principles, we conclude that peti-tioner McCarthy need not have exhausted his constitutional
claim for money damages. As a preliminary matter, we findthat Congress has not meaningfully addressed the appropriateness of requiring exhaustion in this context. Althoughrespondents' interests are significant, we are left with a firm
conviction that, given the type of claim McCarthy raises andthe particular characteristics of the Bureau's general grievance procedure, McCarthy's individual interests outweighcountervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion.

A
Turning first to congressional intent, we note that the gen-eral grievance procedure was neither enacted nor mandated

by Congress. Respondents, however, urge that Congress,in effect, has acted to require exhaustion by delegating
power to the Attorney General and the Bureau of Prisonsto control and manage the federal prison system. See 18
U. S. C. $$ 4001(b) and 4042. Brief for Respondents 3, 16;Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42. We think respondents confuse what
Congress could be claimed to allow by implication with whatCongress affirmatively has requested or required. By delegating authority, in the most general of terms, to the Bureauto administer the federal prison system, Congress cannot be
said to have spoken to the particular issue whether prisonersin the custody of the Bureau should have direct access to the
federal courts.Respondents next argue that Congress, by enactment of

$ 7 of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 94Stat. 352, 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e, has articulated a policy favoring

503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT
150 McCARTHY v. MADIGAN

Opinion of the Court
exhaustion of the prison grievance procedure prior to the
filing of a constitutional claim against prison officials. Section 1997e imposes a limited exhaustion requirement for a
claim brought by a state prisoner under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,
42 U. S. C. $ 1983, provided that the underlying state prison
administrative remedy meets specified standards. See
Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S., at 507-512.
Section 1997e has no direct application in this case, because
at issue here is a Bivens claim by a federal prisoner against
federal prison officials. We find it significant that Congress,
in enacting $ 1997e, stopped short of imposing a parallel requirement in the federal prison context.

Section 1997e is not only inapplicable to Bivens claims,
but--by its own terms--cuts against respondents' claim that
the particular procedure now at issue need be exhausted.
First, unlike the rule of exhaustion proposed here, $ 1997e
does not authorize dismissal of an action for failure to exhaust. Instead, it provides that the action is to be stayed
for a maximum of 90 days. See $ 1997e(a)(1). Second,

$ 1997e does not mechanically require exhaustion in every
case where an acceptable state procedure is in place.
Rather, it directs federal courts to abstain "if the court
believes that such a [waiting] requirement would be appropriate and in the interests of justice." $ 1997e(a)(1). In
other words, if an inmate fails to meet filing deadlines under
an administrative scheme, a court has ample discretion to
determine that exhaustion nonetheless should be forgone.
Third, in contrast to the absence of any provision for the
award of money damages under the Bureau's general grievance procedure, the statute conditions exhaustion on the existence of "effective administrative remedies." 4 It is diffi4 The Conference Committee Report states: "It is the intent of the Congress that the court not find such a requirement [of exhaustion] appropriate in those situations in which the action brought . . . raises issues

Opinion of the Court
cult to see why a stricter rule of exhaustion than Congressitself has required in the state prison context should apply

in the federal prison context.Respondents also argue that requiring exhaustion is appropriate because Bivens relief gives way when necessaryto accommodate either the effective functioning of Government or an articulated congressional policy. Brief for Re-spondents 15. We have recognized that a

Bivens remedydoes not lie in two situations: (1) where Congress has provided an equally effective alternative remedy and declaredit to be a substitute for recovery under the Constitution, and
(2) where, in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,special factors counsel hesitation.

Carlson v. Green, 446U. S. 14, 18-19 (1980). As to the first exception, Congress

did not create the remedial scheme at issue here and thatscheme, in any case, as noted above, cannot be considered to
be equally effective with respect to a claim for money dam-ages. As to the second exception, respondents appear to
confuse the presence of special factors with any factorscounseling hesitation. In

Carlson, the Court held that "spe-cial factors" do not free prison officials from Bivens liability,

because prison officials do not enjoy an independent statusin our constitutional scheme, nor are they likely to be unduly
inhibited in the performance of their duties by the assertionof a Bivens claim. Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S., at 19.

The Attorney General, charged under the statute with certifying the
adequacy of state administrative remedial schemes, has provided by regulation: "The [state] grievance procedure shall afford a successful grievant
a meaningful remedy." 28 CFR $ 40.6 (1991) (emphasis added). At the
time of promulgating these regulations, the Department of Justice observed on the public record: "Presumably, where monetary relief was the
sole adequate remedy and could not be obtained through a grievance procedure, exhaustion would not be appropriate." 46 Fed. Reg. 3845 (1981).

152 McCARTHY v. MADIGAN

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 367 (1983), the Court found the Bivens remedy dis-placed because Congress had legislated an elaborate and

comprehensive remedial scheme. Schweiker, 487 U. S., at425; Bush, 462 U. S., at 388. "When the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what itconsiders adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional
violations that may occur in the course of its administra-tion, we have not created additional

Bivens remedies."Schweiker, 487 U. S., at 423. Here Congress has enacted

nothing. B

Because Congress has not required exhaustion of a federalprisoner's Bivens claim, we turn to an evaluation of the individual and institutional interests at stake in this case. Thegeneral grievance procedure heavily burdens the individual
interests of the petitioning inmate in two ways. First, theprocedure imposes short, successive filing deadlines that create a high risk of forfeiture of a claim for failure to comply.Second, the administrative "remedy" does not authorize an
award of monetary damages--the only relief requested byMcCarthy in this action. The combination of these features
means that the prisoner seeking only money damages haseverything to lose and nothing to gain from being required
to exhaust his claim under the internal grievance procedure.The filing deadlines for the grievance procedure require
an inmate, within 15 days of the precipitating incident, notonly to attempt to resolve his grievance informally but also
to file a formal written complaint with the prison warden.28 CFR $ 542.13 (1991). Then, he must successively hurdle
20-day and 30-day deadlines to advance to the end of thegrievance process. $ 542.15. Other than the Bureau's general and quite proper interest in having early notice of anyclaim, we have not been apprised of any urgency or exigency
justifying this timetable. Cf. Yakus v. United States, 321U. S. 414, 435 (1944) ("The sixty days' period allowed for protest of the Administrator's regulations cannot be said to be

Opinion of the Court
unreasonably short in view of the urgency and exigencies of
wartime price regulation"). As a practical matter, the filing
deadlines, of course, may pose little difficulty for the knowledgeable inmate accustomed to grievances and court actions.
But they are a likely trap for the inexperienced and unwary
inmate, ordinarily indigent and unrepresented by counsel,
with a substantial claim.

Respondents argue that the deadlines are not jurisdictional and may be extended for any "valid" reason. See 28
CFR $$ 542.13(b) and 542.15 (1991). Yet the regulations do
not elaborate upon what a "valid" reason is. Moreover,
it appears that prison officials--perhaps the very officials
subject to suit--are charged with determining what is a
"valid" reason.

All in all, these deadlines require a good deal of an inmate
at the peril of forfeiting his claim for money damages. The
"first" of "the principles that necessarily frame our analysis
of prisoners' constitutional claims" is that "federal courts
must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims of
prison inmates." Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987).
Because a prisoner ordinarily is divested of the privilege
to vote, the right to file a court action might be said to be
his remaining most "fundamental political right, because
preservative of all rights." Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.
356, 370 (1886). The rapid filing deadlines counsel strongly
against exhaustion as a prerequisite to the filing of a federalcourt action.5

5 Petitioner concedes that if his complaint contained a prayer for injunctive relief, exhaustion principles would apply differently. Brief for Petitioner 20, n. 20. Were injunctive relief sought, the grievance procedure
probably would be capable of producing the type of corrective action desired. Additionally, because of the continuing nature of conduct subject
to injunctive relief, the short filing deadlines would pose less difficulty
because the limitations period would be triggered anew by ongoing
conduct.

154 McCARTHY v. MADIGAN

Opinion of the Court
As we have noted, the grievance procedure does not in-clude any mention of the award of monetary relief. Respondents argue that this should not matter, because "in mostcases there are other things that the inmate wants." Tr. of
Oral Arg. 30. This may be true in some instances. But wecannot presume, as a general matter, that when a litigant
has deliberately forgone any claim for injunctive relief andhas singled out discrete past wrongs, specifically requesting
monetary compensation only, that he is likely interested in"other things." The Bureau, in any case, is always free to
offer an inmate administrative relief in return for with-drawal of his lawsuit. We conclude that the absence of any
monetary remedy in the grievance procedure also weighsheavily against imposing an exhaustion requirement.

In the alternative, respondents argue that, despite the ab-sence of any provision in the general grievance procedure for
the award of money damages, such damages in fact are avail-able for most prisoners asserting Bivens claims. As to Bivens claims that could have been brought under the FederalTort Claims Act (FTCA),

6 respondents contend that a grievance asking for money damages can be "converted" by prisonofficials to a FTCA claim for which prison officials are au6 Respondents contend that Bivens claims are almost always categorizable as FTCA claims, especially in view of the Attorney General's concession that corrections guards are "law enforcement" officers within the
meaning of the exception to the intentional-tort exception of the FTCA.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. As to those claims that are not categorizable as
FTCA claims, respondents concede that the Bureau of Prisons has no authority to offer a monetary settlement. Id., at 40. Instead, they contend
that the Department of Justice has a general settlement authority under
the federal regulations that might be exercised to dispose of general grievance claims. 28 CFR $ 50.15(c)(2) (1991). Nothing in the record indicates
that this authority has ever been exercised to recompense a prisoner with
a Bivens claim. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that a monetary settlement would be made in the course of an administrative proceeding, because the regulation provides that "[a]bsent exceptional circumstances" a
monetary settlement will not be paid "before entry of an adverse verdict,
judgment, or award." $ 50.15(c)(3).

Opinion of the Court
thorized, under 28 CFR $ 543.30 (1991), to award money dam-ages. This "conversion" authority does not appear in the

regulations having to do with the grievance procedure,which raises substantial doubt that an inmate would have
sufficient notice as to how his claim would be treated. In
any event, respondents have not pointed to anything in therecord showing that prison officials have a practice of converting a claim filed under the general grievance procedureto a claim under the FTCA procedure. We agree with petitioner that it is implausible to think that they do. The avail-ability of a money damages remedy is, at best, uncertain, and
the uncertainty of the administrative agency's authority to
award relief counsels against requiring exhaustion. See
Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620, 626 (1946); Union
Pacific R. Co. v. Board of Comm'rs of Weld County, 247 U. S.
282, 287 (1918).

We do not find the interests of the Bureau of Prisons to
weigh heavily in favor of exhaustion in view of the remedial
scheme and particular claim presented here. To be sure, the
Bureau has a substantial interest in encouraging internal
resolution of grievances and in preventing the undermining
of its authority by unnecessary resort by prisoners to the
federal courts. But other institutional concerns relevant to
exhaustion analysis appear to weigh in hardly at all. The
Bureau's alleged failure to render medical care implicates
only tangentially its authority to carry out the control and
management of the federal prisons. Furthermore, the Bureau does not bring to bear any special expertise on the type
of issue presented for resolution here.

The interests of judicial economy do not stand to be advanced substantially by the general grievance procedure.
No formal factfindings are made. The paperwork generated
by the grievance process might assist a court somewhat in
ascertaining the facts underlying a prisoner's claim more
quickly than if it has only a prisoner's complaint to review.
But the grievance procedure does not create a formal factual

record of the type that can be relied on conclusively by acourt for disposition of a prisoner's claim on the pleadings or

at summary judgment without the aid of affidavits.

C
In conclusion, we are struck by the absence of supportingmaterial in the regulations, the record, or the briefs that

the general grievance procedure here was crafted with anythought toward the principles of exhaustion of claims for
money damages. The Attorney General's professed concernfor internal dispute resolution has not translated itself into
a more effective grievance procedure that might encouragethe filing of an administrative complaint as opposed to a
court action. Congress, of course, is free to design or re-quire an appropriate administrative procedure for a prisoner
to exhaust his claim for money damages. Even without fur-ther action by Congress, we do not foreclose the possibility
that the Bureau itself may adopt an appropriate administra-tive procedure consistent with congressional intent.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scaliaand

Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court's holding that a federal prisonerneed not exhaust the procedures promulgated by the Federal

Bureau of Prisons. My view, however, is based entirely onthe fact that the grievance procedure at issue does not provide for any award of monetary damages. As a result, incases such as this one where prisoners seek monetary relief,
the Bureau's administrative remedy furnishes no effectiveremedy at all, and it is therefore improper to impose an exhaustion requirement. See McNeese v. Board of Ed. forCommunity Unit School Dist. 187, 373 U. S. 668, 675 (1963);
Montana National Bank of Billings v. Yellowstone County,276 U. S. 499, 505 (1928).

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
Because I would base the decision on this ground, I do not
join the Court's extensive discussion of the general principles
of exhaustion, nor do I agree with the implication that those
general principles apply without modification in the context
of a Bivens claim. In particular, I disagree with the Court's
reliance on the grievance procedure's filing deadlines as a
basis for excusing exhaustion. As the majority observes,
ante, at 146-147, we have previously refused to require exhaustion of administrative remedies where the administrative process subjects plaintiffs to unreasonable delay or to
an indefinite timeframe for decision. See Coit Independence
Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S. 561, 587 (1989); Gibson v.
Berryhill, 411 U. S. 564, 575, n. 14 (1973); Walker v. Southern
R. Co., 385 U. S. 196, 198 (1966); Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 270 U. S. 587, 591-592 (1926). This principle rests
on our belief that when a plaintiff might have to wait seemingly forever for an agency decision, agency procedures are
"inadequate" and therefore need not be exhausted. Coit
Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, supra, at 587.

But the Court makes strange use of this principle in holding that filing deadlines imposed by agency procedures may
provide a basis for finding that those procedures need not be
exhausted. Ante, at 152-153. Whereas before we have
held that procedures without "reasonable time limit[s]" may
be inadequate because they make a plaintiff wait too long,
Coit Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, supra, at 587,
today the majority concludes that strict filing deadlines
might also contribute to a finding of inadequacy because they
make a plaintiff move too quickly. But surely the second
proposition does not follow from the first. In fact, short filing deadlines will almost always promote quick decisionmaking by an agency, the very result that we have advocated
repeatedly in the cases cited above. So long as there is an
escape clause, as there is here, and the time limit is within a

159OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

DAWSON v. DELAWARE
certiorari to the supreme court of delaware
No. 90-6704. Argued November 12, 1991--Decided March 9, 1992
A Delaware jury convicted petitioner Dawson of first-degree murder and

other crimes. At the penalty hearing, the prosecution, inter alia, read
a stipulation--"[t]he Aryan Brotherhood refers to a white racist prison
gang that began . . . in California in response to other gangs of racial
minorities. Separate gangs calling themselves the Aryan Brotherhood
now exist in many state prisons including Delaware"--despite Dawson's
assertion that the admission of the stipulated facts violated his First
and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and introduced evidence that he had
the words "Aryan Brotherhood" tattooed on his hand. The jury found
that the aggravating circumstances--that the murder was committed by
an escaped prisoner, during the commission of a burglary, and for pecuniary gain--outweighed Dawson's mitigating evidence--that he had
shown kindness to family members and had earned good time credits in
prison--and made a binding recommendation to the court that he be
sentenced to death. The State Supreme Court affirmed.

Held:

1. Dawson's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated
by the admission of the Aryan Brotherhood evidence in this case, because the evidence had no relevance to the issues being decided in the
proceeding. The Constitution does not erect a per se barrier to the
admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and associations are protected by
the First Amendment. See, e. g., Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939.
However, the narrowness of the stipulation admitted here left the evidence totally without relevance to the sentencing proceeding. The stipulation says nothing about the beliefs of the Delaware prison's chapter
of the Aryan Brotherhood. Any racist beliefs the group might hold
were not tied in any way to the murder, because Dawson's victim was
white, as is Dawson. The evidence proved only the group's and Dawson's abstract beliefs, not that the group had committed or endorsed any
unlawful or violent acts. Thus, it was not relevant to help prove any
aggravating circumstance. Cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414.
Nor was the evidence relevant to rebut any mitigating evidence, since,
while the State was entitled to introduce "bad" character evidence to
rebut Dawson's "good" character evidence, see Payne v. Tennessee, 501

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

The question presented in this case is whether the Firstand Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the introduction in a
capital sentencing proceeding of the fact that the defendantwas a member of an organization called the Aryan Brotherhood, where the evidence has no relevance to the issuesbeing decided in the proceeding. We hold that they do.

Opinion of the Court
morning, Dawson burglarized a house near Kenton, Dela-ware, stealing a motorcycle jacket, several pocket watches,

and containers of loose change. He then proceeded to thehome of Richard and Madeline Kisner, located about half a
mile from the burglary site. Mrs. Kisner was alone in the
house, preparing to leave for work. Dawson brutally mur-dered Mrs. Kisner, stole the Kisners' car and some money,

and fled further south.He reappeared later that evening at the Zoo Bar in Milford, Delaware, wearing a motorcycle jacket that was too bigfor him. While at the bar, Dawson introduced himself to
Patty Dennis, and told her that his name was "Abaddon,"
which he said meant "[o]ne of Satan's disciples." App. 80-
81. Dawson was subsequently asked to leave the bar.
Later that evening, a Delaware state police officer responded
to a call to investigate a one-car accident. The car involved
in the accident had been stolen from a location near the Zoo
Bar and had been driven into a ditch, but the driver had
left the scene. The police began a house-to-house search for
Dawson, and found him at 5:25 the next morning, on the floor
of a Cadillac parked about three-tenths of a mile from the
accident site.

A jury convicted Dawson of first-degree murder, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony,
and various other crimes. The trial court then conducted a
penalty hearing before the jury to determine whether Dawson should be sentenced to death for the first-degree murder
conviction. See Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, $ 4209 (1987). The
prosecution gave notice that it intended to introduce (1) expert testimony regarding the origin and nature of the Aryan
Brotherhood, as well as the fact that Dawson had the words
"Aryan Brotherhood" tattooed on the back of his right hand,
(2) testimony that Dawson referred to himself as "Abaddon"
and had the name "Abaddon" tattooed in red letters across
his stomach, and (3) photographs of multiple swastika tattoos
on Dawson's back and a picture of a swastika he had painted

162 DAWSON v. DELAWARE

Opinion of the Court
on the wall of his prison cell. Dawson argued that thisevidence was inflammatory and irrelevant, and that its admission would violate his rights under the First and Four-teenth Amendments.

Before the penalty phase began, the parties agreed to a
stipulation regarding the Aryan Brotherhood evidence. Thestipulation provided:

"The Aryan Brotherhood refers to a white racist prison
gang that began in the 1960's in California in response toother gangs of racial minorities. Separate gangs calling

themselves the Aryan Brotherhood now exist in many
state prisons including Delaware." App. 132.

In return for Dawson's agreement to the stipulation, theprosecution agreed not to call any expert witnesses to testify

about the Aryan Brotherhood. Although Dawson agreed to
the stipulation in order to avoid presentation of this experttestimony, it is apparent from the record and from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Delaware that he continued toassert that the admission of the stipulated facts into evidence
violated the Constitution. 581 A. 2d 1078 (1990). At thepenalty hearing, the prosecution read the stipulation to the
jury and introduced evidence that Dawson had tattooed thewords "Aryan Brotherhood" on his hand. The trial judge
permitted the prosecution to present the evidence related to
the name "Abaddon" as well, but excluded all of the swastikaevidence. In addition, the prosecution submitted proof of

Dawson's lengthy criminal record. Dawson, in turn, pre-sented mitigating evidence based on the testimony of two
family members and on the fact that he had earned good time
credits in prison for enrolling in various drug and alcohol
programs. The jury found three statutory aggravating circumstances, each making Dawson eligible for the death penalty under Delaware law; it determined (1) that the murder
was committed by an escaped prisoner, (2) that the murder
was committed during the commission of a burglary, and (3)

163Cite as: 503 U. S. 159 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain. See id.,at 1102, and n. 27. The jury further concluded that the aggravating evidence outweighed the mitigating evidence, andrecommended that Dawson be sentenced to death. The trial
court, bound by that recommendation, imposed the death
penalty.The Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the convictions

and the death sentence. The court rejected Dawson's claimthat the evidence concerning the Aryan Brotherhood and his
use of the name "Abaddon" should have been excluded fromthe penalty hearing. It observed that having found at least
one statutory aggravating factor, the jury was "required to
make an individualized determination of whether Dawson
should be executed or incarcerated for life, based upon Dawson's character, his record and the circumstances of the
crime," and that it was desirable for the jury to have as much
information before it as possible when making that decision.
Id., at 1102-1103 (emphasis in original). The court acknowledged that the Constitution would prohibit the consideration
of certain irrelevant factors during the sentencing process,
but stated that " `[p]unishing a person for expressing his
views or for associating with certain people is substantially
different from allowing . . . evidence of [the defendant's] character [to be considered] where that character is a relevant
inquiry.' " Id., at 1103. Because the evidence relating to
the Aryan Brotherhood and the name "Abaddon" properly
focused the jury's attention on Dawson's character, and did
not appeal to the jury's prejudices concerning race, religion,
or political affiliation, the court upheld its introduction during the penalty phase. We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 946
(1991), to consider whether the admission of this evidence
was constitutional error. We hold that its admission in this
case was error and so reverse.

We have held that the First Amendment protects an individual's right to join groups and associate with others holding similar beliefs. See Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378

164 DAWSON v. DELAWARE

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 500, 507 (1964); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,357 U. S. 449, 460 (1958). Because his right to associate with

the Aryan Brotherhood is constitutionally protected, Dawsonargues, admission of evidence related to that association at
his penalty hearing violated his constitutional rights. Relying on our statement in Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862(1983), that an aggravating circumstance is invalid if "it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct thatis constitutionally protected," he contends that the Constitution forbids the consideration in sentencing of any evidenceconcerning beliefs or activities that are protected under the
First Amendment. Id., at 885.

We think this submission is, in the light of our decided
cases, too broad. These cases emphasize that "the sentencing authority has always been free to consider a wide range
of relevant material." Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808,
820-821 (1991); United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446
(1972) ("[A] judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry
broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may
come"); Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949). We
have previously upheld the consideration, in a capital sentencing proceeding, of evidence of racial intolerance and subversive advocacy where such evidence was relevant to the
issues involved. In Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939 (1983),
for example, we held that a sentencing judge in a capital
case might properly take into consideration "the elements of
racial hatred" in Barclay's crime as well as "Barclay's desire
to start a race war." See id., at 949 (plurality opinion); id.,
at 970, and n. 18 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).

One year later, in United States v. Abel, 469 U. S. 45 (1984),
we held that the Government could impeach a defense witness by showing that both the defendant and the witness
were members of the Aryan Brotherhood, and that members
were sworn to lie on behalf of each other. We held the evidence admissible to show bias, even assuming that member503us1$41H 11-13-95 22:26:44 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ship in the organization was among the associational free-doms protected by the First Amendment. Though

Abel did
not involve a capital sentencing proceeding, its logic is per-fectly applicable to such a proceeding. We therefore conclude that the Constitution does not erect a per se barrier to
the admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs and associ-ations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment.Although we cannot accept Dawson's broad submission, we
nevertheless agree with him that, in this case, the receiptinto evidence of the stipulation regarding his membership in
the Aryan Brotherhood was constitutional error. Before
the penalty hearing, the prosecution claimed that its expert
witness would show that the Aryan Brotherhood is a white
racist prison gang that is associated with drugs and violent
escape attempts at prisons, and that advocates the murder
of fellow inmates. If credible and otherwise admissible evidence to that effect had been presented, we would have a
much different case. But, after reaching an agreement with
Dawson, the prosecution limited its proof regarding the
Aryan Brotherhood to the stipulation. The brief stipulation
proved only that an Aryan Brotherhood prison gang originated in California in the 1960's, that it entertains white racist beliefs, and that a separate gang in the Delaware prison
system calls itself the Aryan Brotherhood. We conclude
that the narrowness of the stipulation left the Aryan Brotherhood evidence totally without relevance to Dawson's sentencing proceeding.

As an initial matter, the second sentence of the stipulation,
when carefully parsed, says nothing about the beliefs of the
Aryan Brotherhood "chapter" in the Delaware prisons.
Prior to trial, the prosecution acknowledged that there are
differences among the various offshoots of the Aryan Brotherhood, stating that "there are cells or specific off-shoots
within various local jurisdictions that don't see eye to eye or
share a union, if you will." App. 33. But the juxtaposition

503us1$41H 11-13-95 22:26:44 PAGES OPINPGT
166 DAWSON v. DELAWARE

Opinion of the Court
of the second sentence with the first sentence, which de-scribes the Aryan Brotherhood in California prisons as a

"white racist prison gang," invited the jury to infer that thebeliefs of the Delaware chapter are identical to those of the
California chapter.

Even if the Delaware group to which Dawson allegedlybelongs is racist, those beliefs, so far as we can determine,

had no relevance to the sentencing proceeding in this case.For example, the Aryan Brotherhood evidence was not tied
in any way to the murder of Dawson's victim. In Barclay,on the contrary, the evidence showed that the defendant's
membership in the Black Liberation Army, and his consequent desire to start a "racial war," were related to the murder of a white hitchhiker. See 463 U. S., at 942-944 (plurality opinion). We concluded that it was most proper for the
sentencing judge to "tak[e] into account the elements of racial hatred in this murder." Id., at 949. In the present
case, however, the murder victim was white, as is Dawson;
elements of racial hatred were therefore not involved in the
killing.

Because the prosecution did not prove that the Aryan
Brotherhood had committed any unlawful or violent acts, or
had even endorsed such acts, the Aryan Brotherhood evidence was also not relevant to help prove any aggravating
circumstance. In many cases, for example, associational evidence might serve a legitimate purpose in showing that a
defendant represents a future danger to society. A defendant's membership in an organization that endorses the killing
of any identifiable group, for example, might be relevant to
a jury's inquiry into whether the defendant will be dangerous
in the future. Other evidence concerning a defendant's associations might be relevant in proving other aggravating circumstances. But the inference which the jury was invited
to draw in this case tended to prove nothing more than the
abstract beliefs of the Delaware chapter. Delaware counters that even these abstract beliefs constitute a portion of

167Cite as: 503 U. S. 159 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Dawson's "character," and thus are admissible in their ownright under Delaware law. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, $ 4209(d)

(1987). Whatever label is given to the evidence presented,however, we conclude that Dawson's First Amendment
rights were violated by the admission of the Aryan Brotherhood evidence in this case, because the evidence proved noth-ing more than Dawson's abstract beliefs. Cf.

Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414 (1989) ("[T]he government may notprohibit the expression of an idea simply because society

finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable"). Delawaremight have avoided this problem if it had presented evidence
showing more than mere abstract beliefs on Dawson's part,
but on the present record one is left with the feeling that
the Aryan Brotherhood evidence was employed simply because the jury would find these beliefs morally reprehensible.
Because Delaware failed to do more, we cannot find the evidence was properly admitted as relevant character evidence.

Nor was the Aryan Brotherhood evidence relevant to
rebut any mitigating evidence offered by Dawson. We have
held that a capital defendant is entitled to introduce any relevant mitigating evidence that he proffers in support of a sentence less than death. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,
114 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978) (plurality
opinion). But just as the defendant has the right to introduce any sort of relevant mitigating evidence, the State is
entitled to rebut that evidence with proof of its own. See
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S., at 825 ("[T]he State has a legitimate interest in counteracting the mitigating evidence
which the defendant is entitled to put in") (internal quotation
marks omitted); id., at 860 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In this
case, Dawson's mitigating evidence consisted of testimony
about his kindness to family members, as well as evidence
regarding good time credits he earned in prison for enrolling

Opinion of the Court
evidence in rebuttal, including that concerning the Aryan
Brotherhood. The principle of broad rebuttal asserted by
Delaware is correct, but the argument misses the mark because, as stated above, the Aryan Brotherhood evidence presented in this case cannot be viewed as relevant "bad" character evidence in its own right.

The dissent takes us to task for failing to recognize the
broader implications of membership in a prison gang, and for
extending the protection of the First Amendment to evidence introduced at a sentencing hearing. The material adduced by the dissent as to the nature of prison gangs--similar to the evidence which the prosecution in this case at one
time considered adducing by expert testimony, supra, at
165--would, if it had been presented to the jury, have made
this a different case. But we do not have the same confidence as the dissent does that jurors would be familiar with
the court decisions and studies upon which it relies. Regarding the reach of the First Amendment, the dissent correctly
points out that it prevents the State from criminalizing certain conduct in the first instance. But it goes further than
that. It prohibits a State from denying admission to the bar
on the grounds of previous membership in the Communist
Party, when there is no connection between that membership
and the "good moral character" required by the State to
practice law. Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of N. M.,
353 U. S. 232 (1957). It prohibits the State from requiring
information from an organization that would impinge on
First Amendment associational rights if there is no connection between the information sought and the State's interest.
Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U. S. 516 (1960); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449 (1958). We think that
it similarly prevents Delaware here from employing evidence
of a defendant's abstract beliefs at a sentencing hearing
when those beliefs have no bearing on the issue being tried.

The question whether the wrongful admission of the
Aryan Brotherhood evidence at sentencing was harmless

error is not before us at this time, and we therefore leave itopen for consideration by the Supreme Court of Delaware on

remand. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990).For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Delaware and remand the case for furtherproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Blackmun, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion, but write separately to note myunderstanding that the Court, by the penultimate paragraph

of its opinion, ante, at 168-169, does not require applicationof harmless-error review on remand.

This Court previously has declined to apply harmless-error analysis to certain categories of constitutional error.
See, e. g., Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 100 (1986) (racialdiscrimination in the selection of a petit jury);

Vasquez v.Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 261-262 (1986) (racial discrimination

in the selection of a grand jury); Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S.39, 49-50, and n. 9 (1984) (right to a public trial); Tumey v.
Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 535 (1927) (trial before an impartialjudge). Because of the potential chilling effect that consideration of First Amendment activity at sentencing mighthave, there is a substantial argument that harmless-error
analysis is not appropriate for the type of error before ustoday. See

Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 587 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) ("[V]iolations of certainconstitutional rights are not, and should not be, subject to

harmless-error analysis because those rights protect impor-tant values that are unrelated to the truth-seeking function
of the trial"). The parties did not address this issue, and itis better left for the Supreme Court of Delaware on remand.

violated the First Amendment. Ante, at 160. I respectfully dissent.

I

Dawson's membership in the Aryan Brotherhood prison
gang had relevance at sentencing. Under Delaware law,
after a jury finds a statutory aggravating factor, it may consider "all relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation" relating to either the crime or the "character and propensities"
of the defendant. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, $ 4209(d)(1) (1987).
Under this provision, Dawson's character became an issue in
determining whether he should receive the death penalty.

To prove his good character, as the Court observes, Dawson introduced evidence that he had acted kindly toward his
family and that he had earned good time credits while in
prison. Ante, at 162. Dawson also introduced evidence of
his membership and participation in various respectable organizations, including the Green Tree Program (described
only as a "drug and alcohol program"), Alcoholics Anonymous (not described at all), and certain therapy and counseling groups (also not described at all). App. 79. Dawson did
not call any expert witnesses to clarify the nature of these
organizations or their activities.

The State attempted to rebut Dawson's mitigating character evidence in part by showing that Dawson also belonged
to a prison gang called the Aryan Brotherhood. A stipulation read to the jury explained:

"The Aryan Brotherhood refers to a white racist prison
gang that began in the 1960's in California in response to
other gangs of racial minorities. Separate gangs calling
themselves the Aryan Brotherhood now exist in many
state prisons including Delaware." Id., at 132.

I do not consider the evidence of Dawson's gang membership
irrelevant to his character.

A

The Court asserts that the gang membership evidence had
no relevance because it did nothing more than indicate Dawson's "abstract" racist "beliefs." Ante, at 167. The Court
suggests that Dawson's membership in a prison gang would
be relevant if the gang had endorsed or committed "unlawful
or violent acts" such as drug use, escape, or the murder of
other inmates. Ante, at 165, 166. Yet, because the State
failed to prove the Aryan Brotherhood's activities, the Court
reasons, the jury could do no more than infer that Dawson
shared the gang's racist beliefs. Ibid. I disagree. In my
judgment, a jury reasonably could conclude from Dawson's
membership in a prison gang that he had engaged in some
sort of forbidden activities while in prison. The evidence
also tended to establish future dangerousness and to rebut
Dawson's attempt to show that he was kind to others.

Jurors do not leave their knowledge of the world behind
when they enter a courtroom and they do not need to have
the obvious spelled out in painstaking detail. Just as defense counsel may assume when introducing mitigating evidence that a jury understands the nature of a church choir,
a softball team, or the Boy Scouts, so too may a prosecutor
assume when rebutting this evidence that a jury knows the
nature of a prison gang. The concept of a prison gang is not
so mysterious that it requires an encyclopedic definition or a
greater explanation than any of the other organizations to
which Dawson belonged, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or
the Green Tree Program. Cf. Jones v. Hamelman, 869 F. 2d
1023, 1028 (CA7 1989) (testimony of a purported expert unnecessary to explain a prison gang once the record established its existence); United States Dept. of Justice, Prison
Gangs: Their Extent, Nature and Impact on Prisons 10 (1985)
(discussing the "extensive" media coverage of prison gangs).

172 DAWSON v. DELAWARE

Thomas, J., dissenting
In stating that Dawson belonged to a prison gang, the stip-ulation implied much more than that he shared the gang 's

abstract racist creed; it indicated that Dawson had engagedin prison gang activities, and that he had the character of a
person who engages in these activities.

"One of the distinguishing characteristics of the prisongang is the virtual absence of any non-criminal, nondeviant activities. Gang members engage in some insti-tutional pastimes, weight lifting being one of the more
notable, but in general their activities are criminal ordeviant in nature. The gang member is completely immersed in being a career prison gangster, leaving littletime and less inclination for other than asocial behavior." U. S. Dept. of Justice, supra, at x-xi.
Denying that Dawson's gang membership told the juryanything about his activities, tendencies, and traits--his

"character"--ignores reality. What Judge Easterbrookremarked when others attempted to distinguish gang membership from gang activities, someone reading the Court'sopinion might say today:

"Who do they think they are fooling? What elementsof `membership'--as opposed to `activity'--take place [in
the prison]? What are prison gangs for, except to en-gage in forbidden `activity'? Surely [they] do not believe that prison gangs meet every month to discuss TheCritique of Pure Reason and debate how Stanley Tigerman's buildings differ from those of the Bauhaus school.Gangs affiliate for mutual support, but not the kind
contemplated by the National Labor Relations Act."
David K. v. Lane, 839 F. 2d 1265, 1278 (CA7 1988) (con-curring opinion).

In my view, the stipulation was relevant to Dawson's charac-ter because it explained that the Aryan Brotherhood was a
prison gang and that Dawson was a member. That evi-dence, I submit, supports an inference that while in prison,

Dawson engaged in the kind of unlawful activity mentionedby the Court.

1

The description of the Aryan Brotherhood as a "racist"prison gang conveyed additional information about Dawson's

character. In Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939 (1983), theplurality found it relevant that a black gang conspired not
merely to commit crimes, but to commit them against whitepersons out of racial hatred. See

id., at 949. Even if Daw-son's white racist prison gang does not advocate "the murder

of fellow inmates," ante, at 165, a jury reasonably could inferthat its members in one way or another act upon their racial
prejudice. The stipulation itself makes clear that the AryanBrotherhood does not exist merely to facilitate formulation
of abstract racist thoughts, but to "respon[d]" to gangs ofracial minorities. The evidence thus tends to establish that
Dawson has not been "a well-behaved and well-adjusted pris-oner,"

Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986), which

1 Indeed, in the case of an organization claiming to be part of the Aryan
Brotherhood, the jury very well may not have needed even the explanation
that the stipulation provided. Courts regularly have noticed that the
Aryan Brotherhood is "a singularly vicious prison gang," United States v.
Fountain, 840 F. 2d 509, 516 (CA7 1988) (Easterbrook, J.) (citing other
cases), that it has a "hostility to black inmates," United States v. Silverstein, 732 F. 2d 1338, 1341 (CA7 1984) (Posner, J.) (citing secondary
sources), and that it originated "during the prison racial violence of the
1960's," United States v. Mills, 704 F. 2d 1553, 1555 (CA11 1983). The
Aryan Brotherhood gangs also have received substantial attention in both
popular and scholarly writings. See, e. g., Matthee, Stronger Prison Gang
Influence Cited, L. A. Times, July 10, 1987, part 1, p. 34, col. 1 (describing
members of the Aryan Brotherhood as "among the most violent prisoners"); Goodgame, Mayhem in the Cellblocks, Time, Aug. 12, 1985, p. 20
(describing the Aryan Brotherhood's "inflexible ethic of vengeance"); J.
Fox, Organizational and Racial Conflict in Maximum-Security Prisons 136
(1982) (identifying the Aryan Brotherhood as an "extremist" organization
like the Ku Klux Klan); United States Dept. of Justice, Prison Gangs: Their
Extent, Nature and Impact on Prisons 65-190 (1985) (discussing the activities of the Aryan Brotherhood in the prisons of 14 States). Even if the
jury were unaware of the Aryan Brotherhood in particular, it was surely
aware of the nature of prison gangs generally.

itself is an indication of future dangerousness, see Franklinv. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 178 (1988) (plurality opinion); id.,

at 186 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).The stipulation also tends to rebut Dawson's evidence of
good character. In capital cases, we have held that the sen-tence imposed should reflect a " `reasoned moral response' "
not only to the crime, but also to the " `background' " and" `character' " of the defendant himself. See

Penry v. Lyn-augh, 492 U. S. 302, 328 (1989) (quoting California v. Brown,

479 U. S. 538, 545 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring). In de-termining Dawson's "personal culpability," Penry, supra, at
327, the jury surely would want to know about the variousactivities, traits, and tendencies that distinguish him as a
"uniquely individual human bein[g]," Woodson v. North
Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 304 (1976). Dawson introducedmitigating character evidence that he had acted kindly towards his family. The stipulation tended to undercut thisshowing by suggesting that Dawson's kindness did not extend to members of other racial groups. Although we donot sit in judgment of the morality of particular creeds, we
cannot bend traditional concepts of relevance to exempt theantisocial.

B
The Court's opinion suggests that the Constitution nowimposes a double standard for determining relevance: a

standard easy for defendants to satisfy, but difficult forprosecutors. Under Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104
(1982), and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978) (pluralityopinion), a capital defendant has a right to introduce all relevant mitigating evidence. Capital defendants, as a result,regularly introduce character evidence that allows juries to
consider their abstract beliefs and associational rights. Daw-son, for example, introduced evidence that he associated with
Alcoholics Anonymous and other groups. Other defendantshave introduced comparable evidence regarding their religious practice and fraternal organizations. See, e. g., Jordan

State v. Beuke, 38 Ohio St. 3d 29, 43, 526 N. E. 2d 274, 289
(1988) (former membership in the Cub Scouts). I see noway to hold that this evidence has relevance, but that Dawson's gang membership does not.A double standard for determining relevance may distort
the picture presented to the jury. In this case, Dawson himself chose to introduce evidence of certain good character
traits. Unless the State had responded with evidence of
other, bad traits, the jury could not possibly have made a
fair and balanced determination. Membership in Alcoholics
Anonymous might suggest a good character, but membership
in the Aryan Brotherhood just as surely suggests a bad one.
The jury could not have assessed Dawson's overall character
without both.

Just last Term, in Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991),
the Court condemned a similar distortion. Overruling
Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987), and South Carolina
v. Gathers, 490 U. S. 805 (1989), we held that the Eighth
Amendment does not generally prohibit the introduction of
victim impact evidence. See Payne, supra, at 827. We reasoned that allowing the jury to consider the defendant, but
not the victim, would create an unbalanced picture. Quoting a dissenting opinion in Booth, we stated: " `[T]he State
has a legitimate interest in counteracting the mitigating evidence which the defendant is entitled to put in, by reminding
the sentencer that just as the murderer should be considered
as an individual, so too the victim is an individual whose
death represents a unique loss to society and in particular to
his family.' " Payne, supra, at 825 (quoting Booth, 482 U. S.,
at 517 (White, J., dissenting)); see also 482 U. S., at 520

Thomas, J., dissenting
(Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Many citizens have found one-sidedand hence unjust the criminal trial in which a parade of witnesses comes forth to testify to the pressures beyond normalhuman experience that drove the defendant to commit his
crime . . . . Perhaps these sentiments do not sufficientlytemper justice with mercy, but that is a question to be decided through the democratic processes of a free people, andnot by the decrees of this Court"). Whatever distortion was
produced in requiring an exclusive focus on the defendant'scharacter, at least nothing in

Booth prevented the jury--asdoes today's decision--from fairly and fully assessing that

character. II

The Court acknowledges that Delaware could haveavoided any First Amendment problem simply by presenting
evidence that proved something more than Dawson's ab-stract beliefs.

Ante, at 167. For the reasons that I havestated, I believe that Delaware has made such a showing.

I therefore see no First Amendment violation under theCourt's analysis. The Court, however, goes on to make several further assertions about the First Amendment that Ifind troubling and unnecessary in this case.

A
Both Dawson and the State, as noted above, had a rightto develop the issue of "character" at the sentencing proceeding. See Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, $ 4209(d)(1) (1987);
Eddings, supra, at 113-114. In applying the First Amend-ment, however, the Court declines to decide whether abstract beliefs may constitute a portion of character. "What-ever label is given to the evidence," the Court asserts, "we
conclude that Dawson's First Amendment rights were vio-lated . . . in this case . . . ."

Ante, at 167. As a consequence,to the extent that abstract beliefs make up part of a person's

character, the decision today limits the aspects of characterthat sentencing authorities may consider.

177Cite as: 503 U. S. 159 (1992)
Thomas, J., dissenting
We long have held that the Constitution permits courtsand juries to consider character evidence in sentencing proceedings. See Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 247(1949). Until today, we have never hinted that the First
Amendment limits the aspects of a defendant's character thatthey may consider. To the contrary, we have emphasized
that the sentencing authority "may appropriately conduct aninquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind
of information he may consider, or the source from whichit may come."

United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446(1972).

In Williams, for example, we upheld a New York law thatencouraged the sentencing judge to consider evidence about
the defendant's "past life, health, habits, conduct, and mentaland moral propensities," 337 U. S., at 245, a phrase easily
broad enough to encompass a substantial amount of FirstAmendment activity. Writing for the Court, Justice Black
specifically identified religion and interests as sentencingconsiderations that may "give the sentencing judge a composite picture of the defendant." Id., at 250, n. 15.More recently, in Franklin v. Lynaugh, all five Members
of the Court who addressed the issue agreed that reli-gious activity may bear upon a defendant's character. See
487 U. S., at 186 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)("Evidence of . . . religious devotion might demonstrate positive character traits"); id., at 190 (Stevens, J., dissenting)("Evidence of . . . regular church attendance" is relevant to
character).2 Although the opinions in Franklin endorsed

2 In federal court, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(2)(A) permits the presentence report following a criminal conviction to contain "information about the history and characteristics of the defendant . . . that

the original version of this Rule, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 795, refers to a report
that we endorsed in Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 250, n. 15 (1949):

consideration of religious activity as a mitigating factor, theendorsement necessarily disfavors abstention from religious

activity, which the First Amendment also protects.The Court nowhere explains why courts and juries may
consider some First Amendment protected activities whenassessing character, but they cannot consider others. Today's decision, moreover, does not define the boundaries ofpermissible inquiry into character. If the Court means that
no First Amendment protected activity "ca[n] be viewed asrelevant `bad' character evidence in its own right,"

ante, at168, then today's decision represents a dramatic shift in our

sentencing jurisprudence. B

Once the Court concludes that the gang membership evi-dence "has no relevance to the issues being decided in the
[sentencing] proceeding," ante, at 160, I also have difficultyseeing what the First Amendment adds to the analysis. If
the Court considers the evidence irrelevant, the problem isnot that Delaware law bases the sentencing decision on impermissible issues, but rather that Dawson may not have re-ceived a fair trial on the permissible issues in the proceeding.
The Due Process Clause, not the First Amendment, tradi-tionally has regulated questions about the improper admission of evidence.As we stated in Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 (1940),
the requirement of due process always has protected "theweak, or . . . helpless political, religious, or racial minorities
and those who differed" by ensuring that "no man's life, lib-erty or property be forfeited as criminal punishment for violation of [the] law until there ha[s] been a charge fairly made
ligion. Religion may be a significant, decisive factor in enabling an individual to overcome his difficulties." Id., at 10. The report also suggests
that courts consider the defendant's "fraternal and social organizations."
Ibid. A more recent edition of this report retains comparable instructions. See Administrative Office of the United States Courts, The Presentence Investigation Report, Pub. No. 105 (1984).

and fairly tried in a public tribunal free of prejudice, passion,excitement, and tyrannical power."

Id., at 236-237. We
have made clear, in particular, that when a state court ad-mits evidence that is "so unduly prejudicial that it renders

the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief."
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S., at 825; see Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168, 179-183 (1986).Our decision in

Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of
N. M., 353 U. S. 232 (1957), which the Court incorrectly cites,illustrates the point. In

Schware, the New Mexico Supreme
Court denied an applicant admission to the bar on grounds
that he lacked good moral character. Evidence showed that
the applicant had belonged to the Communist Party 15 years
earlier. The Court erroneously states that Schware held
that admitting proof of the applicant's membership in the
Communist Party violated the First Amendment. Ante, at
168. Schware, in fact, did not decide that admitting the
Communist Party evidence abridged any right of free political association. See 353 U. S., at 243, n. 13. It held, instead,
that the state court erred in admitting the Communist Party
evidence because it had no relevance to the applicant's moral
character after so many years. See id., at 246. Due process, the Court concluded, prohibited the state court to find
the applicant morally unfit to practice law without any relevant evidence. See id., at 247.

Applying familiar evidentiary standards in Dawson's case,
the trial judge recognized that the "real issue" in admitting
the gang membership evidence was whether its "probative
value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice."
App. 52. The Delaware Supreme Court, likewise, examined
the record to determine whether the gang membership evidence "improperly appeal[ed] to the juror's passions and
prejudices concerning race, religion, or political affiliation."
581 A. 2d 1078, 1103 (1990). The standards employed by
these courts went further than the fundamental unfairness

argument, based on the record as a whole, that the courtsmisapplied these standards to the facts of his case. For
these reasons, I would affirm.

GENERAL MOTORS CORP. et al. v. ROMEIN et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of michigan
No. 90-1390. Argued December 10, 1991--Decided March 9, 1992
In 1980, the Michigan Legislature raised maximum weekly workers' compensation benefits and provided an annual supplemental adjustment to
workers injured before 1980. The following year it enacted a statute
allowing employers to decrease workers' compensation benefits to those
disabled employees eligible to receive wage-loss compensation from
other employer-funded sources. Some employers, including petitioners,
General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor Company, took the position
that the 1981 law's "benefit coordination" provision allowed them to reduce workers' compensation benefits to workers injured before the statute's effective date, who were receiving benefits from other sources.
The State Supreme Court ultimately accepted this interpretation.
Chambers v. General Motors Corp., 422 Mich. 636, 375 N. W. 2d 715. In
1987, the legislature repudiated Chambers and required employers who
had coordinated benefits for previously disabled workers under the 1981
law to refund the benefits withheld. The State Supreme Court upheld
the 1987 law, rejecting petitioners' arguments that the reimbursement
provision was unfairly retroactive and violated the Contract Clause and
the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution.

Held:

1. The 1987 statute did not substantially impair the obligations of
petitioners' contracts with their employees in violation of the Contract
Clause, because there was no contractual agreement regarding the specific terms allegedly at issue. The contracts were entered into after
collective bargaining between the parties before the 1981 law was enacted and make no express mention of workers' compensation benefits.
Nor was the workers' compensation law an implied contract term
whereby employers promised to pay the amount required by law for
each payment period, an obligation that was completed by making payments for any disability period. There was no occasion for the parties
to consider in bargaining taking place before the 1981 law's effective
date the question whether an unanticipated reduction in benefits could
later be restored after the "benefit period" had closed. Petitioners err
in arguing that such a term is "incorporated" by law into the employment contracts, regardless of the parties' assent. Michigan law does
not explicitly imply a contractual term allowing an employer to depend
on the closure of past disability compensation periods; and such a right

182 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. ROMEIN

Syllabus
does not appear to be so central to the bargained-for exchange between
the parties, or to the enforceability of the contract as a whole, that it
must be deemed to be a contract term. State regulations are usually
implied terms regardless of assent only when those laws affect the validity, construction, and enforcement of contracts. See United States
Trust Co. of N. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 19, n. 17. While changes
in the laws that make a contract legally enforceable may trigger Contract Clause scrutiny if they impair the obligation of pre-existing contracts, even if they do not alter the contracts' bargained-for terms, the
1987 statute did not change the legal enforceability of the contracts here.
The parties still have the same ability to enforce the bargained-for
terms that they did before the 1987 statute's enactment. Petitioners'
suggestion that every workplace regulation should be read into private
employment contracts would expand the definition of contract so far
that the Contract Clause would lose its purpose of enabling individuals
to order their personal and business affairs according to their particular
needs and interests; would cause the Clause to protect against all
changes in legislation, regardless of those changes' effect on bargainedfor agreements; would severely limit the ability of state legislatures to
amend their regulatory legislation; and could render the Clause entirely
dependent on state law. Pp. 186-191.

2. The 1987 statute did not violate the Due Process Clause. Its retroactive provision was a rational means of furthering the legitimate
legislative purpose of correcting the results of the Chambers opinion.
Cf. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467
U. S. 717, 730. It preserved the legislative compromise that had been
struck by the 1980-1981 laws--giving workers injured before 1982 their
full benefits without coordination, but not the greater increases made
to subsequently injured workers--and equalized the payments made
by employers who had relied on Chambers with those who had not,
cf. United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 64-65. Pp. 191-192.

In 1987, the Michigan Legislature enacted a statute thathad the effect of requiring petitioners General Motors Corporation (GM) and Ford Motor Company (Ford) to repayworkers' compensation benefits GM and Ford had withheld
in reliance on a 1981 workers' compensation statute. Peti-tioners challenge the provision of the statute mandating
these retroactive payments on the ground that it violates theContract Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Federal
Constitution. I

184 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. ROMEIN

Opinion of the Court
"Neither side was able to obtain everything it wanted--pos-sibly a good indication of the degree of balance this compromise represents." Id., at 458.Among other things, the 1980 legislation raised maximum
weekly benefits to 90% of the state average weekly wage,
and provided workers injured before 1980 an annual supple-mental adjustment of their benefits of up to five percent.

Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $$ 418.355(2), 418.352(1) (West 1982).In 1981, the legislature enacted a statute allowing employers
to decrease workers' compensation benefits to those disabledemployees eligible to receive wage-loss compensation from
other employer-funded sources. $ 418.354. This provision,
allowing what is called "benefit coordination," is at the heart
of the controversy in this case.

The benefit coordination provision did not specify whether
it was to be applied to workers injured before its effective
date, March 31, 1982. Petitioners took the position that the
1981 law allowed them to reduce workers' compensation benefits to workers injured before March 31, 1982, who were
receiving benefits from other sources. For example, GM cut
respondent Romein's weekly payment by $132 per week, and
Ford cut respondent Gonzalez' payment by $176 per week.
The lower state courts disagreed with petitioners' interpretation, holding that coordination was allowed only for employees injured after 1982. See, e. g., Franks v. White Pine
Copper Div., Copper Range Co., 122 Mich. App. 177, 185, 332
N. W. 2d 447, 449 (1982). Both Houses of the Michigan Legislature passed a concurrent resolution declaring that the coordination provisions were "not designed to disrupt benefits
which were already being received by an employee prior to
the effective date of this act or benefits resulting from injuries incurred prior to the act's effective date." See Senate
Con. Res. 575, adopted by the Senate on April 1, 1982, and
by the House on May 18, 1982; 1982 Senate J. 626, 706-707;
1982 House J. 1262. The same year, a bill was introduced in
the Michigan Senate to amend the statute in this respect,

185Cite as: 503 U. S. 181 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
but it was not passed. Senate Bill 834, introduced on May26, 1982.

Meanwhile, petitioners continued to attempt to persuadethe Michigan courts that the 1981 statute should be applied
to workers injured before its effective date. In 1985, petitioners' interpretation was accepted by the Michigan Su-preme Court.

Chambers v. General Motors Corp., decided
with Franks v. White Pine Copper Div., Copper Range Co.,422 Mich. 636, 375 N. W. 2d 715. The court held that the

benefit coordination provision applied to all payment periodsafter its effective date, regardless of the date the employee
had been injured. The court also held that application
of the coordination provisions to employees injured before
1982 did not violate the Contract Clause or the Due Process Clause.

After the decision in Chambers, employers who had not
coordinated benefits for employees injured before 1982
began to demand reimbursement from these employees.
See Jones, Firms Cut Checks for Disabled Workers, Detroit
Free Press, Nov. 29, 1985, p. 3A. The Michigan Legislature
responded almost immediately by introducing legislation to
overturn the court's decision. On October 16, 1985, before
the Michigan Supreme Court had ruled on the motion for
rehearing in Chambers, House Bill 5084 was introduced. As
amended and passed by the House on January 29, 1986, the
bill repudiated the Chambers decision, declared that employers who had not coordinated benefits before the Chambers
decision could not seek reimbursement from affected employees, and required employers who had coordinated benefits
before Chambers to reimburse their employees. Meanwhile, the Senate passed its own version of the bill, Senate
Bill 67, also disapproving the Chambers decision and providing that employers could not require employees to reimburse
them for benefits not coordinated after 1982. The Senate
bill was amended by a Conference Committee to provide for
reimbursement of benefits withheld as a result of coordina503us1$42z 11-13-95 22:38:39 PAGES OPINPGT

tion, putting employers who had coordinated benefits for previously disabled workers in the same position as those who
had not. House Legislative Analysis of Senate Bill 67, p. 2
(May 7, 1987). The amended Senate bill passed into law on
May 14, 1987. 1987 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 28.

As a result of the 1987 statute, petitioners were ordered
to refund nearly $25 million to disabled employees. They
protested that the provision requiring reimbursement of
benefits withheld was unfairly retroactive and violated the
Contract Clause and the Due Process Clause. The Michigan
Supreme Court upheld the statute against these challenges,
on the ground that the employers had no vested rights in
coordination for Contract Clause purposes, and that the retroactive provisions furthered a rational legislative purpose.
436 Mich. 515, 462 N. W. 2d 555 (1990). We granted certiorari, 500 U. S. 915 (1991), and now affirm.

II
Article I, $ 10, of the Constitution provides: "No State shall
. . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts."
Petitioners claim that the 1987 statute requiring reimbursement of benefits withheld in reliance on the 1981 coordination
provisions substantially impaired the obligation of the contracts with their employees.

Generally, we first ask whether the change in state law
has "operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual
relationship." Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438
U. S. 234, 244 (1978); Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas
Power & Light Co., 459 U. S. 400, 411 (1983). This inquiry
has three components: whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial. Normally, the first two are unproblematic, and we need address
only the third. In this case, however, we need not reach
the questions of impairment, as we hold that there was no

187Cite as: 503 U. S. 181 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
contractual agreement regarding the specific workers' com-pensation terms allegedly at issue.

The contracts allegedly impaired by the 1987 statute areemployment contracts entered into after collective bargaining between petitioners and respondents. It is undisputed
that the contracts themselves were formed before the 1981law was enacted requiring benefit coordination. It is also

undisputed that the contracts make no express mention ofworkers' compensation benefits. Petitioners argue that the
workers' compensation law is an implied term of the con-tracts, because the parties bargained for other compensation
with workers' compensation benefits in mind. This implied
term that was allegedly impaired by the 1987 statute is defined as a promise to pay the amount of workers' compensation required by law for each payment period. Once performance of this obligation is completed by making payments
for any disability period, petitioners claim that they have
a settled expectation that cannot be undone by later state
legislation. Because the 1987 statute "reopens" these closed
transactions, petitioners contend its retroactive provisions
violate the Contract Clause.

The Michigan Supreme Court held that the term suggested by petitioners was not an implied term of the employment contracts between petitioners and respondents. We
"accord respectful consideration and great weight to the
views of the State's highest court," though ultimately we are
"bound to decide for ourselves whether a contract was
made." Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, 303 U. S. 95,
100 (1938). The question whether a contract was made is a
federal question for purposes of Contract Clause analysis,
see Irving Trust Co. v. Day, 314 U. S. 556, 561 (1942), and
"whether it turns on issues of general or purely local law, we
can not surrender the duty to exercise our own judgment."
Appleby v. City of New York, 271 U. S. 364, 380 (1926). In
this case, however, we see no reason to disagree with the
Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion.

503us1$42z 11-13-95 22:38:39 PAGES OPINPGT
188 GENERAL MOTORS CORP. v. ROMEIN

Opinion of the Court
While it is true that the terms to which the contracting
parties give assent may be express or implied in their dealings, cf. Garrison v. City of New York, 21 Wall. 196, 203
(1875), the contracting parties here in no way manifested assent to limiting disability payments in accordance with the
1981 law allowing coordination of benefits. The employment
contracts at issue were formed before the 1981 law allowing
coordination of benefits came into effect. Thus, there was
no occasion for the parties to consider in bargaining the question raised here: whether an unanticipated reduction in benefits could later be restored after the "benefit period" had
closed.

Petitioners argue that their right to rely on past payment
periods as "closed" is a contractual term "incorporated" by
law into the employment contracts, regardless of the assent,
express or implied, of the parties. While petitioners cite
passages from our prior decisions that " `the laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract . . .
enter into and form a part of it,' " Home Building & Loan
Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 429-430 (1934) (quoting Von
Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550 (1867)), that
principle has no application here, since petitioners have not
shown that the alleged right to rely on past payment periods
as closed was part of Michigan law at the time of the original
contract. Though Michigan courts, in awarding interest on
unpaid workers' compensation awards, had held that such
awards were more analogous to contractual damages than
tort damages, see, e. g., Wilson v. Doehler-Jarvis Division
of National Lead Co., 358 Mich. 510, 517-519, 100 N. W. 2d
226, 229-230 (1960); Brown v. Eller Outdoor Advertising Co.,
139 Mich. App. 7, 14, 360 N. W. 2d 322, 326 (1984), Michigan
law does not explicitly imply a contractual term allowing an
employer to depend on the closure of past disability compensation periods. Moreover, such right does not appear to be
so central to the bargained-for exchange between the par503us1$42z 11-13-95 22:38:39 PAGES OPINPGT

189Cite as: 503 U. S. 181 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
ties, or to the enforceability of the contract as a whole, thatit must be deemed to be a term of the contract.

Contrary to petitioners' suggestion, we have not held thatall state regulations are implied terms of every contract entered into while they are effective, especially when the regulations themselves cannot be fairly interpreted to requiresuch incorporation. For the most part, state laws are implied into private contracts regardless of the assent of theparties only when those laws affect the validity, construction,
and enforcement of contracts. See United States Trust Co.
of N. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 19, n. 17 (1977).

While it is somewhat misleading to characterize laws affecting the enforceability of contracts as "incorporated
terms" of a contract, see 3 A. Corbin, Contracts $ 551,
pp. 199-200 (1960), these laws are subject to Contract Clause
analysis because without them, contracts are reduced to simple, unenforceable promises. "The obligation of a contract
consists in its binding force on the party who makes it. This
depends on the laws in existence when it is made; these are
necessarily referred to in all contracts, and forming a part
of them as the measure of the obligation to perform them by
the one party, and the right acquired by the other. . . . If any
subsequent law affect to diminish the duty, or to impair the
right, it necessarily bears on the obligation of the contract."
McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608, 612 (1844). See also
Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, supra. A change in the
remedies available under a contract, for example, may convert an agreement enforceable at law into a mere promise,
thereby impairing the contract's obligatory force. See
Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 197-198 (1819); Edwards v. Kearzey, 96 U. S. 595, 601 (1878). For this reason,
changes in the laws that make a contract legally enforceable
may trigger Contract Clause scrutiny if they impair the obligation of pre-existing contracts, even if they do not alter any
of the contracts' bargained-for terms. See, e. g., Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, supra (repeal of tax designed to

Opinion of the Court
repay bond issue); Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 316 (1843)(law limiting foreclosure rights); McCracken, supra, at 611-

614 (same).The 1987 statute did not change the legal enforceability of
the employment contracts here. The parties still have thesame ability to enforce the bargained-for terms of the employment contracts that they did before the 1987 statute wasenacted. Moreover, petitioners' suggestion that we should
read every workplace regulation into the private contractualarrangements of employers and employees would expand the
definition of contract so far that the constitutional provisionwould lose its anchoring purpose,

i. e., "enabl[ing] individualsto order their personal and business affairs according to their

particular needs and interests." Allied Structural Steel,438 U. S., at 245. Instead, the Clause would protect against
all changes in legislation, regardless of the effect of thosechanges on bargained-for agreements. The employment
contract, in petitioners' view, could incorporate workplacesafety regulations, employment tax obligations, and laws
prohibiting workplace discrimination, even if these laws arenot intended to affect private contracts and are not subject
to bargaining between the employer and employees. More-over, petitioners' construction would severely limit the ability of state legislatures to amend their regulatory legislation.Amendments could not take effect until all existing contracts
expired, and parties could evade regulation by entering intolong-term contracts. The ultimate irony of petitioners' proposed principle is that, taken to an extreme, it would renderthe Contract Clause itself entirely dependent on state law.
As Justice Story pointed out:

"It has been contended, by some learned minds, that themunicipal law of a place where a contract is made forms

a part of it, and travels with it, wherever the parties toit may be found. If this were admitted to be true, the
consequence would be, that all the existing laws of aState, being incorporated into the contract, would con503us1$42z 11-13-95 22:38:39 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
stitute a part of its stipulations . . . . If, therefore, thelegislature should provide, by a law, that all contracts

thereafter made should be subject to the entire controlof the legislature, as to their obligation, validity, and execution, whatever might be their terms, they would becompletely within the legislative power, and might be
impaired or extinguished by future laws; thus having acomplete

ex post facto operation." 2 J. Story, Commen-taries on the Constitution of the United States $ 1383,

pp. 252-253 (5th ed. 1891).

III
Petitioners also contend that the 1987 statute violated dueprocess because its retroactive provisions unreasonably interfered with closed transactions. Retroactive legislationpresents problems of unfairness that are more serious than
those posed by prospective legislation, because it can deprivecitizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions. For this reason, "[t]he retroactive aspects of [eco-nomic] legislation, as well as the prospective aspects, must
meet the test of due process": a legitimate legislative pur-pose furthered by rational means. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 730(1984).

The statute in this case meets that standard. The pur-pose of the 1987 statute was to correct the unexpected results of the Michigan Supreme Court's Chambers opinion.The retroactive repayment provision of the 1987 statute was
a rational means of meeting this legitimate objective: It pre-served the delicate legislative compromise that had been
struck by the 1980 and 1981 laws--giving workers injuredbefore 1982 their full benefits without coordination, but not
the greater increases given to subsequently injured workers.Also, it equalized the payments made by employers who had
gambled on the Chambers decision with those made by em-ployers who had not. Cf. United States v. Sperry Corp., 493

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 52, 64-65 (1989) (legitimate to legislate retrospectivelyin order to ensure that similarly situated persons bear similar financial burdens of program).In sum, petitioners knew they were taking a risk in reducing benefits to their workers, but they took their chanceswith their interpretation of the 1981 law. Having now lost
the battle in the Michigan Legislature, petitioners wishedto continue the war in court. Losing a political skirmish,
however, in itself creates no ground for constitutional relief.

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 90-6297. Argued November 6, 1991--Decided March 9, 1992
Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the United States Sentencing

Commission has promulgated Guidelines establishing sentencing ranges
for different categories of federal offenses and defendants. The Act
allows a district court to depart from a guideline range under certain
circumstances, 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b), and provides for limited appellate
review of sentences, requiring a remand for resentencing if a sentence
(1) was imposed in violation of law or "as a result of an incorrect application" of the Guidelines, $ 3742(f)(1), or (2) is an unreasonable departure
from the applicable guideline range, $ 3742(f)(2). Petitioner Williams
was convicted in the Federal District Court of possession of a firearm
by a convicted felon. The applicable sentencing range for someone in
his criminal history category and at his offense level is 18 to 24 months.
However, the District Court departed upward from that range and sentenced him to 27 months' imprisonment, determining that his criminal
history category was inadequate because it did not include two convictions that were too old to be counted in the Guidelines' criminal history
calculation and because it did not reflect several prior arrests. The
Court of Appeals agreed that the convictions were reliable information
indicating more extensive criminal conduct than was reflected by Williams' criminal history category, but it rejected the District Court's reliance upon the prior arrests, finding that the Guidelines prohibit a court
from basing a departure on a prior arrest record alone and that the
District Court had not adequately explained the factual basis for its use
of those arrests as a ground for departure. Although the District Court
had used both proper and improper factors to justify departure, the
Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence on the ground that it was reasonable in light of the proper factors standing alone.

Held:

1. A reviewing court may, in appropriate circumstances, affirm a sentence in which a district court's departure from a guideline range is
based on both valid and invalid factors. Pp. 197-202.

(a) Construing the plain language of the Guidelines and the Act, it
is an incorrect application of the Guidelines for a district court to depart
from the applicable sentencing range based on a factor that the Commission has already fully considered in establishing a guideline range or, as

503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT
194 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
in this case, on a factor that the Commission has expressly rejected as
a ground for departure. An "incorrect application of the sentencing
guidelines" occurs when the departure ground is prohibited either by
the Guidelines or by general policy statements regarding the Guidelines'
application, which the Commission is also authorized to promulgate, 28
U. S. C. $ 994(a)(2). A policy statement is an authoritative guide to the
meaning of the applicable Guideline, and an error in the statement's
interpretation could lead to an incorrect determination that departure
was appropriate. Pp. 199-201.

(b) When a district court relies upon an improper ground in departing from a guideline range, a reviewing court may not affirm a sentence
based solely on its independent assessment that the departure is reasonable under $ 3742(f)(2). In order to give full effect to both $ 3742(f)(1)
and $ 3742(f)(2), the reviewing court must conduct separate inquiries
under each provision to determine whether a remand is required. It
may not focus on one provision to the exclusion of the other.
Pp. 201-202.

(c) Williams' argument that a remand is automatically required
under $ 3742(f)(1) in order to rectify any "incorrect application" of the
Guidelines is rejected. A remand is required only if a sentence is "imposed as a result of an incorrect application" of the Guidelines, i. e., if
the sentence would have been different but for the district court's error.
The party challenging the sentence bears the initial burden of showing
that the district court relied upon an invalid factor at sentencing, but
not the burden of proving that the invalid factor was determinative in
the sentencing decision. Rather, once the court of appeals finds that
the district court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate
unless the reviewing court determines that the error was harmless.
Pp. 202-203.

(d) If the court of appeals determines that a remand is not required
under $ 3742(f)(1), it may affirm the sentence as long as it is also satisfied
that the departure is reasonable under $ 3742(f)(2). The reasonableness
determination looks to the amount and extent of the departure in light
of the grounds for departing. In assessing reasonableness, a court must
examine the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence under the
Guidelines and the district court's stated reasons for the sentence's imposition. $ 3742(e). A sentence can be "reasonable" even if some of the
district court's reasons justifying departure are invalid, provided the
remaining reasons are sufficient to justify the departure's magnitude.
Pp. 203-204.

(e) The limited appellate review of sentencing decisions does not
alter the traditional deference a court of appeals owes to a district
court's exercise of its sentencing discretion, and the selection of the ap503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT

195Cite as: 503 U. S. 193 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
propriate sentence from within the guideline range and the decision to
depart from that range are left solely to the sentencing court. Thus,
when only some of the district court's reasons for departure are invalid,
an appellate court may not affirm a sentence on the ground that the
district court could have based its departure on the remaining factors,
since the district court, once apprised of the errors in its interpretation
of the Guidelines, may have chosen a different sentence. Pp. 204-205.

2. This Court declines to review the Court of Appeals' determination
regarding the reliability of Williams' outdated convictions, because the
propriety of the District Court's consideration of nonsimilar outdated
convictions was not clearly presented in the petition for certiorari and
was not briefed by either party. Pp. 205-206.

3. The case is remanded for a determination whether the sentence
was imposed "as a result of" the District Court's erroneous consideration of Williams' prior arrests, since it cannot be ascertained whether
the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court would have imposed the same sentence even without relying upon Williams' prior arrest record or whether it affirmed simply on the basis that the sentence
was reasonable under $ 3742(f)(2). P. 206.

Petitioner Joseph Williams, a previously convicted felon,
was the subject of an investigation conducted by the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 1988 and 1989. He was
indicted and convicted after a jury trial in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin for possession of a firearm while a convicted felon in violation of 18
U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1).

The presentence report assigned Williams a criminal history category of V. App. 48. Combined with an offense
level of 9, the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines was 18 to 24 months. Ibid. The District Court departed upward from this range pursuant to $ 4A1.3 of the
Guidelines Manual, which allows a district court to increase
a criminal history classification if "reliable information" indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately
reflect the seriousness of the defendant's criminal background or propensity for future criminal conduct. United
States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 4A1.3,
p. s. (Nov. 1991) (USSG). The District Court determined
that Williams' criminal history category was inadequate because it did not include two convictions that were too old to
be counted in the Guidelines' criminal history calculation, see

$ 4A1.2(e)(1), and because it did not reflect several prior arrests. App. 53-54. Citing these two factors, the court
looked to the next highest criminal history category, for

Opinion of the Court
which the guideline range was 21 to 27 months. Id., at 53-
54. The court then sentenced Williams to 27 months' imprisonment and explained that it was selecting a sentence at
the high end of the guideline range because Williams had
previously been convicted for the same offense and because
he had threatened an undercover agent in this case. Id.,
at 55-56.1

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the conviction and the sentence. 910 F. 2d 1574
(1990). It agreed with the District Court that, under the
circumstances of this case, the two outdated convictions were
"reliable information" indicating more extensive criminal
conduct than was reflected by Williams' criminal history
category. Id., at 1579. It rejected, however, the District
Court's reliance upon Williams' prior arrests not resulting in
prosecution. Although the Guidelines allow a court to consider "prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a
criminal conviction" in determining whether a departure is
warranted, they prohibit a court from basing a departure on
a prior arrest record alone. USSG $ 4A1.3, p. s. The Court
of Appeals asserted that "the determination that the arrests
indicated similar criminal conduct must be based on facts
apart from the arrest record itself," 910 F. 2d, at 1580, and
held that the District Court had not adequately explained
the factual basis for its use of Williams' prior arrests as a
ground for departure. Ibid.

Although it invalidated one of the two grounds mentioned
by the District Court in its decision to depart, the Court of
Appeals nevertheless affirmed Williams' sentence. It relied
upon the Seventh Circuit precedent of United States v.
Franklin, 902 F. 2d 501 (CA7), cert. denied sub nom. Mann

1 Our reading of the sentencing transcript thus does not accord with the
dissent's understanding that the District Court also considered Williams'
prior conviction for the same offense in its decision to depart. See post,

to justify a departure, the sentence can be affirmed if it isreasonable in light of the proper factors standing alone. 902

properly in the criminal history category and that the rele-vant evidence justified the rather modest increase in sentence." 910 F. 2d, at 1580.We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 918 (1991), to resolve a

incorrect application of the Guidelines, or if the district courtdeparted downward from the guideline range. $ 3742(b).

For both types of appeal, $ 3742(f) delineates the followingnarrow scope of review:

"If the court of appeals determines that the sentence--"(1) was imposed in violation of law or imposed as a
result of an incorrect application of the sentencingguidelines, the court shall remand the case for further
sentencing proceedings with such instructions as thecourt considers appropriate;

"(2) is outside the applicable guideline range and isunreasonable or was imposed for an offense for which
there is no applicable sentencing guideline and is plainlyunreasonable, it shall state specific reasons for its conclusions and--
"(A) if it determines that the sentence is too high andthe appeal has been filed [by the defendant], it shall set

aside the sentence and remand the case for further sen-tencing proceedings with such instructions as the court

appeal has been filed [by the Government], it shall setaside the sentence and remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the courtconsiders appropriate;

A
In the case before us, Williams urges that the District
Court's use of his arrest record as a ground for departurewas a misapplication of the Guidelines and that the "incor503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
rect application" standard of $ 3742(f )(1) means that once adeparture ground is invalidated, a remand is always in order.

The Government does not dispute that a district court's reli-ance upon an invalid factor in departing from the guideline
sentencing range is appropriately characterized as an "incorrect application" of the Guidelines, but contends that a re-mand is only required when the error was determinative in

the decision to depart.We agree with both parties that a sentencing court's use
of an invalid departure ground is an incorrect application ofthe Guidelines. The Guidelines echo the Act's instruction
that a district court may depart from the applicable guideline
range only when it finds an aggravating or mitigating circumstance " `not adequately taken into consideration by
the Sentencing Commission' " in formulating the Guidelines.
USSG $ 1A4(b), p. s., $ 5K2.0, p. s. (both quoting 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(b)). Construing the plain language of the Guidelines
Manual and the governing statute, we conclude that it is an
incorrect application of the Guidelines for a district court to
depart from the applicable sentencing range based on a factor that the Commission has already fully considered in establishing the guideline range or, as in this case, on a factor
that the Commission has expressly rejected as an appropriate ground for departure.

Congress has defined "guidelines" as "the guidelines
promulgated by the commission pursuant to section 994(a)."
28 U. S. C. $ 998(c). Section 994(a) grants the Commission
the authority to promulgate both "guidelines," $ 994(a)(1),
and "general policy statements regarding application of the
guidelines," $ 994(a)(2). The dissent draws a distinction between the "actual" guidelines and the policy statements that
"interpre[t]" and "explai[n]" them; in the dissent's view, only
the former can be incorrectly applied within the meaning
of 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f )(1). Post, at 211-212. But to say
that guidelines are distinct from policy statements is not to
say that their meaning is unaffected by policy statements.

Opinion of the Court
Where, as here, a policy statement prohibits a district courtfrom taking a specified action, the statement is an authoritative guide to the meaning of the applicable Guideline. Anerror in interpreting such a policy statement could lead to
an incorrect determination that a departure was appropriate.In that event, the resulting sentence would be one that was
"imposed as a result of an incorrect application of thesentencing guidelines" within the meaning of $ 3742(f)(1).

2

Similarly, an erroneous calculation under the SentencingTable, from which all Guidelines sentencing ranges are derived, could properly be reviewed as an "incorrect applica-tion of the sentencing guidelines" under $ 3742(f )(1) even
though the Table itself is not officially designated as a"guideline." See USSG ch. 5, pt. A.

Because use of a departure ground prohibited by a policystatement can be an "incorrect application" of the Guidelines
under $ 3742(f )(1), we also agree with both Williams and theGovernment that, when a district court relies upon an improper ground in departing from the guideline range, a re-viewing court may not affirm a sentence based solely on
its independent assessment that the departure is reason-able under $ 3742(f)(2). Section 3742(f) specifies two circum2 The dissent states that an error in interpreting a policy statement governing departures "is not, in itself, subject to appellate review." Post, at
212. The dissent believes that all departure decisions must be reviewed
under the "reasonableness" standard of $ 3742(f)(2) and that the "reasonableness" determination includes an assessment of whether the district
court properly found an " `aggravating or mitigating circumstance . . . not
adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in
formulating the guidelines.' " Post, at 218 (quoting 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b)).
But, in determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken into
consideration, a court must consider "the sentencing guidelines, policy
statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission."

$ 3553(b). Thus, the dissent would appear to agree that an appellate court
can review the validity of a district court's reasons for departure for consistency with the Commission's policy statements; it simply considers that
inquiry to go to the "reasonableness" of the decision to depart rather than
to the correct application of the Guidelines.

Opinion of the Court
stances in which a court of appeals must remand for resen-tencing: if the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines or if the sentence is anunreasonable departure from the applicable guideline range.
The statute does not allow a court to focus on one remand
provision to the exclusion of the other.We do not believe that the dissent's contrary conclusion is

supported by declarations from Congress and the SentencingCommission which state that departure sentences are reviewable under $ 3742(f)(2). Post, at 209-210, 212-213. Weare unable to find any indication in those statements that
departures from the Guidelines are to be reviewed exclusively under $ 3742(f )(2). Thus, we believe that, while departure decisions are properly reviewed under $ 3742(f)(2),
they are also properly reviewed under $ 3742(f)(1) when they
are the result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines
(considered in light of the relevant policy statements) that
govern departure decisions. In order to give full effect to
both provisions, therefore, the reviewing court is obliged to
conduct two separate inquiries. First, was the sentence imposed either in violation of law or as a result of an incorrect
application of the Guidelines? If so, a remand is required
under $ 3742(f )(1). If the court concludes that the departure
is not the result of an error in interpreting the Guidelines,
it should proceed to the second step: is the resulting sentence an unreasonably high or low departure from the relevant guideline range? If so, a remand is required under

$ 3742(f)(2).

Williams argues further that whenever a court of appeals
finds that a district court considered an erroneous factor
in sentencing, a remand is automatically required under

$ 3742(f)(1) in order to rectify an "incorrect application" of
the Guidelines. We disagree. Section 3742(f)(1) does not
call for a remand every time a sentencing court might misapply a provision of the Guidelines; rather, remand is required
only if the sentence was "imposed as a result of an incorrect

Opinion of the Court
application" of the Guidelines. When a district court hasnot intended to depart from the Guidelines, a sentence is

imposed "as a result of " an incorrect application of theGuidelines when the error results in the district court selecting a sentence from the wrong guideline range. When a dis-trict court has intended to depart from the guideline range,
a sentence is imposed "as a result of " a misapplication of theGuidelines if the sentence would have been different but
for the district court's error. Accordingly, in determiningwhether a remand is required under $ 3742(f )(1), a court of
appeals must decide whether the district court would haveimposed the same sentence had it not relied upon the invalid
factor or factors.We conclude that the party challenging the sentence on
appeal, although it bears the initial burden of showing thatthe district court relied upon an invalid factor at sentencing,
does not have the additional burden of proving that the in-valid factor was determinative in the sentencing decision.
Rather, once the court of appeals has decided that the dis-trict court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record asa whole, that the error was harmless,

i. e., that the error didnot affect the district court's selection of the sentence imposed. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a).

B
If the party defending the sentence persuades the court ofappeals that the district court would have imposed the same

sentence absent the erroneous factor, then a remand is notrequired under $ 3742(f )(1), and the court of appeals may affirm the sentence as long as it is also satisfied that the depar-ture is reasonable under $ 3742(f)(2). The reasonableness
determination looks to the amount and extent of the depar-ture in light of the grounds for departing. In assessing reasonableness under $ 3742(f )(2), the Act directs a court of ap-peals to examine the factors to be considered in imposing a

Opinion of the Court
sentence under the Guidelines, as well as the district court'sstated reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence.

$ 3742(e). A sentence thus can be "reasonable" even if someof the reasons given by the district court to justify the departure from the presumptive guideline range are invalid, pro-vided that the remaining reasons are sufficient to justify the
magnitude of the departure.

C
The dissent interprets the "reasonableness" standard of$ 3742(f)(2) to be the sole provision governing appellate review of departure decisions. The dissent also posits a two-step test of reasonableness: the appellate court must determine the reasonableness of the district court's decision todepart based on the court's stated reasons for departure,
post, at 218, and the appellate court must determine the rea-sonableness of the amount or extent of departure,

post, at218-220. This is similar to our two-step inquiry, see supra,

at 201-202, for determining when a remand is required. Thedissent thus agrees that "[w]here all the reasons enunciated
by the district court to support departure are found to beinvalid," the appellate court "must set aside the sentence and
remand the case," post, at 218, although it would find such aremand necessary because "the departure is

per se unreason-able," ibid., and not because it was imposed "as a result of "

an incorrect application of the Guidelines. When some butnot all of the district court's reasons for departure are invalid, however, the dissent's position requires the appellatecourt to consider whether the district court could have based
its departure on the remaining factors, post, at 219, and notwhether it

would still have chosen so to act, supra, at 203.In practical effect, therefore, the divergence of the dissent's interpretation of the statute from our own is in thedegree of an appellate court's authority to affirm a sentence
when the district court, once made aware of the errors in itsinterpretation of the Guidelines, may have chosen a different

Opinion of the Court
sentence. Although the Act established a limited appellate
review of sentencing decisions, it did not alter a court of
appeals' traditional deference to a district court's exercise of
its sentencing discretion. The selection of the appropriate
sentence from within the guideline range, as well as the decision to depart from the range in certain circumstances, are
decisions that are left solely to the sentencing court. USSG

$ 5K2.0, p. s. The development of the guideline sentencing
regime has not changed our view that, except to the extent
specifically directed by statute, "it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence."
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290, n. 16 (1983).

Significantly, Congress amended the Act in 1986 to delete
certain provisions that authorized an appellate court to correct a sentence determined to have been imposed as a result
of an incorrect application of the Guidelines. See Criminal
Law and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, $ 73,
100 Stat. 3617. That action confirms our belief that it is the
prerogative of the district court, not the court of appeals, to
determine, in the first instance, the sentence that should be
imposed in light of certain factors properly considered under
the Guidelines.

A

At oral argument in this Court, petitioner's counsel contended that both of the District Court's stated grounds for
departure were invalid and therefore that Williams' sentence
must have resulted from an incorrect application of the
Guidelines. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42-43. Counsel argued that
not only was it improper for the District Court to rely upon
Williams' prior arrest record, but also that the Guidelines
prevented the court from considering convictions more than
15 years old. Id., at 43. The Guidelines explicitly authorize

206 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
a district court to base a departure on outdated convictionsthat are "evidence of similar misconduct," see USSG $ 4A1.2,

comment., n. 8, but the Circuits are divided as to whether,by implication, they prohibit a departure based on nonsimilar outdated convictions. Compare, e. g., United States v.
Aymelek, 926 F. 2d 64, 72-73 (CA1 1991) (nonsimilar out-dated convictions may be appropriate grounds for departure); United States v. Russell, 905 F. 2d 1439, 1444 (CA101990) (same), with United States v. Leake, 908 F. 2d 550, 554
(CA9 1990) (upward departure can never be based on non-similar outdated convictions). In this case, the propriety of
the District Court's consideration of Williams' nonsimilaroutdated convictions was not clearly presented in the petition for certiorari and was not briefed by either party. Ac-cordingly, we decline to review the Court of Appeals' determination that Williams' outdated convictions were reliableinformation that his criminal history category understated
the extent of his criminal background. See 910 F. 2d, at1578-1579.

B
The Court of Appeals was obliged to review, under bothremand provisions of $ 3742(f ), a departure from the guideline range in which it found one of the two stated groundsfor departure to be valid and the other to be invalid. We
are unable to ascertain from its opinion whether the Court
of Appeals concluded that the District Court would haveimposed the same sentence even without relying upon

Williams' prior arrest record, see $ 3742(f)(1), or whether itaffirmed simply on the basis that the sentence was reasonable under $ 3742(f )(2). We therefore vacate the judgment
below affirming Williams' sentence, and remand the case fora determination whether the sentence was imposed "as a result of " the District Court's erroneous consideration of hisprior arrests not resulting in prosecution.

It is so ordered.

district court when departing from the applicable guidelinerange.

6 Indeed, the majority--as well as both parties in

their briefs on the merits and in response to our requestfor supplemental briefing--fails to define what the phrase

"incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines" means.Absent such understanding, it is impossible to apply these
appellate review provisions with any hope of meeting Con-gress' intent.

We deal here with a faulty interpretation of a policy state-ment, USSG $ 4A1.3, p. s., by the District Court when deciding to depart from the otherwise applicable guideline range.Policy statements, however, even though contained in the
Guidelines Manual, are not "guidelines" as referred to in$ 3742(e)(2) and defined in the Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 998(c), as "the
guidelines promulgated by the Commission pursuant tosection 994(a)." Congress has clearly distinguished between
Guidelines and policy statements. The former are "for useof a sentencing court in determining the sentence to be imposed in a criminal case." $ 994(a)(1). The latter are simply instructions "regarding application of the guidelines orany other aspect of sentencing or sentence implementation"

furthering the purposes of the Act. $ 994(a)(2). Only theGuidelines promulgated pursuant to $ 994(a)(1) play a direct

6 Commentary by the Chairman of the United States Sentencing Commission, Judge William Wilkins, Jr., of the Fourth Circuit, confirms this
approach. See Wilkins, Sentencing Reform and Appellate Review, 46
Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 429, 437-444 (1989). His discussion of appellate review of guideline departures focused on the recognition that "the language
of subsections 3742(e)(3) and (f)(2) . . . pertain[s] to consideration and disposition of a departure sentence appeal." Id., at 441. Indeed, the plain
language of the controlling statute so clearly dictated this approach that
his discussion nowhere even recognizes the possibility that subsections
(e)(2) and (f)(1) are implicated on the appellate review of a departure sentence. This view has carried the day in the Fourth Circuit. See United
States v. Summers, 893 F. 2d 63, 64-67 (1990) (opinion of Wilkins, J.).

role in the calculation of points pertaining to the offense leveland criminal history category reduced into the Sentencing

Table, USSG $ 5A, from which the applicable guideline rangeis drawn.

7 It follows that "application of the sentencing

guidelines" refers only to those Guidelines relevant to theconstruction of the applicable guideline range.

8

Even though policy statements are numbered and grouped
in the Guidelines Manual by means identical to actualGuidelines, see USSG $ 1B1.6, their purpose is limited to interpreting and explaining how to apply the Guidelines, and--significantly--"may provide guidance in assessing the reasonableness of any departure from the guidelines," $ 1B1.7.
While the district court must consider policy statements
when determining the appropriate sentence, see 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(a)(5), the Act's legislative history could not have been
more explicit that an error in their interpretation is not, in
itself, subject to appellate review:

"It should be noted that a sentence that is inconsistent
with the sentencing guidelines is subject to appellate review, while one that is consistent with guidelines but
inconsistent with the policy statements is not. This is
not intended to undermine the value of the policy statements. It is, instead, a recognition that the policy
statements may be more general in nature than the
guidelines and thus more difficult to use in determining
the right to appellate review." S. Rep. No. 98-225,

7 The interrelationship of subsections (a)(4), (b), and (c) of $ 3553 compels
this conclusion. See supra, at 207-208. For within these subsections, all
reference ultimately is to those actual Guidelines, as opposed to policy
statements, promulgated pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 994(a)(1).

8 The majority misinterprets this conclusion to be only that formally

designated Guidelines "can be incorrectly applied within the meaning of
18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f)(1)." Ante, at 200. What I plainly conclude, however,
is that only these Guidelines are part of the district court's calculus when
constructing the applicable guideline range, and it was to the propriety of
this construction that Congress addressed itself in $ 3742(e)(2).

The legislative history to 18 U. S. C. $ 3557 10 is equally clearin this regard:

"The provisions for appellate judicial review of sen-tences in section 3742 are designed to reduce materially
any remaining unwarranted disparities by giving theright to appeal a sentence outside the guidelines and by
providing a mechanism to assure that sentences insidethe guidelines are based on correct application of the
guidelines." S. Report 86 (emphasis added).
The majority of the Justices asserts that, because one ofthree reasons for the upward departure imposed here by the

District Court was invalid, an "incorrect application of the

9 The legislative history behind the nature, role, and purpose of the district court's statement pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(c) of its reasons for
imposing a particular sentence is similarly instructive:

"The statement of reasons for a sentence outside the guidelines is especially important. Under proposed 18 U. S. C. 3742, a defendant may appeal a sentence above the applicable guidelines, and the government may
appeal a sentence below the guidelines. If the appellate court finds that
a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable, the case may be remanded to the trial court for resentencing . . . . The statement of reasons
will play an important role in evaluation of the reasonableness of the
sentence. In fact, if the sentencing judge fails to give specific reasons for
a sentence outside the guidelines, the appellate court would be justified in
returning the case to the sentencing judge for such a statement.

"Sentences within the guidelines are subject to appeal under proposed
18 U. S. C. 3742 on grounds of illegality or an incorrect application of the
guidelines. As with sentences outside the guidelines, the statement of
reasons may play a role in the appellate court's decision on the legality of
sentences. The statement of reasons in cases claiming incorrect application of the guidelines will probably play only a minor role in the appellate
process because the sentencing court will be deciding factual issues concerning offense and offender characteristics which might not be discussed
in the statement of reasons." S. Report 80 (emphasis added).

sentencing guidelines" within the meaning of $ 3742(e)(2)took place in this case.

11 As I have explained, however, this

phrase refers only to the process by which the district courtdetermines the applicable range of sentences when applying

the "guidelines," as defined by 28 U. S. C. $ 998(c). The majority does not--and indeed can not--identify or claim thatany error in determining the guideline range under the

Guidelines is involved in this case. Instead, the majority
does no more than declare that invalidly finding an aggravat11 This confusion apparently stems from both parties' citation of United
States v. Hernandez-Vasquez, 884 F. 2d 1314 (CA9 1989) (per curiam), and
United States v. Zamarripa, 905 F. 2d 337 (CA10 1990), in support of the
proposition that, when one or more of the stated grounds for departure is
invalid, the case must be remanded for resentencing. Be that as it may,
neither case has concluded that the sentence should be treated as "an
incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines," within the meaning of

$ 3742(f)(1), when reviewing district court departures that rely on both
proper and improper grounds. Not only do neither of these cases so hold,
but neither case in any way purports to explain, much less cite, $ 3742.
Instead, both cases simply rely on United States v. Nuno-Para, 877 F. 2d
1409, 1412-1414 (CA9 1989), for the above proposition. Also in reliance on
Nuno-Para, Zamarripa added that the appellate court "cannot determine
whether the same departure would have resulted absent the improper
factor." 905 F. 2d, at 342. But Nuno-Para itself fails to cite, discuss, or
explain $ 3742. The Ninth Circuit there simply concluded that "we must
hold that the district court's departure was unreasonable because it improperly relied on factors already considered by the guidelines." 877 F.
2d, at 1414 (emphasis added). While such a construction of the review for
"reasonableness" is too limited, see infra, at 217-220, any such consideration on appeal is clearly taken under $ 3742(f)(2). Moreover, a close
study of the appellate review outlined by the Tenth Circuit in Zamarripa
reveals that it in fact generally conforms to the approach outlined by my
opinion here. See 905 F. 2d, at 339-340; see also United States v. White,
893 F. 2d 276, 277-278 (CA10 1990); United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874
F. 2d 43, 49 (CA1), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 862 (1989).

Consequently, no case has been brought to our attention that has considered reliance upon both proper and improper grounds for departure to be
"an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines" within the meaning
of $ 3742(f)(1). That the parties attempt to concede this point should not
prevent our own scrupulous reading of these statutes, lest we disturb Congress' intent, which I find to be clearly expressed.

ing circumstance not adequately taken into account by theSentencing Commission is an " `incorrect application' of the

Guidelines," while referring only to two policy statementscontained in the Guidelines Manual, see USSG $$ 1A4(b),
p. s., and 5K2.0, p. s., which, the majority says, do no more
than echo the statute.12 Ante, at 200. Since the policystatements referred to by the majority merely refer to the

statute, the majority's confusion about the distinction be-tween Guidelines and policy statements is without import.
But the majority concludes that the "Guidelines"--and wehave here at issue only a policy statement, USSG $ 4A1.3,
p. s.--qualify the propriety of basing a departure on arrestrecords, and that the District Court erred in relying on arrest records without further explanation. To the extentthat the majority equates the District Court's misinterpretation of this policy statement with a misapplication of the
Guidelines that must be dealt with under $ 3742(f )(1), it doesso erroneously. Such error by the District Court signifies

only an invalid grounds for departure, nothing more. Whilethe majority concludes that such a policy statement "prohibits a district court from taking a specified action" andthereby "is an authoritative guide to the meaning of the applicable Guideline," ante, at 201, it remains a fact that thisstatute does not permit appellate review for the mere misinterpretation of a policy statement, see supra, at 212-213.

Significantly, subsections (a) and (b) of $ 3742 do not au-thorize appeal of a sentence imposed within the guideline

range correctly determined under the Sentencing Guidelines.And if any alleged error is found to be without basis, the
appellate court "shall affirm the sentence." 18 U. S. C.

12 I point the majority to the language of one of the policy statements it
cites: USSG $ 1A.4(b), p. s. When discussing guided departures of the
type referred to in $ 4A1.3, p. s., the Sentencing Commission states that it
"intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions and that the
courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures `unreasonable'
where they fall outside suggested levels" (emphasis added).

$ 3742(f)(3). Thus, appellate review under $ 3742(f)(1) has a
much more focused inquiry than that given it by the majority. A sentence is imposed "as a result of " an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines when the error results
in a mistaken guideline range. When such an error is identified, remand is required.13 To obtain relief under subsection
(f )(1) insofar as it relates to a misapplication of the Guidelines, the appellant must demonstrate that an error has occurred that affects the applicable guideline range.14

13 Contrary to the majority's conclusion, ante, at 202-203, appellate
review of departure sentences under $ 3742 does not accommodate
"harmless-error" review. Subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2) both explicitly direct that, if appellate review discloses an error listed in subsection (e), the
court "shall" remand for resentencing. As originally enacted, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3742 would have authorized an appellate court to "correct the sentence"
determined to have been imposed in violation of law or as a result of
an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines. Pub. L. 98-473,

$ 213(a), 98 Stat. 2012. However, "[a]fter consideration, Congress determined that it was more appropriate for an appellate court to remand a
case for further sentencing proceedings in all instances in which the district court decision was reversed, thereby leaving imposition of the final
sentence to the district court." Wilkins, 46 Wash. & Lee L. Rev., at 433;
see Pub. L. 99-646, $ 73, 100 Stat. 3617. Deeming an error "harmless"
does not conform with the appellate court's mandate. See United States
v. Stephenson, 887 F. 2d 57, 62 (CA5 1989), cert. denied sub nom. Goff v.
United States, 493 U. S. 1086 (1990).

14 The unfortunate result of the majority's contrary conclusion, based as

it is on an unnatural reading of this statute, is that appellate review becomes a quite complicated exercise, one which will apparently involve
shifting "burdens" in the search for the subjective intent of the district
court to determine whether "the sentence would have been different but
for the district court's error." Ante, at 203. The baldness of this assertion is matched only by the total lack of guidance the majority provides
to control this inquiry, apart from its opaque instruction that the appellate
courts somehow "must decide whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it not relied upon the invalid factor or factors." Ibid. This will likely provide the fodder for later confusion and
conflict among the circuits, which I believe we could here avoid by a
straightforward reading of this statute.

Looking to this case, there is no question but that theDistrict Court correctly applied the relevant Guidelines

to derive the properly applicable guideline range. The"Guideline" Williams places at issue, USSG $ 4A1.3, p. s., is
specifically designated as a policy statement, dealing onlywith considerations of whether the criminal history category
calculated under the Guidelines was so inadequate as to war-rant a departure. This provision is solely to guide a district
court's discretion should it find departure from the Guide-lines appropriate. Because the District Court's error here
in construing this policy statement could in no way affect theapplicable guideline range, Williams is not entitled to relief
pursuant to subsections 3742(e)(2) and (f)(1).Accordingly, the only available appellate consideration
here is whether Williams' sentence "is outside the appli-cable guideline range and is unreasonable." 18 U. S. C.

$ 3742(f)(2). This inquiry is guided solely by $ 3742(e)(3),which states in full:

"(e) Consideration.--Upon review of the record, thecourt of appeals shall determine whether the sentence--

. . . . .
"(3) is outside the applicable guideline range, and isunreasonable, having regard for--

"(A) the factors to be considered in imposing a sen-tence, as set forth in chapter 227 of this title; and

provisions of section 3553(c) . . . ."
Subsection (e)(3)(A) in fact refers to $ 3553(a), designating"factors to be considered in imposing a sentence."

should be noted as well that the reasons to be assessed pur15 Briefly recited, these factors include, inter alia, the seriousness of

suant to subsection (e)(3)(B) arise directly from findings bythe district court that "there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequatelytaken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in
formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentencedifferent from that described [in the applicable guideline

support departure are found to be invalid, the departureis

per se unreasonable, as nothing supports it, and the appel-late court must set aside the sentence and remand the case,

after stating specific reasons for its conclusion. 18 U. S. C.$ 3742(f)(2). See n. 13,

supra. The reasonableness inquiryis more involved when only one of several reasons supporting

departure are found to be invalid. Not every circumstanceleft unconsidered by the Sentencing Commission warrants
departure. Indeed, $ 3553(b) requires a finding that theidentified circumstances "should result" in a sentence outside
the applicable guideline range.16 By law the Guidelines gen-erally provide a variance between the high and low ends of
the range by the greater of six months or 25%. 28 U. S. C.$ 994(b)(2). This provides both flexibility within the range
as well as a check on disparity. Whether a departure then"should result" depends on the factors listed in $ 3553(a) for
consideration when imposing the sentence in the first in-stance. These same factors control the inquiry into the pro16 The legislative history indicates that this language was intended to
emphasize that not every unaccounted-for circumstance is a basis for departure: "The provision recognizes . . . that even though the judge finds
an aggravating or mitigating circumstance in the case that was not adequately considered in the formulation of guidelines, the judge might conclude that the circumstance does not justify a sentence outside the guidelines. Instead, he might conclude that a sentence at the upper end of the
range in the guidelines for an aggravating circumstance, or at the lower
end of the range for a mitigating circumstance, was more appropriate or
that the circumstance should not affect the sentence at all." S. Report

priety of the nature and extent of any departure made. In
light of the surviving reasons enunciated by the district
court, the appellate court must determine for itself the
"reasonableness" of the departure under the factors to be
considered when imposing sentence.17 Subsection (a)(6)--
"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among
defendants with similar records who have been found guilty
of similar conduct"--takes on added significance in judging
the reasonableness of the extent of departure. Congress intended appellate review under the new sentencing regime to
guide and control the discretion long reposed in the district
courts towards the ultimate goal of sentencing reform: to
promote fairness and rationality, and to reduce unwarranted
disparity, in sentencing. S. Report 78, 150, 161; see also 28
U. S. C. $ 991(b)(1). The provisions of 18 U. S. C. $ 3742 establish the limited practice of appellate review which Congress deemed "essential to assure that the guidelines are ap17 The majority obliquely references Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290,
n. 16 (1983), and its broad statement that an appellate court should not
substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court. Ante, at 204-
205. Indeed, prior to the Sentencing Reform Act, appellate courts were
generally bound by the simple principle that sentences imposed by district
courts within legal limits should not be disturbed. Dorszynski v. United
States, 418 U. S. 424, 431 (1974); Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393
(1958). See S. Report 150. But that unquestioned deference evolved
from the near-absolute discretion vested in the district courts prior to
sentencing reform. Ibid. That discretion is now checked, however, and
appellate courts are presented a statement of reasons explaining its exercise. In the situation we face here, a district court has made clear its
conclusion that the applicable guideline range is inadequate. It is not a
substitution of judgment for the appellate court to determine whether the
district court's judgment remains valid. And in any event, this review of
"reasonableness" is precisely what Congress intends the appellate courts
to do. To the extent our decisions previously reigned in the scope of
appellate review, they must be loosened to conform to this new mandate.

plied properly and to provide case law development of the
appropriate reasons for sentencing outside the guidelines."
S. Report 151. Because the district court must state its reasons when departing, $ 3553(c)(2), and because the appellate
court must "state specific reasons" for concluding a departure sentence is unreasonable, $ 3742(f)(2), case law development will proceed apace, creating a ready benchmark by
which to determine whether the current offender has been
dealt a sentence disparate from similar criminals found
guilty of similar crimes.18 In sum, "while the reasonableness standard will be interpreted and defined by subsequent
case law, the incorporation into this standard of the section
3553(b) departure test and the section 3553(a) sentencing factors provides specific content that will permit a broader judicial inquiry than otherwise would be warranted by a bare
reasonableness standard alone." Wilkins, Sentencing Reform and Appellate Review, 46 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 429, 444
(1989) (footnote omitted).

In this case, the Seventh Circuit concluded that it was
error for the District Court to consider prior arrests not resulting in conviction because no reliable evidence of the conduct described in the arrest entries indicated a more severe
criminal history than the one provided by the Guidelines.
910 F. 2d 1574, 1580 (1990); see USSG $ 4A1.3, p. s. The
Court of Appeals correctly ruled, however, that "a sentence
nevertheless may be upheld if there are proper factors that,
standing alone, would justify the departure." 910 F. 2d, at
1580 (citing United States v. Franklin, 902 F. 2d 501, 508-509

18 The statements of reasons and development of case law will also permit the Sentencing Commission to "adequately consider" those factors
leading to departures, ultimately resulting in less need for departures
overall. See S. Report 151; USSG $ 1A4(b), p. s. ("By monitoring when
courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons
for doing so and court decisions with references thereto, the Commission,
over time, will be able to refine the guidelines to specify more precisely
when departures should and should not be permitted").

(CA7 1990)). The Court of Appeals noted that the DistrictCourt had also properly relied upon convictions more than

15 years old, as well as the fact that the petitioner had pre-viously been convicted of the same crime--felon in possession of a firearm.19 910 F. 2d, at 1580; see USSG $ 4A1.3,p. s.; United States v. Schmude, 901 F. 2d 555, 559 (CA7 1990).
The court found both reasons to support a finding that thecriminal history category did not adequately reflect the severity of petitioner's criminal past, and that his propensityfor violence was laid bare in this case by his threats to the
lives of the DEA agents and their families. 910 F. 2d, at1580. In conclusion, the Court of Appeals considered the 3-
month departure imposed by the District Court, and statedthat "despite the error noted, the court correctly determined
that Mr. Williams' criminality was not reflected properly inthe criminal history category and that the relevant evidence
justified the rather modest increase in sentence." Ibid.This appellate assessment of the validity of the sentence
imposed is sufficient. As previously stated by the SeventhCircuit in Franklin, it is not for the court on appeal "to
probe the mind of the sentencing judge and try to determinewhat portions of the departure he or she assigned to the
different grounds for departure." 902 F. 2d, at 508. In-stead, the appellate court must assess for itself whether valid
reasons stated by the district court justify the magnitude ofdeparture.

Id., at 509. This the Seventh Circuit did with-out error, and I would affirm its judgment.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

19 The majority suggests this latter factor only played a role in "selecting
a sentence at the high end of the guideline range" to which the District
Court was departing. See ante, at 197; App. 54-55. What must be kept
in mind, however, is that this was a departure sentence and, as recognized
by the Seventh Circuit here, the reasons articulated to justify a particular
sentence beyond the otherwise applicable guideline range are those supporting departure, as in this case, e. g., where "the criminal history category is inadequate." 910 F. 2d, at 1580.

STRINGER v. BLACK, COMMISSIONER, MISSISSIPPIDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 90-6616. Argued December 9, 1991--Decided March 9, 1992
After finding petitioner Stringer guilty of capital murder, a Mississippi

jury, in the sentencing phase of the case, found that there were three
statutory aggravating factors. These included the factor the murder
was "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel," which had not been otherwise defined in the trial court's instructions. Stringer was sentenced
to death, the sentence was affirmed by the State Supreme Court on
direct review, and postconviction relief was denied in the state courts.
The Federal District Court then denied Stringer habeas corpus relief,
rejecting his contention that the "heinous, atrocious or cruel" aggravating factor was so vague as to render the sentence arbitrary, in violation
of the Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishment. The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed, holding that Stringer
was not entitled to rely on Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, or
Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, in his habeas corpus proceedings
because those decisions, which were issued after his sentence became
final, announced a "new rule" as defined in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288.

Held: In a federal habeas corpus proceeding, a petitioner whose death

sentence became final before Maynard and Clemons were decided is
not foreclosed by Teague from relying on those cases. Pp. 227-237.

(a) When a petitioner seeks federal habeas relief based on a principle
announced after a final judgment, Teague requires a federal court to
determine, first, whether the decision in question announced a new rule,
i. e., was not dictated by precedent existing when the judgment became
final. If the answer is yes and neither of two exceptions apply, the
decision is not available to the petitioner. Second, if the decision did
not announce a new rule, it is necessary to inquire whether granting the
relief sought would create a new rule because the prior decision is applied in a novel setting, thereby extending the precedent. See Butler
v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 414-415. Pp. 227-228.

(b) For purposes of Teague, Maynard did not announce a new rule.
Its invalidation of Oklahoma's "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"
aggravating circumstance was controlled by Godfrey v. Georgia, 446
U. S. 420, in which the Court held that Georgia's aggravating circumstance that the killing was "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and

inhuman" was vague and imprecise, inviting arbitrary and capricious
application of the death penalty in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
Pp. 228-229.

(c) This Court rejects the State's contention that, at the time Stringer's conviction became final and before Clemons, it would have been a
new rule to apply the Godfrey and Maynard holdings to the Mississippi
sentencing system because of differences between the use of aggravating factors in that system and their use in the Georgia system in Godfrey. The principal--and critical--difference between the two schemes
is that Mississippi, unlike Georgia, is a "weighing" State, in which a jury
that has found a defendant guilty of capital murder and found at least
one statutory aggravating factor must weigh such factors against the
mitigating evidence. Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 890, expressly left
open the possibility that in a weighing State infection of the process
with an invalid aggravating factor might require invalidation of the
death sentence. Although Clemons later held that the appellate court
in such a case could reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances or undertake harmless-error analysis, this Court has not suggested that the Eighth Amendment permits a weighing-state appellate
court to affirm a death sentence without a thorough analysis of the role
an invalid aggravating factor played in the sentencing process, but has
required such courts to implement the well-established requirement of
individualized sentencing determinations in death penalty cases, see,
e. g., Zant, supra, at 879. In a nonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it
also finds an invalid factor does not infect the formal process of deciding
whether death is appropriate. But when the sentencing body is told to
weigh an invalid factor in its decision, the weighing process itself has
been skewed. Thus, the fact that Mississippi is a weighing State only
gives emphasis to the requirement that aggravating factors be defined
with some degree of precision and underscores the applicability of Godfrey and Maynard to the Mississippi system. Pp. 229-232.

(d) Moreover, precedent existing at the time Stringer's sentence became final defeats the State's contention that before Clemons it was
reasonable to believe that there was no constitutional requirement to
define aggravating factors with precision in the Mississippi system.
Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, distinguished. It is important that
the Mississippi Supreme Court, the final authority on the meaning of
Mississippi law, has at all times viewed the State's capital sentencing
scheme as subject to Godfrey's dictates. See, e. g., Gilliard v. State,
428 So. 2d 576. The correctness of that view as a matter of federal law
is so evident that the issue was not even mentioned in Clemons, in
which the Court, unchallenged by the State, took for granted the propo503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
sition that if a State uses aggravating factors in deciding who shall be
eligible for, or receive, the death penalty, it cannot use factors which
as a practical matter fail to guide the sentencer's discretion. See 494
U. S., at 756, n. 1 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part). The fact that two pre-Clemons Fifth Circuit cases ruled Godfrey inapplicable to Mississippi is not dispositive, since those cases ignored the State Supreme Court's own characterization of its law and
accorded no significance to the centrality of aggravating factors in the
weighing phase of a Mississippi capital sentencing proceeding, and were
therefore seriously mistaken under precedents existing even before
Maynard and Clemons. Pp. 232-237.

either Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988), or Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990). The petitioner argues that the State of Mississippi committed the same error
in his case as it did in Clemons, and that under both Maynard and Clemons his sentence is unconstitutional. The
question presented is whether in a federal habeas corpus
proceeding a petitioner is foreclosed from relying on Maynard and Clemons because either or both announced a new
rule as defined in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).

I
In June 1982, Ray McWilliams and his wife, Nell, were
shot to death in their Jackson, Mississippi, home as part of
an armed robbery. The petitioner James R. Stringer did not
fire the fatal shots, but he did plan the robbery and take part
in it. The killing was part of his plan from the outset. The
crimes, and their gruesome aspects, are described in the
opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court on direct review of
the conviction and sentence. Stringer v. State, 454 So. 2d
468, 471-473 (1984).

Under Mississippi law the death sentence may be imposed
for murders designated by statute as "capital murder."
Miss. Code Ann. $ 97-3-19(2) (Supp. 1991). A killing in the
course of a burglary or robbery is included within that category. Following a capital murder conviction, the jury in the
Mississippi system proceeds to the sentencing phase of the
case. For a defendant who has been convicted of capital
murder to receive the death sentence, the jury must find at
least one of eight statutory aggravating factors, and then it
must determine that the aggravating factor or factors are
not outweighed by the mitigating circumstances, if any.

$ 99-19-101.

The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder in the
course of a robbery. In the sentencing phase the jury found
that there were three statutory aggravating factors. The

503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT
226 STRINGER v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
aggravating factors as defined in the jury instructions, andfor the most part following the statutory wording, were:

"1. The Defendant contemplated that life would betaken and/or the capital murder was intentionally committed and that the Defendant was engaged in an at-tempt to commit a robbery; and was committed for pecuniary gain."2. The capital murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing the detection and lawfularrest of James R. Stringer, the Defendant.

"3. The capital murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel." Brief for Respondents 4.

The trial court in its instructions did not further define themeaning of the third factor.

On direct review the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed.
Stringer v. State, supra. With respect to the sentence, thecourt found it was not "imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor," id., at 478; "theevidence fully support[ed] the jury's finding of statutorily required aggravating circumstances," id., at 479; and the deathsentence was not disproportionate to sentences imposed in
other cases, ibid. Petitioner's conviction became final whenwe denied certiorari on February 19, 1985.

Stringer v. Mississippi, 469 U. S. 1230. Postconviction relief was denied
in the state courts. Stringer v. State, 485 So. 2d 274 (1986).This case comes to us from proceedings begun when petitioner filed his first federal habeas petition in the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The relevant claim is petitioner's contention that the
third aggravating factor found by the jury and considered in
the sentencing proceeding, the "heinous, atrocious or cruel"
aggravating factor, was so vague as to render the sentence
arbitrary, in violation of the Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishment. The District Court
found the claim subject to a procedural bar and, in the alter503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
native, ruled it had no merit. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675F. Supp. 356, 366 (1987).

Without consideration of the procedural bar question, theCourt of Appeals affirmed on the merits, finding no constitutional infirmity in the jury's consideration of the third aggra-vating factor because two other aggravating factors were unchallenged. Stringer v. Jackson, 862 F. 2d 1108 (CA5 1988).When the Court of Appeals affirmed, we had not decided
Clemons v. Mississippi, and we later vacated its opinion forfurther consideration. 494 U. S. 1074 (1990). On remand
the Court of Appeals held that petitioner was not entitled torely on

Clemons or the related case of Maynard v. Cartwright in his habeas corpus proceeding because those deci-sions announced a new rule after his sentence was final. 909

F. 2d 111 (1990). The court relied upon its earlier analysisin Smith v. Black, 904 F. 2d 950 (1990), cert. pending, No.
90-1164, a case that had also presented the question whetherClemons and Maynard announced a new rule. We granted
certiorari, 500 U. S. 915 (1991), and now reverse.

II
Subject to two exceptions, a case decided after a petition-er's conviction and sentence became final may not be the

predicate for federal habeas corpus relief unless the decisionwas dictated by precedent existing when the judgment in
question became final. Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407(1990); Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989); Teague v.
Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). As we explained in Butler, "[t]he`new rule' principle . . . validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts eventhough they are shown to be contrary to later decisions."
494 U. S., at 414. Neither one of the exceptions is at issuehere, so our inquiry is confined to the question whether
Clemons, Maynard, or both announced a new rule.When a petitioner seeks federal habeas relief based upon
a principle announced after a final judgment, Teague and our

503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT
228 STRINGER v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
subsequent decisions interpreting it require a federal courtto answer an initial question, and in some cases a second.

First, it must be determined whether the decision reliedupon announced a new rule. If the answer is yes and neither exception applies, the decision is not available to thepetitioner. If, however, the decision did not announce a new
rule, it is necessary to inquire whether granting the reliefsought would create a new rule because the prior decision is
applied in a novel setting, thereby extending the precedent.See

Butler v. McKellar, supra, at 414-415. The interests infinality, predictability, and comity underlying our new rule

jurisprudence may be undermined to an equal degree by theinvocation of a rule that was not dictated by precedent as by
the application of an old rule in a manner that was not dic-tated by precedent.

A
A determination whether Maynard and Clemons an-nounced a new rule must begin with Godfrey v. Georgia, 446

U. S. 420 (1980). In Godfrey we invalidated a death sen-tence based upon the aggravating circumstance that the killing was "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhu-man." Id., at 428-429. The formulation was deemed vague
and imprecise, inviting arbitrary and capricious applicationof the death penalty in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
We later applied the same analysis and reasoning in Maynard. In Maynard the aggravating circumstance under anOklahoma statute applied to a killing that was "especially

heinous, atrocious, or cruel." 486 U. S., at 359. We foundthe language gave no more guidance than did the statute in
Godfrey, and we invalidated the Oklahoma formulation. 486U. S., at 363-364.

In the case now before us Mississippi does not argue that
Maynard itself announced a new rule. To us this appears awise concession. Godfrey and Maynard did indeed involve

somewhat different language. But it would be a mistake toconclude that the vagueness ruling of Godfrey was limited

229Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
to the precise language before us in that case. In applyingGodfrey to the language before us in Maynard, we did not

"brea[k] new ground." Butler v. McKellar, supra, at 412.Maynard was, therefore, for purposes of Teague, controlled
by Godfrey, and it did not announce a new rule.

B
Of more substance is the State's contention that it was anew rule to apply the Godfrey and Maynard holdings to the

Mississippi sentencing process. The State argues this musthave been an open question when petitioner's sentence became final, with Clemons yet undecided. We acknowledgethere are differences in the use of aggravating factors under
the Mississippi capital sentencing system and their use inthe Georgia system in

Godfrey. In our view, however, thosedifferences could not have been considered a basis for denying relief in light of precedent existing at the time petition-er's sentence became final. Indeed, to the extent that the
differences are significant, they suggest that application ofthe Godfrey principle to the Mississippi sentencing process
follows, a fortiori, from its application to the Georgia system.

1
The principal difference between the sentencing schemesin Georgia and Mississippi is that Mississippi is what we have

termed a "weighing" State, while Georgia is not. See Clem-ons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S., at 745; Parker v. Dugger, 498
U. S. 308, 318 (1991). Under Mississippi law, after a jury hasfound a defendant guilty of capital murder and found the
existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, it mustweigh the aggravating factor or factors against the mitigating evidence. By contrast, in Georgia the jury must find theexistence of one aggravating factor before imposing the
death penalty, but aggravating factors as such have no spe-cific function in the jury's decision whether a defendant who
has been found to be eligible for the death penalty should

Opinion of the Court
receive it under all the circumstances of the case. Instead,under the Georgia scheme, " `[i]n making the decision as to

the penalty, the factfinder takes into consideration all cir-cumstances before it from both the guilt-innocence and the
sentence phases of the trial. These circumstances relate
both to the offense and the defendant.' " Zant v. Stephens,462 U. S. 862, 872 (1983) (quoting the response of the Georgia

Supreme Court to our certified question).That Mississippi is a weighing State only gives emphasis
to the requirement that aggravating factors be defined withsome degree of precision. By express language in

Zant we
left open the possibility that in a weighing State infection
of the process with an invalid aggravating factor might require invalidation of the death sentence. Id., at 890. Although we later held in Clemons v. Mississippi that under
such circumstances a state appellate court could reweigh
the aggravating and mitigating circumstances or undertake
harmless-error analysis, we have not suggested that the
Eighth Amendment permits the state appellate court in a
weighing State to affirm a death sentence without a thorough analysis of the role an invalid aggravating factor played
in the sentencing process.

We require close appellate scrutiny of the import and effect of invalid aggravating factors to implement the wellestablished Eighth Amendment requirement of individualized sentencing determinations in death penalty cases. See
Zant, supra, at 879; Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,
110-112 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 601-605 (1978)
(plurality opinion); Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U. S. 633, 636-
637 (1977); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 197 (1976) ( joint
opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); Woodson v.
North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 303-304 (1976) (plurality opinion). In order for a state appellate court to affirm a death
sentence after the sentencer was instructed to consider an
invalid factor, the court must determine what the sentencer
would have done absent the factor. Otherwise, the defend503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT

231Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
ant is deprived of the precision that individualized consider-ation demands under the

Godfrey and Maynard line of cases.
These principles of appellate review were illustrated byour decision in

Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939 (1983). Florida, like Mississippi, is a weighing State, Parker v. Dugger,
supra, at 318, and the trial judge imposes the sentence basedupon a recommendation from the jury. In

Barclay the sentencing judge relied on an aggravating factor that was not alegitimate one under state law. We affirmed the sentence,

but only because it was clear that the Florida Supreme Courthad determined that the sentence would have been the same
had the sentencing judge given no weight to the invalid factor. See 463 U. S., at 958 (plurality opinion); id., at 973-974
(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore, contrary
to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 245-247, the fact that
both principal opinions in Barclay focused on the weight the
sentencer gave to an invalid aggravating factor demonstrates that a reviewing court in a weighing State may not
make the automatic assumption that such a factor has not
infected the weighing process. In short, it may not make
the automatic assumption that Stringer claims the Mississippi Supreme Court made in this case.

In view of the well-established general requirement of individualized sentencing and the more specific requirement
that a sentence based on an improper factor be reassessed
with care to assure that proper consideration was given,
there was no arguable basis to support the view of the Court
of Appeals that at the time petitioner's sentence became final
the Mississippi Supreme Court was permitted to apply a rule
of automatic affirmance to any death sentence supported by
multiple aggravating factors, when one is invalid.

With respect to the function of a state reviewing court in
determining whether the sentence can be upheld despite the
use of an improper aggravating factor, the difference between a weighing State and a nonweighing State is not one
of "semantics," as the Court of Appeals thought, Stringer v.

503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT
232 STRINGER v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
Jackson, 862 F. 2d, at 1115, but of critical importance. In anonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds at

least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also findsan invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty. As-suming a determination by the state appellate court that the
invalid factor would not have made a difference to the jury'sdetermination, there is no constitutional violation resulting
from the introduction of the invalid factor in an earlier stageof the proceedings. But when the sentencing body is told to
weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court maynot assume it would have made no difference if the thumb
had been removed from death's side of the scale. When theweighing process itself has been skewed, only constitutional
harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appel-late level suffices to guarantee that the defendant received
an individualized sentence. This clear principle emerges notfrom any single case, as the dissent would require, post, at
243-247, but from our long line of authority setting forththe dual constitutional criteria of precise and individualized
sentencing. Thus, the principal difference between the sen-tencing systems of Mississippi and Georgia, the different role
played by aggravating factors in the two States, underscoresthe applicability of

Godfrey and Maynard to the Mississippisystem.

2
Although it made no similar argument in Clemons itself,the State contends now that before

Clemons it was reason-able to believe there was no constitutional requirement to

define aggravating factors with precision in the Mississippisystem. It points to the fact that in order for a jury to find
a defendant guilty of capital murder it must find that thecrime fits within the narrow and precise statutory definition
of that offense. Any additional consideration of aggravatingfactors during the sentencing phase, under this view, is of no
constitutional significance because the requisite differentia503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT

233Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
tion among defendants for death penalty purposes has takenplace during the jury's deliberation with respect to guilt.

The State cites our decision in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484U. S. 231 (1988), in support of its analysis. But

Lowenfield,
arising under Louisiana law, is not applicable here and does
not indicate that Clemons imposed a new rule.In Louisiana, a person is not eligible for the death penalty

unless found guilty of first-degree homicide, a category morenarrow than the general category of homicide. 484 U. S.,
at 241. A defendant is guilty of first-degree homicide ifthe Louisiana jury finds that the killing fits one of five statutory criteria. See id., at 242 (quoting La. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 14:30A (West 1986)). After determining that a defendant
is guilty of first-degree murder, a Louisiana jury next must
decide whether there is at least one statutory aggravating
circumstance and, after considering any mitigating circumstances, determine whether the death penalty is appropriate.
484 U. S., at 242. Unlike the Mississippi process, in Louisiana the jury is not required to weigh aggravating against
mitigating factors.

In Lowenfield, the petitioner argued that his death sentence was invalid because the aggravating factor found
by the jury duplicated the elements it already had found in
determining there was a first-degree homicide. We rejected
the argument that, as a consequence, the Louisiana sentencing procedures had failed to narrow the class of deatheligible defendants in a predictable manner. We observed
that "[t]he use of `aggravating circumstances' is not an end
in itself, but a means of genuinely narrowing the class of
death-eligible persons and thereby channeling the jury's discretion. We see no reason why this narrowing function may
not be performed by jury findings at either the sentencing
phase of the trial or the guilt phase." Id., at 244-245. We
went on to compare the Louisiana scheme with the Texas
scheme, under which the required narrowing occurs at the
guilt phase. Id., at 245 (discussing Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S.

503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT
234 STRINGER v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
262 (1976)). We also contrasted the Louisiana scheme withthe Georgia and Florida schemes. 484 U. S., at 245.

The State's premise that the Mississippi sentencingscheme is comparable to Louisiana's is in error. The Mississippi Supreme Court itself has stated in no uncertain terms
that, with the exception of one distinction not relevant here,its sentencing system operates in the same manner as the

Florida system; and Florida, of course, is subject to the ruleforbidding automatic affirmance by the state appellate court
if an invalid aggravating factor is relied upon. In consider-ing a

Godfrey claim based on the same factor at issue here,
the Mississippi Supreme Court considered decisions of theFlorida Supreme Court to be the most appropriate source of

guidance. In Gilliard v. State, 428 So. 2d 576, 586 (1983),
the Mississippi Supreme Court compared the claim before itto the claim in

Dobbert v. State, 375 So. 2d 1069 (Fla. 1979),
cert. denied, 447 U. S. 912 (1980). The court stated:

"In Dobbert . . . the Florida Supreme Court held that
even though the lower court considered two circum-stances which would not pass constitutional muster and

did not amount to aggravating circumstances, there wasone aggravating circumstance which existed and that it
was sufficient to uphold the death penalty. The onlydistinction between

Dobbert and the present case is that
in Dobbert, under Florida law, the judge determined thesentence without a jury."

Gilliard, supra, at 586.

Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court in Gilliard wasadopting the kind of harmless-error rule we approved in

Barclay, 463 U. S., at 958, and if so, whether it applied that
same rule in Stringer's case, are questions relating to the
merits of Stringer's claim which we need not consider here.
What is dispositive is the fact that the Mississippi Supreme
Court, which is the final authority on the meaning of Mississippi law, has at all times viewed the State's sentencing
scheme as one in which aggravating factors are critical in

503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT

235Cite as: 503 U. S. 222 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
the jury's determination whether to impose the death pen-alty. See also

Evans v. State, 422 So. 2d 737, 743 (Miss.
1982) (applying Godfrey). It would be a strange rule of fed-eralism that ignores the view of the highest court of a State

as to the meaning of its own law. See Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S., at 310 (discussing federalism as one of the concernsunderlying the nonretroactivity principle).

As a matter of federal law, moreover, the view of the Mis-sissippi Supreme Court that

Godfrey's dictates apply to its
capital sentencing procedure is correct. Indeed, it is so evi-dent that the issue was not even mentioned in

Clemons.
There we took for granted, and the State did not challenge,
the proposition that if a State uses aggravating factors in
deciding who shall be eligible for the death penalty or who
shall receive the death penalty, it cannot use factors which
as a practical matter fail to guide the sentencer's discretion.
See Clemons, 494 U. S., at 756, n. 1 (opinion of Blackmun, J.,
joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (noting that the unconstitutionality of the vague aggravating factor is implicit in the Court's
opinion).

Even were we free to ignore the Mississippi Supreme
Court's understanding of the way its own law works, we
would reject the suggestion that Lowenfield could form the
basis for an argument that Godfrey does not apply to Mississippi. Although our precedents do not require the use of
aggravating factors, they have not permitted a State in
which aggravating factors are decisive to use factors of
vague or imprecise content. A vague aggravating factor
employed for the purpose of determining whether a defendant is eligible for the death penalty fails to channel the sentencer's discretion. A vague aggravating factor used in the
weighing process is in a sense worse, for it creates the risk
that the jury will treat the defendant as more deserving of
the death penalty than he might otherwise be by relying
upon the existence of an illusory circumstance. Because the

503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT
236 STRINGER v. BLACK

Opinion of the Court
use of a vague aggravating factor in the weighing processcreates the possibility not only of randomness but also of bias

in favor of the death penalty, we cautioned in Zant that theremight be a requirement that when the weighing process has
been infected with a vague factor the death sentence must
be invalidated.Nothing in

Lowenfield suggests that the proscription of
vague aggravating factors does not apply to a capital sen-tencing system like Mississippi's.

Lowenfield did not involve a claim that a statutory aggravating factor was ambig-uous, and its relevance to

Godfrey, which it did not find it
necessary to cite, or the line of cases following from Godfrey,
is slight at best.

We also note that the State's reliance on Lowenfield to
show that it could not have anticipated Godfrey's application
to Mississippi is somewhat odd. For Lowenfield, after all,
was decided when the petitioner's conviction and sentence
already were final. It is a fiction for the State to contend
that in 1984 its courts relied on a 1988 decision. This is not
to say that a State could not rely on a decision announced
after a petitioner's conviction and sentence became final to
defeat his claim on the merits. It could. Insofar as our
new rule jurisprudence "validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents," Butler v. McKellar,
494 U. S., at 414, however, the State may have little cause to
complain if in deciding to allow a petitioner to rely upon a
decision the federal courts look only to those precedents
which the state courts knew at the relevant time. In any
event, we need not dwell on the anachronism inherent in the
State's Lowenfield argument because, as we have concluded,
that case does not provide a basis for concluding that it was
a new rule to apply Godfrey to the Mississippi system.

The State next argues that Clemons' application of Godfrey to Mississippi could not have been dictated by precedent
because prior to Clemons the Fifth Circuit concluded that
Godfrey did not apply to Mississippi. See Evans v. Thigpen,

reiterate that the rationale of the Fifth Circuit has not been
adopted by the Mississippi Supreme Court, which, as a state
court, is the primary beneficiary of the Teague doctrine.
The Mississippi Supreme Court has recognized that it is
bound by Godfrey. See, e. g., Mhoon v. State, 464 So. 2d 77,
85 (1985) (requiring, based on Godfrey, that a capital sentencing jury be given a narrowing construction of the "heinous,
atrocious or cruel" factor).

The Fifth Circuit's pre-Clemons views are relevant to our
inquiry, see Butler, supra, at 415, but not dispositive. The
purpose of the new rule doctrine is to validate reasonable
interpretations of existing precedents. Reasonableness, in
this as in many other contexts, is an objective standard, and
the ultimate decision whether Clemons was dictated by
precedent is based on an objective reading of the relevant
cases. The short answer to the State's argument is that the
Fifth Circuit made a serious mistake in Evans v. Thigpen
and Johnson v. Thigpen. The Fifth Circuit ignored the Mississippi Supreme Court's own characterization of its law and
accorded no significance to the fact that in Mississippi aggravating factors are central in the weighing phase of a capital
sentencing proceeding. As we have explained, when these
facts are accorded their proper significance, the precedents
even before Maynard and Clemons yield a well-settled principle: Use of a vague or imprecise aggravating factor in the
weighing process invalidates the sentence and at the very
least requires constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing in the state judicial system.

We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

238 STRINGER v. BLACK

Souter, J., dissenting
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Today the Court holds that no reasonable jurist could havebelieved in 1985, two years after Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.

862 (1983), that the holding of that case would apply to a so-called "weighing" State. The Court maintains, on the contrary, that in 1985 it was obvious that a sentencer's weighingof a vague aggravating circumstance deprives a defendant of
individualized sentencing. While that may be obvious after
Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988), I submit thatwas not so before this Court decided that case. I respectfully dissent. I

Under the principle first announced in Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989), a prisoner seeking habeas corpus relief in
federal court generally cannot benefit from a new rule an-nounced after the prisoner's conviction became final,

id., at301 (plurality opinion), that is, after exhausting all direct appeals, see Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 314 (1989). Adecision announces a new rule "if the result was not dictated
by precedent existing at the time the defendant's convictionbecame final." Teague, supra, at 301 (plurality opinion) (emphasis omitted). The result in a given case is not dictatedby precedent if it is "susceptible to debate among reasonable
minds," Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990), or, putdifferently, if "reasonable jurists may disagree,"

Sawyer v.Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990).

Petitioner's conviction became final for Teague purposeson February 19, 1985. He now claims the benefit of the rule
that an Eighth Amendment violation occurs when a sen-tencer in a weighing State considers a vague aggravating
circumstance, even if the sentencer has also found the exist-ence of at least one other aggravating circumstance that is
neither vague nor otherwise infirm. Because this Courtnever endorsed that position before February 19, 1985, I will
discuss the relevant pre-1985 decisions, infra, Part I-A, and

the post-1985 decisions that, implicitly at least, announcedthe rule petitioner invokes, infra, Part I-B. Finally, I will

enquire whether this rule was dictated by the pre-1985 deci-sions, infra, Part II.

A
The cases determining the apposite law before 1985 startwith

Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980). Under theGeorgia sentencing scheme, a defendant is given a life sentence unless the jury finds one or more aggravating circum-stances. Once the jury does that, aggravating circumstances no longer play a role: the jury is instructed todetermine whether the defendant should receive a death sentence by considering all the evidence in aggravation and inmitigation. The jury is not instructed to weigh any aggravating circumstances against mitigating circumstances. In
Godfrey, a Georgia jury had returned a death verdict on thestrength of just one aggravating circumstance, that the

murder was "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible andinhuman."

Id., at 426 (plurality opinion). Saying that "[a]person of ordinary sensibility could fairly categorize almost

every murder as `outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible andinhuman,' " id., at 428-429, this Court held that this circumstance failed to impose any "restraint on the arbitrary andcapricious infliction of the death sentence,"

id., at 428. Ac-cordingly, Georgia's sentencing scheme, as applied, violated

the Eighth Amendment in the same way as the schemestruck down in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972): it
failed to "provide a meaningful basis for distinguishing thefew cases in which [the penalty] is imposed from the many
cases in which it is not." 446 U. S., at 427 (internal quota-tion marks omitted).

After Godfrey came Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983),arising from a Georgia jury's death verdict based on a showing of several aggravating circumstances, one of which wasthat respondent had "a substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions," id., at 866. Shortly after respond503us1$44L 11-13-95 23:06:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Souter, J., dissenting
ent's sentencing, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in a differ-ent case, held that the "substantial history" circumstance left

"a wide latitude of discretion in a jury as to whether or notto impose the death penalty," rendering a death sentence
imposed upon the strength of the "substantial history" circumstance alone unconstitutional under Furman. Arnoldv.

State, 236 Ga. 534, 541, 224 S. E. 2d 386, 392 (1976). The
Supreme Court of Georgia nevertheless refused to vacateStephens' sentence, holding it adequately supported by the

other, unchallenged, aggravating circumstances. Stephensv.

State, 237 Ga. 259, 261-262, 227 S. E. 2d 261, 263, cert.
denied, 429 U. S. 986 (1976). This Court agreed, holding
Godfrey to be distinguishable because, in that case, the single aggravating circumstance failed to narrow the class of
persons eligible for the death penalty, as required by the
Eighth Amendment, 462 U. S., at 878, while in Stephens, the
remaining aggravating circumstances properly discharged
the narrowing obligation, id., at 879. The vagueness of one
among several aggravating circumstances was therefore held
to be irrelevant, and the scheme itself adequate under Furman, 462 U. S., at 888-889, so long as it included mandatory
appellate review for any arbitrariness or disproportionality
stemming from some other source, id., at 890.

The last relevant pre-1985 decision is Barclay v. Florida,
463 U. S. 939 (1983). The Florida scheme, like the one in
Georgia, requires the sentencer to impose a life sentence if
it finds no aggravating circumstances present. But, unlike
Georgia, Florida is a weighing State, in which the sentencer
who finds that one or more aggravating circumstances exist
must determine the sentence by weighing aggravating and
mitigating circumstances. In Barclay, a judge had imposed
a death sentence after finding several aggravating circumstances, one of which was that the petitioner had a criminal
record, id., at 944-945, which Florida law did not recognize
as an aggravating circumstance, id., at 946. This Court held
that the resulting death sentence did not violate the Eighth

Amendment, for the same reason the sentence in Stephensdid not: the remaining aggravating circumstances satisfied

the Eighth Amendment's narrowing requirement. See id.,at 957 (plurality opinion);

id., at 966-967 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); see also id., at 947-948, n. 5 (plurality
opinion) (distinguishing Godfrey as involving only one aggra-vating circumstance).

B
The first case in which this Court applied the rule from
which petitioner seeks to benefit was Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988). There, an Oklahoma jury had
found the presence of two aggravating circumstances, one ofwhich was that the murder was "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel." Because Oklahoma is a weighing State, thetrial court had instructed the jury that, in determining the
penalty, it should weigh these aggravating circumstancesagainst any mitigating circumstances, and the jury had eventually returned a verdict of death. On collateral review, the
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that the "hei-nous, atrocious, or cruel" circumstance without further instruction was vague in the Godfrey sense. See Cartwrightv.

Maynard, 822 F. 2d 1477, 1485-1491 (1987) (en banc). Distinguishing Stephens, the Court of Appeals held that thisvagueness amounted to an Eighth Amendment violation because Oklahoma was a weighing State, 822 F. 2d, at 1480.1It vacated Cartwright's sentence, noting that Oklahoma's
highest court had failed to cure the constitutional defect byeither reweighing or performing harmless-error review,

id.,
at 1482.This Court affirmed, holding that

Godfrey controlled because the "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" circum-stance gave no more guidance than the "outrageously or

Souter, J., dissenting
wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman" circumstance in Godfrey, 486 U. S., at 363-364. The Court rejected Oklahoma's
argument that Cartwright's sentence was adequately sup-ported by the unchallenged aggravating circumstance, observing that Oklahoma's highest court had a practice of not
attempting to "save the death penalty when one of severalaggravating circumstances . . . was found invalid,"

id., at 365.
(Instead, that court would simply commute any death sen-tence imposed after finding an "invalid" aggravating circumstance into a sentence of life imprisonment, see id., at 359.)The Court said that "the Court of Appeals cannot be faulted
for not itself undertaking what the state courts themselves
refused to do," id., at 365.

Cartwright was followed by Clemons v. Mississippi, 494
U. S. 738 (1990). Like Oklahoma, Mississippi is a weighing
State, and a jury had returned a death verdict finding that
two aggravating circumstances were present (one of which
had been that the crime was "especially heinous, atrocious,
or cruel"), and finding that these two aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances. The
Supreme Court of Mississippi had affirmed, distinguishing
Cartwright on the ground, inter alia, that, while Oklahoma
had no procedure for salvaging a death sentence resting in
part on a vague aggravating circumstance, there was an established procedure in Mississippi. "[W]hen one aggravating circumstance is found to be invalid . . . , a remaining valid
aggravating circumstance will nonetheless support the death
penalty verdict." 494 U. S., at 743-744 (internal quotation
marks omitted). In this Court, Clemons argued that where
a jury had originally imposed a death sentence, the Constitution demanded resentencing by a jury whenever a state
appellate court found that the jury had considered an unconstitutionally vague aggravating circumstance. Id., at 744.
This Court rejected the argument, saying that nothing in
the Constitution forbade a state appellate court to salvage
an unconstitutional sentence, id., at 745-750, although, at a

minimum, the state appellate court would have to reweighor perform harmless-error review, id., at 751-752.

In rejecting a more relaxed rule "authorizing or requir-ing affirmance of a death sentence so long as there remains
at least one valid aggravating circumstance," the Courtexplained:

"An automatic rule of affirmance in a weighing Statewould be invalid under Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586
(1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982),for it would not give defendants the individualized treatment that would result from actual reweighing ofthe mix of mitigating factors and aggravating circumstances. Cf. Barclay v. Florida, [supra, at 958]." Id.,at 752.

See also Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 321-322 (1991).Today the Court adds to

Clemons' explanation by reason-ing that a sentencer's weighing of a vague aggravating circumstance deprives the defendant of individualized sentenc-ing because it "creates the possibility . . . of randomness."
Ante, at 236. The Court says that a sentencer's weighing ofa vague aggravating circumstance may "ske[w]" the weighing process, ante, at 232, by placing a "thumb [on] death'sside of the scale,"

ibid., by "creat[ing] the risk [of] treat[ing]the defendant as more deserving of the death penalty," ante,

at 235-236, or by "creat[ing] the possibility . . . of bias infavor of the death penalty,"

ibid.2

II
Like Godfrey and Stephens, the petitioner in the instantcase was sentenced to death after a finding of a vague aggra2 The mere fact that an aggravating circumstance inclines a sentencer
more towards imposing the death penalty cannot, of course, violate the
Eighth Amendment. I therefore read the majority opinion to object to
the weighing of vague aggravating circumstances only because they skew
the operation of the scheme by their random application from case to case.

vating circumstance. Like Stephens, but unlike Godfrey, he
was sentenced on the basis of more than one aggravating circumstance, only one of which he challenged. The
issue in this case, then, is whether it would have been reasonable to believe in 1985 that a sentencer's weighing of a
vague 3 aggravating circumstance does not offend the Eighth
Amendment so long as the sentencer has found at least one
other valid aggravating circumstance.4 Put differently, the
question is whether it would have been reasonable to believe
in 1985 that the holding in Stephens could apply to a weighing State. The majority answers these questions in the negative, saying that in 1985, no reasonable jurist could have
failed to discover a concern with randomness in this Court's
individualized-sentencing cases, or have failed to realize that
a sentencer's weighing of a vague aggravating circumstance
deprives a defendant of individualized sentencing. I think
th is answer endues the jurist w ith prescience, not
reasonableness.

It is true that the Court in Stephens reserved judgment
on the question whether its holding would apply to a weighing State:

3 I say vague and not, as the majority does, invalid, see ante, at 230, 231.
There might indeed have been invalid aggravating circumstances whose
consideration, even with one or more valid ones, would have tainted an
ensuing death sentence in any reasonable view in 1985. Thus, it would
have been unreasonable to believe in 1985 that a capital sentence could
stand, without more, if the sentencer had been instructed, say, to consider
constitutionally protected behavior in aggravation. See Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 956 (1983) (plurality opinion); Zant v. Stephens, 462
U. S. 862, 885 (1983). But I would apply that proposition to weighing and
nonweighing States alike.

4 Because, in this case, valid aggravating circumstances remained, I need

not discuss respondents' argument that it was reasonable to believe in
1985 that the Mississippi murder statute performed all constitutionally
required narrowing in the guilt phase of petitioner's trial. Cf. Lowenfield
v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988).

"[I]n deciding this case we do not express any opinionconcerning the possible significance of a holding that a

particular aggravating circumstance is `invalid' under astatutory scheme in which the judge or jury is specifically instructed to weigh statutory aggravating andmitigating circumstances in exercising its discretion
whether to impose the death penalty." 462 U. S., at890.

I agree that this statement would have put a reasonable ju-rist on notice that

Stephens' rule might not apply to a weigh-ing State, but the answer to the question reserved was no

foregone conclusion. It is worth remembering that theGeorgia jury in Stephens was instructed simply to "conside[r]" all aggravating and mitigating evidence, see id., at871, leaving it with what the respondent described as "unbridled discretion" at the final stage of sentencing, id., at 875,which this Court found to be no violation of the Eighth
Amendment, id., at 875-880. If unguided discretion createdno risk of randomness, it was hardly obvious that this risk
arose when a vague aggravating circumstance was weighed.To conclude after

Stephens that the outcome in Cartwrightand Clemons was dictated is a leap of reason.

The leap lengthens when one considers Barclay, for Ithink a reasonable jurist, in 1985, could have concluded that
this Court resolved the question reserved in Stephens whenit decided

Barclay, which strongly implied that the Stephensprinciple applied to weighing States like Florida. See 463

U. S., at 957 (plurality opinion); id., at 966-967 (Stevens, J.,concurring in judgment). The majority attempts to minimize Barclay by saying that the Barclay Court upheld thesentence "only because it was clear that the Florida Supreme
Court had determined that the sentence would have beenthe same had the sentencing judge given no weight to the
invalid factor." Ante, at 231 (citing 463 U. S., at 958 (plural-ity opinion)). But I do not think

Barclay can be explainedaway so easily.

246 STRINGER v. BLACK

Souter, J., dissenting
It is true that the plurality opinion noted that the SupremeCourt of Florida performed harmless-error review.

Ibid.
But the opinion's discussion of this point merely respondedto Barclay's argument that the Supreme Court of Florida

had failed to apply state-law precedent properly, which, Barclay maintained, required harmless-error review. See id., at957. The plurality rejected that argument, saying that failure to apply those cases would be "mere errors of state law[that] are not the concern of this Court," and that, in any
event, the Supreme Court of Florida had, contrary to peti-tioner's assertions, performed harmless-error review.

Id.,
at 957-958. Nothing in the plurality's opinion suggests that
harmless-error review would be constitutionally required
where the sentencer had weighed an "invalid" aggravating
circumstance.

It is also true that the concurrence of Justice Stevens
and Justice Powell, who cast the deciding votes in Barclay,
stated that Florida law required the Supreme Court of Florida to reweigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
See id., at 974 (opinion concurring in judgment). But that
simply responded to Barclay's argument that the Supreme
Court of Florida failed to perform the quantum of appellate
review that the Constitution requires in every capital case
(regardless of whether the trial court commits state-law
error). See id., at 972-973. Justice Stevens' opinion
merely noted that the principal opinion in Proffitt v. Florida,
428 U. S. 242, 253 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,
and Stevens, JJ.), had held that reweighing satisfied the
appellate-review obligation imposed by the Constitution.
463 U. S., at 974. Justice Stevens never said that reweighing would be the constitutionally required minimum
where the sentencer had weighed an "invalid" aggravating
circumstance.

Although Barclay may be read as assuming that some appellate test must be passed if a death verdict is to stand in a
weighing State despite the finding of an invalid aggravating

circumstance, nowhere do the opinions state that the StateSupreme Court's mandated proportionality review would not

satisfy the required constitutional minimum. See Proffitt,supra, at 258 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.) ("The Supreme Court of Florida reviews eachdeath sentence to ensure that similar results are reached in

similar cases"). Mississippi law requires just such review.See

ante, at 226.In sum, after Barclay, a jurist mindful of the Stephens

caveat could reasonably have assumed that weighing one in-valid aggravating circumstance along with one or more valid
ones need not be treated as significant enough to amount toconstitutional error in a State that at least provided appellate review for proportionality. That is dispositive under
Teague: a reasonable reading of Barclay bars the conclusionthat the result in Cartwright and Clemons was dictated by

the cases on our books in 1985.The Fifth Circuit, indeed, held as recently as 1988 that the
rule in Stephens applied to a weighing State. See Stringerv.

Jackson, 862 F. 2d 1108, 1115 (1988); Edwards v. Scroggy,849 F. 2d 204, 211 (1988).

5 The conflict between its view and

that of the Tenth Circuit, see Cartwright v. Maynard, 822F. 2d 1477, 1480 (1987) (en banc), is itself evidence that it

was not unreasonable to believe in 1985 that Stephens wouldgovern the result in this case. See

Butler v. McKellar, 494U. S., at 415. Nor, in light of my analysis, can the Fifth Circuit's opinion be dismissed as having "no arguable basis tosupport" the view expressed,

ante, at 231.

In sum, I do not think that precedent in 1985 dictated therule that weighing a vague aggravating circumstance neces5 This was after we announced Cartwright. The Fifth Circuit distinguished that case in the same way the Supreme Court of Mississippi distinguished Cartwright in Clemons. See Stringer, 862 F. 2d, at 1113; Edwards, 849 F. 2d, at 211, n. 7.

249OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

CONNECTICUT NATIONAL BANK v. GERMAIN,

trustee for the ESTATE OF O'SULLIVAN'SFUEL OIL CO., INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 90-1791. Argued January 21, 1992--Decided March 9, 1992
In a suit by respondent Germain, the trustee of a bankrupt debtor's estate,

seeking to hold petitioner Connecticut National Bank (CNB) liable for
various torts and breaches of contract, the Bankruptcy Court denied
CNB's motion to strike Germain's demand for a jury trial, and the District Court affirmed. The Court of Appeals dismissed CNB's attempted
appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that a court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction over an interlocutory order in bankruptcy only when
the district court issues the order after having withdrawn the case from
the bankruptcy court, and not when the district court acts in its capacity
as a bankruptcy court of appeals.

Held: An interlocutory order issued by a district court sitting as a court

of appeals in bankruptcy is appealable under the unambiguous language
of 28 U. S. C. $ 1292. That section provides for review in the courts of
appeals, in certain circumstances, of "[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts," and does not limit such review to orders issued by district
courts sitting as bankruptcy trial courts rather than appellate courts.
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 158(d)--which gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction
over, inter alia, appeals from all final orders of district courts sitting as
appellate courts in bankruptcy, but is silent as to review of interlocutory
orders--does not limit the unadorned words of $ 1292 by negative implication. Contrary to Germain's contention, giving effect to $ 1292's companion provision, $ 1291--which confers jurisdiction over appeals from
"final decisions of the district courts" acting in any capacity--would not
render $ 158(d) wholly superfluous. Although $$ 1291 and 158(d) do
overlap, $ 158(d) also confers jurisdiction over the final decisions of bankruptcy appellate panels, such that each section reaches cases that the
other does not. Redundancies across statutes are not unusual events
in drafting, and where, as here, there is no positive repugnancy between
two laws, a court must give effect to both. Pp. 251-254.

In this case, we determine the appealability of an interloc-utory order issued by a district court sitting as a court of

appeals in bankruptcy. I

In 1984, O'Sullivan's Fuel Oil Co., Inc., filed a bankruptcypetition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut. Although the case began as a reorgani-zation under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in 1986
the Bankruptcy Court converted it into a liquidation underChapter 7. Petitioner Connecticut National Bank (CNB) is
successor in interest to one of O'Sullivan's creditors. Re-spondent Thomas M. Germain is trustee of O'Sullivan's
estate.On June 1, 1987, Germain sued CNB in Connecticut state
court, seeking to hold the bank liable for various torts andbreaches of contract. CNB removed the suit to the United
States District Court for the District of Connecticut, which,pursuant to local rule, automatically referred the proceeding
to the Bankruptcy Court overseeing the liquidation. Ger-main then filed a demand for a jury trial. CNB moved to
strike Germain's demand. The Bankruptcy Court deniedCNB's motion,

CNB then tried to appeal to the Court of Appeals for theSecond Circuit, but the court dismissed for lack of jurisdic503us1$45z 11-13-95 23:12:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion. 926 F. 2d 191 (1991). The Second Circuit held that a
court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction over interlocutory
orders in bankruptcy only when a district court issues the
order after having withdrawn a proceeding or case from a
bankruptcy court, and not when the district court acts in
its capacity as a bankruptcy court of appeals. We granted
certiorari, 502 U. S. 905 (1991), and now reverse and remand.

II
Courts of appeals have jurisdiction over "[i]nterlocutory
orders of the district courts of the United States" under 28
U. S. C. $ 1292.* CNB contends that $ 1292(b) applies by its
terms in this case, and that the Second Circuit therefore
could have exercised discretionary jurisdiction over its appeal. Germain argues that $ 1292 does not apply at all in
this case because Congress limited $ 1292 through 28 U. S. C.

*That section provides in relevant part:
"(a) . . . [T]he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from:

"(1) Interlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States . . .
or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except
where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court;

"(2) Interlocutory orders appointing receivers, or refusing orders to
wind up receiverships or to take steps to accomplish the purposes
thereof . . . ;

"(3) Interlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof

Opinion of the Court

$ 158(d), which deals with bankruptcy jurisdiction. CNBresponds that nothing in $ 158(d) limits $ 1292. We agree

with CNB.Bankruptcy appeals are governed for the most part by

$ 158. This section comprises four subsections, three of
which concern us here. Subsection (a) gives the districtcourts authority to hear appeals from final and interlocutory

orders of the bankruptcy courts. The District Court, as wehave noted, had jurisdiction under this provision to hear
CNB's appeal from the Bankruptcy Court. Subsection (b)permits the judicial council of any circuit to establish a bankruptcy appellate panel to fill the role of the district courtsunder subsection (a). Subsection (d), which is pivotal in this
case, provides:

"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals
from all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decreesentered under subsections (a) and (b) of this section."

Neither this subsection nor any other part of $ 158 mentionsinterlocutory orders entered by the district courts in bankruptcy. The parties agree, as they must, that $ 158 did notconfer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals.

Germain contends that the Court of Appeals did not havejurisdiction under $ 1292 either, for $ 158(d), in his view, precludes jurisdiction under $ 1292 by negative implication. Germain reasons as follows: Although $$ 1291 and 1292 appearto cover the universe of decisions issued by the district

courts--with $ 1291 conferring jurisdiction over appeals fromfinal decisions of the district courts, and $ 1292 conferring
jurisdiction over certain interlocutory ones--that cannot in
fact be so. If $ 1291 did cover all final decisions by a district
court, he argues, that section would render $ 158(d) superfluous, since a final decision issued by a district court sitting
as a bankruptcy appellate court is still a final decision of a
district court. If $ 158(d) is to have effect, Germain contends, then that section must be exclusive within its own

Opinion of the Court
domain, which he defines as the universe of orders issued bydistrict courts sitting pursuant to $ 158(a) as courts of appeals in bankruptcy. When a district court enters an orderin that capacity, Germain concludes, only $ 158(d) can confer
jurisdiction, and if it does not, nothing else can. Germain
claims to find support for his view in his reading of the legis-lative history of $ 158(d).

Contrary to Germain's contention, we need not choose be-tween giving effect on the one hand to $ 1291 and on the
other to $ 158(d), for the statutes do not pose an either-orproposition. Section 1291 confers jurisdiction over appeals
from "final decisions of the district courts" acting in any capacity. Section 158(d), in contrast, confers jurisdiction over
appeals from final decisions of the district courts when they
act as bankruptcy appellate courts under $ 158(a), and also
confers jurisdiction over final decisions of the appellate panels in bankruptcy acting under $ 158(b). Sections 1291 and
158(d) do overlap, therefore, but each section confers jurisdiction over cases that the other section does not reach.

Redundancies across statutes are not unusual events in
drafting, and so long as there is no "positive repugnancy"
between two laws, Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 363
(1842), a court must give effect to both. Because giving effect to both $$ 1291 and 158(d) would not render one or the
other wholly superfluous, we do not have to read $ 158(d) as
precluding courts of appeals, by negative implication, from
exercising jurisdiction under $ 1291 over district courts
sitting in bankruptcy. We similarly do not have to read

$ 158(d) as precluding jurisdiction under $ 1292. While
courts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render
language superfluous, in this case that canon does not apply.

In any event, canons of construction are no more than
rules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning of
legislation, and in interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before all others. We
have stated time and again that courts must presume that a

503us1$45z 11-13-95 23:12:28 PAGES OPINPGT
254 CONNECTICUT NAT. BANK v. GERMAIN

Opinion of the Court
legislature says in a statute what it means and means in astatute what it says there. See,

e. g., United States v. Ron
Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241-242 (1989); United
States v. Goldenberg, 168 U. S. 95, 102-103 (1897); Oneale v.
Thornton, 6 Cranch 53, 68 (1810). When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last:"judicial inquiry is complete."

Rubin v. United States, 449
U. S. 424, 430 (1981); see also Ron Pair Enterprises, supra,at 241.

Germain says that legislative history points to a differentresult. But we think that judicial inquiry into the applicability of $ 1292 begins and ends with what $ 1292 does say
and with what $ 158(d) does not. Section 1292 provides for
review in the courts of appeals, in certain circumstances, of
"[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United
States." Section 158(d) is silent as to review of interlocutory orders. Nowhere does $ 1292 limit review to orders issued by district courts sitting as trial courts in bankruptcy
rather than appellate courts, and nowhere else, whether in

$ 158(d) or any other statute, has Congress indicated that the
unadorned words of $ 1292 are in some way limited by implication. "It would be dangerous in the extreme to infer . . .
that a case for which the words of an instrument expressly
provide, shall be exempted from its operation." Sturges v.
Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 202 (1819); see also Regents of
Univ. of Cal. v. Public Employment Relations Bd., 485 U. S.
589, 598 (1988). There is no reason to infer from either

$ 1292 or $ 158(d) that Congress meant to limit appellate review of interlocutory orders in bankruptcy proceedings. So
long as a party to a proceeding or case in bankruptcy meets
the conditions imposed by $ 1292, a court of appeals may rely
on that statute as a basis for jurisdiction.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
Whenever there is some uncertainty about the meaning ofa statute, it is prudent to examine its legislative history.

1 In

this case, such an examination is appropriate because peti-tioner's interpretation of 28 U. S. C. $ 158(d) creates an unusual overlap with 28 U. S. C. $ 1291.Rejecting petitioner's position, the Court of Appeals concluded that in enacting the current system of bankruptcyappeals, Congress limited the scope of $ 1292(b), excluding
review by the courts of appeals of certain interlocutorybankruptcy orders. If Congress had intended such a significant change in the scheme of appellate jurisdiction, someindication of this purpose would almost certainly have found
its way into the legislative history. The legislative record,however, contains no mention of an intent to limit the scope
of $ 1292(b). This silence tends to support the conclusionthat no such change was intended.

2

Accordingly, notwithstanding the inferences drawn by theCourt of Appeals, the legislative history is not only consist1 See Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier 501 U. S. 597, 611, n. 4
(1991) ("[C]ommon sense suggests that inquiry benefits from reviewing
additional information rather than ignoring it"). As Judge Learned Hand
advised, statutes "should be construed, not as theorems of Euclid, but with
some imagination of the purposes which lie behind them." Lehigh Valley
Coal Co. v. Yensavage, 218 F. 547, 553 (CA2 1914), cert. denied, 235 U. S.
705 (1915). Legislative history helps to illuminate those purposes.

Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256, 266-267
(1979); see also Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 602 (1980)
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting) ("In a case where the construction of legislative language such as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox
a change as that made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take
into consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night").
Similarly, Justice Frankfurter's scholarly observation concerning the interpretation of a statutory text also applies to the analysis of legislative
history: "One must . . . listen attentively to what it does not say." Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev.

ent with petitioner's interpretation of the statute, but alsoactually supports it. For this reason, and because I agree

with the Court's textual analysis, I concur in its judgment.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice White and
Justice Blackmun join, concurring in the judgment.

I agree that when Congress enacted 28 U. S. C. $ 158(d) aspart of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship

Act of 1984, Congress probably did not intend to deprive thecourts of appeals of their longstanding jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy cases. But I think weshould admit that this construction of the statutes

does ren-der $ 158(d) largely superfluous, and that we
do strive to in-terpret statutes so as to avoid redundancy. Cf. ante, at 253-

254. In this case, I think it far more likely that Congressinadvertently created a redundancy than that Congress intended to withdraw appellate jurisdiction over interlocutorybankruptcy appeals by the roundabout method of reconferring jurisdiction over appeals from final bankruptcy orders.I would reverse the judgment below only for this reason.

HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTIONCORPORATION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 90-727. Argued November 13, 1991--Decided March 24, 1992
Pursuant to its authority under the Securities Investor Protection Act

(SIPA), respondent Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)
sought, and received, judicial decrees to protect the customers of two of
its member broker-dealers. After trustees were appointed to liquidate
the broker-dealers' businesses, SIPC and the trustees filed this suit,
alleging, among other things, that petitioner Holmes and others had
conspired in a fraudulent stock-manipulation scheme that disabled the
broker-dealers from meeting obligations to customers; that this conduct
triggered SIPC's statutory duty to advance funds to reimburse the customers; that the conspirators had violated the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and regulations promulgated thereunder; and that their acts
amounted to a "pattern of racketeering activity" within the meaning of
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18
U. S. C. $$ 1962, 1961(1), and (5), so as to entitle the plaintiffs to recover
treble damages, $ 1964(c). The District Court entered summary judgment for Holmes on the RICO claims, ruling, inter alia, that SIPC did
not meet the "purchaser-seller" requirement for standing under RICO.
The Court of Appeals held the finding of no standing to be error and,
for this and other reasons, reversed and remanded.

Held: SIPC has demonstrated no right to sue Holmes under $ 1964(c).

Pp. 265-276.

(a) A plaintiff's right to sue under $ 1964(c)--which specifies that
"[a]ny person injured . . . by reason of a violation of [$ 1962] may sue
therefor . . . and . . . recover threefold the damages he sustains . . ."--
requires a showing that the defendant's violation was the proximate
cause of the plaintiff's injury. Section 1964(c) was modeled on $ 4 of
the Clayton Act, which was itself based on $ 7 of the Sherman Act, see
Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S.
519, 530, and both antitrust sections had been interpreted to incorporate
common-law principles of proximate causation, see, e. g., id., at 533-534,
and n. 29, 536, n. 33. It must be assumed that the Congress which
enacted $ 1964(c) intended its words to have the same meaning that
courts had already given them. Cf. id., at 534. Although $ 1964(c)'s
language can be read to require only factual, "but for," causation, this

259Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)
Syllabus
construction is hardly compelled, and the very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover persuades
this Court that RICO should not get such an expansive reading.
Pp. 265-268.

(b) As used herein, "proximate cause" requires some direct relation
between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged. For a
variety of reasons, see id., at 540-544, such directness of relationship is
one of the essential elements of Clayton Act causation. Pp. 268-270.

(c) SIPC's claim that it is entitled to recover on the ground that it is
subrogated to the rights of the broker-dealers' customers who did not
purchase manipulated securities fails because the conspirators' conduct
did not proximately cause those customers' injury. Even assuming,
arguendo, that SIPC may stand in the shoes of such customers, the
link is too remote between the stock manipulation alleged, which directly injured the broker-dealers by rendering them insolvent, and the
nonpurchasing customers' losses, which are purely contingent on the
broker-dealers' inability to pay customers' claims. The facts of this
case demonstrate that the reasons supporting adoption of the Clayton
Act direct-injury limitation, see ibid., apply with equal force to $ 1964(c)
suits. First, if the nonpurchasing customers were allowed to sue, the
district court would first need to determine the extent to which their
inability to collect from the broker-dealers was the result of the alleged
conspiracy, as opposed to, e. g., the broker-dealers' poor business practices or their failures to anticipate financial market developments. Second, assuming that an appropriate assessment of factual causation could
be made out, the court would then have to find some way to apportion
the possible respective recoveries by the broker-dealers and the customers, who would otherwise each be entitled to recover the full treble
damages. Finally, the law would be shouldering these difficulties despite the fact that the directly injured broker-dealers could be counted
on to bring suit for the law's vindication, as they have in fact done in
the persons of their SIPA trustees. Indeed, the insolvency of the victim directly injured adds a further concern to those already expressed
in Associated General Contractors, since a suit by an indirectly injured
victim could be an attempt to circumvent the relative priority its claim
would have in the directly injured victim's liquidation proceedings.
This analysis is not deflected by the congressional admonition that
RICO be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes, since
allowing suits by those injured only indirectly would open the door to
massive and complex damages litigation, which would not only burden
the courts, but also undermine the effectiveness of treble-damages suits.
Id., at 545. Thus, SIPC must await the outcome of the trustees' suit

and may share according to the priority SIPA gives its claim if the
trustees recover from Holmes. Pp. 270-275.

(d) SIPC's claim that it is entitled to recover under a SIPA provision,
15 U. S. C. $ 78eee(d), fails because, on its face, that section simply qualifies SIPC as a proper party in interest in any "matter arising in a liquidation proceeding" as to which it "shall be deemed to have intervened,"
and gives SIPC no independent right to sue Holmes for money damages. Pp. 275-276.

(e) This Court declines to decide whether every RICO plaintiff who
sues under $ 1964(c) and claims securities fraud as a predicate offense
must have purchased or sold a security. In light of the foregoing, discussion of that issue is unnecessary to resolve this case. Nor will leaving the question unanswered deprive the lower courts of much-needed
guidance. A review of those courts' conflicting cases shows that all
could have been resolved on proximate-causation grounds, and that none
involved litigants like those in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,
421 U. S. 723, who decided to forgo securities transactions in reliance on
misrepresentations. P. 276.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent Securities Investor Protection Corporation
(SIPC) alleges that petitioner Robert G. Holmes, Jr., conspired in a stock-manipulation scheme that disabled two
broker-dealers from meeting obligations to customers, thus
triggering SIPC's statutory duty to advance funds to reimburse the customers. The issue is whether SIPC can recover from Holmes under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961-1968
(1988 ed. and Supp. II). We hold that it cannot.

I
A

The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA), 84
Stat. 1636, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 78aaa-78lll, authorized
the formation of SIPC, a private nonprofit corporation,

$ 78ccc(a)(1), of which most broker-dealers registered under

$ 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, $ 78o(b),
are required to be "members," $ 78ccc(a)(2)(A). Whenever
SIPC determines that a member "has failed or is in danger
of failing to meet its obligations to customers," and finds
certain other statutory conditions satisfied, it may ask for
a "protective decree" in federal district court. $ 78eee(a)(3).
Once a court finds grounds for granting such a petition,

$ 78eee(b)(1), it must appoint a trustee charged with liquidating the member's business, $ 78eee(b)(3).

After returning all securities registered in specific customers' names, $$ 78fff-2(c)(2); 78fff(a)(1)(A); 78lll(3), the trustee
must pool securities not so registered together with cash
found in customers' accounts and divide this pool ratably
to satisfy customers' claims, $$ 78fff-2(b); 78fff(a)(1)(B).1 To

1 Such "customer property," see 15 U. S. C. $ 78lll(4), does not become
part of the debtor's general estate until all customers' and SIPC's claims
have been paid. See $ 78fff-2(c)(1). That is to say, the claim of a general

PROTECTION CORPORATION

Opinion of the Court

the extent the pool of customer property is inadequate, SIPCmust advance up to $500,000 per customer

2 to the trustee

for use in satisfying those claims. $ 78fff-3(a).3

B
On July 24, 1981, SIPC sought a decree from the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Florida to

protect the customers of First State Securities Corporation(FSSC), a broker-dealer and SIPC member. Three days
later, it petitioned the United States District Court for theCentral District of California, seeking to protect the customers of Joseph Sebag, Inc. (Sebag), also a broker-dealer andSIPC member. Each court issued the requested decree and
appointed a trustee, who proceeded to liquidate the broker-dealer.

Two years later, SIPC and the two trustees brought thissuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, accusing some 75 defendants of conspiracyin a fraudulent scheme leading to the demise of FSSC and
Sebag. Insofar as they are relevant here, the allegationswere that, from 1964 through July 1981, the defendants manipulated stock of six companies by making unduly optimisticstatements about their prospects and by continually selling
small numbers of shares to create the appearance of a liquidmarket; that the broker-dealers bought substantial amounts
of the stock with their own funds; that the market's percep-tion of the fraud in July 1981 sent the stocks plummeting;

creditor of the broker-dealer (say, its landlord) is subordinated to claims
of customers and SIPC.

2 With respect to a customer's cash on deposit with the broker-dealer,

SIPC is not obligated to advance more than $100,000 per customer.

$ 78fff-3(a)(1).

3 To cover these advances, SIPA provides for the establishment of a

SIPC Fund. $ 78ddd(a)(1). SIPC may replenish the fund from time to
time by levying assessments, $ 78ddd(c)(2), which members are legally obligated to pay, $ 78jjj(a).

Opinion of the Court
and that this decline caused the broker-dealers' financial dif-ficulties resulting in their eventual liquidation and SIPC's

advance of nearly $13 million to cover their customers'claims. The complaint described Holmes' participation in
the scheme by alleging that he made false statements aboutthe prospects of one of the six companies, Aero Systems, Inc.,
of which he was an officer, director, and major shareholder;and that over an extended period he sold small amounts of
stock in one of the other six companies, the BunningtonCorporation, to simulate a liquid market. The conspirators
were said to have violated $ 10(b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b), Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 (1991),and the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1341, 1343
(1988 ed., Supp. II). Finally, the complaint concluded thattheir acts amounted to a "pattern of racketeering activity"
within the meaning of the RICO statute, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1962,1961(1), and (5) (1988 ed. and Supp. II), so as to entitle the
plaintiffs to recover treble damages, $ 1964(c).After some five years of litigation over other issues,

4 the

District Court entered summary judgment for Holmes onthe RICO claims, ruling that SIPC "does not meet the

`purchaser-seller' requirements for standing to assert RICOclaims which are predicated upon violation of Section 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5," App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a,5 and that neither

Corporation v. Vigman, 764 F. 2d 1309 (CA9 1985) (Vigman I).

5 Two years earlier, the District Court had dismissed SIPC's non-RICO

securities action on the ground that SIPC's claim to have been subrogated
to the rights only of those customers who did not purchase any of the
manipulated securities rendered the action a failure under the so-called
Birnbaum test, which requires a plaintiff to be a purchaser or seller of a
security. See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723
(1975); Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F. 2d 461 (CA2), cert. denied,
343 U. S. 956 (1952). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed

Opinion of the Court

SIPC nor the trustees had satisfied the "proximate causerequirement under RICO," id., at 39a; see id., at 37a. Although SIPC's claims against many other defendants re-mained pending, the District Court under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 54(b) entered a partial judgment for Holmes,immediately appealable. SIPC and the trustees appealed.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitreversed and remanded after rejecting both of the District
Court's grounds. Securities Investor Protection Corporation v. Vigman, 908 F. 2d 1461 (1990). The Court of Appealsheld first that, whereas a purchase or sale of a security is

necessary for entitlement to sue on the implied right of ac-tion recognized under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, see

Blue ChipStamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723 (1975), the cause

of action expressly provided by $ 1964(c) of RICO imposesno such requirement limiting SIPC's standing, 908 F. 2d, at
1465-1467. Second, the appeals court held the finding of noproximate cause to be error, the result of a mistaken focus
on the causal relation between SIPC's injury and the acts ofHolmes alone; since Holmes could be held responsible for the
acts of all his co-conspirators, the Court of Appeals ex-plained, the District Court should have looked to the causal
relation between SIPC's injury and the acts of all conspira-tors.

Id., at 1467-1469.6Holmes' ensuing petition to this Court for certiorari presented two issues, whether SIPC had a right to sue under
that ruling, Vigman II, supra, holding that the District Court should have
permitted SIPC to proceed under the Birnbaum rule to the extent that
FSSC and Sebag had made unauthorized use of those customers' assets to
buy manipulated securities, as SIPC had alleged they had. Id., at 1519-
1520. On remand, after discovery, the District Court ruled that no genuine issue of material fact existed on the question of unauthorized use and
that Holmes was entitled to summary judgment. App. to Pet. for Cert.
27a. SIPC has not appealed that ruling.

6 For purposes of this decision, we will assume without deciding that the

Court of Appeals correctly held that Holmes can be held responsible for
the acts of his co-conspirators.

RICO's provision for civil actions reads that

"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by rea-son of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue

therefor in any appropriate United States district courtand shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney'sfee." 18 U. S. C. $ 1964(c).

This language can, of course, be read to mean that a plain-tiff is injured "by reason of " a RICO violation, and therefore
may recover, simply on showing that the defendant violated$ 1962,

9 the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant's viola7 The petition phrased the question as follows: "Whether a party which
was neither a purchaser nor a seller of securities, and for that reason
lacked standing to sue under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, is free of that limitation on standing
when presenting essentially the same claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (`RICO')." Pet. for Cert. i.

8 Holmes does not contest the trustees' right to sue under $ 1964(c), and

they took no part in the proceedings before this Court after we granted
certiorari on the first question alone.

9 Section 1962 lists "Prohibited activities." Before this Court, SIPC invokes only subsections (c) and (d). See Brief for Respondent 15, and n. 58.
Subsection (c) makes it "unlawful for any person . . . associated with any
enterprise . . . to . . . participate . . . in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity . . . ." Insofar as it is
relevant here, subsection (d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate subsection (c). The RICO statute defines "pattern of racketeering activity"
as "requir[ing] at least two acts of racketeering activity[,] . . . the last of
which occurred within ten years . . . after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity." $ 1961(5). The predicate offenses here at issue
are listed in 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961(1)(B) and (D) (1988 ed., Supp. II), which

tion was a "but for" cause of plaintiff 's injury. Cf. Associ-ated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459

U. S. 519, 529 (1983). This construction is hardly compelled,however, and the very unlikelihood that Congress meant to
allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover 10 persuadesus that RICO should not get such an expansive reading.

define "racketeering activity" to include "any act which is indictable under
. . . section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), [or] section 1343 (relating to
wire fraud), . . . or . . . any offense involving . . . fraud in the sale of
securities . . . ."

10 "In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward to

eternity, and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of human events,
and beyond. But any attempt to impose responsibility upon such a basis
would result in infinite liability for all wrongful acts, and would `set society
on edge and fill the courts with endless litigation.' " W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,
R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 41, p. 264
(5th ed. 1984) (quoting North v. Johnson, 58 Minn. 242, 245, 59 N. W. 1012
(1894)). As we put it in the antitrust context, "An antitrust violation may
be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow through the Nation's economy;
but despite the broad wording of $ 4 [of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 15,]
there is a point beyond which the wrongdoer should not be held liable."
Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U. S. 465, 476-477 (1982) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

11 The Courts of Appeals have overwhelmingly held that not mere factual, but proximate, causation is required. See, e. g., Pelletier v. Zweifel,
921 F. 2d 1465, 1499-1500 (CA11), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 855 (1991); Ocean
Energy II, Inc. v. Alexander & Alexander, Inc., 868 F. 2d 740, 744 (CA5
1989); Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F. 2d 1179, 1189 (CA4 1988); Sperber v.
Boesky, 849 F. 2d 60 (CA2 1988); Haroco, Inc. v. American National
Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F. 2d 384, 398 (CA7 1984), aff'd, 473
U. S. 606 (1985) (per curiam). Indeed, the court below recognized a
proximate-cause requirement. See Securities Investor Protection Corporation v. Vigman, 908 F. 2d 1461, 1468 (CA9 1990).

12 SIPC does say that the question whether its claim must, and as alleged may, satisfy the standard of proximate causation is not within the
question on which we granted certiorari. See Brief for Respondent 3, 33,
34, 38-39. However, the proximate-cause issue is "fairly included" within
that question. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a). SIPC's own restatement of
the question presented reads: "Was the Ninth Circuit correct when it held
that SIPC need not be a `purchaser or seller' of securities to sue under
Section 1964(c), which provides that `any person' may sue for `injury to

Opinion of the Court
The key to the better interpretation lies in some statutoryhistory. We have repeatedly observed, see

Agency Holding
Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 150-
151 (1987); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,
482 U. S. 220, 241 (1987); Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473
U. S. 479, 489 (1985), that Congress modeled $ 1964(c) on the
civil-action provision of the federal antitrust laws, $ 4 of the
Clayton Act, which reads in relevant part that

"any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust
laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold
the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee." 15 U. S. C. $ 15.

In Associated General Contractors, supra, we discussed
how Congress enacted $ 4 in 1914 with language borrowed
from $ 7 of the Sherman Act, passed 24 years earlier.13 Before 1914, lower federal courts had read $ 7 to incorporate
common-law principles of proximate causation, 459 U. S., at
533-534, and n. 29 (citing Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183
F. 704 (CA3 1910); Ames v. American Telephone & Telegraph
Co., 166 F. 820 (CC Mass. 1909)), and we reasoned, as many
lower federal courts had done before us, see Associated Genhis business or property' `by reason of' `any offense . . . involving fraud in
the sale of securities . . . punishable under any law of the United States,'
wire fraud, or mail fraud in violation of Section 1962?" Brief for Respondent i (ellipses in original). By thus restating the question presented (as
was its right to do, see this Court's Rule 24.2), SIPC properly set the
enquiry in the key of the language of $ 1964(c), which we hold today carries
a proximate-cause requirement within it. What is more, SIPC briefed
the proximate-cause issue, see Brief for Respondent 34-36, 38-39, and
announced at oral argument that it recognized the Court might reach it,
see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.

13 When Congress enacted $ 4 of the Clayton Act, $ 7 of the Sherman Act

read in relevant part:

"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any
other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared
to be unlawful by this act, may sue . . . ." 26 Stat. 210.

Opinion of the Court

eral Contractors, supra, at 536, n. 33 (citing cases),14 thatcongressional use of the $ 7 language in $ 4 presumably carried the intention to adopt "the judicial gloss that avoided asimple literal interpretation," 459 U. S., at 534. Thus, we
held that a plaintiff 's right to sue under $ 4 required a show-ing that the defendant's violation not only was a "but for"
cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.The reasoning applies just as readily to $ 1964(c). We may
fairly credit the 91st Congress, which enacted RICO, withknowing the interpretation federal courts had given the
words earlier Congresses had used first in $ 7 of the ShermanAct, and later in the Clayton Act's $ 4. See

Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979). It usedthe same words, and we can only assume it intended them to

have the same meaning that courts had already given them.See, e. g., Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U. S. 750, 756
(1979); Northcross v. Memphis Bd. of Ed., 412 U. S. 427, 428(1973). Proximate cause is thus required.

B
Here we use "proximate cause" to label generically thejudicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the

consequences of that person's own acts. At bottom, the no-tion of proximate cause reflects "ideas of what justice demands, or of what is administratively possible and conven-ient." W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser
and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 41, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984). Ac-cordingly, among the many shapes this concept took at common law, see Associated General Contractors, supra, at532-533, was a demand for some direct relation between the
injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged. Thus, aplaintiff who complained of harm flowing merely from the
misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant'sacts was generally said to stand at too remote a distance to

passed RICO.

recover. See, e. g., 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55-56(1882).

Although such directness of relationship is not the sole re-quirement of Clayton Act causation,

15 it has been one of its

central elements, Associated General Contractors, 459 U. S.,at 540, for a variety of reasons. First, the less direct an

injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain theamount of a plaintiff 's damages attributable to the violation,
as distinct from other, independent, factors. Id., at 542-543.Second, quite apart from problems of proving factual causation, recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would forcecourts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages
among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury fromthe violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.
Id., at 543-544; Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457U. S. 465, 473-475 (1982); Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.,
405 U. S. 251, 264 (1972). And, finally, the need to grapplewith these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct, since directly injuredvictims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as

15 We have sometimes discussed the requirement that a $ 4 plaintiff have
suffered "antitrust injury" as a component of the proximate-cause enquiry.
See Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S.
519, 538 (1983); Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U. S., at 481-484.
We need not discuss it here, however, since "antitrust injury" has no analogue in the RICO setting. See Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S.
479, 495-497 (1985).

For the same reason, there is no merit in SIPC's reliance on legislative
history to the effect that it would be inappropriate to have a "private
litigant . . . contend with a body of precedent--appropriate in a purely
antitrust context--setting strict requirements on questions such as `standing to sue' and `proximate cause.' " 115 Cong. Rec. 6995 (1969) (American
Bar Association comments on S. 2048). That statement is rightly understood to refer only to the applicability of the concept of "antitrust injury"
to RICO, which we rejected in Sedima, supra, at 495-497. See Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F. 2d, at 1189, n. 11. Besides, even if we were to read
this statement to say what SIPC says it means, it would not amount to
more than background noise drowned out by the statutory language.

Opinion of the Court

private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely. Associated General Contractors, supra, at 541-542.

We will point out in Part III-A below that the facts of
the instant case show how these reasons apply with equal
force to suits under $ 1964(c).

III
As we understand SIPC's argument, it claims entitlement
to recover, first, because it is subrogated to the rights of
those customers of the broker-dealers who did not purchase
manipulated securities, and, second, because a SIPA provision gives it an independent right to sue. The first claim
fails because the conspirators' conduct did not proximately
cause the nonpurchasing customers' injury, the second because the provision relied on gives SIPC no right to sue for
damages.

A

As a threshold matter, SIPC's theory of subrogation is
fraught with unanswered questions. In suing Holmes, SIPC
does not rest its claimed subrogation to the rights of the
broker-dealers' customers on any provision of SIPA. See
Brief for Respondent 38, and n. 181. SIPC assumes that
SIPA provides for subrogation to the customers' claims
against the failed broker-dealers, see 15 U. S. C. $$ 78fff-3(a),
78fff-4(c); see also $ 78fff-2(c)(1)(C); see generally Mishkin v.
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 744 F. Supp. 531, 556-557
(SDNY 1990), but not against third parties like Holmes. As
against him, SIPC relies rather on "common law rights of
subrogation" for what it describes as "its money paid to customers for customer claims against third parties." Brief for
Respondent 38 (footnote omitted). At oral argument in this
Court, SIPC narrowed its subrogation argument to cover
only the rights of customers who never purchased manipu503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT

271Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
lated securities. Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.16 But SIPC stops
there, leaving us to guess at the nature of the "common law
rights of subrogation" that it claims, and failing to tell us
whether they derive from federal or state common law, or, if
the latter, from common law of which State.17 Nor does
SIPC explain why it declines to assert the rights of customers who bought manipulated securities.18

It is not these questions, however, that stymie SIPC's subrogation claim, for even assuming, arguendo, that it may
stand in the shoes of nonpurchasing customers, the link is
too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the
customers' harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-dealers. That is, the conspirators have
allegedly injured these customers only insofar as the stock
manipulation first injured the broker-dealers and left them
without the wherewithal to pay customers' claims. Although the customers' claims are senior (in recourse to "customer property") to those of the broker-dealers' general
creditors, see $ 78fff-2(c)(1), the causes of their respective
injuries are the same: The broker-dealers simply cannot pay
their bills, and only that intervening insolvency connects the
conspirators' acts to the losses suffered by the nonpurchasing
customers and general creditors.

As we said, however, in Associated General Contractors,
quoting Justice Holmes, " `The general tendency of the law,
in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first
step.' " 459 U. S., at 534 (quoting Southern Pacific Co. v.

16 And, SIPC made no allegation that any of these customers failed to
do so in reliance on acts or omissions of the conspirators.

17 There is support for the proposition that SIPC can assert statelaw subrogation rights against third parties. See Redington v. Touche
Ross & Co., 592 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA2 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 442
U. S. 560 (1979). We express no opinion on this issue.

18 The record reveals that those customers have brought their own suit

against the conspirators.

Opinion of the Court

Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U. S. 531, 533 (1918)),19 andthe reasons that supported conforming Clayton Act causation to the general tendency apply just as readily to the pres-ent facts, underscoring the obvious congressional adoption of
the Clayton Act direct-injury limitation among the require-ments of $ 1964(c).

20 If the nonpurchasing customers were

19 SIPC tries to avoid foundering on the rule that creditors generally
may not sue for injury affecting their debtors' solvency by arguing that
those customers that owned manipulated securities themselves were victims of Holmes' fraud. See Brief for Respondent 39, n. 185 (citing Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F. 2d 1271, 1280 (CA7 1989); Ocean Energy,
868 F. 2d, at 744-747; Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 859 F. 2d 1096, 1100-
1101 (CA2 1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1007 (1989)). While that may well
be true, since SIPC does not claim subrogation to the rights of the customers that purchased manipulated securities, see supra, at 270-271, it gains
nothing by the point.

We further note that SIPC alleged in the courts below that, in late May
1981, Joseph Lugo, an officer of FSSC and one of the alleged conspirators,
parked manipulated stock in the accounts of customers, among them
Holmes, who actively participated in the parking transaction involving his
account. See Statement of Background and Facts, 1 App. 223-225. Lugo
"sold" securities owned by FSSC to customers at market price and
"bought" back the same securities some days later at the same price plus
interest. Under applicable regulations, a broker-dealer must discount the
stock it holds in its own account, see 17 CFR $ 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(F)(1)(vi)
(1991), and the sham transactions allowed FSSC to avoid the discount.
But for the parking transactions, FSSC would allegedly have failed capital
requirements sooner; would have been shut down by regulators; and would
not have dragged Sebag with it in its demise. 1 App. 231. Thus, their
customers would have been injured to a lesser extent. Id., at 229, 231.
We do not rule out that, if, by engaging in the parking transactions, the
conspirators committed mail fraud, wire fraud, or "fraud in the sale of
securities," see 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961(1)(B) and (D) (1988 ed., Supp. I), the
broker-dealers' customers might be proximately injured by these offenses.
See, e. g., Taffet v. Southern Co., 930 F. 2d 847, 856-857 (CA11 1991);
County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 907 F. 2d 1295, 1311-1312
(CA2 1990). However this may be, SIPC in its brief on the merits places
exclusive reliance on a manipulation theory and is completely silent about
the alleged parking scheme.

20 As we said in Associated General Contractors, "the infinite variety of

claims that may arise make it virtually impossible to announce a blackletter rule that will dictate the result in every case." 459 U. S., at 536

allowed to sue, the district court would first need to deter-mine the extent to which their inability to collect from the

broker-dealers was the result of the alleged conspiracy tomanipulate, as opposed to, say, the broker-dealers' poor business practices or their failures to anticipate developments inthe financial markets. Assuming that an appropriate assessment of factual causation could be made out, the districtcourt would then have to find some way to apportion the
possible respective recoveries by the broker-dealers and thecustomers, who would otherwise each be entitled to recover
the full treble damages. Finally, the law would be shoulder-ing these difficulties despite the fact that those directly
injured, the broker-dealers, could be counted on to bring suitfor the law's vindication. As noted above, the brokerdealers have in fact sued in this case, in the persons of theirSIPA trustees appointed on account of their insolvency.

(footnote omitted). Thus, our use of the term "direct" should merely be
understood as a reference to the proximate-cause enquiry that is informed
by the concerns set out in the text. We do not necessarily use it in the
same sense as courts before us have and intimate no opinion on results
they reached. See, e. g., Sedima, 473 U. S., at 497, n. 15; id., at 522 (Marshall, J., dissenting); Pelletier, 921 F. 2d, at 1499-1500; Ocean Energy,
supra.

21 If the trustees had not brought suit, SIPC likely could have forced

their hands. To the extent consistent with SIPA, bankruptcy principles
apply to liquidations under that statute. See $ 78fff(b); see also $ 78fff-
1(b) (to extent consistent with SIPA, SIPA trustee has same duties as
trustee under Chapter 7 of Bankruptcy Code); $ 78eee(b)(2)(A)(iii) (to extent consistent with SIPA, court supervising SIPA liquidation has same
powers and duties as bankruptcy court). And, it is generally held that a
creditor can, by petitioning the bankruptcy court for an order to that
effect, compel the trustee to institute suit against a third party. See In
re Automated Business Systems, Inc., 642 F. 2d 200, 201 (CA6 1981). As
a practical matter, it is very unlikely that SIPC will have to petition a
court for such an order, given its influence over SIPA trustees. See

$ 78eee(b)(3) (court must appoint as trustee "such perso[n] as SIPC, in its
sole discretion, specifies," which in certain circumstances may be SIPC
itself); $ 78eee(b)(5)(C) (SIPC's recommendation to court on trustee's compensation is entitled to "considerable reliance" and is, under certain circumstances, binding).

274 HOLMES v. SECURITIES INVESTOR

PROTECTION CORPORATION

Opinion of the Court

Indeed, the insolvency of the victim directly injured adds a
further concern to those already expressed, since a suit by
an indirectly injured victim could be an attempt to circumvent the relative priority its claim would have in the directly
injured victim's liquidation proceedings. See Mid-State
Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange National Bank of Chicago, 877
F. 2d 1333, 1336 (CA7 1989).

As against the force of these considerations of history and
policy, SIPC's reliance on the congressional admonition that
RICO be "liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes," $ 904(a), 84 Stat. 947, does not deflect our analysis.
There is, for that matter, nothing illiberal in our construction: We hold not that RICO cannot serve to right the conspirators' wrongs, but merely that the nonpurchasing customers, or SIPC in their stead, are not proper plaintiffs.
Indeed, we fear that RICO's remedial purposes would more
probably be hobbled than helped by SIPC's version of liberal
construction: Allowing suits by those injured only indirectly
would open the door to "massive and complex damages litigation[, which would] not only burde[n] the courts, but [would]
also undermin[e] the effectiveness of treble-damages suits."
Associated General Contractors, 459 U. S., at 545.

In sum, subrogation to the rights of the manipulation conspiracy's secondary victims does, and should, run afoul of
proximate-causation standards, and SIPC must wait on the
outcome of the trustees' suit. If they recover from Holmes,
SIPC may share according to the priority SIPA gives its
claim. See 15 U. S. C. $ 78fff-2(c).

B
SIPC also claims a statutory entitlement to pursue Holmes
for funds advanced to the trustees for administering the liquidation proceedings. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. Its theory
here apparently is not one of subrogation, to which the statute makes no reference in connection with SIPC's obligation

275Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
to make such advances. See 15 U. S. C. $ 78fff-3(b)(2).22SIPC relies instead, see Brief for Respondent 37, and n. 180,

on this SIPA provision:

"SIPC participation--SIPC shall be deemed to be aparty in interest as to all matters arising in a liquidation

proceeding, with the right to be heard on all such mat-ters, and shall be deemed to have intervened with respect to all such matters with the same force and effectas if a petition for such purpose had been allowed by the
court." 15 U. S. C. $ 78eee(d).
The language is inapposite to the issue here, however. Onits face, it simply qualifies SIPC as a proper party in interest

in any "matter arising in a liquidation proceeding" as towhich it "shall be deemed to have intervened." By extending a right to be heard in a "matter" pending between otherparties, however, the statute says nothing about the conditions necessary for SIPC's recovery as a plaintiff. How theprovision could be read, either alone or with $ 1964(c), to give

and III, our discussion of the issue would be unnecessary tothe resolution of this case. Nor do we think that leaving

this question unanswered will deprive the lower courts ofmuch-needed guidance. A review of the conflicting cases
shows that all could have been resolved on proximate-causation grounds, and that none involved litigants like those
in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723(1975), persons who had decided to forgo securities transactions in reliance on misrepresentations. Thus, we think itinopportune to resolve the issue today.

We hold that, because the alleged conspiracy to manipulatedid not proximately cause the injury claimed, SIPC's allegations and the record before us fail to make out a right to suepetitioner under $ 1964(c). We reverse the judgment of the

(RICO), 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1961-1968(1988 ed. and Supp. II), have a proximate cause element, and

granted certiorari. In resolving that question, I would hold

that a plaintiff need not be a purchaser or a seller to assertRICO claims predicated on violations of fraud in the sale

amination of the text of RICO, and a comparison with the
situation the Court confronted in Blue Chip Stamps, persuades me that the Court of Appeals' determination was
correct. Because the Court's decision today leaves intact a
division among the Circuits on whether Blue Chip Stamps'
standing requirement applies in RICO suits,2 I would affirm
this portion of the decision below, even though we go on to
hold that the alleged RICO violation did not proximately
cause SIPC's injuries.

Our obvious starting point is the text of the statute under
which SIPC sued. RICO makes it unlawful for any person
who has engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity" to
invest, maintain an interest, or participate in an enterprise
that is engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. 18
U. S. C. $ 1962. "[R]acketeering activity" is defined to include a number of state and federal offenses, including any
act indictable under 18 U. S. C. $ 1341 (1988 ed., Supp. II)
(mail fraud) or $ 1343 (wire fraud), and "any offense involving
. . . fraud in the sale of securities . . . punishable under any
law of the United States." $ 1961(1). RICO authorizes
"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason
of a violation of section 1962" to sue for treble damages in
federal court. $ 1964(c).

RICO's civil suit provision, considered on its face, has no
purchaser/seller standing requirement. The statute sweeps

broadly, authorizing "[a]ny person" who is injured by reason
of a RICO violation to sue. "[P]erson" is defined to include
"any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property." $ 1961(3) (emphasis added). "Insofar as `any' encompasses `all'," Mobil Oil Exploration &
Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United Distribution Cos., 498
U. S. 211, 223 (1991), the words "any person" cannot reasonably be read to mean only purchasers and sellers of securities. As we have explained in rejecting previous efforts to
narrow the scope of civil RICO: "If the defendant engages in
a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner forbidden by
[$ 1962's] provisions, and the racketeering activities injure
the plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has
a claim under $ 1964(c). There is no room in the statutory
language for an additional . . . requirement." Sedima,
S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 495 (1985).

Of course, a RICO plaintiff "only has standing if, and can
only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his
business or property by [reason of] the conduct constituting
the violation." Id., at 496. We have already remarked that
the requirement of injury in one's "business or property"
limits the availability of RICO's civil remedies to those who
have suffered injury in fact. Id., at 497 (citing Haroco, Inc.
v. American National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 747
F. 2d 384, 398 (CA7 1984)). Today, the Court sensibly holds
that the statutory words "by reason of " operate, as they do
in the antitrust laws, to confine RICO's civil remedies to
those whom the defendant has truly injured in some meaningful sense. Requiring a proximate relationship between
the defendant's actions and the plaintiff 's harm, however,
cannot itself preclude a nonpurchaser or nonseller of securities, alleging predicate acts of fraud in the sale of securities,
from bringing suit under $ 1964(c). Although the words "injury in [one's] business or property" and "by reason of " are
words of limitation, they do not categorically exclude non503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

purchasers and nonsellers of securities from the universe ofRICO plaintiffs.

Petitioner argues that the civil suit provisions of $ 1964(c)are not as sweeping as they appear because $ 1964(c) incorporates the standing requirements of the predicate acts alleged. But $ 1964(c) focuses on the "injur[y]" of any "per-son," not the legal right to sue of any proper plaintiff for a

predicate act. If standing were to be determined by refer-ence to the predicate offenses, a private RICO plaintiff could
not allege as predicates many of the acts that constitute thedefinition of racketeering activity. The great majority of
acts listed in $ 1961(1) are criminal offenses for which only a
State or the Federal Government is the proper party to
bring suit. In light of $ 1964(c)'s provision that "any person"
injured by reason of a RICO violation may sue, I would not
accept that this same section envisions an overlay of standing requirements from the predicate acts, with the result
that many RICO suits could be brought only by government entities.

Nor can I accept the contention that, even if $ 1964(c) does
not normally incorporate the standing requirements of the
predicate acts, an exception should be made for "fraud in the
sale of securities" simply because it is well established that
a plaintiff in a civil action under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 must
be either a purchaser or seller of securities. A careful reading of $ 1961(1) reveals the flaw in this argument. The relevant predicate offense is "any offense involving . . . fraud in
the sale of securities . . . punishable under any law of the
United States." The embracing words "offense . . . punishable under any law of the United States" plainly signify the
elements necessary to bring a criminal prosecution. See
Trane Co. v. O'Connor Securities, 718 F. 2d 26, 29 (CA2
1983); Dan River, Inc. v. Icahn, 701 F. 2d 278, 291 (CA4 1983).
To the extent that RICO's reference to an "offense involving
fraud in the sale of securities" encompasses conduct that violates $ 10(b), see infra, at 282-283, the relevant predicate is

281Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
defined not by $ 10(b) itself, but rather by $ 32(a) of the 1934Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 78ff(a), which authorizes criminal sanctions

against any person who willfully violates the Act or rulespromulgated thereunder. As we have previously made
clear, the purchaser/seller standing requirement for private
civil actions under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is of no import incriminal prosecutions for willful violations of those provisions. United States v. Naftalin, 441 U. S. 768, 774, n. 6(1979);

SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U. S. 453, 467,
n. 9 (1969). Thus, even if Congress intended RICO's civilsuit provision to subsume established civil standing requirements for predicate offenses, that situation is not presented
here.

Although the civil suit provisions of $ 1964(c) lack a
purchaser/seller requirement, it is still possible that one
lurks in $ 1961(1)'s catalog of predicate acts; i. e., it is possible
that $ 1961(1) of its own force limits RICO standing to the
actual parties to a sale. As noted above, the statute defines
"racketeering activity" to include "any offense involving . . .
fraud in the sale of securities . . . punishable under any law
of the United States." Unfortunately, the term "fraud in
the sale of securities" is not further defined. "[A]ny offense
. . . punishable under any law of the United States" presumably means that Congress intended to refer to the federal
securities laws and not common-law tort actions for fraud.
Unlike most of the predicate offenses listed in $ 1961(1), however, there is no cross-reference to any specific sections of
the United States Code. Nor is resort to the legislative history helpful in clarifying what kinds of securities violations
Congress contemplated would be covered. See generally
Bridges, Private RICO Litigation Based Upon "Fraud in the
Sale of Securities," 18 Ga. L. Rev. 43, 58-59 (1983) (discussing

which we need not definitively resolve here. The statuteunmistakably requires that there be fraud, sufficiently willful

to constitute a criminal violation, and that there be a sale ofsecurities. At the same time, however, I am persuaded that
Congress' use of the word "sale" in defining the predicateoffense does not

necessarily dictate that a RICO plaintiffhave been a party to an executed sale.

Section 1961(1)'s list of racketeering offenses provides theRICO predicates for both criminal prosecutions and civil
actions. Obviously there is no requirement that the Gov-ernment be party to a sale before it can bring a RICO prosecution predicated on "fraud in the sale of securities."Accordingly, any argument that the offense itself embodies
a standing requirement must apply only to private ac-tions. That distinction is not tenable, however. By including a private right of action in RICO, Congress intended tobring "the pressure of `private attorneys general' on a serious national problem for which public prosecutorial re-sources [were] deemed inadequate."

in tension with our reasoning in Blue Chip Stamps. In thatcase, the Court admitted that it was not "able to divine from

the language of $ 10(b) the express `intent of Congress' as tothe contours of a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5."
421 U. S., at 737. The purchaser/seller standing limitationin Rule 10b-5 damages actions thus does not stem from a
construction of the phrase "in connection with the purchaseor sale of any security." Rather, it rests on the relationship
between $ 10(b) and other provisions of the securities laws,
id., at 733-736, and the practical difficulties in grantingstanding in the absence of an executed transaction, id., at

737-749, neither of which are relevant in the RICO context.Arguably, even if $ 10(b)'s reference to fraud "

in connec-tion with" the sale of a security is insufficient to limit the

plaintiff class to purchasers and sellers, $ 1961(1)'s referenceto fraud "in" the sale of a security performs just such a narrowing function. But we have previously had occasion toexpress reservations on the validity of that distinction. In
United States v. Naftalin, 441 U. S. 768 (1979), we reinstatedthe conviction of a professional investor who engaged in
fraudulent "short selling" by placing orders with brokers tosell shares of stock which he falsely represented that he
owned. This Court agreed with the District Court thatNaftalin was guilty of fraud "in" the "offer" or "sale" of securities in violation of $ 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933,15 U. S. C. $ 77q(a)(1), even though the fraud was perpetrated
on the brokers, not their purchasing clients. The Courtnoted:

"[Naftalin] contends that the requirement that thefraud be `in' the offer or sale connotes a narrower range
of activities than does the phrase `in connection with,'which is found in $ 10(b) . . . . First, we are not necessarily persuaded that `in' is narrower than `in connectionwith.' Both Congress, see H. R. Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong.,
1st Sess., 6 (1933), and this Court, see Superintendentof Insurance v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 404 U. S. 6, 10

(1971), have on occasion used the terms interchangeably.But even if `in' were meant to connote a narrower group

of transactions than `in connection with,' there is noth-ing to indicate that `in' is narrower in the sense insisted
upon by Naftalin." 441 U. S., at 773, n. 4.
So also in today's case. To the extent that there is ameaningful difference between Congress' choice of "in" as

opposed to "in connection with," I do not view it as limitingthe class of RICO plaintiffs to those who were parties to a
sale. Rather, consistent with today's decision, I view it asconfining the class of defendants to those proximately responsible for the plaintiff 's injury and excluding those onlytangentially "connect[ed] with" it.

In Blue Chip Stamps, we adopted the purchaser/sellerstanding limitation in $ 10(b) cases as a prudential means of
avoiding the problems of proof when no security was tradedand the nuisance potential of vexatious litigation. 421 U. S.,
at 738-739. In that case, however, we were confronted withlimiting access to a private cause of action that was judicially
implied. We expressly acknowledged that "if Congress hadlegislated the elements of a private cause of action for damages, the duty of the Judicial Branch would be to administerthe law which Congress enacted; the Judiciary may not circumscribe a right which Congress has conferred because ofany disagreement it might have with Congress about the
wisdom of creating so expansive a liability." Id., at 748. Tobe sure, the problems of expansive standing identified in
Blue Chip Stamps are exacerbated in RICO. In addition tothe threat of treble damages, a defendant faces the stigma
of being labeled a "racketeer." Nonetheless, Congress haslegislated the elements of a private cause of action under
RICO. Specifically, Congress has authorized "[a]ny personinjured in his business or property by reason of " a RICO
violation to bring suit under $1964(c). Despite the very realspecter of vexatious litigation based on speculative damages,
it is within Congress' power to create a private right of ac503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT

tion for plaintiffs who have neither bought nor sold securi-ties. For the reasons stated above, I think Congress has

done so. "That being the case, the courts are without au-thority to restrict the application of the statute."

United
States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 587 (1981).

In sum, we granted certiorari to resolve a split among theCircuits as to whether a nonpurchaser or nonseller of securities could assert RICO claims predicated on violations of$ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See cases cited n. 1,

supra. I recognize that, like the case below, some of those decisionsmight have been more appropriately cast in terms of proximate causation. That we have now more clearly articulatedthe causation element of a civil RICO action does not change
the fact that the governing precedent in several Circuits is
in disagreement as to Blue Chip Stamps' applicability in the
RICO context. Because that issue was decided below and
fully addressed here, we should resolve it today. I would
sustain the Court of Appeals' determination that RICO
plaintiffs alleging predicate acts of fraud in the sale of securities need not be actual purchasers or sellers of the securities
at issue. Accordingly, I join all of the Court's opinion except
Part IV.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with Justice O'Connor that in deciding this case
we ought to reach, rather than avoid, the question on which
we granted certiorari. I also agree with her on the answer
to that question: that the purchaser-seller rule does not
apply in civil RICO cases alleging as predicate acts violations of Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5,
17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 (1991). My reasons for that conclusion,
however, are somewhat different from hers.

The ultimate question here is statutory standing: whether
the so-called nexus (mandatory legalese for "connection") between the harm of which this plaintiff complains and the defendant's so-called predicate acts is of the sort that will sup503us2$47J 11-16-95 13:15:57 PAGES OPINPGT

287Cite as: 503 U. S. 258 (1992)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
port an action under civil RICO. See Sedima, S. P. R. L. v.Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 497 (1985). One of the usual elements of statutory standing is proximate causality. It is re-quired in RICO not so much because RICO has language
similar to that of the Clayton Act, which in turn has languagesimilar to that of the Sherman Act, which, by the time the
Clayton Act had been passed, had been interpreted to in-clude a proximate-cause requirement; but rather, I think, because it has always been the practice of common-law courts(and probably of all courts, under all legal systems) to require as a condition of recovery, unless the legislature
specifically prescribes otherwise, that the injury have been
proximately caused by the offending conduct. Life is tooshort to pursue every human act to its most remote consequences; "for want of a nail, a kingdom was lost" is a com-mentary on fate, not the statement of a major cause of action
against a blacksmith. See Associated General Contractors
of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 536 (1983).

Yet another element of statutory standing is compliancewith what I shall call the "zone-of-interests" test, which

seeks to determine whether, apart from the directness of the
injury, the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought tobe benefited by the provision at issue.* Judicial inference

of a zone-of-interests requirement, like judicial inference ofa proximate-cause requirement, is a background practice
against which Congress legislates. See Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 345-348 (1984).
Sometimes considerable limitations upon the zone of inter-ests are set forth explicitly in the statute itself--but rarely,

if ever, are those limitations so complete that they are

*My terminology may not be entirely orthodox. It may be that proximate causality is itself an element of the zone-of-interests test as that
phrase has ordinarily been used, see, e. g., Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502
U. S. 437, 473 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting), but that usage would leave
us bereft of terminology to connote those aspects of the "violation-injury
connection" aspect of standing that are distinct from proximate causality.

deemed to preclude the judicial inference of others. If, forexample, a securities fraud statute specifically conferred a

cause of action upon "all purchasers, sellers, or owners ofstock injured by securities fraud," I doubt whether a stockholder who suffered a heart attack upon reading a false earnings report could recover his medical expenses. So alsohere. The phrase "any person injured in his business or

property by reason of " the unlawful activities makes clearthat the zone of interests does not extend

beyond those injured in that respect--but does not necessarily mean thatit includes

all those injured in that respect. Just as the
phrase does not exclude normal judicial inference of proximate cause, so also it does not exclude normal judicial inference of zone of interests.

It seems to me obvious that the proximate-cause test and
the zone-of-interests test that will be applied to the various
causes of action created by 18 U. S. C. $ 1964 are not uniform,
but vary according to the nature of the criminal offenses
upon which those causes of action are based. The degree of
proximate causality required to recover damages caused by
predicate acts of sports bribery, for example, see 18 U. S. C.

$ 224, will be quite different from the degree required for
damages caused by predicate acts of transporting stolen
property, see 18 U. S. C. $$ 2314-2315. And so also with the
applicable zone-of-interests test: It will vary with the underlying violation. (Where the predicate acts consist of different criminal offenses, presumably the plaintiff would have to
be within the degree of proximate causality and within the
zone of interests as to all of them.)

It also seems to me obvious that unless some reason for
making a distinction exists, the background zone-of-interests
test applied to one cause of action for harm caused by violation of a particular criminal provision should be the same as
the test applied to another cause of action for harm caused
by violation of the same provision. It is principally in this
respect that I differ from Justice O'Connor's analysis,

ante, at 280 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment). If, for example, one statute gives persons injured by

a particular criminal violation a cause of action for damages,and another statute gives them a cause of action for equitable relief, the persons coming within the zone of interests of
those two statutes would be identical. Hence the relevanceto this case of our decision in

Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor
Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723 (1975). The predicate acts ofsecurities fraud alleged here are violations of Rule 10b-5;

and we held in Blue Chip Stamps that the zone of interestsfor civil damages attributable to violation of that provision
does not include persons who are not purchasers or sellers.
As I have described above, just as RICO's statutory phrase
"injured in his business or property by reason of " does not
extend the rule of proximate causation otherwise applied to
congressionally created causes of action, so also it should not
extend the otherwise applicable rule of zone of interests.

What prevents that proposition from being determinative
here, however, is the fact that Blue Chip Stamps did not
involve application of the background zone-of-interests rule
to a congressionally created Rule 10b-5 action, but rather
specification of the contours of a Rule 10b-5 action "implied"
(i. e., created) by the Court itself--a practice we have since
happily abandoned, see, e. g., Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 568-571, 575-576 (1979). The policies
that we identified in Blue Chip Stamps, supra, as supporting
the purchaser-seller limitation (namely, the difficulty of assessing the truth of others' claims, see id., at 743-747, and
the high threat of "strike" or nuisance suits in securities litigation, see id., at 740-741) are perhaps among the factors
properly taken into account in determining the zone of interests covered by a statute, but they are surely not alone
enough to restrict standing to purchasers or sellers under a
text that contains no hint of such a limitation. I think, in
other words, that the limitation we approved in Blue Chip
Stamps was essentially a legislative judgment rather than an

interpretive one. Cf. Franklin v. Gwinnett County PublicSchools, ante, at 77 (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).It goes beyond the customary leeway that the zone-ofinterests test leaves to courts in the construction of statu-tory texts.

In my view, therefore, the Court of Appeals correctly re-jected the assertion that SIPC had no standing because it
was not a purchaser or seller of the securities in question.A proximate-cause requirement also applied, however, and I
agree with the Court that that was not met. For these rea-sons, I concur in the judgment.

UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 90-1577. Argued December 10, 1991--Decided March 24, 1992
Because certain conduct of respondent R. L. C. at age 16 would have constituted the crime of involuntary manslaughter under 18 U. S. C.

$$ 1112(a) and 1153 if committed by an adult, the District Court held that
he had committed an act of juvenile delinquency within the meaning of
the Juvenile Delinquency Act. In light of a provision of that Act requiring the length of official detention in certain circumstances to be
limited to "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult,"

$ 5037(c)(1)(B), the court committed R. L. C. to detention for three years,
the maximum sentence for involuntary manslaughter under $ 1112(b).
Reading $ 5037(c)(1)(B) to bar a juvenile term longer than the sentence
a court could impose on a similarly situated adult after applying the
United States Sentencing Guidelines, and finding that the Guidelines
would yield a maximum sentence of 21 months for an adult in R. L. C.'s
circumstances, the Court of Appeals vacated his sentence and remanded
for resentencing.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
915 F. 2d 320, affirmed.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II-A, and III, concluding:

1. Plain-meaning analysis does not compel adoption of the Government's construction that the word "authorized" in $ 5037(c)(1)(B) must
refer to the maximum term of imprisonment provided for by the statute
defining the offense. At least equally consistent, and arguably more
natural, is the construction that "authorized" refers to the result of
applying all statutes with a required bearing on the sentencing decision,
including not only those that empower the court to sentence but those
that limit the legitimacy of its exercise of that power, including $ 3553(b),
which requires application of the Guidelines and caps an adult sentence
at the top of the relevant Guideline range, absent circumstances warranting departure. Thus, the most that can be said from examining the
text in its present form is that the Government may claim its preferred
construction to be one possible resolution of statutory ambiguity.

2. The $ 5037(c)(1)(B) limitation refers to the maximum sentence that
could be imposed if the juvenile were being sentenced after application
of the Guidelines. Although determining the maximum permissible
sentence under $ 5037(c)(1)(B) will require sentencing and reviewing
courts to determine an appropriate Guideline range in juveniledelinquency proceedings, it does not require plenary application of the
Guidelines to juvenile delinquents. Where the statutory provision
applies, a sentencing court's concern with the Guidelines goes solely to
the upper limit of the proper Guideline range as setting the maximum
term for which a juvenile may be committed to official detention,
absent circumstances that would warrant departure under $ 3553(b).
Pp. 306-307.

Justice Souter, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White, and
Justice Stevens, delivered an opinion with respect to Parts II-B and
II-C, concluding that:

1. The textual evolution of $ 5037(c)(1)(B) and the relevant legislative
history reinforce the conclusion that the section is better understood to
refer to the maximum sentence permitted under $ 3553(b). Whereas
the predecessor of $ 5037(c) spoke in terms of the "maximum term which
could have been imposed on an adult" (emphasis added), the current
version's reference to "the juvenile," on its face suggests a change in
reference from abstract considerations to a focused inquiry into the circumstances of the particular juvenile. Although an intervening version
referred to the maximum sentence "that would be authorized by section
3581(b) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult" (emphasis added), the emphasized language was quickly deleted, resulting in
the present statutory text. The legislative history demonstrates that
Congress intended the deletion to conform juvenile and adult maximum
sentences, in that $ 3581(b), which catalogs such sentences for federal
offenses by reference to their relative seriousness, could in some circumstances have appeared to authorize a longer sentence for a juvenile than
an adult would have received. Absent promulgation of the Guidelines,
the deletion might have left the question of the "authorized" maximum
to be determined by reference to the penalty provided by the statute
creating the offense. However, Congress' purpose today can be
achieved only by reading "authorized" to refer to the maximum sentence
that may be imposed consistently with $ 3553(b), which will generally
provide a ceiling more favorable to the juvenile than that contained in
the offense-defining statute. It hardly seems likely that Congress
adopted the current $ 5037(c) without intending the recently enacted
Guidelines scheme to be considered for the purpose of conforming juvenile and adult sentences. Pp. 298-305.

2. No ambiguity about the statute's intended scope survives the foregoing analysis, but, if any did, the construction yielding the shorter sentence would be chosen under the rule of lenity. That rule's application
is unnecessary in this case, however, since this Court has "always
reserved lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute's intended scope even after resort to `the language
and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies' of the statute." Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (citation omitted).
Pp. 305-306.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas,
concluded that it is not consistent with the rule of lenity to construe a
textually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the
basis of legislative history. Once it is determined that the statutory
text is ambiguous, the rule requires that the more lenient interpretation
prevail. In approving reliance on a statute's "motivating policies,"
Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108, seems contrary to Hughey
v. United States, 495 U. S. 411, 422. And insofar as Moskal requires
consideration of legislative history at all, it compromises the purposes
of the lenity rule: to assure that criminal statutes provide fair warning
of what conduct is rendered illegal, see, e. g., McBoyle v. United States,
283 U. S. 25, 27, and to assure that society, through its representatives,
has genuinely called for the punishment to be meted out, see, e. g.,
United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348. While the Court has considered legislative history in construing criminal statutes before, it appears
that only one case, Dixson v. United States, 465 U. S. 482, has relied on
legislative history to "clarify" an ambiguous statute against a criminal
defendant's interest. Dixson does not discuss the implications of its
decision, and both of the cases it cites in supposed support of its holding
found the statute at hand not to be facially ambiguous. Pp. 307-311.

Justice Thomas agreed with Justice Scalia that the use of legislative history to construe an otherwise ambiguous penal statute against
a criminal defendant is difficult to reconcile with the rule of lenity. The
rule operates, however, only if ambiguity remains even after a court has
applied established principles of construction to the statutory text.
See, e. g., Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 463. Although
knowledge of these principles is imputed to the citizenry, there appears
scant justification for also requiring knowledge of extralegal materials
such as legislative history. Pp. 311-312.

The provisions of the Juvenile Delinquency Act require thelength of official detention in certain circumstances to be limited to "the maximum term of imprisonment that would beauthorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an
adult." 18 U. S. C. $ 5037(c)(1)(B). We hold that this limita-tion refers to the maximum sentence that could be imposed

the Red Lake Indian Reservation, which is within Indian

country as defined by federal law. These circumstances provide federal jurisdiction in this case. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 1151,
1162, 1153. Upon certifying that a proceeding was authorized in federal court under $ 5032 on the ground that no state
court had jurisdiction over the offense, the Government
charged R. L. C. with an act of juvenile delinquency.

After a bench trial, the District Court found R. L. C. to be
a juvenile who had driven a car recklessly while intoxicated
and without the owner's authorization, causing Mountain's
death. R. L. C. was held to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency within the meaning of $ 5031, since his acts
would have been the crime of involuntary manslaughter in
violation of $$ 1112(a) and 1153 if committed by an adult.
The maximum sentence for involuntary manslaughter under
18 U. S. C. $ 1112(b) is three years. At R. L. C.'s dispositional hearing, the District Court granted the Government's
request to impose the maximum penalty for respondent's delinquency and accordingly committed him to official detention for three years.

Despite the manslaughter statute's provision for an adult
sentence of that length, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit vacated R. L. C.'s sentence and remanded for resentencing, after concluding that 36 months
exceeded the cap imposed by $ 5037(c)(1)(B) upon the period
of detention to which a juvenile delinquent may be sentenced. 915 F. 2d 320 (1990). Although the statute merely
provides that juvenile detention may not extend beyond "the
maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if
the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult," 1 the

296 UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.

Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals read this language to bar a juvenile term
longer than the sentence a court could have imposed on a
similarly situated adult after applying the United States
Sentencing Guidelines. Under the Guidelines, involuntary
manslaughter caused by recklessness has a base offense level
of 14. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual $ 2A1.4(a)(2) (Nov. 1991). The court found, and the
Government agrees, see Brief for United States 22, n. 5, that
because R. L. C. had the lowest possible criminal history
level, Category I, the Guidelines would yield a sentencing
range of 15-21 months for a similarly situated adult. The
Court of Appeals therefore concluded that the maximum period of detention to which R. L. C. could be sentenced was
21 months.

The Government sought no stay of mandate from the
Court of Appeals, and on remand the District Court imposed
detention for 18 months. Although R. L. C. has now served
this time, his failure to complete the 3-year detention originally imposed and the possibility that the remainder of it
could be imposed saves the case from mootness. See United
States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S. 579, 581, n. 2 (1983).
We granted the Government's petition for certiorari, 501
U. S. 1230 (1991), to resolve the conflict between the Eighth
Circuit's holding in this case and the Ninth Circuit's position, adopted in United States v. Marco L., 868 F. 2d 1121,

"(A) the date when the juvenile becomes twenty-one years old; or
"(B) the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if
the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult; or

"(A) who if convicted as an adult would be convicted of a Class A, B, or

Government.

II

A

The Government suggests a straightforward enquiry into
plain meaning to explain what is "authorized." It argues
that the word "authorized" must mean the maximum term
of imprisonment provided for by the statute defining the offense, since only Congress can "authorize" a term of imprisonment in punishment for a crime. As against the position
that the Sentencing Guidelines now circumscribe a trial
court's authority, the Government insists that our concern
must be with the affirmative authority for imposing a sentence, which necessarily stems from statutory law. It maintains that in any event the Sentencing Commission's congressional authorization to establish sentencing guidelines does
not create affirmative authority to set punishments for
crime, and that the Guidelines do not purport to authorize
the punishments to which they relate.

But this is too easy. The answer to any suggestion that
the statutory character of a specific penalty provision gives
it primacy over administrative sentencing guidelines is that
the mandate to apply the Guidelines is itself statutory. See
18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b). More significantly, the Government's
argument that "authorization" refers only to what is affirmatively provided by penal statutes, without reference to the
Sentencing Guidelines to be applied under statutory mandate, seems to us to beg the question. Of course it is true
that no penalty would be "authorized" without a statute
providing specifically for the penal consequences of defined
criminal activity. The question, however, is whether Congress intended the courts to treat the upper limit of such a
penalty as "authorized" even when proper application of a
statutorily mandated Guideline in an adult case would bar
imposition up to the limit, and an unwarranted upward de503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Souter, J.
parture from the proper Guideline range would be reversible
error. $ 3742. Here it suffices to say that the Government's
construction is by no means plain. The text is at least
equally consistent with treating "authorized" to refer to the
result of applying all statutes with a required bearing on the
sentencing decision, including not only those that empower
the court to sentence but those that limit the legitimacy of its
exercise of that power. This, indeed, is arguably the more
natural construction.

Plain-meaning analysis does not, then, provide the Government with a favorable answer. The most that can be said
from examining the text in its present form is that the Government may claim its preferred construction to be one possible resolution of statutory ambiguity.

B
On the assumption that ambiguity exists, we turn to examine the textual evolution of the limitation in question and
the legislative history that may explain or elucidate it.2 The

2 R. L. C. argues that the broader statutory purpose supports his position. He contends that longer juvenile sentences are only justified by a
rehabilitative purpose. See, e. g., Carter v. United States, 113 U. S. App.
D. C. 123, 125, 306 F. 2d 283, 285 (1962) (imposing a longer juvenile sentence under the now-repealed Youth Corrections Act) ("[R]ehabilitation
may be regarded as comprising the quid pro quo for a longer confinement
but under different conditions and terms than a defendant would undergo
in an ordinary prison"). He then suggests that the Sentencing Reform
Act rejected the rehabilitative model not merely for adult imprisonment,
see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366-367 (1989), but for juveniles as well. See Brief for Respondent 19. While it is true that some
rehabilitative tools were removed from the juvenile penalty scheme in
1984, see Pub. L. 98-473, $ 214(b), 98 Stat. 2014 (abolishing parole for
juvenile delinquents), the Juvenile Delinquency Act does not completely
reject rehabilitative objectives. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $$ 5035, 5039. We
do not think a broader congressional purpose points clearly in either party's direction.

predecessor of $ 5037(c) as included in the Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 provided that a juvenile adjudged delinquent could be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a period "not [to] extend
beyond the juvenile's twenty-first birthday or the maximum
term which could have been imposed on an adult convicted
of the same offense, whichever is sooner." 18 U. S. C.

$ 5037(b) (1982 ed.) (emphasis added). In its current form,
the statute refers to the "maximum term of imprisonment
that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and
convicted as an adult." 18 U. S. C. $ 5037(c) (emphasis
added). On its face, the current language suggests a change
in reference from abstract consideration of the penalty permitted in punishment of the adult offense, to a focused enquiry into the maximum that would be available in the circumstances of the particular juvenile before the court. The
intervening history supports this reading.

With the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (chapter II of
the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-

473, $ 214(a), 98 Stat. 2013), $ 5037 was rewritten. As

$ 5037(c)(1)(B), its relevant provision became "the maximum
term of imprisonment that would be authorized by section
3581(b) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an
adult." 18 U. S. C. $$ 5037(c)(1)(B), (c)(2)(B)(ii) (1982 ed.,
Supp. II) (emphasis added). The emphasized language was
quickly deleted, however, by the Criminal Law and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-646,

$ 21(a)(2), 100 Stat. 3596 (Technical Amendments Act), resulting in the present statutory text, "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been
tried and convicted as an adult." It thus lost the reference
to $ 3581(b), which would have guided the sentencing court
in identifying the "authorized" term of imprisonment.

300 UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.

Opinion of Souter, J.
R. L. C. argues that this loss is highly significant. Section3581(b)

3 was, and still is, part of a classification system

adopted in 1984 for use in setting the incidents of punishmentfor federal offenses by reference to letter grades reflecting

their relative seriousness. One provision, for example, setsthe maximum period of supervised release for each letter
grade. $ 3583. Section 3581(b) sets out the maximum termof imprisonment for each letter grade, providing, for instance, that the authorized term of imprisonment for a classC felony is not more than 12 years, for a class D not more
than 6, and for a class E not more than 3.The deletion of the reference to $ 3581(b) with its specific
catalog of statutory maximums would seem to go against theGovernment's position. Since, for example, a juvenile who
had committed what would have been an adult class E felonywould apparently have been subject to three years of detention, because $ 3581(b) "authorized" up to three years of im-prisonment for an adult, the deletion of the reference to

$ 3581(b) would appear to indicate some congressional intentto broaden the range of enquiry when determining what
was authorized.4The Government, however, finds a different purpose, disclosed in the section-by-section analysis prepared by the De3 "(b) Authorized terms.--The authorized terms of imprisonment
are--

"(1) for a Class A felony, the duration of the defendant's life or any
period of time;

"(2) for a Class B felony, not more than twenty-five years;
"(3) for a Class C felony, not more than twelve years;
"(4) for a Class D felony, not more than six years;
"(5) for a Class E felony, not more than three years;
"(6) for a Class A misdemeanor, not more than one year;
"(7) for a Class B misdemeanor, not more than six months;
"(8) for a Class C misdemeanor, not more than thirty days; and
"(9) for an infraction, not more than five days." 18 U. S. C. $ 3581.
4 We speak here of an indication appearing solely from the face of the

text. In fact, so far as we can tell, at the time of the amendment no
federal statute defining an offense referred to it by letter grade.

partment of Justice to accompany the bill that became the
Technical Amendments Act. The Department's analysis
included this explanation for the proposal to delete the reference to $ 3581(b): "Because of the effect of 18 U. S. C.

$ 3559(b)(2), deleting the reference to 18 U. S. C. $ 3581(b)
will tie the maximum sentences for juveniles to the maximum for adults, rather than making juvenile sentences more
severe than adult sentences." 131 Cong. Rec. 14177 (1985).
Congress had enacted $ 3559 to reconcile the new sentencing
schedule, providing for the incidents of conviction according
to the offense's assigned letter grade, with the pre-existing
body of federal criminal statutes, which of course included
no assignments of letter grades to the particular offenses
they created. Section 3559(a) provides a formula for assigning the missing letter based on the maximum term of imprisonment set by the statute creating the offense. Thus, as it
stood at the time of the Technical Amendments Act, it read:

"(a) Classification

"An offense that is not specifically classified by a letter
grade in the section defining it, is classified--

"(H) thirty days or less but more than five days, as a
Class C misdemeanor; or

"(I) five days or less, or if no imprisonment is authorized, as an infraction.

"(b) Effect of classification

"An offense classified under subsection (a) carries all
the incidents assigned to the applicable letter designation except that:

"(1) the maximum fine that may be imposed is the fine
authorized by the statute describing the offense, or by
this chapter, whichever is the greater; and

"(2) the maximum term of imprisonment is the term
authorized by the statute describing the offense." 18
U. S. C. $ 3559 (1982 ed., Supp. II).

The Government explains that limiting the length of a
juvenile detention to that authorized for an adult under

$ 3581(b) could in some circumstances have appeared to authorize a longer sentence than an adult could have received,
when the offense involved was assigned no letter grade in
its defining statute. Thus an offense created without letter
grade and carrying a maximum term of two years would be
treated under $ 3559(a) as a class E felony. Section 3581(b)
provides that a class E felony carried a maximum of three
years. Regardless of that classification, $ 3559(b)(2) would
certainly preclude sentencing any adult offender to more
than two years. Tension would arise, however, where a juvenile had committed the act constituting the offense. Insofar as $ 5037(c) capped the juvenile detention by reference to
what was authorized for an adult, the maximum would have
been two years; but insofar as it capped it by reference to
what was authorized by $ 3581(b), the limit might have appeared to be three. It was to break this tension, according
to the Government, that the reference to $ 3581(b) was deleted guaranteeing that no juvenile would be given detention
longer than the maximum adult sentence authorized by the

statute creating the offense. The amendment also, the Gov-ernment says, left the law clear in its reference to the statute

creating the offense as the measure of an "authorized" sen-tence. This conclusion is said to be confirmed by a statement in the House Report that the amendment "delet[es an]
incorrect cross-referenc[e]," H. R. Rep. No. 99-797, p. 21(1986), which, the Government argues, "suggests that no substantive change was intended." Brief for United States 20,n. 4.

We agree with the Government's argument up to a point.A sentencing court could certainly have been confused by
the reference to $ 3581(b). A sentencing judge considering a
juvenile defendant charged with an offense bearing no letter
classification, and told to look for "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized [according to letter
grade] by section 3581(b)," would have turned first to

$ 3559(a) to obtain a letter classification. The court perhaps
would have felt obliged to ignore the provision of $ 3559(b)
that "the maximum term of imprisonment is the term authorized by the statute describing the offense" in favor of a
longer term provided for by the appropriate letter grade in

$ 3581(b). Indeed, the sentencing judge would have been
faced with this puzzle in virtually every case, since the system of classifying by letter grades adopted in 1984 was only
to be used in future legislation defining federal criminal offenses. See Brief for United States 16. No federal offense
on the books at the time the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984
was adopted carried a letter grade in its defining statute,
and Congress has used the device only rarely in the ensuing years.

Thus, while it included a reference to $ 3581(b), $ 5037(c)
was ambiguous. This ambiguity was resolved by an amendment that, absent promulgation of the Guidelines, might
have left the question of the "authorized" maximum term of
imprisonment to be determined only by reference to the penalty provided by the statute creating the offense, whether

expressed as a term of years or simply by reference to lettergrade. The legislative history does not prove, however, that

Congress intended "authorized" to refer solely to the statutedefining the offense despite the enactment of a statute requiring application of the Sentencing Guidelines, a provision
that will generally provide a ceiling more favorable to thejuvenile than that contained in the offense-defining statute.

Indeed, the contrary intent would seem the better infer-ence. The Justice Department analysis of the Criminal Law
and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, uponwhich the Government relies, went on to say that "deleting
the reference to 18 U. S. C. $ 3581(b) will tie the maximum
sentences for juveniles to the maximum for adults, rather
than making juvenile sentences more severe than adult sentences." 131 Cong. Rec. 14177 (1985). This is an expression of purpose that today can be achieved only by reading
"authorized" to refer to the maximum period of imprisonment that may be imposed consistently with 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(b). That statute provides that "[t]he court shall impose a sentence . . . within the range" established for the
category of offense as set forth in the Guidelines, "unless the
court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating
circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken
into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described." $ 3553(b).

The point is reinforced by other elements of the legislative
history. The Senate Report accompanying the 1986 Technical Amendments Act states that the amendment "makes
clear that juvenile sentences are to be of equal length as
those for adult offenders committing the same crime."
S. Rep. No. 99-278, p. 3 (1986). This, in turn, reflects the
statement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sentencing Reform Act, that the changes in juvenile sentencing law
were included "in order to conform it to the changes made
in adult sentencing laws." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 155 (1983).

Opinion of Souter, J.
The most fundamental of the Sentencing Reform Act'schanges was, of course, the creation of the Sentencing Commission, authorized to promulgate the guidelines requiredfor use by sentencing courts. It hardly seems likely that
Congress adopted the current $ 5037(c) with a purpose toconform juvenile and adult maximum sentences without intending the recently authorized Guidelines scheme to be con-sidered for that purpose. The legislative history thus reinforces our initial conclusion that $ 5037 is better understoodto refer to the maximum sentence permitted under the statute requiring application of the Guidelines.5

C
We do not think any ambiguity survives. If any did, how-ever, we would choose the construction yielding the shorter

sentence by resting on the venerable rule of lenity, see, e. g.,
United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347-348 (1971), rooted in" `the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison

unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should,' " id., at348 (quoting H. Friendly, Benchmarks 209 (1967)). While
the rule has been applied not only to resolve issues about thesubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing, see Bifulco v. United
States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980), its application is unnecessaryin this case, since "we have always reserved lenity for those

situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a stat-ute's intended scope even after resort to `the language and
structure, legislative history, and motivating policies' of the

5 The dissent takes us to task for reliance upon a "technical amendment."
But a statute is a statute, whatever its label. Although the critical congressional enactment, the deletion of the reference to $ 3581(b), came in
the Technical Amendments Act, we have applied the usual tools of statutory construction: the language left in the statute after its amendment in
1986 is most naturally read to refer to the term of imprisonment authorized after application of the statute mandating use of the Guidelines.
The legislative history of the Technical Amendments Act reinforces this
conclusion.

We hold, therefore, that application of the language in

$ 5037(c)(1)(B) permitting detention for a period not to exceed "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an
adult" refers to the maximum length of sentence to which a
similarly situated adult would be subject if convicted of the
adult counterpart of the offense and sentenced under the
statute requiring application of the Guidelines, $ 3553(b).
Although determining the maximum permissible sentence
under $ 5037(c)(1)(B) will therefore require sentencing and
reviewing courts to determine an appropriate Guideline
range in juvenile-delinquency proceedings, we emphasize

6 Justice Scalia questions the soundness of Moskal's statement that
we have reserved lenity for those cases (unlike this one) in which after
examining "the . . . structure, legislative history, and motivating policies,"
in addition to the text of an ambiguous criminal statute, we are still left
with a reasonable doubt about the intended scope of the statute's application. But the Court has not in the past approached the use of lenity in
the way Justice Scalia would have it.

It is true that the need for fair warning will make it "rare that legislative history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statute
broader than that clearly warranted by the text," Crandon v. United
States, 494 U. S. 152, 160 (1990), and that "general declarations of policy,"
whether in the text or the legislative history, will not support construction
of an ambiguous criminal statute against the defendant, Hughey v. United
States, 495 U. S. 411, 422 (1990). But lenity does not always require the
"narrowest" construction, and our cases have recognized that a broader
construction may be permissible on the basis of nontextual factors that
make clear the legislative intent where it is within the fair meaning of the
statutory language. See Dixson v. United States, 465 U. S. 482, 500-501,
n. 19 (1984). Cf. McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931) (a criminal statute should be construed in such a way that its language gives "fair
warning" to the "common mind"). Whether lenity should be given the
more immediate and dispositive role Justice Scalia espouses is an issue
that is not raised and need not be reached in this case.

that it does not require plenary application of the Guidelinesto juvenile delinquents.

7 Where that statutory provision

applies, a sentencing court's concern with the Guidelinesgoes solely to the upper limit of the proper Guideline range

as setting the maximum term for which a juvenile may be
committed to official detention, absent circumstances thatwould warrant departure under $ 3553(b).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment.

In my view it is not consistent with the rule of lenity toconstrue a textually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the basis of legislative history. Because
Justice Souter's opinion assumes the contrary, I join onlyParts I, II-A, and III, and concur in the judgment.

The Court begins its analysis, quite properly, by examin-ing the language of 18 U. S. C. $ 5037(c)(1)(B)--which proves
to be ambiguous. Reasonable doubt remains, the Court concludes, as to whether the provision refers (i) to the maximum
punishment that could be imposed if the juvenile were being
sentenced under the United States Sentencing Guidelines
(15-21 months) or (ii) to the maximum punishment authorized by the statute defining the offense, see 18 U. S. C.

$ 1112(a) (36 months). Ante, at 298. With that conclusion I
agree--and that conclusion should end the matter. The rule
of lenity, in my view, prescribes the result when a criminal

7 The Sentencing Guidelines, of course, do not directly apply to juveniledelinquency proceedings. We observe that 28 U. S. C. $ 995(a)(19), also
enacted as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, gives the Sentencing Commission power to "study the feasibility of developing guidelines
for the disposition of juvenile delinquents." The Government reports
that the Sentencing Commission has recently begun such a study. See

statute is ambiguous: The more lenient interpretation mustprevail.

Yet the plurality continues. Armed with its warrant oftextual ambiguity, the plurality conducts a search of $ 5037's
legislative history to determine whether that clarifies the
statute. Happily for this defendant, the plurality's extratex-tual inquiry is benign: It uncovers evidence that the "better

understood" reading of $ 5037 is the more lenient one. Ante,at 305. But this methodology contemplates as well a different ending, one in which something said in a Committee Re-port causes the criminal law to be stricter than the text of
the law displays. According to the plurality, " `[W]e have
always reserved [the rule of] lenity for those situations in
which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute's intended
scope even after resort to "the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies" of the statute.' "
Ante, at 305-306 (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.
103, 108 (1990) (citation omitted)). I doubt that Moskal accurately characterizes the law in this area, and I am certain
that its treatment of "the venerable rule of lenity," ante, at
305, does not venerate the important values the old rule
serves.

The Moskal formulation of the rule, in approving reliance
on a statute's "motivating policies" (an obscure phrase),
seems contrary to our statement in Hughey v. United States,
495 U. S. 411, 422 (1990), that "[e]ven [where] the statutory
language . . . [is] ambiguous, longstanding principles of lenity
. . . preclude our resolution of the ambiguity against [the
criminal defendant] on the basis of general declarations of
policy in the statute and legislative history." And insofar
as Moskal requires consideration of legislative history at all,
it compromises what we have described to be purposes of
the lenity rule. "[A] fair warning," we have said, "should be
given to the world in language that the common world will
understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is
passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line

should be clear." McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27(1931). "[T]he rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes

will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered ille-gal."

Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 427 (1985).
It may well be true that in most cases the proposition that
the words of the United States Code or the Statutes at Largegive adequate notice to the citizen is something of a fiction,

see McBoyle, supra, at 27, albeit one required in any systemof law; but necessary fiction descends to needless farce when
the public is charged even with knowledge of CommitteeReports.

Moskal's mode of analysis also disserves the rule of lenity's other purpose: assuring that the society, through its representatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to be
meted out. "[B]ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the
moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not
courts should define criminal activity." United States v.
Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971). See also Liparota, supra,
at 427; United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820).
The rule reflects, as the plurality acknowledges, " ` "the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless
the lawmaker has clearly said they should." ' " Ante, at 305
(quoting Bass, supra, at 348, and H. Friendly, Benchmarks
209 (1967)). But legislative history can never provide assurance against that unacceptable result. After all, "[a] statute
is a statute," ante, at 305, n. 5, and no matter how "authoritative" the history may be--even if it is that veritable Rosetta
Stone of legislative archaeology, a crystal clear Committee
Report--one can never be sure that the legislators who
voted for the text of the bill were aware of it. The only
thing that was authoritatively adopted for sure was the text
of the enactment; the rest is necessarily speculation.
Where it is doubtful whether the text includes the penalty,
the penalty ought not be imposed. "[T]he moral condemnation of the community," Bass, supra, at 348, is no more re503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT

flected in the views of a majority of a single committee ofcongressmen (assuming, of course, they have genuinely considered what their staff has produced) than it is reflected inthe views of a majority of an appellate court; we should feel
no less concerned about "men languishing in prison" at the
direction of the one than of the other.We have in a number of cases other than

Moskal done
what the plurality has done here: inquired into legislativehistory and invoked it to support or at least permit the more

lenient reading. But only once, to my knowledge, have werelied on legislative history to "clarify" a statute, explicitly
found to be facially ambiguous, against the interest of a criminal defendant. In Dixson v. United States, 465 U. S. 482,
500-501, n. 19 (1984), the Court relied on legislative history
to determine that defendants, officers of a corporation responsible for administering federal block grants, were "public officials" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. $ 201(a). The
opinion does not trouble to discuss the "fair warning" or
"condemnation of the community" implications of its decision,
and both of the cases it cites in supposed support of its holding found the statute at hand not to be facially ambiguous.
See United States v. Moore, 423 U. S. 122, 131 (1975) ("By its
terms $ 841 reaches `any person' " and "does not exempt (as
it could have) `all registrants' or `all persons registered under
this Act' "); United States v. Brown, 333 U. S. 18, 22 (1948)
("The legislation reflects an unmistakable intention to provide punishment for escape or attempted escape to be superimposed upon the punishment meted out for previous offenses. This appears from the face of the statute itself ").
I think Dixson weak (indeed, utterly unreasoned) foundation
for a rule of construction that permits legislative history to
satisfy the ancient requirement that criminal statutes speak
"plainly and unmistakably," United States v. Gradwell, 243
U. S. 476, 485 (1917); see also Bass, supra, at 348.

In sum, I would not embrace, as the plurality does, the
Moskal formulation of this canon of construction, lest lower

the consequences of the Moskal mode of analysis, and theconsequent conclusion that Moskal may not be good law.

Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.
I agree with Justice Scalia that the use of legislativehistory to construe an otherwise ambiguous penal statute
against a criminal defendant is difficult to reconcile with therule of lenity. I write separately, however, to emphasize
that the rule is not triggered merely because a statute ap-pears textually ambiguous on its face. Just last Term, we
reaffirmed that the rule operates only " `at the end of theprocess' " of construction, Chapman v. United States, 500
U. S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Callanan v. United States, 364U. S. 587, 596 (1961)), if ambiguity remains "even after a
court has " `seize[d] every thing from which aid can be de-rived," ' "

ibid. (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,347 (1971), in turn quoting United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch

358, 386 (1805)). Thus, although we require Congress toenact "clear and definite" penal statutes, United States v.
Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S. 218, 221-222 (1952),we also consult our own "well-established principles of statutory construction," Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S.395, 410 (1991), in determining whether the relevant text

isclear and definite. See,
e. g., id., at 404 (applying the rule in
Arnold v. United States, 9 Cranch 104, 119-120 (1815), thatstatutes become effective immediately);

Albernaz v. United
States, 450 U. S. 333, 337-342 (1981) (applying the rule in
Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932), toestablish the permissibility of multiple punishments).

These cases, I think, demonstrate that we must presumefamiliarity not only with the United States Code, see

ante,
at 309, but also with the United States Reports, in which wehave developed innumerable rules of construction powerful

enough to make clear an otherwise ambiguous penal statute.Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense

Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843, n. 9 (1984) ("clear congres-sional intent" may be discerned by application of "traditional
tools of statutory construction"). Like Congress' statutes,the decisions of this Court are law, the knowledge of which
we have always imputed to the citizenry. At issue here,though, is a rule that would also require knowledge of committee reports and floor statements, which are not law. Iagree with

Justice Scalia that there appears scant justifi-cation for extending the "necessary fiction" that citizens

know the law, see ante, at 309, to such extralegal materials.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Blackmunjoins, dissenting.

By failing to interpret 18 U. S. C. $ 5037(c)(1)(B) in light ofthe statutory scheme of which it is a part, the Court interprets a "technical amendment" to make sweeping changes tothe process and focus of juvenile sentencing. Instead, the
Court should honor Congress' clear intention to leave settledpractice in juvenile sentencing undisturbed.

When Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of1984, it authorized the United States Sentencing Commission
(Sentencing Commission or Commission) to overhaul the dis-cretionary system of adult sentencing. As an important aspect of this overhaul, Guidelines sentencing formalizes sen-tencing procedures. The Commission explains:

"In pre-guidelines practice, factors relevant to sen-tencing were often determined in an informal fashion.
The informality was to some extent explained by the
fact that particular offense and offender characteristicsrarely had a highly specific or required sentencing consequence. This situation will no longer exist undersentencing guidelines. The court's resolution of disputed sentencing factors will usually have a measura-ble effect on the applicable punishment. More formal503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT

ity is therefore unavoidable if the sentencing processis to be accurate and fair." United States Sentencing

Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 6A1.3, comment (Nov.1991) (USSG).

Another significant change permits an appeal when theGuidelines are incorrectly applied or departed from, 18
U. S. C. $ 3742; under prior law, a sentence within statutorylimits was not generally subject to review, United States v.
Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 447 (1972). Thus, factual findingsmade at adult sentencing hearings can be challenged on
appeal.When Congress made these fundamental changes in sentencing, it repealed the Youth Corrections Act, Pub. L. 98-473, Title II, $ 218(a)(8), 98 Stat. 2027 (1984), which gave special treatment to defendants under 22. Congress did not,however, repeal the Juvenile Delinquency Act, which applies
to defendants under 18, and clearly indicated that the Com-mission was only to study the feasibility of sentencing guidelines for juveniles, see 28 U. S. C. $$ 995(a)(1)-(a)(9), a processwhich is still in progress. Brief for United States 11, n. 1.
Thus, Congress did not intend the Guidelines to apply to ju-veniles. Section 5037(c)(1)(B) must be interpreted against
this backdrop.Before the Sentencing Reform Act, $ 5037(c)(1)(B) limited
juvenile sentences by the correlative adult statutory maxi-mum. As part of the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress
made clear that this past practice would remain the same bylimiting juvenile sentences to: "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized by section 3581(b) if thejuvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult," 18 U. S. C.

$ 5037(c)(1)(B) (1982 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added). Thereference to $ 3581(b), which classifies offenses and sets out
maximum terms, clarified that the statutory maximum of theoffense, not the Guideline maximum, would still limit the
juvenile's sentence. Thus, consonant with its decision toleave juvenile sentencing in place, Congress did not change

314 UNITED STATES v. R. L. C.

O'Connor, J., dissenting

$ 5037(c)(1)(B) to require sentencing judges in juvenile casesto calculate Guideline maximum sentences.

As the plurality acknowledges, ante, at 299-304, the cross-reference to $ 3581(b) added by the Sentencing Reform Act
created a new ambiguity as to whether the maximum sentence referred to was that authorized in the particular of-fense statute, or in the offense classification statute. To resolve the ambiguity, the cross-reference was deleted in 1986as one of numerous technical amendments. The Court reads
this technical amendment as changing $ 3581's reference fromthe statutory maximum to the

Guideline maximum, even
though before the amendment the statute clearly did not
refer to the Guideline maximum. While the original version
of $ 5037(c)(1)(B) was ambiguous in other respects, there was
never any question that $ 5037(c)(1)(B) referred to the adult
statutory maximum. There is no indication that Congress
intended to change pre-existing practice. Section 5037(c)
(1)(B), read in this context, still unambiguously refers to the
statutory maximum. And because $ 5037(c)(1)(B) is unambiguous in this respect, the rule of lenity does not apply here.
Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990) (Court may
look to structure of statute to ascertain the sense of a provision before resorting to rule of lenity). The Court, however,
construes $ 5037(c)(1)(B) to change pre-existing practice only
by reading it in a vacuum apart from the rest of the Sentencing Reform Act, thus violating the canon of construction that
"the words of a statute must be read in their context and
with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme."
Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809
(1989).

The practical implications of the Court's reading demonstrate why its construction runs contrary to Congress' decision not to apply the Guidelines to juveniles. Requiring a
district court to calculate a Guideline maximum for each juvenile imports formal factfinding procedures foreign to the
discretionary sentencing system Congress intended to re503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT

One reason for the traditional informality of juvenile proceedings is that the focus of sentencing is on treatment, not punishment. The presumption is that juvenilesare still teachable and not yet "hardened criminals. "

S. Rep. No. 1989, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 1 (1938). See McKeiver, supra; 18 U. S. C. $ 5039 ("Whenever possible, the Attorney General shall commit a juvenile to a foster home orcommunity-based facility located in or near his home community"). As a result, the sentencing considerations relevant
to juveniles are far different from those relevant to adults.

The Court asserts, naively it seems to me, that it is not
requiring "plenary application" of the Guidelines, ante, at
307, and makes the process of determining the Guideline
maximum seem easy--a court need only look at the offense
the juvenile was found guilty of violating and his criminal
history, ante, at 296. In practice, however, calculating a
Guideline maximum is much more complicated. Even in this
relatively straightforward case, respondent was said to have
stolen the car he was driving. Although apparently not
placed in issue at the sentencing hearing, that conduct might,
if proven and connected to the offense of which respondent
was convicted, enhance the applicable Guideline maximum as
"relevant conduct." See USSG $ 1B1.3. Respondent's role
in the offense might also warrant an adjustment of the
Guideline maximum. $$ 3B1.1, 3B1.2. The District Court
made a determination that respondent had not accepted responsibility, and that finding changed the calculation of the
Guideline maximum. Tr. 3 (Jan. 25, 1991), $ 3E1.1. The
District Court also had to take into account factors not considered by the Guidelines in determining whether or not a
departure was warranted, which would increase or decrease
the "maximum" sentence by an undiscernible "reasonable"
amount. Tr. 3-4, 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b). In short, the Guide503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
line maximum is not static or readily ascertainable, but de-pends on particularized findings of fact and discretionary

determinations made by the sentencing judge.These determinations may even require adversarial evidentiary hearings. Yet such formal factual investigations
are not provided for by the Juvenile Delinquency Act.There is no indication in the statute that the judge is required to support the sentence with particular findings.USSG $ 6A1.3 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
32(a)(1), as amended after the Guidelines, do provide for anadversarial sentencing procedure for adults that accommodates Guideline factfinding. Rule 32 does not apply when
it conflicts with provisions of the Juvenile Delinquency Act,
however, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 54(b)(5), and it seems to
me a serious question whether adversarial factfinding is
what Congress had in mind for juvenile sentencing. An
even more serious question is whether Congress intended
juveniles to be able to appeal the findings of fact that determine the Guideline maximum. Yet the Court's decision
would seem to require provision for such appeals.

In addition, a Guideline maximum for an adult incorporates factors the Sentencing Commission has found irrelevant to juvenile sentencing, see, e. g., USSG $ 4B1.1 (career
offender status inapplicable to defendants under 18), and
does not incorporate factors Congress has found relevant to
juvenile sentencing, see, e. g., USSG $$ 5H1.1, 5H1.6 (age and
family ties irrelevant to Guideline sentencing). As a result,
the Guideline maximum for an adult cannot serve as a useful
point of comparison. In sum, the cumbersome process of determining a comparable Guideline maximum threatens to
dominate the juvenile sentencing hearing at the expense of
considerations more relevant to juveniles.

I cannot infer that Congress meant to overhaul and refocus
the procedures of juvenile sentencing in such a fundamental
way merely by deleting a cross-reference in a technical
amendment, especially when Congress expressly left juve503us2$48M 11-14-95 17:45:34 PAGES OPINPGT

nile sentencing out of the scope of the Sentencing ReformAct and directed the Commission to examine how sentencing

guidelines might be tailored to juveniles.This case is admittedly unusual in that respondent was
sentenced to a longer sentence than a similarly situatedadult. Before the Guidelines were enacted, however, such
anomalies were not unknown: A juvenile could receive alonger sentence than a similarly situated adult, as long as
the sentence was within the statutory maximum. Weshould not try to address the disparity presented in this particular case by changing all juvenile sentencing in ways thatCongress did not intend. Instead, we should wait for the
Sentencing Commission and Congress to decide whether tofashion appropriate guidelines for juveniles. For this reason, I respectfully dissent.

NATIONWIDE MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. et al. v.DARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 90-1802. Argued January 21, 1992--Decided March 24, 1992
Contracts between petitioners Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. et al. and

respondent Darden provided, among other things, that Darden would
sell only Nationwide policies, that Nationwide would enroll him in a
company retirement plan for agents, and that he would forfeit his entitlement to plan benefits if, within a year of his termination and 25 miles
of his prior business location, he sold insurance for Nationwide's competitors. After his termination, Darden began selling insurance for those
competitors. Nationwide charged that Darden's new business activities disqualified him from receiving his retirement plan benefits, for
which he then sued under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA). The District Court granted summary judgment
to Nationwide on the ground that Darden was not a proper ERISA
plaintiff because, under common-law agency principles, he was an independent contractor rather than, as ERISA requires, an "employee," a
term the Act defines as "any individual employed by an employer." Although agreeing that he "most probably would not qualify as an employee" under traditional agency law principles, the Court of Appeals
reversed, finding the traditional definition inconsistent with ERISA's
policy and purposes, and holding that an ERISA plaintiff can qualify as
an "employee" simply by showing (1) that he had a reasonable expectation that he would receive benefits, (2) that he relied on this expectation,
and (3) that he lacked the economic bargaining power to contract out of
benefit plan forfeiture provisions. Applying this standard, the District
Court found on remand that Darden had been Nationwide's "employee,"
and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. The term "employee" as used in ERISA incorporates traditional
agency law criteria for identifying master-servant relationships.
Where a statute containing that term does not helpfully define it, this
Court presumes that Congress means an agency law definition unless it
clearly indicates otherwise. See, e. g., Community for Creative NonViolence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730, 739-740. ERISA's nominal definition of
"employee" is completely circular and explains nothing, and the Act contains no other provision that either gives specific guidance on the term's

meaning or suggests that construing it to incorporate traditional agency
law principles would thwart the congressional design or lead to absurd
results. Since the multifactor common-law test here adopted, see, e. g.,
id., at 751-752, contains no shorthand formula for determining who is
an "employee," all of the incidents of the employment relationship must
be assessed and weighed with no one factor being decisive. NLRB v.

Opinion of the Court
contracts he signed with petitioners Nationwide Mutual In-surance Co. et al. Darden promised to sell only Nationwide

insurance policies, and, in exchange, Nationwide agreed topay him commissions on his sales and enroll him in a company retirement scheme called the "Agent's Security Compensation Plan" (Plan). The Plan consisted of two differentprograms: the "Deferred Compensation Incentive Credit

Plan," under which Nationwide annually credited an agent'sretirement account with a sum based on his business performance, and the "Extended Earnings Plan," under whichNationwide paid an agent, upon retirement or termination,
a sum equal to the total of his policy renewal fees for the
previous 12 months.

Such were the contractual terms, however, that Darden
would forfeit his entitlement to the Plan's benefits if, within
a year of his termination and 25 miles of his prior business
location, he sold insurance for Nationwide's competitors.
The contracts also disqualified him from receiving those benefits if, after he stopped representing Nationwide, he ever
induced a Nationwide policyholder to cancel one of its
policies.

In November 1980, Nationwide exercised its contractual
right to end its relationship with Darden. A month later,
Darden became an independent insurance agent and, doing
business from his old office, sold insurance policies for several
of Nationwide's competitors. The company reacted with the
charge that his new business activities disqualified him from
receiving the Plan benefits to which he would have been entitled otherwise. Darden then sued for the benefits, which he
claimed were nonforfeitable because already vested under
the terms of ERISA. 29 U. S. C. $ 1053(a).

Darden brought his action under 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a),
which enables a benefit plan "participant" to enforce the substantive provisions of ERISA. The Act elsewhere defines
"participant" as "any employee or former employee of an employer . . . who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit

of any type from an employee benefit plan . . . ." $ 1002(7).
Thus, Darden's ERISA claim can succeed only if he was Nationwide's "employee," a term the Act defines as "any individual employed by an employer." $ 1002(6).

It was on this point that the District Court granted summary judgment to Nationwide. After applying common-law
agency principles and, to an extent unspecified, our decision
in United States v. Silk, 331 U. S. 704 (1947), the court found
that " `the total factual context' of Mr. Darden's relationship
with Nationwide shows that he was an independent contractor and not an employee." App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a, 50a,
quoting NLRB v. United Ins. Co. of America, 390 U. S. 254
(1968).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
vacated. Darden v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 796 F. 2d
701 (1986). After observing that "Darden most probably
would not qualify as an employee" under traditional principles of agency law, id., at 705, it found the traditional definition inconsistent with the " `declared policy and purposes' "
of ERISA, id., at 706, quoting Silk, supra, at 713, and NLRB
v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U. S. 111, 131-132 (1944),
and specifically with the congressional statement of purpose
found in $ 2 of the Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001.1 It therefore held

that an ERISA plaintiff can qualify as an "employee" simply
by showing "(1) that he had a reasonable expectation that he
would receive [pension] benefits, (2) that he relied on this
expectation, and (3) that he lacked the economic bargaining
power to contract out of [benefit plan] forfeiture provisions."

1 The Court of Appeals cited Congress's declaration that "many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement
benefits," that employee benefit plans "have become an important factor
affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of
industrial relations," and that ERISA was necessary to "assur[e] the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness." 796 F. 2d, at
706, quoting 29 U. S. C. $ 1001. None of these passages deals specifically
with the scope of ERISA's class of beneficiaries.

In due course, Nationwide filed a petition for certiorari,which we granted on October 15, 1991. 502 U. S. 905. We

now reverse. II

We have often been asked to construe the meaning of"employee" where the statute containing the term does not
helpfully define it. Most recently we confronted this prob-lem in

Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490U. S. 730 (1989), a case in which a sculptor and a nonprofit

group each claimed copyright ownership in a statue thegroup had commissioned from the artist. The dispute ultimately turned on whether, by the terms of $ 101 of theCopyright Act of 1976, 17 U. S. C. $ 101, the statue had been
"prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her
employment." Because the Copyright Act nowhere definedthe term "employee," we unanimously applied the "well established" principle that

"[w]here Congress uses terms that have accumulated
settled meaning under . . . the common law, a court mustinfer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning ofthese terms. . . . In the past, when Congress has used
the term `employee' without defining it, we have con-cluded that Congress intended to describe the conven2 The Court of Appeals also held that the Deferred Compensation Plan
was a pension plan subject to regulation under ERISA, but that the Extended Earnings Plan was not. 922 F. 2d, at 208. We denied Darden's

U. S. 906 (1991).

tional master-servant relationship as understood bycommon-law agency doctrine. See, e. g., Kelley v.

Southern Pacific Co., 419 U. S. 318, 322-323 (1974);Baker v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 359 U. S. 227, 228 (1959)
(per curiam); Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 237U. S. 84, 94 (1915)." 490 U. S., at 739-740 (internal quotation marks omitted).
While we supported this reading of the Copyright Act withother observations, the general rule stood as independent

authority for the decision.So too should it stand here. ERISA's nominal definition
of "employee" as "any individual employed by an employer,"29 U. S. C. $ 1002(6), is completely circular and explains nothing. As for the rest of the Act, Darden does not cite, andwe do not find, any provision either giving specific guidance
on the term's meaning or suggesting that construing it toincorporate traditional agency law principles would thwart
the congressional design or lead to absurd results. Thus,we adopt a common-law test for determining who qualifies
as an "employee" under ERISA,3 a test we most recentlysummarized in Reid:

"In determining whether a hired party is an employeeunder the general common law of agency, we consider
the hiring party's right to control the manner and meansby which the product is accomplished. Among the
other factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill re-quired; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the
location of the work; the duration of the relationshipbetween the parties; whether the hiring party has the
right to assign additional projects to the hired party;the extent of the hired party's discretion over when and
how long to work; the method of payment; the hired
3 As in Reid, we construe the term to incorporate "the general common
law of agency, rather than . . . the law of any particular State." Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730, 740 (1989).

party's role in hiring and paying assistants; whetherthe work is part of the regular business of the hiring

party; whether the hiring party is in business; the pro-vision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment
of the hired party." 490 U. S., at 751-752 (footnotesomitted).

Cf. Restatement (Second) of Agency $ 220(2) (1958) (listingnonexhaustive criteria for identifying master-servant relationship); Rev. Rul. 87-41, 1987-1 Cum. Bull. 296, 298-299(setting forth 20 factors as guides in determining whether
an individual qualifies as a common-law "employee" in various tax law contexts). Since the common-law test contains"no shorthand formula or magic phrase that can be applied

to find the answer, . . . all of the incidents of the relationshipmust be assessed and weighed with no one factor being decisive." NLRB v. United Ins. Co. of America, 390 U. S., at258.

In taking its different tack, the Court of Appeals cited
NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U. S., at 120-129,and

United States v. Silk, 331 U. S., at 713, for the proposition that "the content of the term `employee' in the contextof a particular federal statute is `to be construed "in the light

of the mischief to be corrected and the end to be attained." ' "
Darden, 796 F. 2d, at 706, quoting Silk, supra, at 713, in turn
quoting Hearst, supra, at 124. But Hearst and Silk, whichinterpreted "employee" for purposes of the National Labor

Relations Act and Social Security Act, respectively, are
feeble precedents for unmooring the term from the commonlaw. In each case, the Court read "employee," which neither

statute helpfully defined,4 to imply something broader thanthe common-law definition; after each opinion, Congress

4 The National Labor Relations Act simply defined "employee" to mean
(in relevant part) "any employee." 49 Stat. 450 (1935). The Social Security Act defined the term to "include," among other, unspecified occupations, "an officer of a corporation." 49 Stat. 647.

amended the statute so construed to demonstrate that the
usual common-law principles were the keys to meaning.
See United Ins. Co., supra, at 256 ("Congressional reaction
to [Hearst] was adverse and Congress passed an amendment
. . . [t]he obvious purpose of [which] was to have the . . .
courts apply general agency principles in distinguishing between employees and independent contractors under the
Act"); Social Security Act of 1948, ch. 468, $ 1(a), 62 Stat. 438
(1948) (amending statute to provide that term "employee"
"does not include . . . any individual who, under the usual
common-law rules applicable in determining the employeremployee relationship, has the status of an independent contractor") (emphasis added); see also United States v. W. M.
Webb, Inc., 397 U. S. 179, 183-188 (1970) (discussing congressional reaction to Silk).

To be sure, Congress did not, strictly speaking, "overrule"
our interpretation of those statutes, since the Constitution
invests the Judiciary, not the Legislature, with the final
power to construe the law. But a principle of statutory construction can endure just so many legislative revisitations,
and Reid's presumption that Congress means an agency law
definition for "employee" unless it clearly indicates otherwise
signaled our abandonment of Silk's emphasis on construing
that term " `in the light of the mischief to be corrected and
the end to be attained.' " Silk, supra, at 713, quoting
Hearst, supra, at 124.

At oral argument, Darden tried to subordinate Reid to
Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, 331 U. S. 722 (1947),
which adopted a broad reading of "employee" under the Fair
Labor Standards Act (FLSA). And amicus United States,
while rejecting Darden's position, also relied on Rutherford
Food for the proposition that, when enacting ERISA, Congress must have intended a modified common-law definition
of "employee" that would advance, in a way not defined, the
Act's "remedial purposes." Brief for United States as Ami503us2$49z 11-14-95 17:51:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
cus Curiae 15-21.5 But Rutherfood Food supports neitherposition. The definition of "employee" in the FLSA evidently derives from the child labor statutes, see RutherfordFood, supra, at 728, and, on its face, goes beyond its ERISA
counterpart. While the FLSA, like ERISA, defines an "em-ployee" to include "any individual employed by an employer," it defines the verb "employ" expansively to mean"suffer or permit to work." 52 Stat. 1060, $ 3, codified at 29
U. S. C. $$ 203(e), (g). This latter definition, whose strikingbreadth we have previously noted,

Rutherford Food, supra,at 728, stretches the meaning of "employee" to cover some

parties who might not qualify as such under a strict application of traditional agency law principles. ERISA lacks anysuch provision, however, and the textual asymmetry between the two statutes precludes reliance on FLSA caseswhen construing ERISA's concept of "employee."

Quite apart from its inconsistency with our precedents, theFourth Circuit's analysis reveals an approach infected with
circularity and unable to furnish predictable results. Apply-ing the first element of its test, which ostensibly enquires
into an employee's "expectations," the Court of Appeals concluded that Nationwide had "created a reasonable expecta-tion on the `employees' part that benefits would be paid to

them in the future," Darden, 796 F. 2d, at 706, by establish-ing "a comprehensive retirement benefits program for its
insurance agents," id., at 707. The court thought it was sim-ply irrelevant that the forfeiture clause in Darden's contract
"limited" his expectation of receiving pension benefits, since"it is precisely that sort of employer-imposed condition on
the employee's anticipations that Congress intended to out5 While both Darden and the United States cite a Department of Labor
"Opinion Letter" as support for their separate positions, see Brief for Respondent 34-35, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16-18, neither

Opinion of the Court
law with the enactment of ERISA." Id., at 707, n. 7 (empha-sis added). Thus, the Fourth Circuit's test would turn not

on a claimant's actual "expectations," which the court effec-tively deemed inconsequential,

ibid., but on his statutory entitlement to relief, which itself depends on his very status as
an "employee." This begs the question.This circularity infects the test's second prong as well,

which considers the extent to which a claimant has relied onhis "expectation" of benefits by "remaining for `long years,'
or a substantial period of time, in the `employer's' service,and by foregoing other significant means of providing for
[his] retirement." Id., at 706. While this enquiry is ostensibly factual, we have seen already that one of its objects
may not be: to the extent that actual "expectations" are (as
in Darden's case) unnecessary to relief, the nature of a claimant's required "reliance" is left unclear. Moreover, any enquiry into "reliance," whatever it might entail, could apparently lead to different results for claimants holding identical
jobs and enrolled in identical plans. Because, for example,
Darden failed to make much independent provision for his
retirement, he satisfied the "reliance" prong of the Fourth
Circuit's test, see 922 F. 2d, at 206, whereas a more provident
colleague who signed exactly the same contracts, but saved
for a rainy day, might not.

Any such approach would severely compromise the capacity of companies like Nationwide to figure out who their
"employees" are and what, by extension, their pension-fund
obligations will be. To be sure, the traditional agency law
criteria offer no paradigm of determinacy. But their application generally turns on factual variables within an employer's knowledge, thus permitting categorical judgments
about the "employee" status of claimants with similar job
descriptions. Agency law principles comport, moreover,
with our recent precedents and with the common understanding, reflected in those precedents, of the difference
between an employee and an independent contractor.

329OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. WILSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 90-1745. Argued January 15, 1992--Decided March 24, 1992
In sentencing respondent Wilson to prison for violating the Hobbs Act,

the District Court denied his request for credit under 18 U. S. C.

$ 3585(b) for the time he had spent in presentence detention by Tennessee authorities. After a state trial court credited such time against his
prison term for state-law convictions, the Court of Appeals reversed the
District Court's ruling, holding that he had a right to federal credit and
that the District Court should have awarded it to him.

Held: It is the Attorney General who computes the amount of the

$ 3585(b) credit after the defendant has begun to serve his sentence.
Pp. 331-337.

(a) Effective in 1987, $ 3585(b)--which specifies, inter alia, that "[a]
defendant shall be given credit toward [his] term of imprisonment for
any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence
commences," if such time "has not been credited against another sentence" (emphasis added)--replaced a statute which had provided, among
other things, that "[t]he Attorney General shall give any such person
credit" (emphasis added). Under the predecessor statute, the Attorney
General, through the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), computed the amount
of credit after taking custody of the sentenced federal offender.
Pp. 331-333.

(b) Section 3585(b) does not authorize a district court to compute the
credit at sentencing. By stating crucial verbs in the past and present
perfect tenses, the section indicates that the computation must occur
after the defendant begins his sentence. A sentencing court, therefore,
cannot apply the section. Indeed, the District Court here could not
have made the necessary computation at sentencing, since the credit is
based on how much time a defendant "has spent" (not "will have spent")
prior to beginning his sentence. The court did not then know when the
state-court proceedings would end or when the federal authorities
would take Wilson into custody, and only could have speculated about
the amount of time that he would spend in detention. Moreover, it is
immaterial that such detention "ha[d] not been credited" against a state
sentence at the time of Wilson's federal sentencing, since basing the

Opinion of the Court
(c) In light of the sentencing court's inability to compute the credit,
the Attorney General must continue to make the calculation as he did
in the past, even though $ 3585(b) no longer mentions him. The offender has a right to certain jail-time credit under the section, and BOP
must know how much of a sentence remains in order to fulfill its statutory duty of administering the sentence. Congress' conversion of the
former statute's active language into the passive voice in $ 3585(b) is
a slim ground for presuming an intention to change well-established
procedures for determining the credit. Pp. 334-336.

(d) The general presumption that Congress contemplates a change
whenever it amends a statute is overcome in this case by the foregoing
analysis. Because the statute was entirely rewritten, and because any
other interpretation would require this Court to stretch $ 3585(b)'s language, it is likely that the former reference to the Attorney General was
simply lost in the shuffle. This interpretation does not render the 1987
revision meaningless, since Congress altered the predecessor statute in
at least three other ways. Pp. 336-337.

Opinion of the Court

I
In the summer and early fall of 1988, respondent Richard
Wilson committed several crimes in Putnam County, Tennessee. The precise details of these crimes do not concern us
here. It suffices to state that Tennessee authorities arrested Wilson on October 5, 1988, and held him in jail pending the outcome of federal and state prosecutions. After
certain preliminary proceedings, Wilson eventually pleaded
guilty to various federal and state criminal charges.

On November 29, 1989, the United States District Court
for the Middle District of Tennessee sentenced Wilson to 96
months' imprisonment for violation of the Hobbs Act, 18
U. S. C. $ 1951. The District Court denied Wilson's request
for credit for time served during his presentence state custody. On December 12, 1989, a Tennessee trial court sentenced Wilson to several years' imprisonment for robbery
and two other felonies. In contrast to the District Court,
the state court granted Wilson 429 days of credit toward
his state sentence. Later that day, Tennessee authorities
transferred Wilson to federal custody, and he began serving
his federal sentence.

Wilson appealed the District Court's refusal to give him
credit for the time that he had spent in state custody. Reversing the District Court, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit held that Wilson had a right to credit
and that the District Court should have awarded it to him.
916 F. 2d 1115 (1990). We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 807
(1991), and now reverse.

The Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons
(BOP), has responsibility for imprisoning federal offenders.
See 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(a). From 1966 until 1987, a provision
codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 3568 (1982 ed.) required the Attorney
General to award federal prisoners credit for certain time

503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT
332 UNITED STATES v. WILSON

Opinion of the Court
spent in jail prior to the commencement of their sentences.This provision, in part, stated:

"The Attorney General shall give any such personcredit toward service of his sentence for any days spent
in custody in connection with the offense or acts forwhich sentence was imposed." Pub. L. 89-465, $ 4, 80
Stat. 217 (emphasis added).
The Attorney General implemented this provision by com-puting the amount of credit after taking custody of the sentenced federal offender. Although the federal courts couldreview the Attorney General's determination, the sentencing
court did not participate in computation of the credit. See,
e. g., United States v. Morgan, 425 F. 2d 1388, 1389-1390(CA5 1970).

In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. $ 3551
et seq., which became effective in 1987, Congress rewrote$ 3568 and recodified it at $ 3585(b). Unlike its predecessor,

$ 3585(b) does not mention the Attorney General. Writtenin the passive voice, it states:

"A defendant shall be given credit toward the serviceof a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent
in official detention prior to the date the sentencecommences--

"(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentencewas imposed; or
"(2) as a result of any other charge for which the de-fendant was arrested after the commission of the offense
for which the sentence was imposed;
"that has not been credited against another sentence."18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b) (emphasis added).

In describing the defendant's right to receive jail-timecredit in this manner, the provision has created doubt about
whether district courts now may award credit when impos-ing a sentence. The question has significance in this case

333Cite as: 503 U. S. 329 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
because the final clause of $ 3585(b) allows a defendant toreceive credit only for detention time "that has not been

credited against another sentence." When the DistrictCourt imposed Wilson's 96-month sentence on November 29,
1989, Wilson had not yet received credit for his detentiontime from the Tennessee courts. However, by the time the
Attorney General imprisoned Wilson on December 12, 1989,the Tennessee trial court had awarded Wilson 429 days of
credit. As a result, Wilson could receive a larger credit ifthe statute permitted crediting at sentencing, and thus before the detention time had been credited against anothersentence.

The United States argues that it is the Attorney Generalwho computes the amount of the credit after the defendant
begins his sentence and that the Court of Appeals erred inordering the District Court to award credit to Wilson. Wilson counters that $ 3585(b) authorizes the District Court tocompute the amount of the credit at sentencing. We agree
with the United States. A

We do not accept Wilson's argument that $ 3585(b) author-izes a district court to award credit at sentencing. Section
3585(b) indicates that a defendant may receive credit againsta sentence that "

was imposed." It also specifies that theamount of the credit depends on the time that the defendant

"has spent" in official detention "prior to the date the sen-tence commences." Congress' use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes. See, e. g., Otte v. United States,419 U. S. 43, 49-50 (1974); Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.
Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 63-64, n. 4(1987). By using these verbs in the past and present perfect
tenses, Congress has indicated that computation of the creditmust occur after the defendant begins his sentence. A district court, therefore, cannot apply $ 3585(b) at sentencing.Federal defendants do not always begin to serve their sentences immediately. In this case, the District Court sen503us2$50N 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT
334 UNITED STATES v. WILSON

Opinion of the Court
tenced Wilson on November 29, 1989, but Wilson did notbegin his sentence until December 12, 1989. At sentencing,

the District Court only could have speculated about theamount of time that Wilson would spend in detention prior
to the commencement of his sentence; the court did not knowwhen the state-court proceedings would end or when the federal authorities would take Wilson into custody. Because$ 3585(b) bases the credit on how much time a defendant "has
spent" (not "will have spent") prior to beginning his sen-tence, the District Court could not compute the amount of
the credit at sentencing.The final phrase of $ 3585(b) confirms this interpretation.
As noted above, it authorizes credit only for time that "hasnot been credited against another sentence." Wilson argues
that this phrase does not prevent him from receiving creditbecause his official detention "ha[d] not been credited"
against the state sentence when the District Court imposedthe federal sentence. Under this logic, however, if the District Court had sentenced Wilson a few weeks later than itdid, he would not have received credit under $ 3585(b). This
interpretation of the statute would make the award of creditarbitrary, a result not to be presumed lightly. See

UnitedStates v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 580 (1981) (absurd results

are to be avoided). We can imagine no reason why Congresswould desire the presentence detention credit, which determines how much time an offender spends in prison, to dependon the timing of his sentencing. For these reasons, we conclude that $ 3585(b) does not authorize a district court tocompute the credit at sentencing.

B
We agree with the United States that the Attorney Gen-eral must continue to compute the credit under $ 3585(b) as

he did under the former $ 3568. When Congress writes astatute in the passive voice, it often fails to indicate who
must take a required action. This silence can make the

Opinion of the Court
meaning of a statute somewhat difficult to ascertain. See,
e. g., E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112,
128 (1977); Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441U. S. 91, 102-103 (1979). Yet, even though $ 3585(b) no

longer mentions the Attorney General, we do not see how
he can avoid determining the amount of a defendant's jail-time credit.

After a district court sentences a federal offender, the At-torney General, through BOP, has the responsibility for administering the sentence. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(a) ("A per-son who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment . . .
shall be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons
until the expiration of the term imposed"). To fulfill this
duty, BOP must know how much of the sentence the offender
has left to serve. Because the offender has a right to certain jail-time credit under $ 3585(b), and because the district
court cannot determine the amount of the credit at sentencing, the Attorney General has no choice but to make the determination as an administrative matter when imprisoning
the defendant.

Crediting jail time against federal sentences long has operated in this manner. After Congress enacted $ 3568 in 1966,
BOP developed detailed procedures and guidelines for determining the credit available to prisoners. See Federal Prison
System Program Statement No. 5880.24 (Sept. 5, 1979) and
Federal Bureau of Prisons Operations Memorandum No.
EMS DM 154-89 (Oct. 23, 1989), Apps. B and C to Brief for
United States (stating BOP's procedures for computing jailtime credit determinations); see also United States v. Lucas,
898 F. 2d 1554 (CA11 1990). Federal regulations have afforded prisoners administrative review of the computation of
their credits, see 28 CFR $$ 542.10-542.16 (1990); Lucas,
supra, at 1556, and prisoners have been able to seek judicial
review of these computations after exhausting their administrative remedies, see United States v. Bayless, 940 F. 2d 300,
304-305 (CA8 1991); United States v. Flanagan, 868 F. 2d

1544, 1546 (CA11 1989); United States v. Martinez, 837 F. 2d
861, 865-866 (CA9 1988). Congress' conversion of an active
sentence in $ 3568 into a passive sentence in $ 3585(b) strikes
us as a rather slim ground for presuming an intention to
change these well-established procedures. "It is not lightly
to be assumed that Congress intended to depart from a long
established policy." Robertson v. Railroad Labor Bd., 268
U. S. 619, 627 (1925).

C

Wilson argues that our conclusion conflicts with the familiar maxim that, when Congress alters the words of a statute,
it must intend to change the statute's meaning. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23-24 (1983). He asserts
that, by removing the explicit reference to the Attorney General when it enacted $ 3585(b), Congress expressed a desire
to remove the Attorney General from the process of computing sentences. Otherwise, Wilson contends, Congress
would have had no reason to modify the provision as it did.
We have no difficulty with the general presumption that
Congress contemplates a change whenever it amends a statute. In this case, however, we find that presumption overcome by our conclusions that the District Court cannot perform the necessary calculation at the time of sentencing and
that the Attorney General, in implementing the defendant's
sentence, cannot avoid computing the credit.

We candidly acknowledge that we do not know what happened to the reference to the Attorney General during the
revision. We do know that Congress entirely rewrote $ 3568
when it changed it to its present form in $ 3585(b). It rearranged its clauses, rephrased its central idea in the passive
voice, and more than doubled its length. In view of these
changes, and because any other interpretation would require
us to stretch the meaning of the words that $ 3585(b) now
includes, we think it likely that the former reference to the
Attorney General was simply lost in the shuffle.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Our interpretation of $ 3585(b), however, does not render
the 1987 revision meaningless. Congress altered $ 3568 in
at least three ways when it enacted $ 3585(b). First, Congress replaced the term "custody" with the term "official
detention." Second, Congress made clear that a defendant
could not receive a double credit for his detention time.
Third, Congress enlarged the class of defendants eligible to
receive credit. Under the old law, a defendant could receive
credit only for time spent in custody in connection with "the
offense . . . for which sentence was imposed." Under the
new law, a defendant may receive credit both for this time
and for time spent in official detention in connection with
"any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after
the commission of the offense for which the sentence was
imposed." In light of these revisions, and for the foregoing
reasons, we conclude that the Attorney General may continue to compute the amount of the credit. The judgment
of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice White joins,
dissenting.

Today's rigid interpretation of a remedial statute is not
supported by the text, legislative history, or underlying policies of the statute. In Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S.
152, 158 (1990), this Court said that "[i]n determining the
meaning of [a] statute, we look not only to the particular
statutory language, but to the design of the statute as a
whole and to its object and policy." The Court has failed to
do this today. The statute at issue, 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b),
gives the convicted defendant a right to have his term of
imprisonment shortened by the amount of time he has already spent in either federal or state custody as a result of

503us2$50I 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT
338 UNITED STATES v. WILSON

Stevens, J., dissenting
his offense, provided that the time has not already been cred-ited against another sentence.

1

The defendant's right to the full credit authorized by thestatute is obviously an important right. Both the Attorney

General and the sentencing judge have a duty to respect andprotect that right. Moreover, it is clear that in the event
there is a dispute between the parties over the right to acredit, the dispute must be resolved by the court. No one
contends that the Attorney General has unreviewable discre-tion to determine the appropriate credit in any case.

2

In most cases, the calculation of the credit is a routine,ministerial task that will not give rise to any dispute.

3 Occasionally, however, as this case demonstrates, there may be alegitimate difference of opinion either about the meaning of

the statute or about the relevant facts.4 Such a dispute

1 Title 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b) provides:
"(b) Credit for Prior Custody.--A defendant shall be given credit
toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent
in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences--

"(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed; or
"(2) as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the sentence was
imposed;

"that has not been credited against another sentence."

2 Prior to 1987, when the statute assigned the initial responsibility for

determining the length of the credit to the Attorney General, it was
settled that his determination was subject to judicial review after the
prisoner exhausted his administrative remedies. See Chua Han Mow v.
United States, 730 F. 2d 1308, 1313 (CA9 1984), cert. denied, 470 U. S.
1031 (1985).

3 As respondent acknowledged, "the arithmetical task of figuring out the

exact date an offender will finish serving his sentence" "is essentially an
administrative ministerial function." Tr. of Oral Arg. 4; see also id., at
10, 21, 52.

4 Typically the dispute centers on whether the questioned time was "official detention" or whether the time has already been "credited" to another sentence. See, e. g., United States v. Beston, 936 F. 2d 361 (CA8
1991) (per curiam); United States v. Chalker, 915 F. 2d 1254 (CA9 1990);

must, of course, be resolved by the judge. The only questionthat remains, then, is when the judge shall resolve the

issue--at the time of sentencing, when the defendant is rep-resented by counsel, or at some later date, after the defendant has begun to serve his sentence.The credit at issue in this case was a period of almost 14
months that respondent had spent in state custody before heentered into a plea agreement with the federal prosecutor.

5

Prior to the amendment of $ 3585(b),6 which became effectivein 1987, the statute--at least as construed by the Sixth Circuit where this case arose--did not authorize a credit fortime spent in state custody. See

United States v. Blank-enship, 733 F. 2d 433, 434 (1984).
7 Consistent with that preamendment practice, the District Court denied respondent'srequest for credit for the 14 months that he had spent in

state custody.8 There are two points that emerge from that

5 In the District Court, the Government did not take any position with
respect to respondent's request for jail credit, stating that "as to defense's
petition that the time spent incarcerated on state charges for the crimes
which occurred prior to the federal conspiracy, that's up to the court and
the government takes no position as to that." Tr. 86. In the Court of
Appeals, however, the Government contended that respondent was not
entitled to the credit. See Brief for Appellee in No. 89-6583 (CA6),
pp. 14-15.

6 Before $ 3585 became effective, 18 U. S. C. $ 3568 (1982 ed.) governed

credit for presentence time spent in official detention.

7 See also United States v. Garcia-Gutierrez, 835 F. 2d 585, 586 (CA5

1988) (construing former $ 3568).

8 "IT IS THE JUDGMENT OF THIS COURT THAT defendant is

hereby committed to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons
to be imprisoned for a term of:

"Ninety six months (96), which includes an upward departure of thirtythree months. Defendant is unable to pay a fine, or the cost of his incarceration or supervised release. Defendant will not be given any credit
for the time spent in state custody." Record, Doc. No. 56.

The Government defended this ruling in its brief to the Court of Appeals, arguing:

"Although there is some authority that a defendant is entitled to credit
for time served in state custody once a federal detainer has been lodged,
the state confinement must be the product of action by federal law enforce503us2$50I 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
ruling: First, the District Court erroneously construed theamended statute, and second, the legal question that the District Court decided was ripe for decision at the time ofsentencing.

In its opinion today, the Court emphasizes the fact thatthe state court later awarded respondent credit for his 14
months in pretrial detention, arguing that he thereforewould not have been entitled to a federal credit if the federal
determination had been made after the state sentence wasimposed. See

ante, at 333, 334. This argument is mislead-ing for three reasons. First, if the Federal District Court

had granted respondent's request, it seems unlikely that the
state court would also have allowed the credit. Second, al-though the Court assumes that the risk of a double credit

could be avoided by postponing the credit determinationuntil after the convicted defendant begins to serve his federal sentence, that assumption is erroneous because stateproceedings frequently do not terminate until after a defendant begins to serve his federal sentence or, indeed, in somecases, until after the defendant has been released from federal custody. Third, when a correct federal sentence, including a correct credit for pretrial custody, has been imposed,the subsequent action of a state court concerning the amount

of punishment for any state offenses the defendant may havecommitted is purely a matter of state concern.

In this case, for example, if the Federal Sentencing Guide-lines had prescribed a sentence of less than 14 months, and
if the District Court, or indeed the Attorney General, hadawarded respondent the proper credit, and therefore released him from custody, it would be bizarre to conclude that
ment officials. United States v. Garcia-Gutierrez, 835 F. 2d 585, 586 (5th
Cir. 1988); United States v. Harris, 876 F. 2d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir. 1989),

Stevens, J., dissenting
the Federal Government should rearrest him if a Tennesseecourt subsequently decided to give him the same credit because he would already have served almost 14 months in cus-tody, thus fulfilling his federal sentence. The possibility
that a state court will allow the same credit that a federalcourt allows exists whenever a state sentence is imposed
after the federal credit determination is made, whether it ismade by the trial judge or by the Attorney General and
whether it is made at the sentencing hearing or at the com-mencement of the federal sentence. The

likelihood that thestate court will allow a second credit after a federal credit

has been allowed seems remote no matter when or by whomthe federal determination is made. More importantly, the
existence of a hypothetical risk of double credits in rare casesinvolving overlapping state and federal jurisdiction is not a
sufficient reason for refusing to give effect to the plain lan-guage of the statute in cases in which no such problem is
presented. I

The Court's entire analysis rests on an incorrect premise.The Court assumes that the statute mandates one of two
starkly different procedures: Either the credit determinationmust

always be made by the Attorney General after the de-fendant has begun to serve his sentence,

or it must alwaysbe made by the sentencing judge at the time of sentencing.

Neither of these procedures is compelled by the statutorytext. An ordinary reading of the statute's plain language
("[a] defendant shall be given credit toward the service of aterm of imprisonment . . .") suggests that the judge has
ample authority to delegate the task of calculating the creditto a probation officer or to the prosecutor, subject, of course,
to judicial review, or to make it himself in the first instance.Surely there is nothing in the statutory text that purports
to deprive the judge of discretion to follow whichever proce-dure seems best suited to the particular facts of a given case.
The text, which uses the passive voice, does not specify who

503us2$50I 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT
342 UNITED STATES v. WILSON

Stevens, J., dissenting
will make the decision about jail credit. Certainly weshould give effect to Congress' choice of words, and understand that the text, as written, does not identify a particulardecisionmaker, and therefore, the appropriate decisionmaker
may be either the judge or the Attorney General dependingon the circumstances.

9

The statute does indicate that the decision should be madeafter "the sentence was imposed" and that the credit shall

include time spent in official detention "prior to the date thesentence commences" even if some of that time is after the
sentencing hearing. If, as is true in most cases, the con-victed defendant begins to serve his sentence immediately
after it is imposed, it is perfectly consistent with the text insuch cases to have the judge determine the credit at the
conclusion of the sentencing hearing. Even if the com-mencement of the sentence is postponed until a later date,
an order specifying the amount of the credit to which thedefendant was then entitled, and directing that an additional
credit be given if appropriate, would also conform to thestatutory text. The statute does not prohibit the judge
from resolving the issue at any time after the sentence hasbeen imposed.

10 In short, the text does not mandate any

particular procedure that must be followed in every case.

9 Those Courts of Appeals that have recognized the shared role of the
sentencing judge and the Attorney General in the decision to award jail
credit include the Ninth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit. See, e. g., United
States v. Chalker, 915 F. 2d, at 1258; United States v. Beston, 936 F. 2d,
at 363.

10 "Instead, we conclude that by failing to specify to whom such power

was vested, Congress intended the Attorney General and the district
courts to have concurrent authority to grant credit for time served. As
a practical matter, our holding will give to the district court, in its discretion, the initial opportunity to grant credit for time previously served.
We believe this result to be fully compatible with Congress' intent in passing the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The Senate Report,
in discussing the sentencing provisions of the Act, specifically decried the
lack of certainty and finality under the pre-Guidelines sentencing system

Although Congress' use of the passive voice clearly leavesopen the question of who the decisionmaker is with respect

to jail credit, the placement of $ 3585 in Subchapter D-Imprisonment, in which "the court" is called upon to determine the sentence, $ 3581, impose the sentence, $ 3582, in-clude a term of supervised release, $ 3583, and determine
whether the term is to run concurrently or consecutively inthe case of multiple sentences, $ 3584, clearly points to the
judge as the person who is to calculate credit, $ 3585, in thefirst instance. Congress could have made this perfectly
clear by repeating the phrase "the court" in $ 3585, but thatwas made almost unnecessary by placing $ 3585 in a subchapter in which the court clearly had responsibility for everyaction that needed to be taken, but could also delegate actions to the appropriate authorities.

The Court's textual argument amounts to nothing morethan an assertion that because

sometimes all issues relatingto the credit determination will not be ripe for decision at

the time of sentencing, the trial court never has authority tomake the credit determination even in cases that are ripe for

11 Certainly there are some credit issues that can arise that are ripe for

decision at the time of the sentencing hearing. What constitutes "official
detention" is one such issue. It is also an issue on which the Courts of
Appeals are currently divided. For example, in Moreland v. United
States, 932 F. 2d 690, 692 (1991), the Eighth Circuit agreed with Moreland
that he should receive credit for the time he spent at a community treatment center; however, in United States v. Insley, 927 F. 2d 185, 186 (1991),
the Fourth Circuit held that Insley's conditions of release did not consti503us2$50I 02-19-99 09:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
Court's holding must rest on its understanding of the legisla-tive history. The history on which the Court relies includes

no relevant comments in the Committee Reports or the de-bates. It consists only of the fact that prior to 1987 the
statute directed the Attorney General to make the creditdetermination. See

ante, at 331-332. It seems to me, how-ever, that that smidgen of history merely raises the issue

without answering it. The fact that Congress carefully re-wrote the relevant section in a way that makes the defendant's right significantly more valuable tends to support theconclusion that the changes in language were deliberate and
should not be ignored. See Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S.151 (1991);

United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz,449 U. S. 166, 179 (1980). Recognizing the district court's

authority to enter an appropriate order at the conclusion ofthe sentencing hearing is entirely consistent with a congressional purpose to enhance the value of this right.

III
No statutory policy would be adversely affected by recog-nizing the district court's authority to make the initial credit

determination in appropriate cases, and in fact, two impor-tant policies would be served. First, as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has observed, see n. 10, supra,allowing the district court, in its discretion, to compute the
credit when the sentence is imposed furthers the interest inproviding prisoners with prompt, accurate, and precise information about the time they must spend in prison. Thispolicy is expressly identified in the Senate Report describing

tute custody for purposes of credit; in Ramsey v. Brennan, 878 F. 2d 995,
996 (1989), the Seventh Circuit would not credit the time that Ramsey
spent in a halfway house while awaiting trial, and in United States v.
Woods, 888 F. 2d, at 656, the Tenth Circuit held that Woods was not entitled to credit for the time he spent at a residential treatment center when
he was out on bond. In each of these cases, the issue was ripe for decision
at the sentencing hearing.

the value of a procedure "whereby the offender, the victim,and society all know the prison release date at the time of the

initial sentencing by the court, subject to minor adjustmentsbased on prison behavior called `good time.' " S. Rep. No.
98-225, p. 46 (1983).12Second, and of even greater importance, allowing the district court to make the credit determination furthers theinterest in uniform and evenhanded sentencing that is the
centerpiece of the entire Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.When there are disputed issues that must be resolved by a
judge, an adversarial proceeding, in which the parties arerepresented by counsel and the proceeding takes place in
open court and on the record, is the best guarantee of a fairand accurate decision.

13 The convicted defendant is represented by trial counsel at the time of sentencing, but usually
must fend for himself after he is incarcerated. Committing
the decision to the Attorney General after the defendant hasbegun to serve his sentence, particularly if he must serve his

sentence in some facility remote from the district of convic-tion, can only minimize the effective participation of defense
counsel. Indeed, it may generate meritless pro se claims forcredit that could be avoided by prompt consideration at
sentencing, as well as complicate and delay the dispositionof meritorious claims. A flexible approach that allows the
judge to decide when, and how, the credit determination

to redress the situation in which "prisoners often do not really know
how long they will spend in prison until the very day they are released."
S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 49.

13 Several States have recognized the advantages of assigning to the

court the task of calculating jail credit. See Fla. Stat. $ 921.161 (1991) ("A
sentence of imprisonment shall not begin to run before the date it is imposed, but the court imposing a sentence shall allow a defendant credit for
all of the time he spent in the county jail before sentence. The credit
must be for a specified period of time and shall be provided for in the
sentence"); see also Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 2900.5(d) (West Supp. 1992);
Mass. Gen. Laws $ 279:33A (1990).

should be made is fully consistent with the purposes of thestatute and with its text.

14

For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals.

14 The information required for the sentencing judge to make a credit
determination could easily become part of the information that is routinely
provided to the judge in the presentence report. Such a report already
contains the convicted offender's prior criminal history, which includes
much of the information necessary to decide whether he is eligible for
credit for time in custody. The report could contain the amount of jail
credit the person is entitled to, and if there are other sentences pending
or unserved, a recommendation whether the current sentence should be
concurrent or consecutive to any prior sentences.

SUTER et al. v. ARTIST M. et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 90-1488. Argued December 2, 1991--Decided March 25, 1992
The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 provides that a

State will be reimbursed by the Federal Government for certain expenses it incurs in administering foster care and adoption services, if it
submits a plan for approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Among its requisite features, an approved plan must provide that
it "shall be in effect in all" of a State's political subdivisions and "be
mandatory upon them," 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(3), and that "reasonable efforts will be made" to prevent removal of children from their homes
and to facilitate reunification of families where removal has occurred,

$ 671(a)(15). Respondents, child beneficiaries of the Act, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that petitioners, the Director and
the Guardianship Administrator of the Illinois agency responsible for
investigating charges of child abuse and neglect and providing services
for abused and neglected children and their families, had failed to make
reasonable efforts to preserve and reunite families, in contravention of

$ 671(a)(15). The District Court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss,
holding, inter alia, that the Act contained an implied cause of action
and that suit could also be brought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The court
entered an injunction against petitioners, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. That court relied on Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496
U. S. 498, to hold that the "reasonable efforts" clause of the Act could
be enforced through a $ 1983 action, and applied the standard of Cort v.
Ash, 422 U. S. 66, to find that the Act created an implied right of action
entitling respondents to bring suit directly under the Act.

Held:

1. Section 671(a)(15) does not confer on its beneficiaries a private
right enforceable in a $ 1983 action. Pp. 355-364.

(a) Section 1983 is not available to enforce a violation of a federal
statute where Congress has foreclosed enforcement in the enactment
itself and "where the statute did not create enforceable rights, privileges, or immunities within the meaning of $ 1983." Wright v. Roanoke
Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418, 423. Congress
must confer such rights unambiguously when it intends to impose conditions on the grant of federal moneys. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. Thus, statutory provisions must

503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:12 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
be analyzed in detail, in light of the entire legislative enactment, to
determine whether the language in question created rights within the
meaning of $ 1983. Pp. 355-357.

(b) Congress did not unambiguously confer upon the Act's beneficiaries the right to enforce the "reasonable efforts" requirement. The
Act is mandatory only insofar as it requires a State to have an approved
plan containing the listed features; and it is undisputed that the Illinois
plan provides that reasonable efforts at prevention and reunification will
be made. Respondents err in basing their $ 1983 argument, in part, on

$ 671(a)(3)'s "in effect" language, which is directed to the requirement
that the plan apply to all of a State's political subdivisions and is not
intended to otherwise modify the word "plan." Unlike the Medicaid
legislation in Wilder, supra--which actually required the States to
adopt reasonable and adequate reimbursement rates for health care providers and which, along with regulations, set forth in some detail the
factors to be considered in determining the methods for calculating
rates--here, the statute provides no further guidance as to how "reasonable efforts" are to be measured, and, within broad limits, lets the State
decide how to comply with the directive. Since other sections of the
Act provide mechanisms for the Secretary to enforce the "reasonable
efforts" clause, the absence of a $ 1983 remedy does not make the clause
a dead letter. The regulations also are not specific and provide no notice that failure to do anything other than submit a plan with the requisite features is a further condition on the receipt of federal funds. And
the legislative history indicates that the Act left a great deal of discretion to the States to meet the "reasonable efforts" requirement.
Pp. 358-363.

2. The Act does not create an implied cause of action for private enforcement. Respondents have failed to demonstrate that Congress intended to make such a remedy available. See Cort, supra; Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15-16.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the
Court.

This case raises the question whether private individuals
have the right to enforce by suit a provision of the Adoption
Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Adoption Act or
Act), 94 Stat. 500, 42 U. S. C. $$ 620-628, 670-679a, either
under the Act itself or through an action under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983.1 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held
that 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(15) contained an implied right of action, and that respondents could enforce this section of the
Act through an action brought under $ 1983 as well. We
hold that the Act does not create an enforceable right on
behalf of respondents.

The Adoption Act establishes a federal reimbursement
program for certain expenses incurred by the States in adof Washington, and Mario J. Palumbo, Attorney General of West Virginia;
and for the Council of State Governments et al. by Richard Ruda and
Charles Rothfeld.

Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the American
Association for Protecting Children et al. by James D. Weill and Robert
G. Schwartz; for the American Bar Association by Talbot S. D'alemberte;
for the Illinois State Bar Association et al. by Robert E. Lehrer, Dennis

of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or
Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects or causes to be subjected,
any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction
thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities, secured
by the Constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an
action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."

Opinion of the Court
ministering foster care and adoption services. The Act provides that States will be reimbursed for a percentage of foster care and adoption assistance payments when the State
satisfies the requirements of the Act. 42 U. S. C. $$ 672-674,
675(4)(A) (1988 ed. and Supp. I).

To participate in the program, States must submit a plan
to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for approval
by the Secretary. $$ 670, 671. Section 671 lists 16 qualifications which state plans must contain in order to gain the
Secretary's approval. As relevant here, the Act provides:

"(a) Requisite features of State plan

"In order for a State to be eligible for payments under
this part, it shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which--. . . . .

"(3) provides that the plan shall be in effect in all
political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered
by them, be mandatory upon them;. . . . .

"(15) effective October 1, 1983, provides that, in each
case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the
placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home,
and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his
home . . . ." $$ 671(a)(3), (15).

Petitioners in this action are Sue Suter and Gary T. Morgan, the Director and the Guardianship Administrator, respectively, of the Illinois Department of Children and Family
Services (DCFS). DCFS is the state agency responsible for,
among other things, investigating charges of child abuse and
neglect and providing services to abused and neglected children and their families. DCFS is authorized under Illinois
law, see Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 37, || 802-1 et seq. (1989), to gain
temporary custody of an abused or neglected child after a

Opinion of the Court
hearing and order by the Juvenile Court. Alternatively, the
court may order that a child remain in his home under a
protective supervisory order entered against his parents.
See Artist M. v. Johnson, 917 F. 2d 980, 982-983 (CA7 1990).
Once DCFS has jurisdiction over a child either in its temporary custody, or in the child's home under a protective order,
all services are provided to the child and his family by means
of an individual caseworker at DCFS to whom the child's
case is assigned. App. 35-39.

Respondents filed this class-action suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the Adoption Act.2 They
alleged that petitioners, in contravention of 42 U. S. C.

$ 671(a)(15), failed to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of children from their homes and to facilitate reunification of families where removal had occurred.3 This failure
occurred, as alleged by respondents, because DCFS failed
promptly to assign caseworkers to children placed in DCFS
custody and promptly to reassign cases when caseworkers
were on leave from DCFS. App. 6-8. The District Court,
without objection from petitioners, certified two separate
classes seeking relief, including all children who are or will
be wards of DCFS and are placed in foster care or remain in
their homes under a judicial protective order.4 Artist M. v.

2 Count III of the complaint alleged that petitioners violated the Due
Process Clause of the Constitution. App. 26. This count was dismissed
by the District Court and was not appealed. Artist M. v. Johnson, 917
F. 2d 980, 982, n. 3 (CA7 1990).

3 Although DCFS administers the child welfare program for the entire

State of Illinois, respondents only alleged violations of the Adoption Act
as to Cook County. App. 6.

4 Specifically, the following classes were certified by the District Court:

"Class A: Children who are or will be the subjects of neglect, dependency
or abuse petitions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Juvenile Division (`Juvenile Court'), who are or will be in the custody of [DCFS] or in

Opinion of the Court
Johnson, 726 F. Supp. 690, 691 (ND Ill. 1989). The District
Court denied a motion to dismiss filed by petitioners, holding, as relevant here, that the Adoption Act contained an
implied cause of action and that suit could also be brought
to enforce the Act under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. 726 F. Supp., at
696, 697.

The District Court then entered an injunction requiring
petitioners to assign a caseworker to each child placed in
DCFS custody within three working days of the time the
case is first heard in Juvenile Court, and to reassign a caseworker within three working days of the date any caseworker relinquishes responsibility for a particular case.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a. The 3-working-day deadline was
found by the District Court to "realistically reflec[t] the institutional capabilities of DCFS," id., at 55a, based in part on
petitioners' assertion that assigning caseworkers within that
time frame "would not be overly burdensome." Id., at 54a.
The District Court, on partial remand from the Court of Appeals, made additional factual findings regarding the nature
of the delays in assigning caseworkers and the progress of
DCFS reforms at the time the preliminary injunction was
entered. App. 28-50.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. 917 F. 2d 980 (CA7 1990).
Relying heavily on this Court's decision in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498 (1990), the Court of Apa home under DCFS supervision by an order of Juvenile Court and who
are now or will be without a DCFS caseworker for a significant period
of time.

"Class B: Children who are or will be the subjects of neglect, dependency
or abuse petitions filed in Juvenile Court who are or will be placed in
DCFS' custody and who are or will be without a DCFS caseworker for a
significant period of time." Artist M. v. Johnson, 726 F. Supp. 690, 691
(ND Ill. 1989).

The "Class B" plaintiffs only raised a constitutional due process claim,
which was dismissed by the District Court. See n. 2, supra.

Opinion of the Court
peals held that the "reasonable efforts" clause of the Adop-tion Act could be enforced through an action under $ 1983.

917 F. 2d, at 987-989.5 That court, applying the standardestablished in Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66 (1975), also found that
the Adoption Act created an implied right of action such thatprivate individuals could bring suit directly under the Act to
enforce the provisions relied upon by respondents. 917 F.2d, at 989-991. We granted certiorari, 500 U. S. 915 (1991),
and now reverse.6

5 The Court of Appeals also noted that the Fourth Circuit, in L. J. ex rel.
Darr v. Massinga, 838 F. 2d 118 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1018 (1989),
had found the substantive requirements listed in $ 671(a) to be enforceable
under $ 1983. 917 F. 2d, at 988.

Several cases have addressed the enforceability of various sections of
the Adoption Act. See, e. g., Massinga, supra, at 123 (finding case plan
requirements enforceable under $ 1983); Lynch v. Dukakis, 719 F. 2d 504
(CA1 1983) (same); Norman v. Johnson, 739 F. Supp. 1182 (ND Ill. 1990)
(finding "reasonable efforts" clause enforceable under $ 1983); B. H. v.
Johnson, 715 F. Supp. 1387, 1401 (ND Ill. 1989) (finding "reasonable efforts" clause not enforceable under $ 1983).

6 Subsequent to oral argument, respondents notified the Court of the

entry of a consent decree in the case of B. H. v. Suter, No. 88-C 5599 (ND
Ill.), which they suggest may affect our decision on the merits, or indeed
may make the instant action moot. We find no merit to respondents' contentions, and conclude that the B. H. consent decree has no bearing on the
issue the Court decides today. Sue Suter, petitioner in this case, is the
defendant in the B. H. suit, which alleges statewide deficiencies in the
operations of DCFS. See B. H. v. Johnson, supra. The class approved
in B. H. contains "all persons who are or will be in the custody of [DCFS]
and who have been or will be placed somewhere other than with their
parents." 715 F. Supp., at 1389.

Respondents suggest that because petitioner has agreed in the B. H.
consent decree to provide "reasonable efforts" to maintain and reunify
families, she is somehow precluded from arguing in this case that

$ 671(a)(15) does not grant a right for individual plaintiffs to enforce that
section by suit. As we have recognized previously this Term, however,
parties may agree to provisions in a consent decree which exceed the
requirements of federal law. Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502
U. S. 367, 389 (1992). Paragraph two of the B. H. decree itself provides
that the decree is not an admission of any factual or legal issue. In addi503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:12 PAGES OPINPGT

355Cite as: 503 U. S. 347 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
In Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980), we first established that $ 1983 is available as a remedy for violations of
federal statutes as well as for constitutional violations. We
have subsequently recognized that $ 1983 is not available to
enforce a violation of a federal statute "where Congress has
foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment

tion, the B. H. consent decree does not require "reasonable efforts" with
no further definition, but rather defines the standard against which those
efforts are to be measured. See B. H. Consent Decree |||| 8, 16(a), pp. 12,
20. Thus, the agreement embodied in the consent decree is not inconsistent with the position petitioner asserts here, namely, that $ 671(a)(15) requiring "reasonable efforts," without further definition, does not create an
enforceable right on behalf of respondents to enforce the clause by suit.

Respondents next contend that the B. H. decree "may also render much
of this case moot." Supp. Brief for Respondents 8. Although petitioner
here is the defendant in B. H., the class certified in B. H. does not include
children living at home under a protective order, and therefore is more
narrow than the class certified in the instant suit. In addition, while
DCFS agrees in the B. H. consent decree to certain obligations, for example, a ceiling on the number of cases handled by each caseworker, none of
these obligations subsumes the injunction entered by the District Court
and affirmed by the Court of Appeals below, requiring petitioners to provide a caseworker within three days of when a child is first removed from
his home. Cf. Johnson v. Board of Ed. of Chicago, 457 U. S. 52 (1982)
(per curiam).

In short, the situation in this case is quite different from that in the
cases cited by respondents in which this Court remanded for further proceedings after events subsequent to the filing of the petition for certiorari
or the grant of certiorari affected the case before the Court. Unlike the
parties in J. Aron & Co. v. Mississippi Shipping Co., 361 U. S. 115 (1959)
(per curiam), the parties in the case before the Court have not entered a
consent decree. Unlike Kremens v. Bartley, 431 U. S. 119 (1977), the B. H.
decree does nothing to change the class at issue or the claims of the named
class members. And unlike American Foreign Service Assn. v. Garfinkel, 490 U. S. 153 (1989) (per curiam), where we noted that "[e]vents occurring since the District Court issued its ruling place this case in a light
far different from the one in which that court considered it," id., at 158, the
issue whether the reasonable efforts clause creates an enforceable right on
behalf of respondents is the same now as it was when decided by the
District Court below.

cause of action. That statute, as well as the statute beforeus today, was enacted by Congress pursuant to its spending
power.7 In Pennhurst, we noted that it was well establishedthat Congress has the power to fix the terms under which it
disburses federal money to the States. 451 U. S., at 17, cit-ing

Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Comm'n, 330U. S. 127 (1947); Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 (1970). As

stated in Pennhurst:

"The legitimacy of Congress' power to legislate underthe spending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the `con-tract.' There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance
if a State is unaware of the conditions or is unable toascertain what is expected of it. Accordingly, if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of fed-eral moneys, it must do so unambiguously." 451 U. S.,
at 17 (citations and footnote omitted).
We concluded that the statutory section sought to be en-forced by the

Pennhurst respondents did not provide suchunambiguous notice to the States because it spoke in terms

"intended to be hortatory, not mandatory." Id., at 24.In

Wright, the Brooke Amendment to existing housinglegislation imposed a ceiling on the rent which might be

charged low-income tenants living in public housing projects.

7 Article I, $ 8, cl. 1, of the Constitution contains the spending power,
which provides, "Congress shall have Power to . . . provide for the . . .
general Welfare of the United States."

Opinion of the Court
The regulations issued by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development in turn defined rent to include " `a reasonable amount for [use of] utilities,' " and further defined
how that term would be measured. Wright, supra, at 420-
421, n. 3. We held that tenants had an enforceable right to
sue the Housing Authority for utility charges claimed to be
in violation of these provisions. In Wilder, 496 U. S., at 503,
the Boren Amendment to the Medicaid Act required that
Medicaid providers be reimbursed according to rates that
the " `State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the
Secretary,' " are " `reasonable and adequate' " to meet the
costs of " `efficiently and economically operated facilities.' "
Again, we held that this language created an enforceable
right, on the part of providers seeking reimbursement, to
challenge the rates set by the State as failing to meet the
standards specified in the Boren Amendment.

In both Wright and Wilder the word "reasonable" occupied
a prominent place in the critical language of the statute or
regulation, and the word "reasonable" is similarly involved
here. But this, obviously, is not the end of the matter. The
opinions in both Wright and Wilder took pains to analyze the
statutory provisions in detail, in light of the entire legislative
enactment, to determine whether the language in question
created "enforceable rights, privileges, or immunities within
the meaning of $ 1983." Wright, supra, at 423. And in
Wilder, we caution that " `[s]ection 1983 speaks in terms of
"rights, privileges, or immunities," not violations of federal
law.' " Wilder, supra, at 509, quoting Golden State Transit
Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 106 (1989).

Did Congress, in enacting the Adoption Act, unambiguously confer upon the child beneficiaries of the Act a right
to enforce the requirement that the State make "reasonable
efforts" to prevent a child from being removed from his
home, and once removed to reunify the child with his family?
We turn now to that inquiry.

358 SUTER v. ARTIST M.

Opinion of the Court
As quoted above, 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(15) requires that toobtain federal reimbursement, a State have a plan which

"provides that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made. . . to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child
from his home, and . . . to make it possible for the child to
return to his home . . . ." As recognized by petitioners,respondents, and the courts below, the Act is mandatory in

its terms. However, in the light shed by Pennhurst, wemust examine exactly what is required of States by the Act.
Here, the terms of $ 671(a) are clear: "In order for a State tobe eligible for payments under this part, it shall have a plan
approved by the Secretary." Therefore the Act does placea requirement on the States, but that requirement only goes
so far as to ensure that the State have a plan approved by
the Secretary which contains the 16 listed features.8Respondents do not dispute that Illinois in fact has a plan

approved by the Secretary which provides that reasonable
efforts at prevention and reunification will be made. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 29-30.9 Respondents argue, however, that $ 1983

8 Contrary to respondents' assertion that finding 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a) to
require only the filing of a plan for approval by the Secretary would add
a new "prerequisite for the existence of a right under $ 1983," Brief for
Respondents 22, n. 6, our holding today imposes no new "prerequisites"
but merely counsels that each statute must be interpreted by its own
terms.

9 The state plan filed by Illinois relies on a state statute and DCFS

internal rules to meet the "reasonable efforts" requirement. Department
of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Development Services
Administration for Children, Youth and Families, Children's Bureau, State
Plan for Title IV-E of the Social Security Act Foster Care and Adoption
Assistance, State Illinois 2-13 (1988).

The Illinois statute to which the plan refers imposes a requirement that
before temporary custody may be ordered, the court must find that reasonable efforts have been made or good cause has been shown why "reasonable efforts cannot prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the
minor from his or her home." Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 37, || 802-10(2) (1989).
The statute further provides: "The Court shall require documentation by
representatives of [DCFS] or the probation department as to the reason503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:13 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
allows them to sue in federal court to obtain enforcement ofthis particular provision of the state plan. This argument

is based, at least in part, on the assertion that 42 U. S. C.$ 671(a)(3) requires that the State have a plan which is "in
effect." This section states that the state plan shall "pro-vid[e] that the plan shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if administered by them, be manda-tory upon them." But we think that "in effect" is directed
to the requirement that the plan apply to all political subdivi-sions of the State, and is not intended to otherwise modify
the word "plan." 10In

Wilder, the underlying Medicaid legislation similarlyrequired participating States to submit to the Secretary of

Health and Human Services a plan for medical assistance de-scribing the State's Medicaid program. But in that case we
held that the Boren Amendment actually required the Statesto adopt reasonable and adequate rates, and that this obligation was enforceable by the providers. We relied in part onthe fact that the statute and regulations set forth in some
detail the factors to be considered in determining the meth-ods for calculating rates.

Wilder, 496 U. S., at 519, n. 17.In the present case, however, the term "reasonable efforts" to maintain an abused or neglected child in his home,
able efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from his or her home, and shall consider the testimony
of any person as to those reasonable efforts." Ibid.

10 Respondents also based their claim for relief on 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(9)

which states that the state plan shall "provid[e] that where any agency of
the State has reason to believe that the home or institution in which a
child resides whose care is being paid for in whole or in part with funds
provided under this part or part B of this subchapter is unsuitable for the
child because of the neglect, abuse, or exploitation of such child, it shall
bring such condition to the attention of the appropriate court or law enforcement agency . . . ."

As this subsection is merely another feature which the state plan must
include to be approved by the Secretary, it does not afford a cause of action
to the respondents anymore than does the "reasonable efforts" clause of

$ 671(a)(15).

Opinion of the Court
or return the child to his home from foster care, appears in
quite a different context. No further statutory guidance is
found as to how "reasonable efforts" are to be measured.
This directive is not the only one which Congress has given
to the States, and it is a directive whose meaning will obviously vary with the circumstances of each individual case.
How the State was to comply with this directive, and with
the other provisions of the Act, was, within broad limits, left
up to the State.

Other sections of the Act provide enforcement mechanisms
for the "reasonable efforts" clause of 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(15).
The Secretary has the authority to reduce or eliminate payments to a State on finding that the State's plan no longer
complies with $ 671(a) or that "there is a substantial failure"
in the administration of a plan such that the State is not
complying with its own plan. $ 671(b). The Act also requires that in order to secure federal reimbursement for foster care payments made with respect to a child involuntarily
removed from his home the removal must be "the result of
a judicial determination to the effect that continuation [in
the child's home] would be contrary to the welfare of such
child and (effective October 1, 1983) that reasonable efforts
of the type described in section 671(a)(15) of this title have
been made." $ 672(a)(1). While these statutory provisions
may not provide a comprehensive enforcement mechanism so
as to manifest Congress' intent to foreclose remedies under

$ 1983,11 they do show that the absence of a remedy to pri11 We have found an intent by Congress to foreclose remedies under

$ 1983 where the statute itself provides a comprehensive remedial scheme
which leaves no room for additional private remedies under $ 1983. Smith
v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority
v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1 (1981). We need not consider this question today due to our conclusion that the Adoption Act does
not create the federally enforceable right asserted by respondents.

vate plaintiffs under $ 1983 does not make the "reasonableefforts" clause a dead letter.

The regulations promulgated by the Secretary to enforcethe Adoption Act do not evidence a view that $ 671(a) places

any requirement for state receipt of federal funds other thanthe requirement that the State submit a plan to be approved
by the Secretary.13 The regulations provide that to meetthe requirements of $ 671(a)(15) the case plan for each child
must "include a description of the services offered and theservices provided to prevent removal of the child from the
home and to reunify the family." 45 CFR $ 1356.21(d)(4)(1991). Another regulation, entitled "requirements and submittal," provides that a state plan must specify "which pre-placement preventive and reunification services are available
to children and families in need." $ 1357.15(e)(1).14 What is

12 The language of other sections of the Act also shows that Congress
knew how to impose precise requirements on the States aside from the
submission of a plan to be approved by the Secretary when it intended to.
For example, 42 U. S. C. $ 672(e) provides that "[n]o Federal payment may
be made under this part" for a child voluntarily placed in foster care for
more than 180 days unless within that period there is a judicial determination that the placement is in the best interest of the child. That the "reasonable efforts" clause is not similarly worded buttresses a conclusion that
Congress had a different intent with respect to it.

13 Cf. Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479

U. S. 418, 430-432 (1987) (statute providing that tenants in low-income
housing could only be charged 30% of their income as rent, in conjunction
with regulations providing that "reasonable utilities" costs were included
in the rental figure, created right under $ 1983 to not be charged more
than a "reasonable" amount for utilities).

14 The regulation, 45 CFR $ 1357.15(e)(2) (1991), goes on to provide a list

of which services may be included in the State's proposal:
"Twenty-four hour emergency caretaker, and homemaker services; day
care; crisis counseling; individual and family counseling; emergency shelters; procedures and arrangements for access to available emergency financial assistance; arrangements for the provision of temporary child care
to provide respite to the family for a brief period, as part of a plan for
preventing children's removal from home; other services which the agency

Opinion of the Court
significant is that the regulations are not specific and do notprovide notice to the States that failure to do anything other

than submit a plan with the requisite features, to be ap-proved by the Secretary, is a further condition on the receipt
of funds from the Federal Government. Respondents contend that "[n]either [petitioners] nor amici supporting them
present any legislative history to refute the evidence that
Congress intended 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(15) to be enforceable."

ices, self-help groups, services to unmarried parents, provision of, or
arrangements for, mental health, drug and alcohol abuse counseling,
vocational counseling or vocational rehabilitation; and post adoption
services."

15 The Report of the Senate Committee on Finance describes how under

the system before the Adoption Act States only received reimbursement
for payments made with respect to children who were removed from their
homes, and how the Act contains a number of provisions in order to "deemphasize the use of foster care," including reimbursing States for developing and administering adoption assistance programs and programs for
"tracking" children in foster care, placing a cap on the amount of federal
reimbursements a State may receive for foster care maintenance payments, and "specifically permitting expenditures for State . . . services to
reunite families." S. Rep. No. 96-336, p. 12 (1979). This Senate Report
shows that Congress had confidence in the ability and competency of state
courts to discharge their duties under what is now $ 672(a) of the Act. Id.,
at 16 ("The committee is aware of allegations that the judicial determination requirement can become a mere pro forma exercise in paper shuffling
to obtain Federal funding. While this could occur in some instances, the
committee is unwilling to accept as a general proposition that the judiciaries of the States would so lightly treat a responsibility placed upon them
by Federal statute for the protection of children").

The House Ways and Means Committee Report on the Adoption Act
similarly recognizes that "the entire array of possible preventive services
are not appropriate in all situations. The decision as to the appropriate503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:13 PAGES OPINPGT

363Cite as: 503 U. S. 347 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Careful examination of the language relied upon by
respondents, in the context of the entire Act, leads us to
conclude that the "reasonable efforts" language does not
unambiguously confer an enforceable right upon the Act's
beneficiaries. The term "reasonable efforts" in this context
is at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather generalized duty on the State, to be enforced not by private individuals, but by the Secretary in the manner previously
discussed.

Having concluded that $ 671(a)(15) does not create a federally enforceable right to "reasonable efforts" under $ 1983,
the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the Adoption Act
contains an implied right of action for private enforcement,
917 F. 2d, at 989, may be disposed of quickly. Under the
familiar test of Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66 (1975), the burden
is on respondents to demonstrate that Congress intended to
make a private remedy available to enforce the "reasonable

ness of specific services in specific situations will have to be made by the
administering agency having immediate responsibility for the care of the
child." H. R. Rep. No. 96-136, p. 47 (1979).

Remarks on the floor of both the House and the Senate further support
these general intentions. See, e. g., 125 Cong. Rec. 22113 (1979) (remarks
of Rep. Brodhead) ("What the bill attempts to do is to get the States to
enact a series of reforms of their foster care laws, because in the past
there has been too much of a tendency to use the foster care program.
The reason there has been that tendency is because . . . it becomes a little
more expensive for the State to use the protective services than foster
care. Through this bill, we want to free up a little bit of money . . . so you
will have an incentive to keep a family together"); id., at 29939 (remarks of
Sen. Cranston, sponsor of the Adoption Act) ("This requirement in the
State plan under [$ 671(a)(15)] would be reinforced by the new requirement
under [$ 672] that each State with a plan approved . . . may make foster
care maintenance payments only for a child who has been removed from
a home as a result of an explicit judicial determination that reasonable
efforts to prevent the removal have been made, in addition to the judicial
determination required by existing law that continuation in the home
would be contrary to the welfare of the child").

efforts" clause of the Adoption Act.16 The most importantinquiry here as well is whether Congress intended to create

the private remedy sought by the plaintiffs. Transamerica
Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15-16 (1979)
("[W]hat must ultimately be determined is whether Congress intended to create the private remedy asserted"). Asdiscussed above, we think that Congress did not intend to

create a private remedy for enforcement of the "reasonableefforts" clause.

We conclude that 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(15) neither confers anenforceable private right on its beneficiaries nor creates an
implied cause of action on their behalf.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore

Reversed.
Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980(Adoption Act or Act) conditions federal funding for state
child welfare, foster care, and adoption programs upon, inter
alia, the State's express commitment to make, "in each case,
reasonable efforts" to prevent the need for removing children from their homes and "reasonable efforts," where
removal has occurred, to reunify the family. 42 U. S. C.

was enacted, that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the
plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or
implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply
such a remedy for the plaintiff? And finally, is the cause of action one
traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the
States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based
solely on federal law?" Id., at 78 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original).

dren in this case may not enforce the State's commitmentin federal court either under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 or under the

Act itself.In my view, the Court's conclusion is plainly inconsistent
with this Court's decision just two Terms ago in Wilder v.
Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498 (1990), in which wefound enforceable under $ 1983 a functionally identical provision of the Medicaid Act requiring "reasonable" reimburse-ments to health-care providers. More troubling still, the
Court reaches its conclusion without even stating, much lessapplying, the principles our precedents have used to determine whether a statute has created a right enforceable under$ 1983. I cannot acquiesce in this unexplained disregard for
established law. Accordingly, I dissent.

I
A

Section 1983 provides a cause of action for the "depriva-tion of any rights, privileges, or immunities, secured by the

Constitution and laws" of the United States. We recognizedin

Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980), that $ 1983 providesa cause of action for violations of federal statutes, not just

the Constitution. Since Thiboutot, we have recognized twogeneral exceptions to this rule. First, no cause of action
will lie where the statute in question does not " `create en-forceable rights, privileges, or immunities within the meaning of $ 1983.' " Wilder, 496 U. S., at 508 (quoting Wright v.
Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S.418, 423 (1987)). Second, $ 1983 is unavailable where "Congress has foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in theenactment itself." 496 U. S., at 508.

In determining the scope of the first exception--whethera federal statute creates an "enforceable right"--the Court
has developed and repeatedly applied a three-part test. Wehave asked (1) whether the statutory provision at issue
" `was intend[ed] to benefit the putative plaintiff.' " Id., at

503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:13 PAGES OPINPGT
366 SUTER v. ARTIST M.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
509 (quoting Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493
U. S. 103, 106 (1989)). If so, then the provision creates an
enforceable right unless (2) the provision "reflects merely a
`congressional preference' for a certain kind of conduct
rather than a binding obligation on the governmental unit,"
496 U. S., at 509 (quoting Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 19 (1981)), or unless (3) the
plaintiff 's interest is so " `vague and amorphous' " as to be
" `beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.' " 496
U. S., at 509 (quoting Golden State, 493 U. S., at 106, in turn
quoting Wright, 479 U. S., at 431-432). See also Dennis v.
Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 448-449 (1991) (quoting and applying
the three-part test as stated in Golden State). The Court
today has little difficulty concluding that the plaintiff children in this case have no enforceable rights, because it does
not mention--much less apply--this firmly established analytic framework.

B

In Wilder, we held that under the above three-part test,
the Boren Amendment to the Medicaid Act creates an enforceable right. As does the Adoption Act, the Medicaid Act
provides federal funding for state programs that meet certain federal standards and requires participating States to
file a plan with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Most relevant here, the Medicaid Act, like the Adoption Act,
requires that the State undertake a "reasonableness" commitment in its plan. With respect to the rate at which providers are to be reimbursed, the Boren Amendment requires:

"A State plan for medical assistance must--. . . . .

"provide . . . for payment . . . [of services] provided
under the plan through the use of rates (determined in
accordance with methods and standards developed by
the State . . .) which the State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary, are reasonable and

adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred byefficiently and economically operated facilities in order

to provide care and services in conformity with appli-cable State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality
and safety standards and to assure that individuals eli-gible for medical assistance have

reasonable access . . .to inpatient hospital services of adequate quality." 42

U. S. C. $ 1396a(a)(13)(A) (emphasis supplied).
In Wilder, we had no difficulty concluding that the reim-bursement provision of the Boren Amendment "was intend[ed] to benefit" the plaintiff providers of Medicaid serv-ices. 496 U. S., at 509. We also concluded that the second
part of the test was satisfied. The amendment, we held,does not simply express a "congressional preference" for
reasonable and adequate reimbursement rates; rather, itimposes a "binding obligation" on the State to establish
and maintain such rates. Id., at 512. In so concluding,we emphasized two features of the Medicaid reimbursement
scheme. First, we observed that the language of the provi-sion is "cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms,"
stating that the plan "must" provide for reasonable and ade-quate reimbursement. Ibid. Second, we noted that the
text of the statute expressly conditions federal funding onstate compliance with the amendment and requires the Secretary to withhold funds from noncomplying States. Ibid.In light of these features of the Medicaid Act, we rejected
the argument, advanced by the defendant state officials andby the United States as

amicus curiae, that the only enforce-able state obligation is the obligation to file a plan with the

Secretary, to find that its rates are reasonable and adequate,and to make assurances to that effect in the plan.

Id., at512-515. Rather, we concluded, participating States are required actually to provide reasonable and adequate rates, notjust profess to the Secretary that they have done so. Ibid.

Finally, we rejected the State's argument that Medicaidproviders' right to "reasonable and adequate" reimburse503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:13 PAGES OPINPGT
368 SUTER v. ARTIST M.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
ment is "too vague and amorphous" for judicial enforcement.We acknowledged that the State has "substantial discretion"

in choosing among various methods of calculating reimburse-ment rates. Id., at 519; see also id., at 505-508. A State's
discretion in determining how to calculate what rates are"reasonable and adequate," we concluded, "may affect the
standard under which a court reviews" the State's reim-bursement plan, but it does not make the right to reasonable
reimbursement judicially unenforceable. Id., at 519.

C
These principles, as we applied them in Wilder, requirethe conclusion that the Adoption Act's "reasonable efforts"

clause 1 establishes a right enforceable under $ 1983. Eachof the three elements of our three-part test is satisfied.
First, and most obvious, the plaintiff children in this case areclearly the intended beneficiaries of the requirement that the
State make "reasonable efforts" to prevent unnecessary re-moval and to reunify temporarily removed children with
their families.Second, the "reasonable efforts" clause imposes a binding
obligation on the State because it is "cast in mandatoryrather than precatory terms," providing that a participating
State "shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which. . .

shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State,and, if administered by them, be mandatory upon them."

Further, the statute requires the plan to "provid[e] that, ineach case, reasonable efforts

will be made." Moreover, as

1 "In order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part, it
shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which--. . . (3) provides that
the plan shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, and, if
administered by them, be mandatory upon them; [and] . . . (15) . . . provides
that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal
of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to
return to his home." 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a).

in Wilder, the statutory text expressly conditions federalfunding on state compliance with the plan requirement and

requires the Secretary to reduce payments to a State if"in the administration of [the State's] plan there is a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the plan." 42
U. S. C. $ 671(b). Under our holding in Wilder, these provi-sions of the Adoption Act impose a binding obligation on the

State. Indeed, neither the petitioner state officials nor amicus United States dispute this point. Brief for Petitioners
17; Reply Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 2; Brief for United Statesas

Amicus Curiae 13-14.
What petitioners and amicus United States do dispute
is whether the third element of the Golden State-WilderDennis test has been satisfied: They argue that the "reasonable efforts" clause of the Adoption Act is too "vague and
amorphous" to be judicially enforced. Aware that Wilder
enforced an apparently similar "reasonableness" clause, they
argue that this clause is categorically different.

According to petitioners, the Court would not have found
the Boren Amendment's reasonableness clause enforceable
had the statute not provided an "objective benchmark"
against which "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement
rates could be measured. Reasonable and adequate rates,
the Boren Amendment provides, are those that meet the
costs that would be incurred by "an `efficiently and economically operated facilit[y]' providing care in compliance with
federal and state standards while at the same time ensuring
`reasonable access' to eligible participants." Wilder, 496
U. S., at 519 (quoting 42 U. S. C. $ 1396a(a)(13)(A)). Petitioners claim that, given this benchmark, "reasonable and adequate" rates can be ascertained by "monetary calculations
easily determined based on prevailing rates in the market."
Brief for Petitioners 21. By contrast, they observe, there is
"no market for `reasonable efforts' to keep or return a child
home, and such `reasonable efforts' cannot be calculated or
quantified." Ibid.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Petitioners misunderstand the sense in which the "bench-mark" in

Wilder is "objective." The Boren Amendment
does not simply define "reasonable and adequate" rates asmarket rates. Rather, it defines a "reasonable and adequate" rate by referring to what would be provided by a
hypothetical facility--one that operates "efficiently and eco-nomically," "compli[es] with federal and state standards,"

and "ensur[es] `reasonable access' to eligible participants."Whether particular existing facilities meet those criteria is
not a purely empirical judgment that requires only simple"monetary calculations." Indeed, the Boren Amendment's
specification of the words "reasonable and adequate" ultimately refers us to a second reasonableness clause: The
"benchmark" facility, we are told, is one that "ensure[s] `reasonable access' to eligible participants." This second reasonableness clause is left undefined. Contrary to petitioners' suggestions, then, the "reasonable and adequate" rates
provision of the Boren Amendment is not "objective" in the
sense of being mechanically measurable. The fact that this
Court found the provision judicially enforceable demonstrates that an asserted right is not "vague and amorphous"
simply because it cannot be easily "calculated or quantified."

Petitioners also argue that the right to "reasonable efforts" is "vague and amorphous" because of substantial disagreement in the child-welfare community concerning appropriate strategies. Furthermore, they contend, because the
choice of a particular strategy in a particular case necessarily
will depend upon the facts of that case, a court-enforced right
to reasonable efforts either will homogenize very different
situations or else will fragment into a plurality of "rights"
that vary from State to State. For both of these reasons,
petitioners contend, Congress left the question of what efforts are "reasonable" to state juvenile courts, the recognized experts in such matters.

Here again, comparison with Wilder is instructive. The
Court noted the lack of consensus concerning which of vari503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:13 PAGES OPINPGT

371Cite as: 503 U. S. 347 (1992)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
ous possible methods of calculating reimbursable costs would
best promote efficient operation of health-care facilities.
See Wilder, 496 U. S., at 506-507. The Court further noted
that Congress chose a standard that leaves the States considerable autonomy in selecting the methods they will use to
determine which reimbursement rates are "reasonable and
adequate." Id., at 506-508, 515. The result, of course, is
that the "content" of the federal right to reasonable and adequate rates--the method of calculating reimbursement and
the chosen rate--varies from State to State. And although
federal judges are hardly expert either in selecting methods
of Medicaid cost reimbursement or in determining whether
particular rates are "reasonable and adequate," neither the
majority nor the dissent found that the right to reasonable
and adequate reimbursement was so vague and amorphous
as to be "beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce."
See id., at 519-520; id., at 524 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).
State flexibility in determining what is "reasonable," we
held,

"may affect the standard under which a court reviews
whether the rates comply with the amendment, but it
does not render the amendment unenforceable by a
court. While there may be a range of reasonable rates,
there certainly are some rates outside that range that
no State could ever find to be reasonable and adequate
under the Act." Id., at 519-520.

The same principles apply here. There may be a "range"
of "efforts" to prevent unnecessary removals or secure beneficial reunifications that are "reasonable." Ibid. It may

also be that a court, in reviewing a State's strategies of compliance with the "reasonable efforts" clause, would owe substantial deference to the State's choice of strategies. That
does not mean, however, that no State's efforts could ever be
deemed "unreasonable." As in Wilder, the asserted right in

503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:13 PAGES OPINPGT
372 SUTER v. ARTIST M.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
this case is simply not inherently "beyond the competence ofthe judiciary to enforce." Ibid.

Petitioners' argument that the "reasonable efforts" clauseof the Adoption Act is so vague and amorphous as to be unenforceable assumes that in Wright and Wilder the Court wasworking at the outer limits of what is judicially cognizable:
Any deviation from Wright or Wilder, petitioners imply,would go beyond the bounds of judicial competence. There
is absolutely nothing to indicate that this is so. See Wilder,496 U. S., at 520 (inquiry into reasonableness of reimbursement rates is "well within the competence of the Judiciary")(emphasis supplied). Federal courts, in innumerable cases,
have routinely enforced reasonableness clauses in federalstatutes. See, e. g., Virginian R. Co. v. Railway Employees,
300 U. S. 515, 518, 550 (1937) (enforcing "every reasonableeffort" provision of the Railway Labor Act and noting that
"whether action taken or omitted is . . . reasonable [is an]everyday subjec[t] of inquiry by courts in framing and enforcing their decrees"). Petitioners have not shown that theAdoption Act's reasonableness clause is exceptional in this
respect. II

The Court does not explain why the settled three-part testfor determining the enforceability of an asserted right is not
applied in this case. Moreover, the reasons the Court doesoffer to support its conclusion--that the Adoption Act's "reasonable efforts" clause creates no enforceable right--wereraised and rejected in

Wilder.The Court acknowledges that the Adoption Act is "mandatory in its terms." Ante, at 358. It adopts, however, a nar-row understanding of what is "mandatory." It reasons that
the language of $ 671(a), which provides that "[i]n order fora State to be eligible for payments under this part, it shall
have a plan approved by the Secretary," requires participat-ing States only to submit and receive approval for a plan that
contains the features listed in $$ 671(a)(1) to (16). According

373Cite as: 503 U. S. 347 (1992)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
to the Court, the beneficiaries of the Act enjoy at most aprocedural right under $ 671(a)--the right to require a participating State to prepare and file a plan--not a substantiveright to require the State to live up to the commitments
stated in that plan, such as the commitment to make "reason-able efforts" to prevent unnecessary removals and secure
beneficial reunifications of families. Since the State of Illi-nois has filed a plan that the Secretary has approved, the
Court reasons, the State has violated no right enforceable infederal court.

The Court's reasoning should sound familiar: The state of-ficials in

Wilder made exactly the same argument, and thisCourt rejected it. In

Wilder, we noted that the MedicaidAct expressly conditions federal funding on state compliance

with the provisions of an approved plan, and that the Secre-tary is required to withhold payments from noncomplying
States. See 496 U. S., at 512 (citing 42 U. S. C. $ 1396c).2 Insubstantially identical language, the Adoption Act, too, requires States to live up to the commitments stated in theirplans.

3 To be sure, the Court's reasoning is consistent with

the dissent in Wilder. See 496 U. S., at 524, 527-528 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). But it flatly contradicts what theCourt

held in that case.The Court attempts to fend off this conclusion in two ways,

neither of them persuasive. First, the Court seeks to distin-guish

Wilder, asserting that our conclusion--that the BorenAmendment gave the health-care providers a substantive

right to reasonable and adequate reimbursement--"relied in

2 "If the Secretary . . . finds . . . that in the administration of the plan
there is a failure to comply substantially with any . . . provision [required
to be included in the plan,] the Secretary shall notify [the] State agency
that further payments will not be made . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 1396c.

3 "[I]n any case in which the Secretary finds . . . there is a substantial

failure to comply with the provisions of [an approved] plan, the Secretary
shall notify the State that further payments will not be made . . . , or that
such payments will be made to the State but reduced by an amount which
the Secretary determines appropriate . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 671(b).

Blackmun, J., dissenting
part on the fact that the statute and regulations set forth insome detail the factors to be considered in determining the

methods for calculating rates." Ante, at 359 (citing Wilder,496 U. S., at 519, n. 17). By contrast, the Court continues,
neither the provisions of the Adoption Act nor the imple-menting regulations offer any guidance as to how the term
"reasonable efforts" should be interpreted.Even assuming that it is accurate to call the statute and
regulations involved in that case "detailed," 4 the Court hasmisread

Wilder. The Court there referred to the relativespecificity of the statute and regulations not to demonstrate

that the health-care providers enjoyed a substantive right toreasonable and adequate rates--we had already concluded
that the State was under a binding obligation to adopt suchrates, see

Wilder, 496 U. S., at 514-515--but only to reinforceour conclusion that the providers' interest was not so "vague

and amorphous" as to be "beyond the competence of judi-cial enforcement." See 496 U. S., at 519, n. 17. Under our
three-part test, the Court would not have inquired whetherthat interest was "vague and amorphous" unless it had already concluded that the State was required to do more thansimply file a paper plan that lists the appropriate factors.

4 Petitioners suggest a sharp contrast between the implementing regulations considered in Wilder and the implementing regulation for the Adoption Act "reasonable efforts" provision: The former, they say, require the
State to consider certain factors, but the latter merely provides "a laundry
list of services the States `may' provide." Brief for Petitioners 34 (citing
45 CFR $ 1357.15(e) (1991)). Further, petitioners emphasize the Department of Health and Human Services' remark during rulemaking that
States must retain flexibility in administering the Adoption Act's "reasonable efforts" requirement. Brief for Petitioners 34-35.

Neither of these factors marks a significant difference between Wilder
and the present case. The difference between requiring States to consider certain factors, as in Wilder, and permitting States to provide certain listed services, as in the present case, is hardly dramatic. As for the
second asserted difference, Wilder itself emphasized that States must retain substantial discretion in calculating "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement rates.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Second, the Court emphasizes: "Other sections of the[Adoption] Act provide enforcement mechanisms for the reasonable efforts clause of 42 U. S. C. $ 671(a)(15)." Ante, at360. Such "mechanisms" include the Secretary's power to
cut off or reduce funds for noncompliance with the state plan,
and the requirement of a state judicial finding that "reason-able efforts" have been made before federal funds may be

used to reimburse foster care payments for a child involun-tarily removed.

The Court has apparently forgotten that ever since Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 (1970), the power of the Secretary to enforce congressional spending conditions by cutting
off funds has not prevented the federal courts from enforcing
those same conditions. See id., at 420, 422-423. Indeed,
we reasoned in Wilder that a similar "cutoff " provision supports the conclusion that the Medicaid Act creates an enforceable right, because it puts the State "on notice" that it
may not simply adopt the reimbursement rates of its choosing. See 496 U. S., at 514. As for the Court's contention
that $ 671(a)(15) should be enforced through individual removal determinations in state juvenile court, the availability of a state judicial forum can hardly deprive a $ 1983 plaintiff of a federal forum. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183
(1961). The Court's reliance on enforcement mechanisms
other than $ 1983, therefore, does not support its conclusion
that the "reasonable efforts" clause of the Adoption Act creates no enforceable right.

The Court, without acknowledgment, has departed from
our precedents in yet another way. In our prior cases, the
existence of other enforcement mechanisms has been relevant not to the question whether the statute at issue creates
an enforceable right, but to whether the second exception to

$ 1983 enforcement applies--whether, that is, " `Congress has
foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment
itself.' " Wilder, 496 U. S., at 508 (quoting Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S., at

503us2$51F 11-16-95 13:20:13 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
423). In determining whether this second exception to

$ 1983 enforcement applies, we have required the defendant
not merely to point to the existence of alternative means of
enforcement, but to demonstrate "by express provision or
other specific evidence from the statute itself that Congress
intended to foreclose [$ 1983] enforcement." 496 U. S., at
520-521. We have said repeatedly that we will not "lightly"
conclude that Congress has so intended. Id., at 520 (quoting
Wright, 479 U. S., at 423-424, in turn quoting Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, 1012 (1984)). In only two instances,
where we concluded that "the statute itself provides a comprehensive remedial scheme which leaves no room for additional private remedies under $ 1983," ante, at 360, n. 11,
have we held that Congress has intended to foreclose $ 1983
enforcement. See Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984)
("carefully tailored" mixed system of enforcement beginning
with local administrative review and culminating in a right
to judicial review); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority
v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1 (1981) (enforcement scheme authorizing Environmental Protection Agency
to bring civil suits, providing for criminal penalties, and including two citizen-suit provisions).

The Court does not find these demanding criteria satisfied
here. See ante, at 360-361, and n. 11. Instead, it simply
circumvents them altogether: The Court holds that even if
the funding cutoff provision in the Adoption Act is not an
"express provision" that "provides a comprehensive remedial
scheme" leaving "no room for additional private remedies
under $ 1983," Wilder, 496 U. S., at 520, that provision nevertheless precludes $ 1983 enforcement. In so holding, the
Court has inverted the established presumption that a private remedy is available under $ 1983 unless "Congress has
affirmatively withdrawn the remedy." 496 U. S., at 509, n. 9
(citing Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S.,
at 106-107, and Wright, 479 U. S., at 423-424).

III
In sum, the Court has failed, without explanation, to applythe framework our precedents have consistently deemed applicable; it has sought to support its conclusion by resurrect-ing arguments decisively rejected less than two years ago
in Wilder; and it has contravened 22 years of precedent bysuggesting that the existence of other "enforcement mechanisms" precludes $ 1983 enforcement. At least for this case,it has changed the rules of the game without offering even
minimal justification, and it has failed even to acknowledgethat it is doing anything more extraordinary than "interpret[ing]" the Adoption Act "by its own terms." Ante, at 358,n. 8. Readers of the Court's opinion will not be misled by
this hollow assurance. And, after all, we are dealing herewith children. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.5 I dissent.

5 Since I conclude that respondents have a cause of action under $ 1983,
I need not reach the question, decided in the affirmative by the Court of
Appeals, whether petitioners may pursue a private action arising directly
under the Adoption Act.

UNITED STATES v. FELIX
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 90-1599. Argued January 14, 1992--Decided March 25, 1992
During the summer of 1987, respondent Felix manufactured methamphetamine at an Oklahoma facility. After Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents shut down that facility, Felix ordered additional
chemicals and equipment from a DEA informant for delivery in Missouri. Federal Government officials observed the delivery, arrested
him, and charged him with the offense of attempting to manufacture an
illegal drug. At his trial in Missouri, the Government, in order to establish Felix's criminal intent, introduced evidence that he had manufactured methamphetamine in Oklahoma, and he was convicted. Subsequently, he was named in, inter alia, six counts of an indictment filed
in a Federal District Court in Oklahoma. Count 1 charged him with
conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and distribute methamphetamine.
Two of the overt acts supporting this charge were based on the same
conduct that had been the subject of the Missouri prosecution. The
other counts charged him with substantive drug offenses, and at trial
the Government introduced much of the same evidence of the Missouri
and Oklahoma transactions that had been introduced at the Missouri
trial. Felix was convicted, but the Court of Appeals reversed, relying
on language in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 521, that the Double
Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution where the government,
"to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." With respect to the conspiracy
count, the court observed that in both trials, the Government proved
that Felix had learned to make, and had manufactured, methamphetamine in Oklahoma and had sought to purchase more chemicals and
equipment in Missouri. The court also noted that the direct evidence
supporting the substantive offenses--that Felix had purchased chemicals and equipment during the spring of 1987 and had manufactured
methamphetamine in Oklahoma--had been introduced at the Missouri
trial to show intent.

Held: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar Felix's prosecution on

either the substantive drug offenses or the conspiracy charge.

(a) None of the substantive offenses for which Felix was prosecuted
in Oklahoma is in any sense the same offense for which he was prosecuted in Missouri. The actual crimes charged in each case were different in both time and place, and no common conduct links them. In
addition, mere overlap in proof between two prosecutions does not establish a double jeopardy violation. Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S.
342. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it assumed
that if the Government offers in evidence in one prosecution acts of
misconduct that might ultimately be charged as criminal offenses in a
second prosecution, the latter prosecution is barred. And it gave an
extravagant reading to Grady, supra, which disclaimed any intention of
adopting a " `same evidence' " test, id., at 521, and n. 12. Pp. 384-387.

(b) A substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are
not the "same offense" for double jeopardy purposes, see, e. g., United
States v. Bayer, 331 U. S. 532; Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U. S. 640,
643, even if they are based on the same underlying incidents, because
the "essence" of a conspiracy offense "is in the agreement or confederation to commit a crime," Bayer, supra, at 542. This established doctrine predates, and was not questioned in, Grady, supra. In addition,
while Grady--which involved a State's reliance on a defendant's two
traffic offense convictions to sustain later-filed homicide and assault
charges arising from the same accident--may be useful in cases arising
from a "single course of conduct," it is much less helpful in analyzing
prosecutions involving multilayered conduct, such as the conspiracy
prosecution here. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in essentially reading Grady as substituting for the "same offence" language of the Double
Jeopardy Clause a test based on whether the two prosecutions involve
the same conduct. Pp. 387-391.

Opinion of the Court
Scott M. Anderson argued the cause and filed a brief forrespondent.*

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment tothe United States Constitution provides: "[N]or shall any
person be subject for the same offence to be twice put injeopardy of life or limb."

During the summer of 1987, respondent Frank DennisFelix operated a facility in Beggs, Oklahoma, at which he
manufactured methamphetamine in violation of applicablefederal statutes. In July, this facility was raided and shut
down by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents.Felix thereupon ordered precursor chemicals and equipment
for the manufacture of methamphetamine to be delivered tohim at Joplin, Missouri. DEA agents observed the transfer
of these items and arrested Felix shortly afterwards. Hewas charged and tried in the Western District of Missouri
for the offense of attempting to manufacture the illegal drugbetween August 26 and August 31, 1987. This charge was
based upon the delivery of the materials to him at Joplin.He was tried, found guilty, and his conviction and sentence
were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit.

In February 1989, Felix was charged in the Eastern Dis-trict of Oklahoma with both conspiracy and substantive
counts in connection with the operation of the facility atBeggs. He was tried and convicted, but the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed most of the counts onwhich he had been found guilty because of its view that trial
on these counts constituted double jeopardy in violation ofthe Fifth Amendment. We hold that prosecution of a defendant for conspiracy, where certain of the overt acts relied

Opinion of the Court
upon by the Government are based on substantive offensesfor which the defendant has been previously convicted, does

not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.

I
At Felix's trial for attempting to manufacture metham-phetamine in Missouri, the Government showed that on August 26, 1987, Felix asked to purchase chemicals and equip-ment needed for the manufacture of methamphetamine from
George Dwinnells, a DEA informant. Felix made a downpayment of $7,500 toward the purchase, and in later telephone conversations instructed Dwinnells to deliver theitems to a Joplin, Missouri, hotel on August 31, 1987. Dwinnells met Felix at the hotel on that date with the merchan-dise. After Felix inspected the items and hitched his car to
the trailer in which the items had been transported, Govern-ment officials arrested him.

Felix's defense in the Missouri case was that "he never hadcriminal intent, but had been acting under the mistaken
belief that he was working in a covert DEA operation."
United States v. Felix, 867 F. 2d 1068, 1074 (CA8 1989). Inorder to establish Felix's criminal intent with respect to the

items delivered in Missouri, the Government introduced evi-dence that Felix had manufactured methamphetamine in
Oklahoma earlier in 1987. See Fed. Rule Evid. 404(b) (Evi-dence of prior acts is admissible to show "motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or ab-sence of mistake or accident"). The evidence showed that
during the spring of 1987, Felix had purchased precursor ma-terials from Dwinnells and had furnished those items to Paul
Roach in exchange for lessons on how to manufacture meth-amphetamine. Roach, who testified for the Government at
Felix's Missouri trial, stated that he and Felix had producedmethamphetamine in a trailer near Beggs, Oklahoma. Government agents had seized the trailer, which was indeedbeing used as a methamphetamine lab, on July 13, 1987.

382 UNITED STATES v. FELIX

Opinion of the Court
The agents did not arrest Felix at that time, however; helater told Dwinnells that he had avoided arrest by hiding

in the nearby woods. In accordance with Rule 404(b), theDistrict Court instructed the jury that the evidence of the
Oklahoma transactions was admissible only to show Felix's
state of mind with respect to the chemicals and equipmenthe attempted to purchase in Missouri. The jury convicted

Felix, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 867 F. 2d, at 1070-1076.

The Government subsequently named Felix in 8 counts ofan 11-count indictment filed in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. Count 1
charged that Felix and five others conspired, between May
1, 1987, and August 31, 1987, to manufacture, possess, and
distribute methamphetamine. Felix was named in nine of
the overt acts supporting the conspiracy charge; two of those
nine overt acts were based on conduct that had been the
subject of the earlier Missouri prosecution. Overt act 17
charged that "[o]n August 26, 1987, Frank Dennis Felix,
while in Tulsa, Oklahoma, provided money for the purchase
of chemicals and equipment necessary in the manufacture of
methamphetamine." Overt act 18 charged that "[o]n August 31, 1987, Frank Dennis Felix, while at a location in Missouri, possessed chemicals and equipment necessary in the
manufacture of methamphetamine." Along with the conspiracy charge, Felix was named in seven substantive counts.
Counts 2 through 5 alleged that on or about July 13, 1987, in
the Eastern District of Oklahoma, Felix had manufactured
methamphetamine, possessed methamphetamine with intent
to distribute it, possessed methamphetamine oil with intent
to manufacture methamphetamine, and manufactured phenylacetone, a methamphetamine precursor. Count 6 charged
that, between June 1, 1987, and July 13, 1987, in the Eastern
District of Oklahoma, Felix and a codefendant had maintained a methamphetamine manufacturing lab. Counts 9
and 10 charged that, on or about June 21, 1987, and July 13,

Opinion of the Court
1987, Felix had traveled from Texas to the Eastern Districtof Oklahoma with the intent to promote the manufacture of

methamphetamine and had thereafter attempted to promotethat activity. At trial, the Government introduced much of
the same evidence of the Missouri and Oklahoma transactions that had been introduced in the Missouri trial. Thejury convicted Felix of all the crimes with which he was

charged.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed Felix's convictions on counts 1 through 6 ofthe Oklahoma indictment. The court began by quoting our
statement in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), that the
Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution
where the government, " `to establish an essential element
of an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct
that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.' " 926 F. 2d 1522, 1527 (1991) (quoting Grady v. Corbin, supra, at 521). With respect to count
1, the conspiracy charge, the court observed that in both the
Missouri and Oklahoma trials, the Government proved that
Felix had learned to make methamphetamine in Oklahoma,
had thereafter manufactured the drug at the lab near Beggs,
Oklahoma, and had sought to purchase more chemicals and
equipment in Missouri after the raid on the Oklahoma lab.
Based on the significant duplication of conduct proved in
each trial, the court concluded that the Oklahoma conspiracy count was barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause
because it charged "the same conduct for which he was previously convicted in Missouri." 926 F. 2d, at 1530. With
respect to the substantive offenses charged in counts 2
through 6, the court noted that the direct evidence supporting these charges--the fact that Felix had purchased
chemicals and equipment during the spring of 1987, and had
subsequently manufactured methamphetamine at the Beggs,
Oklahoma, trailer--had been introduced at the previous Missouri trial to show intent. The court concluded that this

duplication "subjected Felix to a successive trial for thesame conduct," and therefore reversed Felix's convictions on

counts 2 through 6. Id., at 1530-1531.1We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 806 (1991), to consider
whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the prosecutionof Felix for these crimes.

so reverse. II

We first consider whether the Double Jeopardy Clausebars Felix's prosecution on the substantive drug offenses
contained in counts 2 through 6 of the Oklahoma indictment.The Court of Appeals held that the Government was fore1 The Court of Appeals affirmed Felix's convictions on counts 9 and 10
of the indictment, which charged unlawful interstate travel. The court
concluded that the conduct alleged in those counts was not sufficiently
related to the conduct proved in the earlier Missouri trial to require their
dismissal under the Double Jeopardy Clause. 926 F. 2d, at 1531.

2 The Courts of Appeals have differed in applying Grady to successive

prosecutions for offenses arising out of a continuing course of conduct,
such as the conspiracy prosecution in this case. In United States v. Calderone, 917 F. 2d 717 (1990), the Second Circuit held that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred a conspiracy prosecution where the defendant had
been previously prosecuted for a "broader" conspiracy that entirely encompassed the actions alleged in the second, "narrower" conspiracy. The
court based its decision on our language in Grady, concluding that the
"conduct" at issue in a conspiracy prosecution is not the agreement itself,
but the conduct from which the Government asks the jury to infer an
agreement. See id., at 721-722. The Second Circuit later followed that
reasoning in holding that a conspiracy prosecution is barred if certain
overt acts supporting the conspiracy charge involve substantive offenses
for which the defendant has been previously prosecuted. United States
v. Gambino, 920 F. 2d 1108 (1990). The Tenth Circuit agreed with that
position in upholding Felix's double jeopardy claim below. 926 F. 2d
1522 (1991).

On the other hand, two Courts of Appeals have concluded that the Government is not barred from bringing a successive conspiracy prosecution,
even where it seeks to base the conspiracy offense on previously prosecuted conduct. United States v. Rivera-Feliciano, 930 F. 2d 951 (CA1
1991); United States v. Clark, 928 F. 2d 639 (CA4 1991).

Opinion of the Court
closed from prosecuting these charges, because it had pre-sented evidence of the Oklahoma drug operation at the prior

trial in order to help demonstrate Felix's criminal intent withrespect to the Missouri transaction.

At its root, the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the duplicative prosecution of a defendant for the "same offence."U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; see

Blockburger v. United States, 284
U. S. 299 (1932). An examination of the indictments belowshows that Felix was charged in the Missouri case only with

attempting to manufacture methamphetamine in Missouri, inlate August 1987. App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a-63a. In the
five substantive drug counts of the Oklahoma indictment that
are at issue here, Felix was charged with various drug offenses that took place in Oklahoma, in June and July 1987.
Id., at 55a-57a. The crimes charged in the Oklahoma indictment were related to the operation of the methamphetamine
lab near Beggs, Oklahoma, in the summer of 1987, while the
crime charged in the Missouri indictment dealt solely with
Felix's attempt to purchase chemicals and equipment from
Dwinnells in order to continue methamphetamine operations
after the Beggs lab was raided. The actual crimes charged
in each case were different in both time and place; there was
absolutely no common conduct linking the alleged offenses.
In short, none of the offenses for which Felix was prosecuted in the Oklahoma indictment is in any sense the "same
offence" as the offence for which he was prosecuted in
Missouri.

The Court of Appeals appears to have acknowledged as
much, as it concentrated not on the actual crimes prosecuted
in the separate trials, but instead on the type of evidence
presented by the Government during the two trials. The
court found it decisive that the Government had introduced
evidence of Felix's involvement in the Oklahoma lab to help
show criminal intent for purposes of the Missouri trial. But
it is clear that, no matter how much evidence of the Oklahoma transactions was introduced by the Government to

386 UNITED STATES v. FELIX

Opinion of the Court
help show Felix's state of mind, he was not prosecuted in theMissouri trial for any offense other than the Missouri attempt offense with which he was charged. Thus, the Courtof Appeals holding must rest on an assumption that if the
Government offers in evidence in one prosecution acts of
misconduct that might ultimately be charged as criminal of-fenses in a second prosecution, the latter prosecution is

barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause.But such an assumption is not supportable; our precedents
hold that a mere overlap in proof between two prosecutionsdoes not establish a double jeopardy violation. The Court
of Appeals relied on the above-quoted language from our
opinion in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S., at 521, in reaching its
result. But we think that this is an extravagant reading of
Grady, which disclaimed any intention of adopting a " `same
evidence' " test. Id., at 521, and n. 12; accord, Gavieres v.
United States, 220 U. S. 338 (1911). Our decision two Terms
ago in Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342 (1990), drives
home this point.

In that case, Dowling was charged with bank robbery. To
help prove his identity at trial, the Government introduced
evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) concerning
the unrelated robbery of a woman named Vena Henry. She
testified that she had been robbed by a man wearing a knitted mask similar to the one used by the bank robber, and
that she had been able to identify the intruder as Dowling
after unmasking him during a struggle. We upheld the introduction of Henry's testimony at the bank robbery trial,
despite the fact that Dowling had previously been acquitted
of the Henry charges. The primary ruling of that case was
our conclusion that the collateral-estoppel component of the
Double Jeopardy Clause offered Dowling no protection despite his earlier acquittal, because the relevance of evidence
offered under Rule 404(b) was governed by a lower standard
of proof than that required for a conviction. See 493 U. S.,
at 348-349 (citing Huddleston v. United States, 485 U. S. 681,

503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
689 (1988)). But it is clear that we would not have had toreach the collateral-estoppel question if the mere introduction, pursuant to Rule 404(b), of evidence concerning theHenry robbery constituted a second prosecution of that
crime for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Under-lying our approval of the Henry evidence in

Dowling is anendorsement of the basic, yet important, principle that the

introduction of relevant evidence of particular misconduct ina case is not the same thing as prosecution for that conduct.

3

That principle is clearly applicable here. At the Missouritrial, the Government did not in any way prosecute Felix

for the Oklahoma methamphetamine transactions; it simplyintroduced those transactions as prior acts evidence under
Rule 404(b). The Government was therefore free to prose-cute Felix in the trial below for the substantive drug crimes
detailed in counts 2 through 6.

III
We next examine whether the Court of Appeals erred inholding that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the prosecution of Felix for the conspiracy charge contained in count 1of the indictment. Here, too, that court--with considerable

3 There is an obvious distinction between Dowling and this case, but one
that makes no difference for purposes of our analysis here. In Dowling,
the defendant was first prosecuted for the Henry robbery, and evidence
concerning that robbery was subsequently admitted for Rule 404(b) purposes at a second prosecution. In this case, evidence of the Oklahoma
drug transactions was first admitted for Rule 404(b) purposes at the Missouri trial, and Felix was subsequently prosecuted for the Oklahoma drug
transactions. The first situation might raise collateral-estoppel concerns
as a result of an initial acquittal, concerns we confronted in Dowling, while
the latter situation would not. But both situations would be equally affected by a rule that the admission of evidence concerning a crime under
Rule 404(b) constitutes prosecution for that crime; under such a rule, the
Double Jeopardy Clause would have barred the subsequent admission of
the Henry evidence in Dowling, and it would bar the subsequent prosecution of the Oklahoma drug crimes in this case. We decline to adopt such
a rule.

388 UNITED STATES v. FELIX

Opinion of the Court
justification--relied upon language from our Grady opinionto support its conclusion. There is no doubt that the conspiracy charge presents a more difficult question than thesubstantive drug offenses dealt with in Part II above, because with respect to it there exists more than a mere overlap in evidence. Of the nine overt acts supporting the con-spiracy charge against Felix, two were based on the conduct

for which he had been previously prosecuted in Missouri.But we hold that because of long established precedent in
this area, which was not questioned in Grady, Felix's claimof double jeopardy fails.

Felix contends, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that language from Grady bars the conspiracy prosecution. There
we said that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a prosecution
where the Government, "to establish an essential element of
an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct
that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." 495 U. S., at 521. Taken out of
context, and read literally, this language supports the defense of double jeopardy. But we decline to read the language so expansively, because of the context in which Grady
arose and because of difficulties which have already arisen
in its interpretation.

Grady involved a defendant who had driven his car across
the median line of a two-way highway and struck an oncoming car, killing one of the occupants. The State charged the
defendant with driving while intoxicated and with failing to
keep right of the median, and the defendant pleaded guilty
to those two traffic violations. Two months later, the State
prosecuted the defendant on homicide and assault charges
arising from the accident, and the defendant argued that this
was a violation of his rights under the Double Jeopardy
Clause. In our decision, we recognized our previous holdings that the traditional Blockburger test governing double
jeopardy claims bars a subsequent prosecution if one of the
two offenses is a lesser included offense of the other. See

Opinion of the Court
Grady v. Corbin, supra, at 519 (citing Brown v. Ohio, 432U. S. 161 (1977);

Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977)).
Although the traffic offenses involved in Grady were nottechnically lesser included offenses of the homicide and assault charges, we analogized the case to the situation we
had previously confronted in Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410(1980). There, the State sought to prosecute the defendant

for involuntary manslaughter after a car accident. Westated, in dicta, that if the State found it necessary to rely
on a previous failure to reduce speed conviction to sustainthe manslaughter charge, the Double Jeopardy Clause might
protect the defendant. See id., at 420. Despite the fact
that neither offense was technically a lesser included offense
of the other, we observed that, in such a circumstance, the
failure to slow offense might be viewed as a "species of
lesser-included offense." Ibid. In Grady, the State sought
to rely on the two previous traffic offense convictions to
sustain the homicide and assault charges, presenting the
situation about which we had speculated in Vitale. In concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the subsequent homicide and assault prosecutions, we simply adopted
the suggestion we had previously made in dicta in Vitale.
Grady v. Corbin, supra, at 521.

But long antedating any of these cases, and not questioned
in any of them, is the rule that a substantive crime and a
conspiracy to commit that crime are not the "same offence"
for double jeopardy purposes.

For example, in United States v. Bayer, 331 U. S. 532
(1947), a military officer had been convicted in court-martial
proceedings of discrediting the military service by accepting
payments in return for transferring soldiers to noncombat
units. We held that his subsequent prosecution in federal
court on charges of conspiring to defraud the Government of
his faithful services was not barred by the Double Jeopardy
Clause, despite the fact that it was based on the same underlying incidents, because the "essence" of a conspiracy offense

503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT
390 UNITED STATES v. FELIX

Opinion of the Court
"is in the agreement or confederation to commit a crime."
Id., at 542. In language applicable here, we pointedly stated
that "the same overt acts charged in a conspiracy count mayalso be charged and proved as substantive offenses, for the

agreement to do the act is distinct from the act itself."
Ibid.; see also Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U. S. 640, 643(1946) ("[T]he commission of the substantive offense and a

conspiracy to commit it are separate and distinct offenses . . .[a]nd the plea of double jeopardy is no defense to a conviction
for both offenses"). We have continued to recognize thisprinciple over the years. See

Iannelli v. United States, 420
U. S. 770, 777-779 (1975); Garrett v. United States, 471 U. S.
773, 778 (1985) ("[C]onspiracy is a distinct offense from the
completed object of the conspiracy"); cf. id., at 793 ("[I]t does
not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause . . . to prosecute [a
continuing criminal enterprise] offense after a prior conviction for one of the predicate offenses").

In a related context, we recently cautioned against "ready
transposition of the `lesser included offense' principles of
double jeopardy from the classically simple situation presented in Brown [v. Ohio] to the multilayered conduct, both
as to time and to place, involved in [continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) prosecutions]." Id., at 789. The great majority of conspiracy prosecutions involve similar allegations
of multilayered conduct as to time and place; the conspiracy
charge against Felix is a perfect example. Reliance on the
lesser included offense analysis, however useful in the context of a "single course of conduct," is therefore much less
helpful in analyzing subsequent conspiracy prosecutions that
are supported by previously prosecuted overt acts, just as
it falls short in examining CCE offenses that are based on
previously prosecuted predicate acts. Id., at 788-789.

Faced with the necessity of reconciling this longstanding
authority with our language in Grady, we choose to adhere
to the Bayer-Pinkerton line of cases dealing with the distinction between conspiracy to commit an offense and the

391Cite as: 503 U. S. 378 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
offense itself. These are separate offenses for double jeop-ardy purposes. The majority in the Court of Appeals below

essentially read Grady as substituting for the "same offence"language of the Double Jeopardy Clause a test based on
whether the two prosecutions involve the "same conduct."
The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals thought thatthis was an oversimplification, pointing to the fact that the

word "conduct" in the previously quoted sentence from
Grady is modified by the phrase " `that constitutes an offense
for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.' " 926F. 2d, at 1532 (Anderson, J., dissenting) (quoting

Grady v.
Corbin, 495 U. S., at 521). The Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, in United States v. Calderone, 917 F. 2d 717
(1990), upheld a claim of double jeopardy by a divided vote,
with each judge on the panel writing an opinion interpreting
the crucial language from Grady differently. That court decided that the "conduct" at issue in a conspiracy prosecution
is not the agreement itself, but the conduct from which the
Government asks the jury to infer that there was an agreement. 917 F. 2d, at 721. Judge Newman filed a concurring
opinion, concluding that Grady bars a subsequent prosecution only when previously prosecuted conduct will be used
to establish the entirety of an element of the second crime.
See 917 F. 2d, at 723-725 (Newman, J., concurring). Other
Courts of Appeals, as described in more detail in n. 2, supra,
have rejected double jeopardy claims in similar situations.
It appears that while Grady eschewed a "same evidence"
test and Garrett rejected a " `single transaction' " test, Garrett v. United States, supra, at 790, the line between those
tests and the "same conduct" language of Grady is not easy
to discern.

We think it best not to enmesh in such subtleties the established doctrine that a conspiracy to commit a crime is a separate offense from the crime itself. Thus, in this case, the
conspiracy charge against Felix was an offense distinct from
any crime for which he had been previously prosecuted, and

the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar his prosecution onthat charge.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly

Reversed.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

While I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, I do notjoin Part III because I do not think there is "considerable
justification," ante, at 387-388, for the Court of Appeals' con-clusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause, as interpreted in
Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), bars prosecution ofFelix for the conspiracy charge contained in count 1 of the
indictment. In Grady, we held that "the Double JeopardyClause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, thegovernment will prove conduct that constitutes an offense
for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." 495U. S., at 510. But as the dissenting opinion of the Court
of Appeals explained, "the overt acts at issue here did notmeaningfully `establish' an essential element of the conspiracy" because there is no overt act requirement in the federaldrug conspiracy statute and the overt acts did not establish
an agreement between Felix and his co-conspirators. 926F. 2d 1522, 1536 (CA10 1991) (Anderson, J., dissenting). I
would thus reverse for the reasons explained in Parts I andII of the Court's opinion, ante, at 381-387, and Part III-B of
the dissenting opinion of the Court of Appeals, 926 F. 2d,at 1536-1539.

393OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

BARNHILL v. JOHNSON, TRUSTEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 91-159. Argued January 14, 1992--Decided March 25, 1992
The debtor's check in payment of a bona fide debt was delivered to petitioner Barnhill in New Mexico on November 18 and honored by the
drawee bank on November 20, the 90th day before the debtor filed a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. Respondent Johnson, the trustee of
the debtor's estate, filed an adversary action against Barnhill, claiming
that the payment was recoverable under 11 U. S. C. $ 547(b) as a transfer
of the debtor's property made on or within 90 days of the bankruptcy
filing. Johnson asserted that the transfer occurred on the date that the
bank honored the check, but Barnhill claimed that it occurred on the
date that he received the check. The Bankruptcy Court agreed with
Barnhill and denied recovery, and the District Court affirmed. The
Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a date of honor rule should
govern $ 547(b) actions.

Held: For the purposes of $ 547(b), a transfer made by check is deemed to

occur on the date the check is honored. Pp. 396-402.

(a) "What constitutes a transfer and when it is complete" is a matter
of federal law. McKenzie v. Irving Trust Co., 323 U. S. 365, 369-370.
The Bankruptcy Code defines "transfer" as "every mode, . . . absolute
or conditional, . . . of disposing of . . . property or . . . an interest in
property." 11 U. S. C. $ 101(54). In the absence of any controlling federal law, "property" and "interest[s] in property" are creatures of state
law. McKenzie, supra, at 370. Under the Uniform Commercial Code,
which has been adopted by New Mexico, a check is simply an order to
the drawee bank to pay the sum stated on demand. If the check is
honored, the debtor's obligation is discharged, but if it is not honored, a
cause of action against the debtor accrues to the check recipient "upon
demand following dishonor." Pp. 396-399.

(b) An unconditional transfer of the debtor's interest in property did
not occur before November 20, since receipt of the check gave Barnhill
no right in the funds the bank held on the debtor's account. No transfer
of any part of the debtor's claim against the bank occurred until the
bank honored the check, at which time the bank had the right to
"charge" the debtor's account and Barnhill's claim against the debtor
ceased. Honoring the check left the debtor in the position that it would
have occupied had it withdrawn cash from its account and handed it

Opinion of the Court
over to Barnhill. Thus, it was not until the debtor directed the bank
to honor the check and the bank did so, that the debtor implemented a
"mode . . . of disposing . . . of property or . . . an interest in property"
under $ 101(54) and a "transfer" took place. Pp. 399-400.

(c) Barnhill's argument that delivery of a check should be viewed as
a "conditional" transfer is rejected. Any chose in action against the
debtor that he gained when he received the check cannot be fairly characterized as a conditional right to "property or . . . an interest in property," since, until the moment of honor, the debtor remained in full
control over the account's disposition and the account remained subject
to a variety of actions by third parties. In addition, the rule of honor
is consistent with $ 547(e)(2)(A), which provides that a transfer occurs
at the time it "takes effect between the transferor and the transferee,"
particularly since the debtor here retained the ability to stop payment
on the check until the very last. Barnhill's appeal to legislative history
is also unavailing. Pp. 400-402.

931 F. 2d 689, affirmed.

Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which White,
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Blackmun, J., joined, post,
p. 403.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the
Court.

Under the Bankruptcy Code's preference avoidance section, 11 U. S. C. $ 547, the trustee is permitted to recover,
with certain exceptions, transfers of property made by the
debtor within 90 days before the date the bankruptcy petition was filed. We granted certiorari to decide whether, in
determining if a transfer occurred within the 90-day preference period, a transfer made by check should be deemed to
occur on the date the check is presented to the recipient or

395Cite as: 503 U. S. 393 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
on the date the drawee bank honors it. We hold that the
latter date is determinative.

The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. The
debtor 1 made payment for a bona fide debt to petitioner
Barnhill. The check was delivered to petitioner on November 18. The check was dated November 19, and the check
was honored by the drawee bank on November 20. The
debtor later filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. It is
agreed by the parties that the 90th day before the bankruptcy filing was November 20.

Respondent Johnson was appointed trustee for the bankruptcy estate. He filed an adversary proceeding against
petitioner, claiming that the check payment was recoverable
by the estate pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 547(b). That section
generally permits the trustee to recover for benefit of the
bankruptcy estate transfers of the debtor's property made
within 90 days of the bankruptcy filing. Respondent asserted that the transfer occurred on November 20, the date
the check was honored by the drawee bank, and therefore
was within the 90-day period. Petitioner defended by
claiming that the transfer occurred on November 18, the date
he received the check (the so-called "date of delivery" rule),
and that it therefore fell outside the 90-day period established by $ 547(b)(4)(A).

The Bankruptcy Court concluded that a date of delivery
rule should govern and therefore denied the trustee recovery. The trustee appealed, and the District Court affirmed.
The trustee then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit.

1 The debtor in this case is actually a collection of debtors whose simultaneous and related bankruptcy filings have been consolidated in a single
proceeding: Alan J. and Mary Frances Antweil, husband and wife, Morris
Antweil (deceased), and Hobbs Pipe & Supply, a general partnership.
Nothing in our decision turns on this fact, and we therefore refer to
them collectively as "debtor."

396 BARNHILL v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, concluding that a date of honor rule should govern actions under

$ 547(b). In re Antweil, 931 F. 2d 689 (1991). It distinguished a prior decision, In re White River Corp., 799 F. 2d
631 (1986), in which it held that, for purposes of $ 547(c), a
date of delivery rule should govern when a transfer occurs.2
The Tenth Circuit concluded that $$ 547(b) and 547(c) have
different purposes and functions, justifying different rules
for each. It further concluded that a date of honor rule was
appropriate because such a rule was consistent with provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C. C.), was capable of easier proof, and was less subject to manipulation.
We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit split.3 502 U. S.
807 (1991).

In relevant part, $ 547(b) provides:

"(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section,
the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the
debtor in property--. . . . .

"(4) made--
"(A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing
of the petition . . . ."

2 Section 547(c) establishes certain transfers that are not recoverable as
preferences, even if they fall within the 90-day preference period. See
infra, at 402.

3 Those selecting a date of honor rule include Nicholson v. First Investment Co., 705 F. 2d 410 (CA11 1983) (Bankruptcy Act), and In re New York
City Shoes, Inc., 880 F. 2d 679 (CA3 1989) (dicta). Those selecting date
of delivery include Global Distribution Network, Inc. v. Star Expansion
Co., 949 F. 2d 910 (CA7 1991); In re Virginia Information Systems Corp.,
932 F. 2d 338 (CA4 1991); In re Belknap, Inc., 909 F. 2d 879 (CA6 1990);

Opinion of the Court
Title 11 U. S. C. $ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp. II) 4 defines "trans-fer" to mean

"every mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or parting with
property or with an interest in property, including re-tention of title as a security interest and foreclosure of
the debtor's equity of redemption."
Section 547(e) provides further guidance on the meaning anddating of a transfer. For purposes of $ 547, it provides

"[(e)(1)](B) a transfer of a fixture or property other thanreal property is perfected when a creditor on a simple
contract cannot acquire a judicial lien that is superior tothe interest of the transferee.
"[(e)](2) For the purposes of this section, except as pro-vided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a transfer is
made--
"(A) at the time such transfer takes effect between thetransferor and the transferee, if such transfer is perfected at, or within 10 days after, such time;
"(B) at the time such transfer is perfected, if such trans-fer is perfected after such 10 days . . . ."

Our task, then, is to determine whether, under the definitionof transfer provided by $ 101(54), and supplemented by

$ 547(e), the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid can besaid to have occurred before November 20.

"What constitutes a transfer and when it is complete" is amatter of federal law.

McKenzie v. Irving Trust Co., 323

4 The definition of transfer was codified in 1986 at 11 U. S. C. $ 101(50).
In 1990, Congress added eight new definitions to $ 101 in two separate
Acts, Public Laws 101-311 and 101-647. The addition of the new definitions apparently has resulted in confusion in codifying those definitions,
with the result that there are now in the United States Code, Chapter 11,
two sections 101(54), one defining "stockbroker" and the second defining
"transfer." We will refer to "transfer" as being codified at $ 101(54).

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 365, 369-370 (1945). This is unsurprising since, asnoted above, the statute itself provides a definition of "transfer." But that definition in turn includes references to part-ing with "property" and "interest[s] in property." In the
absence of any controlling federal law, "property" and "inter-ests in property" are creatures of state law.

Id., at 370;Butner v. United States, 440 U. S. 48, 54 (1979) ("Congress

has generally left the determination of property rights in theassets of a bankrupt's estate to state law"). Thus it is helpful to sketch briefly the rights and duties enjoyed understate law by each party to a check transaction.

5

A person with an account at a bank enjoys a claim againstthe bank for funds in an amount equal to the account balance.

Under the U. C. C., a check is simply an order to the draweebank to pay the sum stated, signed by the maker and payable
on demand. U. C. C. $$ 3-104(1), (2)(b), 2 U. L. A. 224 (1991).Receipt of a check does not, however, give the recipient a
right against the bank. The recipient may present thecheck, but, if the drawee bank refuses to honor it, the recipient has no recourse against the drawee. $ 3-409(1), 2AU. L. A. 189 (1991).

6

That is not to say, however, that the recipient of a checkis without any rights. Receipt of a check for an underlying

obligation suspends the obligation "pro tanto until the in-strument['s] . . . presentment[;] . . . discharge of the underlying obligor on the instrument also discharges him on the obli-gation." $ 3-802(1)(b), 2A U. L. A. 514 (1991). But should

5 We discuss these issues under the rubric of the U. C. C. and, in particular, U. C. C. Article 3. New Mexico, the State in which the instant transaction occurred, has adopted the U. C. C., see N. M. Stat. Ann. $ 55-3-101
et seq. (1978 and Supp. 1991), as have all other 49 States, the District of
Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. We are aware of no material
differences between the version adopted by each of these other jurisdictions and the one we consider today, that of New Mexico.

6 "A check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of

any funds in the hands of the drawee available for its payment, and the
drawee is not liable on the instrument until he accepts it."

Opinion of the Court
the drawee bank refuse to honor a check, a cause of actionagainst the drawer of the check accrues to the recipient of a

check "upon demand following dishonor of the instrument."$ 3-122(3), 2 U. L. A. 407 (1991); see also $ 3- 413(2), 2A
U. L. A. 208 (1991). And the recipient of a dishonored check,received in payment on an underlying obligation, may maintain an action on either the check or the obligation. $ 3-802(1)(b), 2A U. L. A. 514 (1991).

With this background we turn to the issue at hand. Peti-tioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred in ignoring
the interest that passed from the debtor to the petitionerwhen the check was delivered on a date outside the 90-day
preference period. We disagree. We begin by noting thatthere can be no assertion that an unconditional transfer of
the debtor's interest in property had occurred before No-vember 20. This is because, as just noted above, receipt of
a check gives the recipient no right in the funds held by thebank on the drawer's account. Myriad events can intervene
between delivery and presentment of the check that wouldresult in the check being dishonored. The drawer could
choose to close the account. A third party could obtain alien against the account by garnishment or other proceedings. The bank might mistakenly refuse to honor thecheck.

7

The import of the preceding discussion for the instant caseis that no transfer of any part of the debtor's claim against

the bank occurred until the bank honored the check on No-vember 20. The drawee bank honored the check by paying
it. U. C. C. $ 1-201(21), 1 U. L. A. 65 (1989) (defining honor);$ 4-215(a), 2B U. L. A. 45 (1991). At that time, the bank had
a right to "charge" the debtor's account, $ 4-401, 2B U. L. A.307 (1991)--

i. e., the debtor's claim against the bank was re-duced by the amount of the check--and petitioner no longer

7 Admittedly, such behavior might create a cause of action for the debtordrawer, see U. C. C. $ 4-402, 2B U. L. A. 59 (1991), but the recipient would
not have any claim against the bank.

Opinion of the Court
had a claim against the debtor. Honoring the check, inshort, left the debtor in the position that it would have occupied if it had withdrawn cash from its account and handed itover to petitioner. We thus believe that when the debtor
has directed the drawee bank to honor the check and thebank has done so, the debtor has implemented a "mode, direct or indirect . . . of disposing . . . of property or . . . aninterest in property." 11 U. S. C. $ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp.
II) (emphasis added). For the purposes of payment by ordi-nary check, therefore, a "transfer" as defined by $ 101(54)
occurs on the date of honor, and not before. And since it isundisputed that honor occurred within the 90-day preference
period, the trustee presumptively may avoid this transfer.In the face of this argument, petitioner retreats to the
definition of "transfer" contained in $ 101(54). Petitionerurges that rather than viewing the transaction as involving
two distinct actions--delivery of the check, with no interestin property thereby being transferred, and honoring of the
check, with an interest being transferred--that we insteadshould view delivery of the check as a "conditional" transfer.
We acknowledge that $ 101(54) adopts an expansive definitionof transfer, one that includes "every mode . . . absolute or
conditional . . . of disposing of or parting with property orwith an interest in property." There is thus some force in
petitioner's claim that he did, in fact, gain something whenhe received the check. But at most, what petitioner gained
was a chose in action against the debtor.8 Such a right, how-ever, cannot fairly be characterized as a conditional right to

8 Petitioner asserts that upon the date of delivery, he held a cause of
action against the debtor. Brief for Petitioner 18. We think that petitioner may overstate matters a bit; it appears under the U. C. C. that receipt of the check provides a contingent cause of action, the contingency
being a subsequent dishonoring of the check and a demand to the drawer
for payment. See U. C. C. $ 3-122(3), 2 U. L. A. 407 (1991), and Official
Comment || 1. It is unnecessary to resolve this question, however, for
even on petitioner's more expansive assertion his claim under the Bankruptcy Code fails.

Opinion of the Court
"property . . . or an interest in property," $ 101(54), wherethe property in this case is the account maintained with the

drawee bank. For as noted above, until the moment ofhonor the debtor retains full control over disposition of the
account and the account remains subject to a variety of actions by third parties. To treat petitioner's nebulous rightto bring suit as a "conditional transfer" of the property

would accomplish a near-limitless expansion of the term"conditional." In the absence of any right against the bank
or the account, we think the fairer description is that peti-tioner had received no interest in debtor's property, not that
his interest was "conditional."

Finally, we note that our conclusion that no transfer of
property occurs until the time of honor is consistent with

$ 547(e)(2)(A). That section provides that a transfer occurs
at the time the transfer "takes effect between the transferor
and the transferee . . . ." For the reasons given above, and
in particular because the debtor in this case retained the
ability to stop payment on the check until the very last, we
do not think that the transfer of funds in this case can be
said to have "taken effect between the debtor and petitioner" until the moment of honor.

Recognizing, perhaps, the difficulties in his position, petitioner places his heaviest reliance not on the statutory language but on accompanying legislative history. Specifically,
he points to identical statements from Representative Edwards and Senator DeConcini that "payment of a debt by
means of a check is equivalent to a cash payment, unless the
check is dishonored. Payment is considered to be made
when the check is delivered for purposes of sections 547(c)(1)
and (2)." 124 Cong. Rec. 32400 (1978); id., at 34000. We
think this appeal to legislative history unavailing.

To begin, we note that appeals to statutory history are
well taken only to resolve "statutory ambiguity." Toibb v.
Radloff, 501 U. S. 157, 162 (1991). We do not think this is
such a case. But even if it were, the statements on which

Opinion of the Court
petitioner relies, by their own terms, apply only to $ 547(c),not to $ 547(b). Section 547(c), in turn, establishes various

exceptions to $ 547(b)'s general rule permitting recovery ofpreferential transfers. Subsection (c)(1) provides an exception for transfers that are part of a contemporaneous ex-change of new value between a debtor and creditor; subsection (c)(2) provides an exception for transfers made fromdebtor to creditor in the ordinary course of business. These
sections are designed to encourage creditors to continue todeal with troubled debtors on normal business terms by obviating any worry that a subsequent bankruptcy filing mightrequire the creditor to disgorge as a preference an earlier
received payment. But given this specialized purpose, wesee no basis for concluding that the legislative history, particularly legislative history explicitly confined by its own termsto $ 547(c), should cause us to adopt a "date of delivery" rule
for purposes of $ 547(b).9

9 Those Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue are unanimous
in concluding that a "date of delivery" rule should apply to check payments
for purposes of $ 547(c). Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Midwest Corp., 873 F. 2d
805 (CA5 1989); In re Continental Commodities, Inc., 841 F. 2d 527 (CA4
1988); In re Wolf & Vine, 825 F. 2d 197 (CA9 1987); In re Kenitra, Inc.,
797 F. 2d 790 (CA9 1986); In re White River Corp., 799 F. 2d 631 (CA10
1986); and O'Neill v. Nestle Libbys P. R., Inc., 729 F. 2d 35 (CA1 1984). A
few Bankruptcy Courts and District Courts have disagreed. See, e. g., In
re Hartwig Poultry, Inc., 56 B. R. 332 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ohio 1985). We,
of course, express no views on that issue, which is not properly before us.
We do note, however, that $ 547(c)(2) has undergone significant change
since the time of Representative Edwards' and Senator DeConcini's comments. Section 547(c)(2) previously had a requirement that, in order for
a payment by the debtor to qualify as a payment in the ordinary course
of business, the payment had to have been made within 45 days of when
the underlying debt was first incurred. That requirement has since been
eliminated. See Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 156-157 (1991).
This in turn may mean that, in the context of a check payment, there is
now less need to precisely date the time when a check transfer occurs for
purposes of $ 547(c)(2). That is, rather than inquiring whether a transfer
occurred on the 45th day or the 46th, courts now need only focus on
whether the transfer was made in the ordinary course of business. Id.,

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.

In my opinion, a "transfer" of property occurs on the datethe check is delivered to the transferee, provided that the
check is honored within 10 days. This conclusion is consist-ent with the traditional commercial practice of treating the
date of delivery as the date of payment when a payment ismade by a check that is subsequently honored by the drawee
bank.1 It is also consistent with the treatment of checks intax law. A taxpayer may deduct expenses paid by a check
delivered on or before December 31 against that year's in-come even though the drawee bank does not honor the check
until the next calendar year.2 Insofar as possible, it is wiseto interpret statutes regulating commercial behavior consistently with established practices in the business community.The custom that treats the delivery of a check as payment

at 162. Thus, the relevance of the legislative history, even for purposes
of interpreting $ 547(c), appears to have been somewhat undermined; given
this, it would clearly be inappropriate to extrapolate from that history for
purposes of interpreting the scope of $$ 547(b) and 101(54).

1 See, e. g., Regents of University of New Mexico v. Lacey, 107 N. M.

742, 744, 764 P. 2d 873, 875 (1988) ("[I]f, when the check is delivered, the
drawer has funds in the drawee bank to meet it, and the check is honored
and paid upon presentment, the conditional nature of the payment becomes absolute and the date of payment will be deemed to have been made

check is paid, the payment of the underlying debt becomes absolute and it
is deemed paid as of the date of the giving of the check").

due course. Treas. Reg. $ 1.170A-1(b), 26 CFR $ 1.170A-1(b) (1991).

Stevens, J., dissenting
should not be rejected unless Congress has unequivocally
commanded a contrary result. In the Bankruptcy Code,
Congress has done no such thing. On the contrary, the Code
is entirely consistent with the normal practice.

The definition of the term "transfer" in $ 101(54) is plainly
broad enough to encompass the conditional transfer of the
right to funds in the debtor's bank account that occurs when
the debtor delivers a check to a creditor. Section 101(54)
defines a "transfer" as "every mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of
or parting with property or with an interest in property
. . . ." 11 U. S. C. $ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp. II). A check 3 is
obviously a "mode" through which the debtor may "par[t]
with property." 4

Of course, the fact that delivery of a check effects a "transfer" within the meaning of the Code does not answer the
question whether the trustee may avoid the transfer by
check in this case because $ 547(b) only authorizes the
trustee to avoid transfers made "on or within 90 days before
the date of the filing of the [bankruptcy] petition." 11
U. S. C. $ 547(b)(4)(A). That raises the question: When did
the "transfer" occur? Section 547(e)(2) provides the answer.
It states that for purposes of the preference avoidance section, $ 547, a transfer is made:

3 A check is an order, signed by the maker, to the drawee bank to pay
the sum stated upon demand. See Uniform Commercial Code $ 3-104, 2
U. L. A. 224 (1991).

4 The fact that "[m]yriad events can intervene between delivery and presentment of the check that would result in the check being dishonored,"
ante, at 399, does not alter this conclusion because $ 101(54) expansively
defines the term "transfer" to include even conditional modes of parting
with property. In my opinion, the delivery of a check effects such a conditional transfer because upon delivery, the transferee receives a conditional
right to funds in the bank account of the maker--the condition being acceptance by the drawee bank.

Stevens, J., dissenting
"(A) at the time such transfer takes effect between the
transferor and the transferee, if such transfer is perfected at, or within 10 days after, such time;

"(B) at the time such transfer is perfected, if such transfer is perfected after such 10 days . . . ." $ 547(e)(2).

The Court interprets this section as supporting its conclusion that the transfer does not occur until the check is
honored by the drawee bank because, it reasons, a transfer
cannot take effect between the transferor and transferee as
long as the transferor retains the ability to stop payment on
the check. Ante, at 401. But that reasoning is foreclosed
by $ 101(54), which states that even a conditional transfer is
a "transfer" for purposes of the Code. Because delivery of
a check effects a conditional transfer from the transferor to
the transferee, the "transfer" is made, for purposes of $ 547,
on the date of delivery, provided that the transfer is "perfected" within 10 days as required by $ 547(e)(2).

As the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recognized, the use of the term "perfected" is "jarring" because
the meaning of the word "perfected" is not immediately apparent in this context. Global Distribution Network, Inc.
v. Star Expansion Co., 949 F. 2d 910, 913 (1991). "Debtors
transfer assets; creditors perfect security interests." Ibid.
The answer lies in the fact that the term "perfected" has
a broader meaning in $ 547(e) than it does in the Uniform
Commercial Code. Section 547(e)(1)(B) states that "a transfer of . . . property other than real property is perfected
when a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire a judicial
lien that is superior to the interest of the transferee."
Under this definition, a transfer by check is "perfected"
when the check is honored because after that time no one
can acquire a judicial lien superior to the interest of the
transferee.

Thus $$ 101(54) and 547, when read together, plainly indicate that a "transfer" by check occurs on the date the check

Stevens, J., dissenting
is delivered to the transferee, provided that the drawee bankhonors the check within 10 days. If, however, the check is

not honored within 10 days, the "transfer" occurs on the dateof honor.

An additional consideration reinforces this interpretationof the statutory text. The Courts of Appeals are unanimous
in concluding that the date of delivery of a check is control-ling for purposes of $ 547(c), and the Court does not dispute
that conclusion for the purposes of its decision today. Ante,at 402-403, n. 9. These Courts of Appeals decisions are consistent with the legislative history,5 which, though admit-tedly not conclusive, identifies the date of delivery of a check
as the date of transfer for purposes of $ 547(c).6 Normally,we assume that the same terms have the same meaning in
different sections of the same statute. See, e. g., Sullivan v.
Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990). That rule is not inex-orable, but nothing in the structure or purpose of $$ 547(b)

and 547(c) suggests a reason for interpreting these adjacentsubsections differently.

7

I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.

5 Indeed, many of these decisions rely on the legislative history. See,
e. g., In re Continental Commodities, Inc., 841 F. 2d 527, 530 (CA4 1988);
In re White River Corp., 799 F. 2d 631, 633 (CA10 1986); O'Neill v. Nestle
Libbys P. R., Inc., 729 F. 2d 35, 37 (CA1 1984).

6 As the Court recognizes, ante, at 401, sponsors of the legislation in the

House and Senate made identical statements to this effect.

7 As the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit cogently explained: "The

policy of section 547(b) is to set aside transfers that potentially prefer
selected creditors; section 547(c), in turn, defines groups of creditors who
are excepted. To give the word `transfer' a different meaning in these
complementary subparts seems inconsistent, unworkable, and confusing."

NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION

et al. v. BOSTON & MAINE CORP. et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 90-1419. Argued January 13, 1992--Decided March 25, 1992*
The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (RPSA) created petitioner National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), a private corporation,
to provide intercity and commuter rail passenger service. The Act permits Amtrak to enter into "trackage rights" agreements to use tracks
owned and used by freight railroads, 45 U. S. C. $ 562(a), and allows Amtrak to ask petitioner Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to condemn railroad property "required for intercity rail passenger service" if
Amtrak and the railroad cannot agree upon sale terms, $ 562(d). For
purposes of the ICC's condemnation order, Amtrak's "need for the property" "shall be deemed to be established" unless the conveyance will
significantly impair the railroad's ability to carry out its obligations as
a common carrier and unless Amtrak's obligations can adequately be
met by the acquisition of alternative property. Ibid. Amtrak had a
"trackage rights" agreement with respondent Boston and Maine Corporation (B&M) to operate its "Montrealer" train between Washington,
D. C., and Montreal. Amtrak claims it was forced to discontinue this
service because of B&M's poor maintenance of its track segment. Subsequently, Amtrak entered into an agreement with petitioner Central Vermont Railroad (CV) which provided that, among other things, Amtrak
would acquire the B&M track and reconvey it to CV, and CV would
grant trackage rights to Amtrak and usage rights to B&M. When
B&M did not accept Amtrak's purchase offer for the track, Amtrak
sought, and received, an ICC order compelling conveyance for just compensation. The ICC found, among other things, that $ 562(d) created a
statutory presumption of Amtrak's need for the track, which B&M failed
to rebut. The Court of Appeals remanded the case for further proceedings, concluding that, because Amtrak did not intend to retain the track,
it needed only its use, not its ownership. While petitions for rehearing
were pending, $ 562(d) was amended to allow Amtrak to subsequently
convey title to acquired property to a third party if the ICC finds the
reconveyance furthers the RPSA's purposes. Nonetheless, the court

denied rehearing, holding that the condemnation was not valid because
the property was not "required for intercity rail passenger service."

Held:

1. The ICC's decision was based on a reasonable interpretation and
application of $ 562(d). Pp. 417-424.

(a) The ICC's interpretation of the word "required" is due deference as a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous term in a statute
that the ICC administers. See, e. g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. The existence of alternative dictionary definitions for "required" indicates that the statute
is open to interpretation. The ICC's interpretation gives effect to

$ 562(d)'s presumption of need. In contrast, the Court of Appeals'
view--that "required" establishes a separate condition that Amtrak's
condemnation authority is limited to property that is indispensable to
its operations--is in clear tension with the presumption. In addition,

$ 562(d)'s amendment confirms the ICC's definition, while the Court of
Appeals' strict rule would make the amendment superfluous by barring
condemnation whenever Amtrak's purpose is to reconvey property.
Pp. 417-420.

(b) The ICC was not required to make specific findings regarding
Amtrak's actual need for the condemnation because its oversight responsibility is limited to ensuring that condemned property will be used
in Amtrak's rail operations. The statute's structure and its presumption of need create a strong inference that it authorizes Amtrak to make
a reasonable business judgment that condemnation is advisable, unless
the statutory presumption is rebutted. Pp. 420-421.

(c) B&M's several arguments against the ICC's interpretation are
rejected. The eminent domain power has been given to the ICC, not

a private entity, and thus is not limited as suggested by cases such
as United States v. Carmack, 329 U. S. 230, 243, n. 13. Furthermore,
these cases turn on the need for deference to the ICC, not to Amtrak. The ICC's interpretation of $ 562(d) also did not violate the
"public use" requirement of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause,
since the ICC's determination that the condemnation will serve a public purpose by facilitating Amtrak's rail service was not irrational.
See, e. g., Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229, 240-241.
Moreover, the ICC did not err in concluding that the statutory prerequisite that the parties were "unable to agree upon terms for the sale"
mandated nothing more than a factual determination that they would
be unable to reach agreement through further negotiations. Nor did it
make inadequate factual findings in concluding that B&M had not rebutted the presumption of need. The ICC was not unreasonable in consid503us2$54L 11-14-95 19:31:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ering the effect of trackage rights and the just compensation award in
assessing whether the conveyance would significantly impair B&M's
ability to carry out its obligations, or in interpreting the availabilityof-alternative-property provision as referring only to whether Amtrak could provide service using an alternative route, not whether a
lesser interest in property would suffice to meet Amtrak's needs.
Pp. 421-424.

well as certain other issues should be resolved on remand. P. 424.

410 NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION v.

BOSTON & MAINE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

Railroad Passenger Corporation, requiring conveyance of
48.8 miles of railroad track from respondent Boston and
Maine Corporation (B&M) to the Corporation. In these consolidated cases we must decide whether the ICC's decision
was based on a reasonable interpretation and application
of $ 402(d) of the Rail Passenger Service Act, 45 U. S. C.

$ 562(d), the statute the Corporation invoked in the proceeding. We hold the ICC's decision is authorized by the statute,
and so reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit, which set aside the Commission's action.

I

The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak,
is a private, for-profit corporation created by Congress in the
Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (RPSA), Pub. L. 91-518,
84 Stat. 1328, 45 U. S. C. $ 501 et seq. The purpose of Amtrak is to provide modern and efficient intercity and commuter rail passenger service. $$ 501, 541. Amtrak is not
an agency or instrumentality of the United States Government, $ 541, but it has been supported over the years by
congressional appropriations. Most of Amtrak's passenger
trains run over existing track systems owned and used by
freight railroads. In the RPSA Congress authorized Amtrak to enter into "trackage rights" agreements which would
allow Amtrak to use those tracks. When Amtrak and a
freight railroad are unable to agree on the terms of such an
agreement, Amtrak may request the ICC to order the track
to be provided on reasonable terms. $ 562(a).

In 1973 Congress amended the RPSA to add subsection
(d) of $ 402, 45 U. S. C. $ 562(d). Section 562(d) provides in
pertinent part:

"(1) If the Corporation [Amtrak] and a railroad are unable to agree upon terms for the sale to the Corporation
of property (including interests in property) owned by
the railroad and required for intercity rail passenger

Opinion of the Court
service, the Corporation may apply to the Commission[ICC] for an order establishing the need of the Corporation for the property at issue and requiring the con-veyance thereof from the railroad to the Corporation on
reasonable terms and conditions, including just compensation. Unless the Commission finds that--

"(A) conveyance of the property to the Corporation
would significantly impair the ability of the railroad tocarry out its obligations as a common carrier; and

"(B) the obligations of the Corporation to provide mod-ern, efficient, and economical rail passenger service can
adequately be met by the acquisition of alternative prop-erty (including interests in property) which is available
for sale on reasonable terms to the Corporation, or avail-able to the Corporation by the exercise of its authority
under section 545(d) of this title,
"the need of the Corporation for the property shall bedeemed to be established and the Commission shall

order the conveyance of the property to the Corporationon such reasonable terms and conditions as it may prescribe, including just compensation."
Amtrak may condemn nonrail property under a somewhat
similar provision, $ 545(d), a statute not at issue here.The Amtrak train the "Montrealer" began offering passenger service between Washington, D. C., and Montreal in1972. In parts of Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire the train used the tracks of the Connecticut River Line(Conn River Line), portions of which are owned by B&M and

other portions by the Central Vermont Railroad (CV). B&M
and CV have operated freight trains on the Conn River Line
under reciprocal "trackage rights" agreements dating back
to 1930.

In 1977 Amtrak entered into a "trackage rights" agreement
with B&M under which B&M agreed to maintain its portions
of the Conn River Line. Those portions include a 48.8-mile

Opinion of the Court

segment of track on the Conn River Line between Brattle-boro and Windsor, Vermont. This is the segment of track at

issue here. At first the arrangement to maintain the trackproceeded well, but in the early 1980's problems developed.
Guilford Transportation Industries, Inc., purchased B&M out
of bankruptcy, and purchased also a railroad operating a par-allel line. Amtrak's claim is that neglect of track maintenance resulting from this purchase caused delays in Mon-trealer service. Maintenance of the Brattleboro-Windsor
track was so poor that at points the train was slowed to fivemiles an hour. Negotiations for better maintenance were
unsuccessful. In April 1987 Amtrak was forced to discontinue its Montrealer service.

Congress responded to these events in July 1987 by appropriating $5 million to upgrade the Montrealer route. Act of
July 11, 1987, Pub. L. 100-71, 101 Stat. 447-448. Amtrak
decided not to spend the money to upgrade the Conn River
Line while B&M continued to own it, because in Amtrak's
view B&M could not be relied upon to maintain the track
once restored. Amtrak began negotiations with CV and,
in early 1988, reached a preliminary agreement. Amtrak
promised to use its statutory condemnation power to acquire
the 48.8 miles of track in question, to at once reconvey the
track to CV, and to provide up to $3.1 million to upgrade
and rehabilitate the segment. In return, CV promised to
provide the balance of the funds necessary to upgrade the
track, to maintain the track for 20 years in a condition meeting Amtrak's standards, to grant Amtrak trackage rights for
20 years, and to grant B&M trackage rights to serve its
existing customers. As a prerequisite to invoking $ 562(d),
Amtrak made an offer to B&M to purchase the segment for
$1 million, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. B&M offered to negotiate the terms under which it would be willing to upgrade
the segment and stated: "[I]t appears clear that there is no
need to pursue the very complex `offer to purchase' set forth
in your letter." App. 60. B&M's refusal to accept the offer

Opinion of the Court
seems to have been anticipated by Amtrak and CV, as indi-cated by an internal CV Memorandum written in January

1988. App. 94.Interpreting the B&M communication as a rejection of its
offer, Amtrak instituted this proceeding before the ICC to
compel conveyance of the track. CV filed a simultaneousrequest for an exemption from ICC regulation for its acquisition of the segment upon reconveyance from Amtrak.B&M assessed the transaction as a significant shift in its
long competition with CV for freight traffic. CV alreadyowned large parts of the Conn River Line and after the proposed transaction it would own most of it. Though B&M
would have trackage rights, CV would gain not only ownership of the segment, but also the right to obtain new customers on its route. B&M alleged this gave a new advantage
to CV's corporate parent, the Canadian National Railway
Company, for each railroad links up with competing companies in Canada. CV's lines link to Canadian National, while
B&M's lines link to the Canadian Pacific, Ltd., Canadian National's competitor. B&M challenged the transaction as simply a device to shift ownership among railroads, not to give
ownership to Amtrak, which, B&M argued, was the sole purpose of the condemnation provision.

B&M filed initial objections to the $ 562(d) proceeding on
two grounds: that Amtrak had not shown that the parties
were unable to agree on reasonable terms of sale, and that

$ 562(d) did not authorize condemnation of railroad lines.
The ICC rejected B&M's arguments and in a condemnation
proceeding held that Amtrak had shown the inability of the
parties to agree to terms. It ruled that $ 562(d) covers railroad tracks because tracks are "rail property `required for
intercity rail passenger service.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. in
No. 90-1419, pp. 130a-133a. B&M next sought to convert
the proceeding into a trackage rights proceeding under

$ 562(a), but the ICC again rejected B&M's position, holding
that Amtrak had an "election of remedies" under $ 562 and

Opinion of the Court

so had no obligation to seek trackage rights under subsection(a) before invoking subsection (d).

Id., at 115a-116a. Meanwhile, CV and the States of Vermont and Massachusetts, aswell as numerous other parties, intervened in the ICC proceeding. (CV appears as a petitioner before this Court, and
Vermont and Massachusetts support petitioners.)This was the first decided case involving Amtrak's condemnation powers under $ 562(d). Id., at 39a. The ICC is-sued its final decision in 1988 and ordered conveyance of the
segment with just compensation of $2,373,286. It reaf-firmed earlier rulings and found that Amtrak "ha[d] met the
statutory criteria for the institution of a proceeding" under

$ 562(d). Id., at 40a-42a, 81a.

The ICC concluded that the presumption of Amtrak's need
for the track contained in $ 562(d)(1) was applicable. In its
view both statutory criteria must be met to rebut the presumption, and B&M had established neither. As to alternative property (subsection (B)), the ICC found that no reasonable alternative route existed for the Montrealer service.
And as to significant impairment of B&M's ability to carry
out its common carrier obligations (subsection (A)), the ICC
found that because B&M had been awarded just compensation and could continue to serve its customers under the
"trackage rights" agreement which was part of the transaction, its ability had not been impaired. Id., at 45a-46a.
The bulk of the ICC's final decision deals with the question
of just compensation, which is not before this Court. See
infra, at 424.

On petition for review, a divided panel of the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the
petition and remanded the matter to the ICC for further
proceedings. 286 U. S. App. D. C. 1, 911 F. 2d 743 (1990).
The majority held that $ 562(d) does not permit Amtrak to
condemn railroad property which it intends to reconvey to
another railroad. It acknowledged that the ICC had inter503us2$54L 11-14-95 19:31:03 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
preted $ 562 in a different way, and that in the usual coursejudicial deference would be given to its interpretation under

the principles enunciated in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984); but
the court concluded that $ 562(d) is unambiguous in light of
its language and history, and so no deference was due. Thepanel majority reasoned that because Amtrak did not intend

to retain the track to be condemned, it needed only its use,not its ownership. As Amtrak could obtain use of the property by obtaining either a "trackage rights" agreementunder $ 562(a), or by condemning an easement under $ 562(d),
the entire fee interest was not " `required for intercity rail
passenger service.' " 286 U. S. App. D. C., at 8, 911 F. 2d,
at 750. The majority stated that its holding was confirmed
by other considerations, including: (1) the potential constitutional problems, under the Takings Clause, raised by the
ICC's interpretation of $ 562(d); (2) the structure of $ 562,
which indicated an intent on the part of Congress to relegate
Amtrak to trackage rights under $ 562(a) when seeking only
the use of track; and (3) Congress' policy against crosssubsidization between sectors of the railroad industry, which
the majority concluded would have been violated by this
transaction. Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg concurred separately,
rejecting the majority's interpretation of the statute, but
concluding that a remand to the ICC was necessary because
the ICC had not made adequate findings to determine
whether Amtrak in fact needed to shift ownership of the
segment from B&M to CV to protect its interests. Id., at
11-13, 911 F. 2d, at 753-755. This factual question, whether
Amtrak's portrayal of a recalcitrant B&M is accurate, remains in dispute. Under our resolution of the case, however, the issue need not be reached.

Amtrak and the ICC filed petitions for rehearing, and
while the petitions were pending Congress amended $ 562(d).
The amendment, adopted in specific response to the Court of

Appeals' decision in this case, added the following sentence
to $ 562(d)(1): "The Corporation may subsequently convey
title or other interest in such property to a third party, if
such reconveyance is found by the Commission to further
the purposes of this Act." Independent Safety Board Act
Amendments of 1990 $ 9(a), Pub. L. 101-641, 104 Stat. 4658.
The amendment was made applicable to all pending cases,

$ 9(b), and B&M does not dispute that it applied in this case
even while it was before the Court of Appeals on rehearing.
Brief for Respondent B&M 33-35. The Court of Appeals
considered the 1990 amendment, but denied rehearing nonetheless. 288 U. S. App. D. C. 196, 925 F. 2d 427 (1991). The
panel majority held that while $ 9 made it clear Amtrak was
authorized to reconvey condemned property "subsequent to
a condemnation that is otherwise valid under [$ 562(d)]," it
did not change the statutory limitation that the property be
" `required for intercity rail passenger service' " in the first
place. Id., at 197, 925 F. 2d, at 428 (emphasis in original).
The majority reasoned that since its original decision was
based on Amtrak's failure to satisfy that requirement, the
amendment did not affect its holding. The majority also distinguished a case from the Second Circuit, National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Two Parcels of Land, 822 F. 2d 1261,
cert. denied, 484 U. S. 954 (1987), which had interpreted

$ 545(d)(1) (the provision authorizing Amtrak to condemn
nonrail property) to permit reconveyance following condemnation. 288 U. S. App. D. C., at 196-197, 425 F. 2d, at 427-
428. In a separate opinion, Judge Ginsburg wrote that the
amendment confirmed her view that the ICC had not misinterpreted the statute, but that a remand remained necessary
for further factual determinations.

Amtrak and CV, in No. 90-1419, and the ICC, in No. 90-
1769, filed separate petitions seeking review of the Court of
Appeals' decision. We granted certiorari and consolidated
the cases. 502 U. S. 807 (1991). We now reverse.

Opinion of the Court

II
The primary question raised by these cases is a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation: whether $ 562(d),
as amended, authorizes the condemnation and transaction
approved by the ICC but set aside by the Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals disallowed the transaction based on its
own interpretation of the language "required for intercity
rail passenger service" in $ 562(d)(1). In so holding it limited Amtrak's condemnation authority to property that was
necessary, in the sense of indispensable, to Amtrak's operations. The ICC interpreted the relevant statutory language
to give Amtrak more latitude, and it is our task to determine
whether the Commission had authority for its statutory
interpretation.

Judicial deference to reasonable interpretations by an
agency of a statute that it administers is a dominant, wellsettled principle of federal law. We relied upon it in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984), and have reaffirmed it often. See, e. g.,
K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S. 281, 292-293 (1988);
Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 696-697
(1991). These decisions mandate that when a court is reviewing an agency decision based on a statutory interpretation, "if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to
the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the
agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the
statute." Chevron U. S. A., supra, at 843. If the agency interpretation is not in conflict with the plain language of the
statute, deference is due. K mart Corp., 486 U. S., at 292.
In ascertaining whether the agency's interpretation is a permissible construction of the language, a court must look to
the structure and language of the statute as a whole. Id.,
at 291; Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83, 89 (1990). If the
text is ambiguous and so open to interpretation in some respects, a degree of deference is granted to the agency, though

503us2$54L 11-14-95 19:31:03 PAGES OPINPGT
418 NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION v.

BOSTON & MAINE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

a reviewing court need not accept an interpretation whichis unreasonable.

Under these principles the ICC's interpretation of $ 562(d)was permissible, and the Court of Appeals' decision was in
error to disregard it. While the ICC's opinion is not explicit
in all of its details, the Commission's decision is based ona reading of the statute quite different from the Court of

Appeals'. The ICC agreed that property Amtrak seeks tocondemn under $ 562(d) must be "required for intercity rail
passenger service." It determined, however, that the word"required" need not mean, as the Court of Appeals' opinion
suggests, indispensable or necessary. Instead, the ICC gave
effect to the statutory presumption of Amtrak's need for the
track, and in so doing implemented and interpreted the statute in a manner that comports with its words and structure.
The analysis of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with the
Commission's interpretation of the statutory presumption of
need. The ICC's position before the Court is that "required" can also mean "useful or appropriate," Brief for Petitioners in No. 90-1769, p. 17, and that the order under review
adopted that meaning. We agree that the manner in which
the ICC has applied the statute in this case has that interpretation as its basic premise. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.
90-1419, pp. 42a-46a.

In its brief the ICC cites a dictionary definition in support
of its view. Brief for Petitioners in No. 90-1769, p. 17, citing
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1929 (1986).
The existence of alternative dictionary definitions of the
word "required," each making some sense under the statute,
itself indicates that the statute is open to interpretation.
See Sullivan v. Everhart, supra. Few phrases in a complex
scheme of regulation are so clear as to be beyond the need
for interpretation when applied in a real context. Further,
the structure of the provision reinforces our conclusion that
statutory interpretation is appropriate and that the Court of
Appeals' interpretation is itself open to serious question.

419Cite as: 503 U. S. 407 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
The court defined the word "required" to establish a separatecondition that the property sought to be condemned be necessary (indispensable) for Amtrak's operations, a view whichis not without support. See,

e. g., American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1105 (2d ed. 1981). This
interpretation, though, leaves little substance to the statu-tory presumption in favor of Amtrak's need and so is in clear

tension with that part of the statute.We decide that $ 562(d) is ambiguous in some respects and
conclude that the ICC's interpretation of the word "re-quired" is a reasonable one. We defer to its interpretation.
This is not to say that the issue is beyond dispute, but these
alternative interpretations are as old as the jurisprudence of
this Court. In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 413
(1819), Chief Justice Marshall, in a choice of interpretations
with some parallels to this one, read the word "necessary"
to mean "convenient, or useful," rejecting a stricter reading
of the term which would have limited congressional power
under the Constitution to the "most direct and simple"
means available. We think that as a matter of definition and
interpretation in the context of this statute it is plausible, if
not preferable, to say that Amtrak can find that an acquisition is required when it is a useful and appropriate way to
accomplish its goals.

The Commission's interpretation is consistent also with
the 1990 statutory addition enacted by Congress. While the
amendment does not modify the specific language of $ 562(d)
at issue here, it confirms the ICC's view. The interpretation given to $ 562(d) by the Court of Appeals and B&M,
on the other hand, would make the amendment superfluous,
because if the word "required" has the strict meaning they
seek to attribute to it, condemnations by Amtrak would seem
to be barred whenever Amtrak's purpose is to reconvey the
property.

Contrary to the position of the dissent, we are not "deferring to what we imagine an agency had in mind." Post, at

Opinion of the Court

428. Rather, we defer to an interpretation which was a nec-essary presupposition of the ICC's decision. We recognize

the well-established rule that an agency's action may not beupheld on grounds other than those relied on by the agency.
SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 88 (1943). But the fact
that the ICC did not in so many words articulate its interpre-tation of the word "required" does not mean that we may

not defer to that interpretation, since the only reasonablereading of the Commission's opinion, and the only plausible
explanation of the issues that the Commission addressedafter considering the factual submissions by all of the parties, is that the ICC's decision was based on the proffered
interpretation. Chenery does not require a remand under
those circumstances. It is noteworthy in this regard that
neither party contends the ICC's decision was not informed
and governed by this statutory interpretation. B&M's primary argument to the Court is that the word required must
mean necessary. Brief for Respondent B&M 16, 22, 44.
But this, as we have said, is quite inconsistent with the statutory presumption of need to which the ICC gave effect.

There is no dispute on this record that Amtrak intends to
use the condemned track for its Montrealer service. Under
the ICC's view that use is sufficient to satisfy the statutory
command that the rail property be "required for intercity
rail passenger service." This is a reasonable interpretation
and application of the RPSA. And it ends the judicial inquiry on this point.

What we have said also answers Judge Ginsburg's concern
that the ICC must make specific findings regarding Amtrak's
actual need for the condemnation. The contention that such
a finding was necessary, to implement the statutory criterion
that the property be "required for intercity rail passenger
service," was the basis for Judge Ginsburg's concurrence in
the Court of Appeals. 286 U. S. App. D. C., at 12, 911 F. 2d,
at 754. That position, however, appears to be based on the
same interpretation of the word "required" as that adopted

503us2$54L 11-14-95 19:31:03 PAGES OPINPGT

421Cite as: 503 U. S. 407 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
by the Court of Appeals' majority, and so is inconsistent withthe ICC's interpretation. The ICC contends that the factual

finding is not mandated. It argues that the structure of thestatute, combined with the presumption created by the statute of Amtrak's need for the property sought, creates a
strong inference that the statute authorizes Amtrak to makea reasonable business judgment that condemnation of the

property is advisable. We agree. The ICC's oversight re-sponsibility, exercised by enforcing the "required for intercity rail passenger service" language as interpreted by theCommission, is limited to ensuring that the condemned property will be used in Amtrak's rail operations. The further
determination of need is delegated to Amtrak, unless the
statutory presumption is rebutted; and it is not rebutted
here. Indeed, as our discussion above indicates, supra, at
418-419, it seems to us that any other interpretation may be
inconsistent with the statutory presumption of need. In all
events, the ICC's interpretation is a reasonable one, and we
may not substitute a different view.

Arguing against the ICC's interpretation, B&M cites to us
cases such as United States v. Carmack, 329 U. S. 230, 243,
n. 13 (1946), which suggest that delegations of eminent domain power to private entities are of a limited nature. We
do not believe that argument has any relevance here because
Amtrak does not exercise eminent domain power under

$ 562(d). Rather, the statute gives that power to the ICC, a
Government agency. To be sure, the statute creates a presumption in favor of conveyance to Amtrak. But the ICC
must assess the impact of any condemnation and make a
determination as to just compensation. Since $ 562(d) is a
proper exercise of regulatory authority, and the ICC's oversight of Amtrak is intended to ensure compliance with the
statute, the eminent domain power here is not private.

Furthermore, this case turns on the need for deference to
the ICC, not Amtrak. There is nothing in the cases B&M
cites contradicting the rule of judicial deference to an

503us2$54L 11-14-95 19:31:03 PAGES OPINPGT
422 NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION v.

BOSTON & MAINE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

agency's statutory interpretation, even when the statute is
one authorizing condemnation of private property. In short,
the principle advanced by B&M does not prevail over Chevron's rule of deference.

We also reject B&M's constitutional objections. B&M
claims that $ 562(d) as interpreted by the Commission violates the "public use" requirement of the Fifth Amendment's
Takings Clause, because the transaction leaves unchanged
the use made by Amtrak of the condemned track. B&M's
position cannot be reconciled with our precedents. We have
held that the public use requirement of the Takings Clause
is coterminous with the regulatory power, and that the
Court will not strike down a condemnation on the basis that
it lacks a public use so long as the taking "is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose." Hawaii Housing
Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229, 240-241 (1984); see also
Berman v. Parker, 348 U. S. 26, 32-34 (1954). In Midkiff
we upheld land reform legislation which authorized condemnations for the specific purpose of transferring ownership to
another private party, in order to eliminate a land oligopoly.
In Berman we permitted land condemnations which contemplated reselling the land to redevelopers, as part of a plan to
restore dilapidated sections of the District of Columbia. In
both Midkiff and Berman, as in the present case, condemnation resulted in the transfer of ownership from one private
party to another, with the basic use of the property by the
government remaining unchanged. The Court held these
exercises of the condemnation power to be constitutional, as
long as the condemning authorities were rational in their positions that some public purpose was served. Those holdings control here, for there can be no serious argument that
the ICC was irrational in determining that the condemnation
will serve a public purpose by facilitating Amtrak's rail service. That suffices to satisfy the Constitution, and we need
not make a specific factual determination whether the con503us2$54L 11-14-95 19:31:03 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
demnation will accomplish its objectives. Midkiff, supra,at 242-243.

As a last effort, B&M argues that this matter must beremanded to the ICC because the Commission did not make
adequate and accurate findings regarding several different
matters. B&M claims that Amtrak failed to prove the par-ties were " `unable' to agree" on terms of sale. In B&M's

view, $ 562(d) demands that Amtrak engage in "good faith . . .negotiations" before it may invoke its condemnation powers.
Brief for Respondent B&M 42. The ICC construed the lan-guage of $ 562(d) in a more narrow fashion, to mandate nothing more than a factual determination that the parties will
not be able to reach agreement through further negotiations.
App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 90-1419, pp. 130a-131a ("Nothing in this record provides any indication that Amtrak and
B&M will ever reach agreement on terms of sale"). This is
a reasonable interpretation of the phrase "unable to agree
upon terms for the sale," and we do not substitute a different
view. Thus the Commission did not err in concluding that
this statutory prerequisite was satisfied.

B&M argues further that the ICC made inadequate factual
findings in concluding: (1) that this conveyance will not significantly impair B&M's ability to carry out its obligations
as a common carrier, $ 562(d)(1)(A); and (2) that Amtrak's
obligations cannot be met by the acquisition of alternative
property, $ 562(d)(1)(B). As to significant impairment, B&M's
argument, like the decision of the Court of Appeals on this
point, 286 U. S. App. D. C., at 8-9, 911 F. 2d, at 750-751, relies
on the notion that in assessing impairment the ICC may consider only the conveyance itself, not any mitigating measures
adopted in response to the conveyance, such as the grant of
trackage rights to B&M. We find no basis in the text or
structure of $ 562(d) for this position and cannot say that the
statute must be interpreted to mandate such a restrictive
inquiry. The ICC was not unreasonable in considering the
effect of the "trackage rights" agreements and the just com503us2$54L 11-14-95 19:31:03 PAGES OPINPGT

White, J., dissenting

pensation award in assessing significant impairment; and theICC's conclusion, that B&M's ability to carry out its common

carrier obligations will not be impaired by the transaction inany significant way, is supported by substantial evidence.
As to the availability of alternative property, the ICC inter-preted that provision as referring only to whether Amtrak
could provide service using an alternative route, not whethera lesser interest in property would suffice to meet Amtrak's
needs. Again, this was a reasonable reading to which wedefer. Since B&M would have to prevail on both the significant impairment and alternative property issues to rebutAmtrak's presumption of need, there can be no doubt that
the ICC's finding that Amtrak established its need for theproperty must be affirmed.

III
For the reasons we have stated, we hold that the ICC didnot exceed its authority in ordering conveyance of the 48.8-

mile segment of the Conn River Line from B&M to Amtrak.Because of its contrary holding on this point, the Court of
Appeals did not address the parties' challenges to the ICC'sjust compensation finding as well as certain other issues.
Id., at 11, 911 F. 2d, at 753. These questions should be re-solved on remand. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceed-ings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The majority opinion proceeds from the well-establishedprinciple that courts should defer to permissible agency interpretations of ambiguous legislation.1 Chevron U. S. A.

that $ 402(d) of the Rail Passenger Service Act (RPSA), 45 U. S. C. $ 562(d),

680, 696-697 (1991). I have no quarrel with that generalproposition. I do, however, object to its invocation to justify
the majority's deference, not to an agency interpretation ofa statute, but to the

post hoc rationalization of Governmentlawyers attempting to explain a gap in the reasoning and

factfinding of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC orCommission). Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,
Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,50 (1983).

Section 402(d) of the RPSA, codified at 45 U. S. C. $ 562(d),provides that Amtrak may apply to the ICC for an order
directing the conveyance of another railroad's property ifAmtrak can meet two conditions: Amtrak and the other railroad must be unable to agree upon terms for sale of the prop-erty, and the property must be "required for intercity rail
passenger service." If these conditions are met, "the needof [Amtrak] for the property shall be deemed to be established," and the other railroad will be able to retain its prop-erty only if it can rebut the strong presumption of Amtrak's
need. Ibid.Because conferring upon Amtrak the presumption of need
will determine the outcome of most disputes under this sec-tion, the two conditions that Amtrak must establish to receive the benefit of the presumption assume particular im-portance. However, in the present case, the ICC failed to
address one of these factors. Although the Commission de-termined that the parties had been unable to come to terms
for sale of the disputed property, see App. to Pet. for Cert.in No. 90-1419, pp. 130a-131a, it neither interpreted nor
applied the second condition, that the property be "required
rangement between Amtrak and the Central Vermont Railroad. Legislation passed while this case was pending before the Court of Appeals makes
it clear that such transactions are permissible. Independent Safety Board

for intercity rail passenger service." Instead, after reject-ing respondent Boston & Maine Corporation's argument that

Amtrak could restore Montrealer service by obtaining track-age rights or an easement, the ICC simply concluded that
"Amtrak has demonstrated sufficient reason to justify acqui-sition of ownership of the line."

Id., at 43a.The majority acknowledges that "the ICC's opinion is not

explicit in all of its details," see ante, at 418, but neverthelessconcludes that the Commission's reading of the statute is
entitled to deference because it "gave effect to the statutorypresumption of Amtrak's need for the track, and in so doing
implemented and interpreted the statute in a manner thatcomports with its words and structure."

Ibid. But thisbegs the question of what showing Amtrak must make to

establish that the track is "required" so that Amtrak maytherefore obtain the benefit of the presumption of need.

The simple fact is that the ICC never addressed this point,and therefore failed to construe a key portion of the statute.
The omission is particularly significant because this is thefirst action treating Amtrak's condemnation powers under

$ 402(d) of the Act; it will guide future adjudications.Rather than acknowledging the ICC's omission and remanding for clarification and factfinding, the majority relieson the Government's argument that the Commission must
have interpreted the word "required" as meaning "useful orappropriate."

Ibid. But this interpretation was not devel-oped by the ICC during its administrative proceedings. Indeed, the explanation was not even proposed in the Com-mission's argument to the Court of Appeals.

2 This ICC

2 This is how the Commission framed its argument to the Court of
Appeals:

"Under Chevron [U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984)], the Commission had broad discretion to interpret RPSA in this proceeding. This is certainly true with regard to the
central issu[e] of determining . . . what must be shown to justify a taking
under section 402(d) . . . . As to [this] issue, the statute merely states
that Amtrak's need for the property will be presumed unless the transfer
will significantly impair the ability of the carrier to carry out its common

White, J., dissenting
definition of "required" debuted in the Commission's briefsbefore this Court. It is nothing more than a creation of appellate counsel, concocted to fill the gaps in the Commission'sanalysis. "The short--and sufficient--answer to [this] submission is that the courts may not accept appellate counsel's
post hoc rationalizations for agency action. . . . It is wellestablished that an agency's action must be upheld, if at all,

on the basis articulated by the agency itself." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., supra, at 50 (emphasis added), citing Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168
(1962); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194, 196-197 (1947);
American Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S.
490, 539 (1981). Therefore, the majority is simply wrong in
asserting that, even though "the ICC did not in so many
words articulate its interpretation of the word `required,' "
the Court may nevertheless defer to the Commission's decision. See ante, at 420 (emphasis added).

Because of the gap in the ICC's interpretation of the statute, "[t]here are no findings and no analysis here to justify
the choice made, no indication of the basis on which the Commission exercised its expert discretion." Burlington Truck
Lines, Inc., supra, at 167. The majority concludes, again
based on the agency's presumed interpretation of the statute, that the Commission was not obligated to make specific
findings as to whether the property was " `required for intercity rail passenger service.' " See ante, at 420. This magnifies the ICC's mistake; an administrative "agency must
make findings that support its decision, and those findings
must be supported by substantial evidence." Burlington
Truck Lines, Inc., 371 U. S., at 168.

Deferring to a federal agency's construction of the legislation that it is charged with administering is one thing. But
deferring to inferences derived from reading between the
lines of an agency decision or excerpted from the brief of

carrier obligations and Amtrak's needs can be met with alternative property." Joint Brief for Respondents in No. 88-1631 (CADC), pp. 15-16.

a Government lawyer is another matter entirely. "For thecourts to substitute their or counsel's discretion for that of

the Commission is incompatible with the orderly functioningof the process of judicial review." Id., at 169. Because the
ICC has failed to provide a clear, authoritative constructionof "required for intercity rail passenger service," we should
return this case to the Commission so that the agency cando its job properly. But we should not strain the

Chevronprinciple by deferring to what we imagine an agency had in

mind when it applied a statute. Therefore, I respectfullydissent.

ROBERTSON, CHIEF, UNITED STATES FORESTSERVICE,

et al. v. SEATTLE AUDUBONSOCIETY

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 90-1596. Argued December 2, 1991--Decided March 25, 1992
Respondent environmental groups filed separate lawsuits challenging

proposed timber harvesting in certain forests managed by the United
States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
These forests are home to the northern spotted owl, an endangered species. Between them, the two lawsuits alleged violations of five federal
statutes. The lower courts preliminarily enjoined some of the challenged harvesting. In response to this ongoing litigation, Congress
enacted $ 318 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 1990, also known as the Northwest Timber Compromise. Section 318 both required harvesting and expanded harvesting
restrictions. Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) prohibited harvesting altogether in various designated areas, and subsection (b)(6)(A) stated in
part that "Congress hereby determines and directs that management
[of the forests] according to subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) . . . is adequate
consideration for the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements
that are the basis for [the two cases,]" which were identified by name
and caption number. Both District Courts rejected respondents' claims
that subsection (b)(6)(A) violated Article III of the Constitution by purporting to direct results in two pending cases. The Court of Appeals
reversed, holding the provision unconstitutional under United States v.
Klein, 13 Wall. 128, on the ground that Congress directed a particular
decision in the cases without repealing or amending the statutes underlying the litigation.

Held: Subsection (b)(6)(A) does not violate Article III. Pp. 437-441.

(a) The provision compelled changes in law, not results under old law,
by replacing the legal standards underlying the two original cases with
those set forth in subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5). Before its enactment,
respondents' claims would fail only if the challenged harvesting violated
none of the provisions of the five statutes that formed the basis for
the original lawsuits. Under subsection (b)(6)(A), however, the claims
would fail if the harvesting satisfied both of two new provisions. Thus,
subsection (b)(6)(A)'s operation modified the old provisions. Moreover,

503us2$55z 11-16-95 13:21:35 PAGES OPINPGT
430 ROBERTSON v. SEATTLE AUDUBON SOC.

Syllabus
there is nothing in the subsection that purported to direct any particular
findings of fact or applications of law to fact. Section 318 reserved
judgment on the lawfulness of the timber sales under old law. It did
not instruct the courts whether any particular timber sales would violate subsections (b)(3) or (b)(5); and it could not instruct that any particular BLM timber sales were lawful, because subsection (b)(5) incorporated by reference the harvesting prohibitions imposed by a BLM
agreement not yet in existence when the Compromise was enacted.
Pp. 437-439.

(b) The three textual features of subsection (b)(6)(A) cited by respondents do not support their argument that the provision directed
findings under old law, rather than supplying new law. The inclusion
of the preface "Congress . . . directs that" does not undermine the conclusion that what Congress directed--to both courts and agencies--was
a change in law. Nor is it significant that the subsection deemed compliance with the new requirements to "mee[t]" the old requirements.
Although Congress could have modified the old laws directly, its enactment of an entirely separate statute modified the old laws through operation of the canon that specific provisions qualify general ones. Finally,
the subsection's explicit reference to the two pending cases served only
to identify the five statutory requirements that were the basis for those
cases. Pp. 439-440.

(c) The Court of Appeals' alternative holding that the provision could
not effect an implied modification of substantive law because it was embedded in an appropriations measure is also without merit. Congress
may amend a substantive law in an appropriations statute if it does so
clearly, see, e. g., United States v. Will, 449 U. S. 200, 222, and it did so
explicitly here. In addition, having determined that the provision
would be unconstitutional unless it modified previously existing law, the
court was obligated to impose that saving interpretation as long as it
was a possible one. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301
U. S. 1, 30. Pp. 440-441.

(d) Since subsection (b)(6)(A) did amend applicable law, there is no
reason to address the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Klein. The
argument of one of respondents' amici--that the provision is unconstitutional even if it amended law because it swept no more, or little more,
broadly than the range of applications at issue in the pending cases--
was not raised below, squarely considered by the Court of Appeals, or
advanced by respondents here. P. 441.

914 F. 2d 1311, reversed and remanded.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we must determine the operation of $ 318 ofthe Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990. I

This case arises out of two challenges to the Federal Gov-ernment's continuing efforts to allow the harvesting and sale
of timber from old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest.These forests are home to the northern spotted owl, a bird
listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of1973, 16 U. S. C. $ 1531 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. II), since
June 1990. See 55 Fed. Reg. 26114. Harvesting the for-ests, say environmentalists, would kill the owls. Restrictions on harvesting, respond local timber industries, woulddevastate the region's economy.

432 ROBERTSON v. SEATTLE AUDUBON SOC.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner Robertson is Chief of the United States ForestService, which manages 13 national forests in Oregon and

Washington known to contain the northern spotted owl. In1988, the Service amended its regional guide to prohibit
timber harvesting on certain designated areas within those
forests. Respondent Seattle Audubon Society ( joined byvarious other environmental groups) and the Washington

Contract Loggers Association ( joined by various other in-dustry groups) filed separate lawsuits in the District Court
for the Western District of Washington, complaining respec-tively that the amendment afforded the owl either too little
protection, or too much. Seattle Audubon alleged violations
of three federal statutes: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act
(MBTA), 40 Stat. 755, ch. 128, as amended, 16 U. S. C. $ 703
et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. II); the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, as amended, 42
U. S. C. $ 4321 et seq.; and the National Forest Management
Act of 1976 (NFMA), 90 Stat. 2949, as amended, 16 U. S. C.

$ 1600 et seq. The District Court consolidated the actions
and preliminarily enjoined 163 proposed timber sales. Seattle Audubon Soc. v. Robertson, No. 89-160 (WD Wash., Mar.
24, 1989).

Petitioner Lujan is Secretary of the Department of
the Interior. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an
agency within the Department, manages several old-growth
forests in western Oregon. Between 1979 and 1983, the
BLM developed timber management plans that permitted
harvesting on some areas within these forests and prohibited
it on others. In 1987, the BLM and the Oregon Department
of Fish and Wildlife executed an agreement that expanded
the areas on which harvesting was prohibited. Also in 1987,
respondent Portland Audubon Society (among others) filed
suit in the District Court for the District of Oregon, challenging certain proposed harvesting under four federal statutes: MBTA; NEPA; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 90 Stat. 2744, as amended, 43

Opinion of the Court
U. S. C. $ 1701 et seq.; and the Oregon-California RailroadLand Grant Act (OCLA), 50 Stat. 874, 43 U. S. C. $ 1181a.

Twice, the District Court dismissed the action. Twice be-fore reversing (on grounds not relevant here), the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit enjoined some of the chal-lenged harvesting pending appeal. See

Portland AudubonSoc. v. Lujan, 884 F. 2d 1233, 1234 (1989), cert. denied, 494

U. S. 1026 (1990); Portland Audubon Soc. v. Hodel, 866 F. 2d302, 304, cert. denied sub nom. Northwest Forest Resource
Council v. Portland Audubon Soc., 492 U. S. 911 (1989).In response to this ongoing litigation, Congress enacted

$ 318 of the Department of the Interior and Related AgenciesAppropriations Act, 1990, 103 Stat. 745, popularly known as
the Northwest Timber Compromise. The Compromise es-tablished a comprehensive set of rules to govern harvesting
within a geographically and temporally limited domain. Byits terms, it applied only to "the thirteen national forests in
Oregon and Washington and [BLM] districts in western Ore-gon known to contain northern spotted owls." $ 318(i). It
expired automatically on September 30, 1990, the last day offiscal year 1990, except that timber sales offered under $ 318
were to remain subject to its terms for the duration of theapplicable sales contracts. $ 318(k).

The Compromise both required harvesting and expandedharvesting restrictions. Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) required the Forest Service and the BLM respectively to offerfor sale specified quantities of timber from the affected lands
before the end of fiscal year 1990. On the other hand, sub-sections (b)(3) and (b)(5) prohibited harvesting altogether
from various designated areas within those lands, expandingthe applicable administrative prohibitions and then codifying
them for the remainder of the fiscal year.1 In addition, sub1 Subsection (b)(3) provided:
"No timber sales offered pursuant to this section from the thirteen national forests in Oregon and Washington known to contain northern spotted owls may occur within [spotted owl habitat areas (SOHA's)] identified

sections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(4) specified general environmental criteria to govern the selection of harvesting sites by
the Forest Service. Subsection (g)(1) provided for limited,
expedited judicial review of individual timber sales offered
under $ 318.

This controversy centers around the first sentence of subsection (b)(6)(A), which stated in part:

"[T]he Congress hereby determines and directs that
management of areas according to subsections (b)(3) and

pursuant to the Final Supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement
for an Amendment to the Pacific Northwest Regional Guide--Spotted Owl

"(A) For the Olympic Peninsula Province, which includes the Olympic
National Forest, SOHA size is to be 3,200 acres;

"(B) For the Washington Cascades Province, which includes the Mt.

"(E) For the Klamath Mountain Province, which includes the Siskiyou
National Forest, SOHA size is to be 1,250 acres.

"(F) All other standards and guidelines contained in the Chief's Record

Subsection (b)(5) provided:

"No timber sales offered pursuant to this section on Bureau of Land
Mangagement lands in western Oregon known to contain northern spotted
owls shall occur within the 110 areas identified in the December 22, 1987
agreement, except sales identified in said agreement, between the Bureau
of Land Management and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Not later than thirty days after enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Land
Management, after consulting with the Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to identify high
priority spotted owl area sites, shall select an additional twelve spotted
owl habitat areas. No timber sales may be offered in the areas identified
pursuant to this subsection during fiscal year 1990."

436 ROBERTSON v. SEATTLE AUDUBON SOC.

Opinion of the Court
plaintiffs resisted on the ground that the first sentence of
subsection (b)(6)(A), because it purported to direct the results in two pending cases, violated Article III of the Constitution. In Seattle Audubon, the District Court held that
subsection (b)(6)(A) "can and must be read as a temporary
modification of the environmental laws." Seattle Audubon
Soc. v. Robertson, No. 89-160 (WD Wash., Nov. 14, 1989).
Under that construction, the court upheld the provision as
constitutional and therefore vacated its preliminary injunction. Nonetheless, the court retained jurisdiction to determine whether the challenged harvesting would violate $ 318
(if done in fiscal year 1990) or other provisions (if done later).
In Portland Audubon, the District Court likewise upheld
subsection (b)(6)(A), but dismissed the action entirely (without prejudice to future challenges arising after fiscal year
1990). Portland Audubon Soc. v. Lujan, No. 87-1160 (Ore.,
Dec. 21, 1989).

The Ninth Circuit consolidated the ensuing appeals and
reversed. 914 F. 2d 1311 (1990). The court held that the
first sentence of $ 318(b)(6)(A) "does not, by its plain language, repeal or amend the environmental laws underlying
this litigation," but rather "directs the court to reach a specific result and make certain factual findings under existing
law in connection with two [pending] cases." Id., at 1316.
Given that interpretation, the court held the provision unconstitutional under United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128
(1872), which it construed as prohibiting Congress from "direct[ing] . . . a particular decision in a case, without repealing
or amending the law underlying the litigation." 914 F. 2d,
at 1315. The Ninth Circuit distinguished this Court's decision in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co.,
18 How. 421 (1856), which it construed as permitting Congress to "amend or repeal any law, even for the purpose
of ending pending litigation." 914 F. 2d, at 1315 (emphasis
in original).

On remand, the plaintiffs renewed their original claims.In Seattle Audubon, the District Court enjoined under

NFMA 16 timber sales offered by the Forest Service duringfiscal year 1990 in order to meet its harvesting quota under

District Court proceedings were ongoing, the agenciesjointly sought review of the Ninth Circuit's judgment that
the first sentence of subsection (b)(6)(A) was unconstitu-tional. We granted certiorari, 501 U. S. 1249 (1991), and
now reverse.3 II

The first sentence of subsection (b)(6)(A) provided that"management of areas according to subsections (b)(3) and
(b)(5) . . . is adequate consideration for the purpose of meet-ing the statutory requirements that are the basis for

[SeattleAudubon] and [Portland Audubon]." The Ninth Circuit

held that this language did not "amend" any previously exist-ing "laws," but rather "direct[ed]" certain "factual findings"
and "specific result[s]" under those laws. 914 F. 2d, at 1316.Petitioners interpret the provision differently. They argue
that subsection (b)(6)(A) replaced the legal standards under-lying the two original challenges with those set forth in
subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5), without directing particular ap-plications under either the old or the new standards. We
agree.We describe the operation of subsection (b)(6)(A) by example. The plaintiffs in both cases alleged violations of MBTA$ 2, 16 U. S. C. $ 703, which makes it unlawful to "kill" or
"take" any "migratory bird." Before the Compromise was

the BLM appears moot. We decide the case, however, because there remains a live controversy between Seattle Audubon and the Forest Service
over the 16 sales offered during fiscal year 1990 and still enjoined under
the NFMA.

enacted, the courts adjudicating these MBTA claims wereobliged to determine whether the challenged harvesting

would "kill" or "take" any northern spotted owl, within themeaning of $ 2.

4 Subsection (b)(6)(A), however, raised the

question whether the harvesting would violate different pro-hibitions--those described in subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5).

If not, then the harvesting would constitute "management. . . according to" subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5), and would
therefore be deemed to "mee[t]" MBTA $ 2 regardless ofwhether or not it would cause an otherwise prohibited killing
or taking. Thus under subsection (b)(6)(A), the agenciescould satisfy their MBTA obligations in either of two ways:
by managing their lands so as neither to "kill" nor "take"any northern spotted owl within the meaning of $ 2, or by
managing their lands so as not to violate the prohibitions ofsubsections (b)(3) and (b)(5). Subsection (b)(6)(A) operated
identically as well upon all provisions of NEPA, NFMA,FLPMA, and OCLA that formed "the basis for" the original lawsuits.We conclude that subsection (b)(6)(A) compelled changes in
law, not findings or results under old law. Before subsection(b)(6)(A) was enacted, the original claims would fail only if
the challenged harvesting violated none of five old pro-visions. Under subsection (b)(6)(A), by contrast, those
same claims would fail if the harvesting violated neither oftwo new provisions. Its operation, we think, modified the
old provisions. Moreover, we find nothing in subsection(b)(6)(A) that purported to direct any particular findings of
fact or applications of law, old or new, to fact. For chal-lenges to sales offered before or after fiscal year 1990, subsection (b)(6)(A) expressly reserved judgment upon "thelegal and factual adequacy" of the administrative documents
authorizing the sales. For challenges to sales offered dur-ing fiscal year 1990, subsection (g)(1) expressly provided

Opinion of the Court
for judicial determination of the lawfulness of those sales.Section 318 did not instruct the courts whether any particular timber sales would violate subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5),just as the MBTA, for example, does not instruct the courts
whether particular sales would "kill" or "take" any northern
spotted owl. Indeed, $ 318 could not instruct that any par-ticular BLM timber sales were lawful under the new standards, because subsection (b)(5) incorporated by reference theharvesting prohibitions imposed by a BLM agreement not
yet in existence when the Compromise was enacted. Seen. 1,

supra.
Respondents cite three textual features of subsection
(b)(6)(A) in support of their conclusion that the provision
failed to supply new law, but directed results under old law.
First, they emphasize the imperative tone of the provision,
by which Congress "determine[d] and direct[ed]" that compliance with two new provisions would constitute compliance
with five old ones. Respondents argue that "Congress was
directing the subsection [only] at the courts." Brief for Respondents Seattle Audubon Society et al. 34. Petitioners,
for their part, construe the subsection as "a directive [only]
to the Forest Service and BLM." Brief for Petitioners 30.
We think that neither characterization is entirely correct.
A statutory directive binds both the executive officials who
administer the statute and the judges who apply it in particular cases--even if (as is usually the case) Congress fails to
preface its directive with an empty phrase like "Congress
. . . directs that." Here, we fail to see how inclusion of the
"Congress . . . directs that" preface undermines our conclusion that what Congress directed--to agencies and courts
alike--was a change in law, not specific results under old law.

Second, respondents argue that subsection (b)(6)(A) did
not modify old requirements because it deemed compliance
with new requirements to "mee[t]" the old requirements.
We fail to appreciate the significance of this observation.
Congress might have modified MBTA directly, for example,

503us2$55z 11-16-95 13:21:35 PAGES OPINPGT
440 ROBERTSON v. SEATTLE AUDUBON SOC.

Opinion of the Court
in order to impose a new obligation of complying either withthe current $ 2 or with subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5). Instead, Congress enacted an entirely separate statute deem-ing compliance with subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) to constitute
compliance with $ 2--a "modification" of the MBTA, we conclude, through operation of the canon that specific provisionsqualify general ones, see,

e. g., Simpson v. United States, 435
U. S. 6, 15 (1978). As explained above, each formulationwould have produced an identical task for a court adjudicating the MBTA claims--determining either that the chal-lenged harvesting did not violate $ 2 as currently written or
that it did not violate subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5).

Finally, respondents emphasize that subsection (b)(6)(A)
explicitly made reference to pending cases identified by name
and caption number. The reference to Seattle Audubon and
Portland Audubon, however, served only to identify the five
"statutory requirements that are the basis for" those cases--
namely, pertinent provisions of MBTA, NEPA, NFMA,
FLPMA, and OCLA. Subsection (b)(6)(A) named two pending cases in order to identify five statutory provisions. To
the extent that subsection (b)(6)(A) affected the adjudication
of the cases, it did so by effectively modifiying the provisions
at issue in those cases.

In the alternative, the Ninth Circuit held that subsection
(b)(6)(A) "could not" effect an implied modification of substantive law because it was embedded in an appropriations
measure. See 914 F. 2d, at 1317. This reasoning contains
several errors. First, although repeals by implication are
especially disfavored in the appropriations context, see, e. g.,
TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 190 (1978), Congress nonetheless
may amend substantive law in an appropriations statute,
as long as it does so clearly. See, e. g., United States v.
Will, 449 U. S. 200, 222 (1980). Second, because subsection
(b)(6)(A) provided by its terms that compliance with certain
new law constituted compliance with certain old law, the
intent to modify was not only clear, but express. Third,

having determined that subsection (b)(6)(A) would be uncon-stitutional unless it modified previously existing law, the

court then became obliged to impose that "saving interpreta-tion," 914 F. 2d, at 1317, as long as it was a "possible" one.
See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 30(1937) ("[A]s between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by theother valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save
the act").We have no occasion to address any broad question of Article III jurisprudence. The Court of Appeals held that sub-section (b)(6)(A) was unconstitutional under

Klein because itdirected decisions in pending cases without amending any

law. Because we conclude that subsection (b)(6)(A) didamend applicable law, we need not consider whether this
reading of Klein is correct. The Court of Appeals statedadditionally that a statute would be constitutional under
Wheeling Bridge if it did amend law. Respondents' amicusPublic Citizen challenges this proposition. It contends that
even a change in law, prospectively applied, would be uncon-stitutional if the change swept no more broadly, or little more
broadly, than the range of applications at issue in the pendingcases. This alternative theory was neither raised below nor
squarely considered by the Court of Appeals; nor was itadvanced by respondents in this Court. Accordingly, we
decline to address it here. The judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

et al. v. MONTANA et al.

appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of montana

No. 91-860. Argued March 4, 1992--Decided March 31, 1992
Article I, $ 2, of the Constitution requires apportionment of Representatives among the States "according to their respective Numbers." A
1941 federal statute provides that after each decennial census "the
method known as the method of equal proportions" shall be used to
determine the number of Representatives to which each State is entitled. Application of that method to the 1990 census caused Montana to
lose one of its two seats in the House of Representatives. If it had
retained both seats, each district would have been closer to the ideal
size of a congressional district than the reapportioned single district.
The State and several of its officials (hereinafter Montana) sued appropriate federal defendants (hereinafter the Government) in the District
Court, alleging, inter alia, that the existing apportionment method
violates Article I, $ 2. A three-judge court, convened pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 2284, granted Montana summary judgment on this claim, holding the statute unconstitutional because the variance between the single
district's population and that of the ideal district could not be justified
under the "one-person, one-vote" standard developed in Wesberry v.
Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, and other intrastate districting cases.

Held: Congress exercised its apportionment authority within the limits

dictated by the Constitution. Pp. 447-466.

(a) The general admonition in Article I, $ 2, that apportionment be
made "according to [the States'] respective numbers" is constrained by
three constitutional requirements: the number of Representatives shall
not exceed one for every 30,000 persons; each State shall have at least one
Representative; and district boundaries may not cross state lines. In
light of those constraints and the problem of fractional remainders--i. e.,
the fractional portion of the number that results when the State's total
population is divided by the population of the ideal district must either be
disregarded or treated as equal to one Representative because each State
must be represented by a whole number of legislators--Congress has considered and either rejected or adopted various apportionment methods
over the years, the most recent method tried being the method of equal
proportions, also known as the "Hill Method." A National Academy of
Sciences committee recommended that method as the fairest of the five

Syllabus
methods the committee felt could lead to a workable solution to the fractional remainder problem. If Congress had chosen the method of the har-monic mean, also known as the "Dean Method," Montana would have received a second seat after the 1990 census. Pp. 447-456.(b) This Court rejects the Government's argument that Congress' selection of any of the alternative apportionment methods presents a "political question" that is not subject to judicial review under the standards setforth in

Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217. Significantly, the Government
does not suggest that all congressional decisions relating to apportionment are beyond judicial review, but merely argues that the DistrictCourt erred in concluding that the Constitution requires the greatest possible equality in the size of congressional districts, as measured by absolute deviation from ideal district size. Thus, the controversy here turnson the proper interpretation of the relevant constitutional provisions.

As in Baker itself and the apportionment cases that followed, the political
question doctrine does not place this kind of constitutional interpretationoutside the proper domain of the Judiciary. Pp. 456-459.

(c) Congress had ample power to enact the statutory procedure at issueand to apply the Hill Method after the 1990 census. It is by no means
clear that the facts here establish a violation of the Wesberry one-person,
one-vote standard. Although Montana's evidence demonstrated that ap-plication of the Dean Method would decrease the absolute deviation from

the ideal district size, it also would increase the relative difference between the ideal and the size of the districts both in Montana and in Wash-ington, the only State that would have lost a Representative under the

Dean Method. Wesberry's polestar of equal representation does not provide sufficient guidance to determine what is the better measure of in-equality. Moreover, while subsequent intrastate districting cases have

interpreted the Wesberry standard as imposing a burden on the States to
make a good-faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality, thatgoal is rendered illusory for the Nation as a whole by the constraints imposed by Article I, $ 2: the guarantee of a minimum of one Representativefor each State and the need to allocate a fixed number of indivisible Representatives among 50 States of varying populations. The constitutional
framework that generated the need for a compromise between the inter-ests of larger and smaller States must also delegate to Congress a measure

of discretion broader than that accorded to the States, and Congress' apparently good-faith decision to adopt the Hill Method commands far moredeference, particularly as it was made after decades of experience, experimentation, and debate, was supported by independent scholars, and has
been accepted for a half century. Pp. 459-466.

held that statute unconstitutional because it found that themethod of equal proportions resulted in an unjustified deviation from the ideal of equal representation.3 The Govern-ment's appeal from that holding requires us to consider the

I
The 1990 census revealed that the population of certainStates, particularly California, Florida, and Texas, had increased more rapidly than the national average. The appli-cation of the method of equal proportions to the 1990 census
caused 8 States to gain a total of 19 additional seats in theHouse of Representatives

4 and 13 States to lose an equal

number.5 Montana was one of those States. Its loss of oneseat cut its delegation in half and precipitated this litigation.

According to the 1990 census, the population of the 50States that elect the members of the House of Representatives is 249,022,783.6 The average size of the 435 congres-sional districts is 572,466. Montana's population of 803,655
forms a single congressional district that is 231,189 personslarger than the ideal congressional district. If it had retained its two districts, each would have been 170,638 per-sons smaller than the ideal district. In terms of absolute

The State of Montana, its Governor, Attorney General, andSecretary of State,

7 and the State's two Senators and Representatives (hereinafter collectively referred to as Montana)filed suit against appropriate federal defendants (the Government) in the United States District Court for the Districtof Montana, asserting that Montana was entitled to retain
its two seats. They alleged that the existing apportionmentmethod violates Article I, $ 2, of the Constitution because it
"does not achieve the greatest possible equality in the number of individuals per representative" 8 and also violates Ar-ticle I, $ 2, and Article I, $ 7, because reapportionment is effected "through application of a mathematical formula by theDepartment of Commerce and the automatic transmittal of
the results to the states" 9 rather than by legislation on whichMembers of Congress vote in the normal manner. A threejudge District Court, convened pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2284,
granted Montana's motion for summary judgment on thefirst claim.

10

The majority of the three-judge District Court decidedthat the principle of equal representation for equal numbers of people that was applied to intrastate districtingin

Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1 (1964), should also be
applied to the apportionment of seats among the States.Under that standard the only population variances that are

acceptable are those that "are unavoidable despite a goodfaith effort to achieve absolute equality, or for which justifi-cation is shown,"

Opinion of the Court
the population of Montana's single district and the ideal dis-trict could not be justified under that standard. The majority refused to accord deference to the congressional decisionto adopt the method of equal proportions in 1941 because
that decision was made without the benefit of this Court'slater jurisprudence adopting the "one-person, one-vote" rule.
Accordingly, the District Court entered a judgment declar-ing the statute void and enjoining the Government from effecting any reapportionment of the House of Representativespursuant to the method of equal proportions.

11

Circuit Judge O'Scannlain dissented. After noting thatCongress has used four different apportionment formulas

during the country's history, and that it is not possible tocreate 435 districts of equal size when each district must be
located entirely within a single State, he concluded that thegoal of any apportionment formula must be a " `practical approximation' " to a population-based allocation.12 He ana-lyzed the two formulae proposed by Montana and concluded
that the State had failed to demonstrate that either was bet-ter than the one that had been chosen by Congress.

method, that of "major fractions," demonstrated that the method of equal
proportions was unconstitutional. Massachusetts v. Mosbacher, Civ. Action No. 91-11234-WD (Mass., Feb. 20, 1992).

Opinion of the Court
ceed one for every 30,000 persons; each State shall have at
least one Representative; and district boundaries may not
cross state lines.14 Although the text of Article I determined the original apportionment that the Framers had
agreed upon,15 it did not explain how that specific allocation
had been made.

When Congress first confronted the task of apportionment
after the census of 1790 (and after Vermont and Kentucky
had been admitted to the Union), it considered using the constitutional minimum of 30,000 persons as the size of each district. Dividing that number into the total population of
3,615,920 indicated that the House of Representatives should
contain 120 members. When the number 30,000 was divided
into the population of individual States, each quotient was a
whole number with a fractional remainder. Thus, the use
of the 30,000 divisor for Connecticut's population of 236,841
indicated that it should have 7.89 Representatives, while
Rhode Island, with a population of 68,446, should have 2.28
Representatives. Because each State must be represented
by a whole number of legislators, it was necessary either to
disregard fractional remainders entirely or to treat some or
all of them as equal to a whole Representative.16

14 The first and second requirements are set forth explicitly in Article I,

$ 2, of the Constitution. The requirement that districts not cross state
borders appears to be implicit in the text and has been recognized by
continuous historical practice. See 775 F. Supp., at 1365, n. 4; id., at 1368
(O'Scannlain, J., dissenting).

15 Section 2, cl. 3, required an enumeration of the population to be made

within three years after the first meeting of Congress and provided that
"until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall
be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four,
Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three."

Opinion of the Court
In the first apportionment bill passed by Congress, an ad-ditional Representative was assigned to the nine States

whose quotas had the highest fractional remainders. Thus,Connecticut's quota of 7.89 gave it 8 and Rhode Island's
smaller remainder was disregarded, giving it only 2. Al-though that method was supported by Alexander Hamilton,
Thomas Jefferson persuaded President Washington to vetothe bill, in part because its allocation of eight Representatives to Connecticut exceeded the constitutional limit of onefor every 30,000 persons.

17

In response to that veto, Congress adopted a proposalsponsored by Thomas Jefferson that disregarded fractional

remainders entirely (thus giving Connecticut only sevenRepresentatives). To overcome the basis for the veto, the
size of the House was reduced from 120 to 105 members,giving each Representative an approximate constituency of
33,000 instead of 30,000 persons. Although both the totalnumber of Representatives and the size of their districts in17 See id., at 16-22. President Washington's veto message read as

"Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:

"I have maturely considered the act passed by the two Houses entitled
`An act for an Apportionment of Representatives among the several
States, according to the first Enumeration;' and I return it to your House,
wherein it originated, with the following objections:

"First. The Constitution has prescribed that Representatives shall be
apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers; and there is no one proportion or divisor which, applied to the respective numbers of the States, will yield the number and allotment of Representatives proposed by the bill.

"Second. The Constitution has also provided that the number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand; which restriction is, by the context, and by fair and obvious construction, to be applied
to the separate and respective numbers of the States; and the bill has
allotted to eight of the States more than one for every thirty thousand,

creased,18 Jefferson's method of disregarding fractional remainders was used after each of the next four censuses.
Today mathematicians sometimes refer to that method as the
"method of greatest divisors," and suggest that it tends to
favor large States over smaller States.19

In 1832, Congress considered, but did not adopt, a proposal
sponsored by John Quincy Adams that was the exact opposite of the Jefferson method. Instead of disregarding fractional remainders, Adams would have treated every fraction
as a unit. Thus, using the former example as a hypothetical,
both Connecticut and Rhode Island would have received one
more Representative under the Adams method than they actually received under the Jefferson method. The Adams
method is sometimes described as the "method of smallest
divisors" and is said to favor the smaller States.20 It has
never been endorsed by Congress.

In 1842, Congress abandoned the Jefferson method in favor
of an approach supported by Senator Daniel Webster. The
Webster method took account of fractional remainders that
were greater than one-half by allocating "one additional representative for each State having a fraction greater than one
moiety." 21 Thus, if that method had been used in 1790, Connecticut's quota of 7.89 would have entitled it to 8 Representatives, whereas Rhode Island, with a quota of 2.28,

would have received only 2. The Webster method is alsodescribed as the "method of major fractions."

In 1850, Congress enacted legislation sponsored by Repre-sentative Vinton endorsing the approach that had been sponsored by Alexander Hamilton after the first census.22 Al-though this method was used during the balance of the 19th
century, it occasionally seemed to produce paradoxical re-sults.

23 Congress rejected it in 1911, reverting to the Webster method. In that year Congress also passed legislationthat ultimately fixed the number of Representatives at 435.

24

After the 1920 census Congress failed to pass a reappor-tionment Act, but debates over the proper method of apportionment ultimately led to a request to the National Acad-emy of Sciences to appoint a committee of experts to review
the subject. That committee, composed of respected mathe-maticians, recommended the adoption of the "method of
equal proportions." Congress used that method in its ap22 Act of May 23, 1850, $$ 24-26, 9 Stat. 432-433. Under the Hamilton/
Vinton method, the Nation's population was divided by the size of the
House (set at 233 in 1850) to determine the ratio of persons per Representative. This ratio was then divided into the population of a State to
establish its quota. Each State would receive the number of Representatives corresponding to the whole number of the quota (ignoring the
fractional remainders). The remaining seats necessary to bring the nationwide total to the proper size (233 in 1850) would then be distributed
to the States with the largest fractional remainders. In practice, the
method was not strictly followed. See Balinski & Young 37; Chafee,
Congressional Reapportionment, 42 Harv. L. Rev. 1015, 1025 (1929).

23 The Hamilton/Vinton method was subject to the "Alabama paradox,"

a mathematical phenomenon in which a State's number of Representatives
may decrease when the size of the House is increased. See Balinski &
Young 38-40; Chafee, Congressional Reapportionment, 42 Harv. L. Rev.,
at 1026.

24 The 1911 statute actually specified 433 Representatives but authorized

an additional Representative for Arizona and New Mexico when they were
admitted to the Union. See 37 Stat. 13. Additional Representatives
were also authorized when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the Union
in 1959, but the number thereafter reverted to 435, where it has remained
ever since. See 72 Stat. 345; 73 Stat. 8.

in the 1941 statute at issue in this case.25

The report of the National Academy of Sciences committee
noted that Congress had properly rejected the Hamilton/
Vinton method, and concluded that the use of only five methods could lead to a workable solution of the fractional remainder problem.26 In the opinion of the committee mem25 Act of Nov. 15, 1941, $ 1, 55 Stat. 761-762, 2 U. S. C. $ 2a. That Act also
made the reapportionment process self-executing, eliminating the need for
Congress to enact an apportionment Act after each decennial census:

"(a) On the first day, or within one week thereafter, of the first regular
session of the Eighty-second Congress and of each fifth Congress thereafter, the President shall transmit to the Congress a statement showing the
whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed, as
ascertained under the seventeenth and each subsequent decennial census
of the population, and the number of Representatives to which each State
would be entitled under an apportionment of the then existing number of
Representatives by the method known as the method of equal proportions,
no State to receive less than one Member.

"(b) . . . It shall be the duty of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, within fifteen calendar days after the receipt of such statement, to
send to the executive of each State a certificate of the number of Representatives to which such State is entitled under this section."

26 The five were the "method of smallest divisors," the "method of the

harmonic mean," the "method of equal proportions," the "method of major
fractions," and the "method of greatest divisors." 1 App. 17.

Each of the methods corresponds to a different formula for producing a
"priority list." A priority list is the mechanical method used in modern
apportionments to translate a particular method of apportionment into a
particular assignment of Representatives. The technical process of forming the priority list proceeds as follows. First, one Representative is assigned to each State to satisfy the constitutional guarantee. Second, the
population of each State is divided by a certain tabulated series of divisors. Third, the quotients for all the States are arranged in a single series in order of size, beginning with the largest quotient, for the 51st Member of the House. This forms the priority list. The series of quotients is
different for each of the five apportionment methods. See Chafee, Congressional Reapportionment, 42 Harv. L. Rev., at 1029, n. 39.

The following are the divisors by which a State's population is divided
under each method ("n" is the number of the State's next seat):

the method of smallest divisors is employed, the 51st seat is assigned to
California, and the 52d seat is assigned to New York. Under the method
of greatest divisors, however, California is assigned both the 51st and the
52d seats because the quotient for its third seat is 9,946,417, which is
higher than the quotient for New York's second seat, which is 9,022,252.

tricts in any pair of States. Under their test of fairness, a
method was satisfactory if, for any pair of States, the transfer of one Representative would not decrease the discrepancy between those States' districts.27 The choice of a
method depended on how one decided to measure the discrepancy between district sizes. Each of the five methods
could be described as the "best" in the sense of minimizing
the discrepancy between districts, depending on the discrepancy measure selected. The method of the harmonic mean,
for example, yielded the fairest apportionment if the discrepancy was measured by the absolute difference between the
number of persons per Representative. The method of
major fractions was the best method if the discrepancy was
measured by the absolute difference between the number of
Representatives per person (also known as each person's
"share" of a Representative).28 The method of equal proportions produced the fairest apportionment if the discrepancy

27 The committee explained the test as follows:
"Let the population of a State be A and the number of Representatives
assigned to it according to a selected method of apportionment be a, and
let B and b represent the corresponding numbers for a second State.
Under an ideal apportionment the population A/a, B/b of the congressional
districts in the two States should be equal, as well as the numbers a/A,
b/B, of Representatives per person in each State. In practice it is impossible to bring this desirable result about for all pairs of States.

"In the opinion of the committee the best test of a desirable apportionment so far proposed is the following:

"An apportionment of Representatives to various States, when the total
number of Representatives is fixed, is mathematically satisfactory if for
every pair of States the discrepancy between the numbers A/a and B/b
cannot be decreased by assigning one or more Representative to the State
A and one fewer to the State B, or vice versa, or if the two numbers a/A
and b/B have the same property." 1 App. 18.

28 A person's "share" of a Representative is the reciprocal of the population of a person's district. For example, in an ideal district under the
1990 census, each person has a share of 1/572,466 of a Representative.

was measured by the "relative difference" 29 in either the size
of the district or the share of a Representative.30

The report concluded by endorsing the method of equal
proportions. The committee apparently preferred this
method for two reasons. First, the method of equal proportions minimized the relative difference both between the size
of congressional districts and between the number of Representatives per person. Second, in comparison with the
other four methods considered, this method occupied an intermediate position in terms of favoring small States over
large States: It favored small States more than major fractions and greatest divisors, but not as much as smallest divisors or the harmonic mean.31

If either the method of smallest divisors or the method of
the harmonic mean, also known as the "Dean Method," had
been used after the 1990 census, Montana would have received a second seat. Under the method of equal proportions, which was actually used, five other States had stronger
claims to an additional seat because Montana's claim to a
second seat was the 441st on the equal proportions "priority
list," see n. 26, supra.32 Montana would not have received

the smaller number from the larger number and then dividing the result

31 See id., at 19. The committee considered only the extent to which

each method favored the small or large States in comparison to the other
methods. The committee did not attempt to determine absolute bias.
Some scholars have asserted that in absolute terms, the method of equal
proportions favors small States over large States and that the method of
major fractions is the method with the least inherent bias between small
and large States. See Balinski & Young 72-78. That contention has
been disputed. See Massachusetts v. Mosbacher, Civ. Action No. 91-

III

The Government argues that Congress' selection of any
of the alternative apportionment methods involved in this
litigation is not subject to judicial review. Relying principally on Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), the Government
contends that the choice among these methods presents a
"political question" not amenable to judicial resolution.

In Baker v. Carr, after an extensive review of our prior
cases involving political questions, we concluded:

"It is apparent that several formulations which vary
slightly according to the settings in which the questions
arise may describe a political question, although each
has one or more elements which identify it as essentially
a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on
the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional
commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable
standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind
clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of
a court's undertaking independent resolution without
expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches
of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning
adherence to a political decision already made; or the
potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.

"Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from
the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of `political
questions,' not one of `political cases.' The courts cannot reject as `no law suit' a bona fide controversy as

Opinion of the Court
to whether some action denominated `political' exceedsconstitutional authority." Id., at 217.

The Government insists that each of the factors identifiedin Baker supports the conclusion that the question presented
here is committed to the "political branches" to the exclusionof the Judiciary. Significantly, however, the Government
does not suggest that all congressional decisions relating toapportionment are beyond judicial review. The Government does not, for instance, dispute that a court could setaside an apportionment plan that violated the constitutional
requirement that "[t]he number of Representatives shall notexceed one for every thirty Thousand."

33 Further, with respect to the provision that Representatives "shall be appor-tioned among the several States . . . according to their respective Numbers," 34 the Government acknowledges thatCongress has a judicially enforceable obligation to select an
apportionment plan that is related to population.35 The gra-vamen of the Government's argument is that the District
Court erred in concluding that the Constitution imposes themore rigorous requirement of greatest possible equality in
the size of congressional districts, as measured by absolutedeviation from ideal district size. The Government then
does not dispute Montana's contention that the Constitutionplaces substantive limitations on Congress' apportionment
power and that violations of those limitations would presenta justiciable controversy. Where the parties differ is in
their understanding of the content of these limitations. Inshort, the Government takes issue not with the existence of
a judicially enforceable right, but with the definition of sucha right.

When a court concludes that an issue presents a nonjusti-ciable political question, it declines to address the merits of

that issue. See Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10-12(1973); Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S., at 197; see also Colegrove v.

Green, 328 U. S. 549, 552-556 (1946) (plurality opinion). Ininvoking the political question doctrine, a court acknowledges the possibility that a constitutional provision may notbe judicially enforceable.

36 Such a decision is of course very

different from determining that specific congressional actiondoes not violate the Constitution.

37 That determination is a

decision on the merits that reflects the exercise of judicialreview, rather than the

abstention from judicial review thatwould be appropriate in the case of a true political question.

The case before us today is "political" in the same sensethat Baker v. Carr was a "political case." 369 U. S., at 217.
It raises an issue of great importance to the politicalbranches.

38 The issue has motivated partisan and sectional

debate during important portions of our history. Neverthe-less, the reasons that supported the justiciability of challenges to state legislative districts, as in Baker v. Carr, aswell as state districting decisions relating to the election of
Members of Congress, see, e. g., Wesberry v. Sanders, 376U. S. 1 (1964);

Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725 (1983), applywith equal force to the issues presented by this litigation.

The controversy between Montana and the Governmentturns on the proper interpretation of the relevant constitutional provisions. As our previous rejection of the politicalquestion doctrine in this context should make clear, the interpretation of the apportionment provisions of the Constitu-tion is well within the competence of the Judiciary. See

36 See Henkin, Is There a "Political Question" Doctrine?, 85 Yale L. J.

11. The political question doctrine presents no bar to ourreaching the merits of this dispute and deciding whether the
District Court correctly construed the constitutional provi-sions at issue.

Our previous apportionment cases concerned States' deci-sions creating legislative districts; today we review the actions of Congress. Respect for a coordinate branch of Gov-ernment raises special concerns not present in our prior
cases, but those concerns relate to the merits of the contro-versy rather than to our power to resolve it. As the issue
is properly raised in a case otherwise unquestionably withinour jurisdiction, we must determine whether Congress exercised its apportionment authority within the limits dictatedby the Constitution. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 940-
941 (1983); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 521 (1969).Without the need for another exploration of the Baker factors, it suffices to say that, as in Baker itself and the appor-tionment cases that followed, the political question doctrine
does not place this kind of constitutional interpretation out-side the proper domain of the Judiciary.

In Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1 (1964), the Court con-sidered the claim of voters in Fulton County, Georgia, that

the disparity between the size of their congressional district(823,680) and the average size of the 10 districts in Georgia
(394,312) deprived them of the right "to have their votes forCongressmen given the same weight as the votes of other
Georgians." Id., at 3. This Court upheld the claim, con-cluding that Article I, $ 2, had established a "high standard

of justice and common sense" for the apportionment of con-gressional districts: "equal representation for equal numbers
of people." 376 U. S., at 18. The constitutional commandthat Representatives be chosen "by the People of the several

Opinion of the Court
States" meant that "as nearly as is practicable one man'svote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as

another's." Id., at 7-8. Writing for the Court, JusticeBlack explained:

"It would defeat the principle solemnly embodied in theGreat Compromise--equal representation in the House
for equal numbers of people--for us to hold that, withinthe States, legislatures may draw the lines of congressional districts in such a way as to give some voters agreater voice in choosing a Congressman than others.
The House of Representatives, the Convention agreed,
was to represent the people as individuals, and on abasis of complete equality for each voter."

Id., at 14.

In subsequent cases, the Court interpreted that standard as
imposing a burden on the States to "make a good-faith effort
to achieve precise mathematical equality." Kirkpatrick v.
Preisler, 394 U. S., at 530-531; see also Karcher v. Daggett,
462 U. S., at 730.Our cases applying the

Wesberry standard have all involved disparities in the size of voting districts within thesame State. In this case, however, Montana contends, and

a majority of the District Court agreed, that the Wesberrystandard also applies to apportionment decisions made by
Congress and that it was violated because of an unjustified
variance between the population of Montana's single districtand the ideal district size.

Montana's evidence demonstrated that if Congress hadused the method of the harmonic mean, sometimes referred
to as the "Dean Method," instead of the method of equal
proportions, sometimes called the "Hill Method," to apportion the districts, 48 of the States would have received the
same number of Representatives, while Washington would
have received one less--eight instead of nine--and Montana
would have received one more. Under an apportionment
undertaken according to the Hill Method, the absolute differ503us2$56I 11-16-95 13:22:15 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ence between the population of Montana's single district
(803,655) and the ideal (572,466) is 231,189; the difference
between the average Washington district (543,105) and the
ideal is 29,361. Hence, the sum of the differences between
the average and the ideal district size in the two States is
260,550. Under the Dean Method, Montana would have two
districts with an average population of 401,838, representing
a deviation from the ideal of 170,638; Washington would then
have eight districts averaging 610,993, which is a deviation of 38,527 from the ideal district size. The sum of the
deviations from the ideal in the two States would thus be
209,165 under the Dean Method (harmonic mean), while it
is 260,550 under the Hill Method (equal proportions). More
generally, Montana emphasizes that the Dean Method is the
best method for minimizing the absolute deviations from
ideal district size.

There is some force to the argument that the same historical insights that informed our construction of Article I, $ 2,
in the context of intrastate districting should apply here as
well. As we interpreted the constitutional command that
Representatives be chosen "by the People of the several
States" to require the States to pursue equality in representation, we might well find that the requirement that Representatives be apportioned among the several States "according to their respective Numbers" would also embody the
same principle of equality. Yet it is by no means clear that
the facts here establish a violation of the Wesberry standard.
In cases involving variances within a State, changes in the
absolute differences from the ideal produce parallel changes
in the relative differences. Within a State, there is no theoretical incompatibility entailed in minimizing both the absolute and the relative differences. In this case, in contrast,
the reduction in the absolute difference between the size of
Montana's district and the size of the ideal district has the

Opinion of the Court
effect of increasing the variance in the relative difference 39between the ideal and the size of the districts in both Montana and Washington.40 Moreover, whereas reductions inthe variances among districts within a given State bring all
of the affected districts closer to the ideal, in this case achange that would bring Montana closer to the ideal pushes
the Washington districts away from that ideal.41

39 See n. 29, supra.
40 Under the Hill Method (equal proportions), the relative differences

between Montana's and Washington's districts and the ideal, respectively,
are 40.4% and 5.4%; under the Dean Method (harmonic mean), they are
42.5% and 6.7%. See 1 App. 27.

The absolute and relative differences between the actual average district size and the ideal district size in an apportionment using the Hill
Method (Montana has one Representative, and Washington has nine
Representatives) are as follows:

Absolute Relative
Average Difference Difference
District Size From Ideal From Ideal
Montana 803,655 231,189 40.4%
Washington 543,105 29,361 5.4%
Total Absolute Difference 260,550

The absolute and relative differences between the actual average district
size and the ideal district size in an apportionment using the Dean Method
(Montana has two Representatives, and Washington has eight Representatives) are as follows:

Absolute Relative
Average Difference Difference
District Size From Ideal From Ideal
Montana 401,828 170,638 42.5%
Washington 610,993 38,527 6.7%
Total Absolute Difference 209,165

The relative difference from the ideal is less both for Montana and for
Washington in a Hill apportionment; the total absolute difference from the
ideal is less in a Dean apportionment.

41 Indeed, as Washington has more districts than Montana, it could be

argued that deviation from ideal district size in Washington represents a
more significant departure from the goal of equal representation than does
a similar deviation in Montana. In his dissent in the District Court,
Judge O'Scannlain noted the potential importance of taking account of the

463Cite as: 503 U. S. 442 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
What is the better measure of inequality--absolute difference in district size, absolute difference in share of a Representative, or relative difference in district size or share?
Neither mathematical analysis nor constitutional interpretation provides a conclusive answer. In none of these alternative measures of inequality do we find a substantive principle
of commanding constitutional significance. The polestar of
equal representation does not provide sufficient guidance
to allow us to discern a single constitutionally permissible
course.

A State's compliance with Wesberry's "high standard of
justice and common sense" begins with a good-faith effort
to produce complete equality for each voter. As our cases
involving variances of only a fraction of one percent demonstrate, that goal is realistic and appropriate for state
districting decisions. See Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S., at
730-743. In this case, however, whether Montana has one
district or two, its variance from the ideal will exceed 40
percent.

The constitutional guarantee of a minimum of one Representative for each State inexorably compels a significant departure from the ideal. In Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming,
where the statewide districts are less populous than the ideal
district, every vote is more valuable than the national average. Moreover, the need to allocate a fixed number of indivisible Representatives among 50 States of varying populations makes it virtually impossible to have the same size
district in any pair of States, let alone in all 50. Accordingly,
although "common sense" supports a test requiring "a goodfaith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality" within
each State, Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S., at 530-531, the
constraints imposed by Article I, $ 2, itself make that goal
illusory for the Nation as a whole.

number of districts in a State, rather than merely the average size of a
district. See 775 F. Supp., at 1371.

Opinion of the Court
This commonsense understanding of a characteristic of our
Federal Government must have been obvious to the masters
of compromise who framed our Constitution. The spirit of
compromise that provided two Senators for every State and
Representatives of the People "according to their respective
Numbers" in the House must also have motivated the original allocation of Representatives specified in Article I, $ 2,
itself. Today, as then, some compromise between the interests of larger and smaller States must be made to achieve a
fair apportionment for the entire country.

The constitutional framework that generated the need for
compromise in the apportionment process must also delegate
to Congress a measure of discretion that is broader than that
accorded to the States in the much easier task of determining district sizes within state borders. Article I, $ 8, cl. 18,
expressly authorizes Congress to enact legislation that "shall
be necessary and proper" to carry out its delegated responsibilities. Its apparently good-faith choice of a method of apportionment of Representatives among the several States
"according to their respective Numbers" commands far more
deference than a state districting decision that is capable
of being reviewed under a relatively rigid mathematical
standard.42

42 Some evidence suggests that partisan political concerns may have influenced Congress' initial decision to adopt the equal proportions method
in 1941. The choice of this method resulted in the assignment of an additional seat to Arkansas, a Democratic State, rather than to Michigan, a
State with more Republican leanings. The vote to adopt equal proportions was along party lines (except for the Democrats from Michigan, who
opposed the bill). See Balinski & Young 57-58; see also 775 F. Supp., at

Opinion of the Court
The District Court suggested that the automatic charac-ter

43 of the application of the method of equal proportions

was inconsistent with Congress' responsibility to make afresh legislative decision after each census.

44 We find no

merit in this suggestion. Indeed, if a set formula is other-wise constitutional, it seems to us that the use of a procedure

that is administered efficiently and that avoids partisan con-troversy supports the legitimacy of congressional action,
rather than undermining it. To the extent that the poten-tially divisive and complex issues associated with apportionment can be narrowed by the adoption of both proceduraland substantive rules that are consistently applied year after
year, the public is well served, provided, of course, that anysuch rule remains open to challenge or change at any time.
We see no constitutional obstacle preventing Congress fromadopting such a sensible procedure.

The decision to adopt the method of equal proportions wasmade by Congress after decades of experience, experimentation, and debate about the substance of the constitutionalrequirement. Independent scholars supported both the
basic decision to adopt a regular procedure to be followed
after each census and the particular decision to use themethod of equal proportions.

45 For a half century the results of that method have been accepted by the States and

43 See n. 25, supra.

45 In his article Congressional Reapportionment, written in 1929, Zechariah Chafee, Jr., wrote:
"[B]oth mathematical and political reasons point to the Method of Equal
Proportions as the best plan for a just apportionment. . . . Congress has
power to delegate the task to the president or other high official, if the
size of the House and the method be definitely indicated. . . . It is very
desirable that this permanent plan should embody the best method now
known, so that it may operate for many decades without constant demands
for revision. Congress will then no longer need to engage in prolonged
debates and committee hearings every ten years. Reapportionment will
be taken out of politics." 42 Harv. L. Rev., at 1047.

FREEMAN et al. v. PITTS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 89-1290. Argued October 7, 1991--Decided March 31, 1992
In a class action filed by respondents, black schoolchildren and their parents, the District Court, in 1969, entered a consent order approving a
plan to dismantle the de jure segregation that had existed in the DeKalb
County, Georgia, School System (DCSS). The court retained jurisdiction to oversee implementation of the plan. In 1986, petitioner DCSS
officials filed a motion for final dismissal of the litigation, seeking a declaration that DCSS had achieved unitary status. Among other things,
the court found that DCSS "has travelled the . . . road to unitary status
almost to its end," noted that it had "continually been impressed by
[DCSS'] successes . . . and its dedication to providing a quality education
for all," and ruled that DCSS is a unitary system with regard to four of
the six factors identified in Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County,
391 U. S. 430: student assignments, transportation, physical facilities,
and extracurricular activities. In particular, the court found with respect to student assignments that DCSS had briefly achieved unitary
status under the court-ordered plan, that subsequent and continuing
racial imbalance in this category was a product of independent demographic changes that were unrelated to petitioners' actions and were
not a vestige of the prior de jure system, and that actions taken by
DCSS had achieved maximum practical desegregation from 1969 to
1986. Although ruling that it would order no further relief in the foregoing areas, the court refused to dismiss the case because it found that
DCSS was not unitary with respect to the remaining Green factors:
faculty assignments and resource allocation, the latter of which the
court considered in connection with a non-Green factor, the quality of
education being offered to the white and black student populations.
The court ordered DCSS to take measures to address the remaining
problems. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that a
district court should retain full remedial authority over a school system
until it achieves unitary status in all Green categories at the same time
for several years; that because, under this test, DCSS had never
achieved unitary status, it could not shirk its constitutional duties by
pointing to demographic shifts occurring prior to unitary status; and
that DCSS would have to take further actions to correct the racial imbalance, even though such actions might be "administratively awkward,

inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations," Swann v. CharlotteMecklenburg Bd. of Education, 402 U. S. 1, 28.

Held:

1. In the course of supervising a desegregation plan, a district court
has the authority to relinquish supervision and control of a school district in incremental stages, before full compliance has been achieved in
every area of school operations, and may, while retaining jurisdiction
over the case, determine that it will not order further remedies in areas
where the school district is in compliance with the decree. Pp. 485-492.

(a) Green held that the duty of a former de jure district is to take
all necessary steps to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination is eliminated, set forth factors that measure unitariness, and
instructed the district courts to fashion remedies that address all these
factors. Although the unitariness concept is helpful in defining the
scope of the district court's authority, the term "unitary" does not have
a fixed meaning or content and does not confine the court's discretion in
a way that departs from traditional equitable principles. Under such
principles, a court has the inherent capacity to adjust remedies in a
feasible and practical way to correct the constitutional violation, Swann,
supra, at 15-16, with the end purpose of restoring state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is operating in compliance, see, e. g., Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 280-281. Where
justified by the facts of the case, incremental or partial withdrawal of
judicial supervision and control in areas of compliance, and retention of
jurisdiction over the case with continuing supervision in areas of noncompliance, provides an orderly means for fulfilling this purpose. In
particular, the court may determine that it will not order further remedies in the area of student assignments where racial imbalance is not
traceable, in a proximate way, to constitutional violations. See Pasadena Bd. of Education v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 436. Pp. 485-491.

(b) Among the factors which must inform the court's discretion to
order the incremental withdrawal of its supervision in an equitable manner are the following: whether there has been full and satisfactory compliance with the decree in those aspects of the system where supervision
is to be withdrawn; whether retention of control is necessary or practicable to achieve compliance in other areas; and whether the school district has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and students of
the once disfavored race, its good-faith commitment to the whole of the
decree and to those statutory and constitutional provisions that were
the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance. In considering these factors a court should give particular attention to the school
system's record of compliance; i. e., whether its policies form a consistent

pattern of lawful conduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.
And with the passage of time the degree to which racial imbalances
continue to represent vestiges of a constitutional violation may diminish,
and the practicability and efficacy of various remedies can be evaluated
with more precision. Pp. 491-492.

2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that, as a matter of law,
the District Court had no discretion to permit DCSS to regain control
over student assignments and three other Green factors, while retaining supervision over faculty assignments and the quality of education.
Pp. 492-500.

(a) The District Court exercised its discretion appropriately in addressing the Green elements, inquiring into quality of education, and
determining whether minority students were being disadvantaged in
ways that required the formulation of new and further remedies in areas
of noncompliance. This approach illustrates that the Green factors
need not be a rigid framework and demonstrates the proper use of equitable discretion. By withdrawing control over areas where judicial supervision is no longer needed, a district court can concentrate its own
and the school district's resources on the areas where the effects of
de jure discrimination have not been eliminated and further action is
necessary. Pp. 492-493.

(b) The related premises underlying the Court of Appeals' rejection of the District Court's order--first, that given noncompliance in
some discrete categories, there can be no partial withdrawal of judicial
control; and second, until there is full compliance, Swann, supra, requires that heroic measures be taken to ensure racial balance in student
assignments system wide--are incorrect under this Court's analysis and
precedents. Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake, but
is to be pursued only when there is a causal link between an imbalance
and the constitutional violation. Once racial imbalance traceable to the
constitutional violation has been remedied, a school district is under no
duty to remedy an imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.
Id., at 31-32. The decree here accomplished its objective of desegregation in student assignments in the first year of its operation, and the
District Court's finding that the subsequent resegregation is attributable to independent demographic forces is credible. A proper rule must
be based on the necessity to find a feasible remedy that ensures systemwide compliance with the decree and that is directed to curing the effect
of the specific violation. Pp. 493-497.

(c) Resolution of the question whether retention of judicial control
over student attendance is necessary or practicable to achieve compliance in other facets of DCSS must await further proceedings on remand.
The District Court did not have this Court's analysis before it when

it addressed the faculty assignment problem, and specific findings and
conclusions should be made on whether student reassignments would be
a proper way to remedy the defect. Moreover, the District Court's
praise for DCSS' successes, dedication, and progress, and its failure to
find that DCSS had acted in bad faith or engaged in postdecree acts of
discrimination with respect to those areas where compliance had not
been achieved, may not be the equivalent of the necessary finding that
DCSS has an affirmative commitment to comply in good faith with the
entirety of the desegregation plan. Pp. 497-500.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
DeKalb County, Georgia, is a major suburban area of Atlanta. This case involves a court-ordered desegregation de-cree for the DeKalb County School System (DCSS). DCSS

now serves some 73,000 students in kindergarten throughhigh school and is the 32d largest elementary and secondary
school system in the Nation.DCSS has been subject to the supervision and jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia since 1969, when it was ordered to dismantle itsdual school system. In 1986, petitioners filed a motion for

final dismissal. The District Court ruled that DCSS had notachieved unitary status in all respects but had done so in
student attendance and three other categories. In its orderthe District Court relinquished remedial control as to those
aspects of the system in which unitary status had beenachieved, and retained supervisory authority only for those
aspects of the school system in which the district was not in
full compliance. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, 887 F. 2d 1438 (1989), holding that a district
court should retain full remedial authority over a school system until it achieves unitary status in six categories at the
same time for several years. We now reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals and remand, holding that a district
court is permitted to withdraw judicial supervision with respect to discrete categories in which the school district has
achieved compliance with a court-ordered desegregation
plan. A district court need not retain active control over
every aspect of school administration until a school district
has demonstrated unitary status in all facets of its system.

Opinion of the Court
Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301 (1955)
(Brown II), which ordered school districts to desegregate
with "all deliberate speed," DCSS was segregated by law.DCSS' initial response to the mandate of

Brown II was an
all too familiar one. Interpreting "all deliberate speed" as
giving latitude to delay steps to desegregate, DCSS took nopositive action toward desegregation until the 1966-1967

school year, when it did nothing more than adopt a freedomof choice transfer plan. Some black students chose to attend
former de jure white schools, but the plan had no significanteffect on the former

de jure black schools.
In 1968, we decided Green v. School Bd. of New Kent
County, 391 U. S. 430. We held that adoption of a freedom
of choice plan does not, by itself, satisfy a school district's
mandatory responsibility to eliminate all vestiges of a dual
system. Green was a turning point in our law in a further
respect. Concerned by more than a decade of inaction, we
stated that " `[t]he time for mere "deliberate speed" has run
out.' " Id., at 438, quoting Griffin v. Prince Edward County
School Bd., 377 U. S. 218, 234 (1964). We said that the obligation of school districts once segregated by law was to come
forward with a plan that "promises realistically to work, and
promises realistically to work now." 391 U. S., at 439
(emphasis in original). The case before us requires an understanding and assessment of how DCSS responded to the
directives set forth in Green.

Within two months of our ruling in Green, respondents,
who are black schoolchildren and their parents, instituted
this class action in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. After the suit was filed,
DCSS voluntarily began working with the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare to devise a comprehensive
and final plan of desegregation. The District Court, in June
1969, entered a consent order approving the proposed plan,
which was to be implemented in the 1969-1970 school year.
The order abolished the freedom of choice plan and adopted

473Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
a neighborhood school attendance plan that had been proposed by DCSS and accepted by the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare subject to a minor modification.
Under the plan all of the former de jure black schools were
closed, and their students were reassigned among the remaining neighborhood schools. The District Court retained jurisdiction.

Between 1969 and 1986, respondents sought only infrequent and limited judicial intervention into the affairs of
DCSS. They did not request significant changes in student attendance zones or student assignment policies. In
1976, DCSS was ordered to expand its Majority-to-Minority
(M-to-M) student transfer program, allowing students in a
school where they are in the majority race to transfer to a
school where they are in the minority; to establish a biracial
committee to oversee the transfer program and future
boundary line changes; and to reassign teachers so that the
ratio of black to white teachers in each school would be, in
substance, similar to the racial balance in the school population systemwide. From 1977 to 1979, the District Court
approved a boundary line change for one elementary school
attendance zone and rejected DCSS proposals to restrict the
M-to-M transfer program. In 1983, DCSS was ordered to
make further adjustments to the M-to-M transfer program.

In 1986, petitioners filed a motion for final dismissal of the
litigation. They sought a declaration that DCSS had satisfied its duty to eliminate the dual education system, that is
to say a declaration that the school system had achieved unitary status. Green, supra, at 441. The District Court approached the question whether DCSS had achieved unitary
status by asking whether DCSS was unitary with respect to
each of the factors identified in Green. The court considered
an additional factor that is not named in Green: the quality
of education being offered to the white and black student
populations.

474 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
The District Court found DCSS to be "an innovative school
system that has travelled the often long road to unitary status almost to its end," noting that "the court has continually
been impressed by the successes of the DCSS and its dedication to providing a quality education for all students within
that system." App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a. It found that
DCSS is a unitary system with regard to student assignments, transportation, physical facilities, and extracurricular
activities, and ruled that it would order no further relief in
those areas. The District Court stopped short of dismissing
the case, however, because it found that DCSS was not unitary in every respect. The court said that vestiges of the
dual system remain in the areas of teacher and principal
assignments, resource allocation, and quality of education.
DCSS was ordered to take measures to address the remaining problems.

B

Proper resolution of any desegregation case turns on a
careful assessment of its facts. Green, supra, at 439. Here,
as in most cases where the issue is the degree of compliance
with a school desegregation decree, a critical beginning point
is the degree of racial imbalance in the school district, that is
to say a comparison of the proportion of majority to minority
students in individual schools with the proportions of the
races in the district as a whole. This inquiry is fundamental,
for under the former de jure regimes racial exclusion was
both the means and the end of a policy motivated by disparagement of, or hostility towards, the disfavored race. In
accord with this principle, the District Court began its analysis with an assessment of the current racial mix in the
schools throughout DCSS and the explanation for the racial
imbalance it found. Respondents did not contend on appeal
that the findings of fact were clearly erroneous, and the
Court of Appeals did not find them to be erroneous. The
Court of Appeals did disagree with the conclusion reached

475Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
by the District Court respecting the need for further super-vision of racial balance in student assignments.

In the extensive record that comprises this case, one factpredominates: Remarkable changes in the racial composition
of the county presented DCSS and the District Court with
a student population in 1986 far different from the onethey set out to integrate in 1969. Between 1950 and 1985,

DeKalb County grew from 70,000 to 450,000 in total popula-tion, but most of the gross increase in student enrollment
had occurred by 1969, the relevant starting date for our pur-poses. Although the public school population experienced
only modest changes between 1969 and 1986 (remaining in
the low 70,000's), a striking change occurred in the racial
proportions of the student population. The school system
that the District Court ordered desegregated in 1969 had
5.6% black students; by 1986 the percentage of black students was 47%.

To compound the difficulty of working with these radical
demographic changes, the northern and southern parts of the
county experienced much different growth patterns. The
District Court found that "[a]s the result of these demographic shifts, the population of the northern half of DeKalb
County is now predominantly white and the southern half of
DeKalb County is predominantly black." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 38a. In 1970, there were 7,615 nonwhites living in the
northern part of DeKalb County and 11,508 nonwhites in the
southern part of the county. By 1980, there were 15,365
nonwhites living in the northern part of the county, and
87,583 nonwhites in the southern part. Most of the growth
in the nonwhite population in the southern portion of the
county was due to the migration of black persons from the
city of Atlanta. Between 1975 and 1980 alone, approximately 64,000 black citizens moved into southern DeKalb
County, most of them coming from Atlanta. During the
same period, approximately 37,000 white citizens moved out
of southern DeKalb County to the surrounding counties.

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:45 PAGES OPINPGT
476 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
The District Court made findings with respect to the num-ber of nonwhite citizens in the northern and southern parts

of the county for the years 1970 and 1980 without makingparallel findings with respect to white citizens. Yet a clear
picture does emerge. During the relevant period, the black
population in the southern portion of the county experiencedtremendous growth while the white population did not, and

the white population in the northern part of the county expe-rienced tremendous growth while the black population did
not.The demographic changes that occurred during the course
of the desegregation order are an essential foundation for
the District Court's analysis of the current racial mix of
DCSS. As the District Court observed, the demographic
shifts have had "an immense effect on the racial compositions
of the DeKalb County schools." Ibid. From 1976 to 1986,
enrollment in elementary schools declined overall by 15%,
while black enrollment in elementary schools increased by
86%. During the same period, overall high school enrollment declined by 16%, while black enrollment in high schools
increased by 119%. These effects were even more pronounced in the southern portion of DeKalb County.

Concerned with racial imbalance in the various schools of
the district, respondents presented evidence that during the
1986-1987 school year DCSS had the following features: (1)
47% of the students attending DCSS were black; (2) 50% of
the black students attended schools that were over 90%
black; (3) 62% of all black students attended schools that had
more than 20% more blacks than the system-wide average;
(4) 27% of white students attended schools that were more
than 90% white; (5) 59% of the white students attended
schools that had more than 20% more whites than the
system-wide average; (6) of the 22 DCSS high schools, five
had student populations that were more than 90% black,
while five other schools had student populations that were
more than 80% white; and (7) of the 74 elementary schools

477Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
in DCSS, 18 are over 90% black, while 10 are over 90% white.
Id., at 31a. (Respondents' evidence on these points treated
all nonblack students as white. The District Court noted
that there was no evidence that nonblack minority students
constituted even 1% of DCSS student population.)

Respondents argued in the District Court that this racial
imbalance in student assignment was a vestige of the dual
system, rather than a product of independent demographic
forces. In addition to the statistical evidence that the ratio
of black students to white students in individual schools varied to a significant degree from the system-wide average,
respondents contended that DCSS had not used all available
desegregative tools in order to achieve racial balancing. Respondents pointed to the following alleged shortcomings in
DCSS' desegregative efforts: (1) DCSS did not break the
county into subdistricts and racially balance each subdistrict;
(2) DCSS failed to expend sufficient funds for minority learning opportunities; (3) DCSS did not establish community advisory organizations; (4) DCSS did not make full use of the
freedom of choice plan; (5) DCSS did not cluster schools, that
is, it did not create schools for separate grade levels which
could be used to establish a feeder pattern; (6) DCSS did not
institute its magnet school program as early as it might have;
and (7) DCSS did not use busing to facilitate urban to suburban exchanges.

According to the District Court, respondents conceded
that the 1969 order assigning all students to their neighborhood schools "effectively desegregated the DCSS for a period
of time" with respect to student assignment. Id., at 35a.
The District Court noted, however, that despite this concession respondents contended there was an improper imbalance in two schools even in 1969. Respondents made much
of the fact that despite the small percentage of blacks in the
county in 1969, there were then two schools that contained a
majority of black students: Terry Mill Elementary School

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:45 PAGES OPINPGT
478 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
was 76% black, and Stoneview Elementary School was 51%black.

The District Court found the racial imbalance in theseschools was not a vestige of the prior

de jure system. It
observed that both the Terry Mill and Stoneview schools
were de jure white schools before the freedom of choice planwas put in place. It cited expert witness testimony that

Terry Mill had become a majority black school as a result ofdemographic shifts unrelated to the actions of petitioners or
their predecessors. In 1966, the overwhelming majority ofstudents at Terry Mill were white. By 1967, due to migration of black citizens from Atlanta into DeKalb County--and
into the neighborhood surrounding the Terry Mill school in
particular--23% of the students at Terry Mill were black.
By 1968, black students constituted 50% of the school population at Terry Mill. By 1969, when the plan was put into
effect, the percentage of black students had grown to 76. In
accordance with the evidence of demographic shifts, and in
the absence of any evidence to suggest that the former dual
system contributed in any way to the rapid racial transformation of the Terry Mill student population, the District
Court found that the pre-1969 unconstitutional acts of petitioners were not responsible for the high percentage of black
students at the Terry Mill school in 1969. Its findings in
this respect are illustrative of the problems DCSS and the
District Court faced in integrating the whole district.

Although the District Court found that DCSS was desegregated for at least a short period under the court-ordered
plan of 1969, it did not base its finding that DCSS had
achieved unitary status with respect to student assignment on that circumstance alone. Recognizing that "[t]he
achievement of unitary status in the area of student assignment cannot be hedged on the attainment of such status for
a brief moment," id., at 37a, the District Court examined the
interaction between DCSS policy and demographic shifts in
DeKalb County.

479Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
The District Court noted that DCSS had taken specificsteps to combat the effects of demographics on the racial mix

of the schools. Under the 1969 order, a biracial committeehad reviewed all proposed changes in the boundary lines of
school attendance zones. Since the original desegregation
order, there had been about 170 such changes. It was foundthat only three had a partial segregative effect. An expert

testified, and the District Court found, that even thosechanges had no significant effect on the racial mix of the
school population, given the tremendous demographic shiftsthat were taking place at the same time.

The District Court also noted that DCSS, on its own initiative, started an M-to-M program in the 1972 school year.
The program was a marked success. Participation increased with each passing year, so that in the 1986-1987
school year, 4,500 of the 72,000 students enrolled in DCSS
participated. An expert testified that the impact of an
M-to-M program goes beyond the number of students transferred because students at the receiving school also obtain
integrated learning experiences. The District Court found
that about 19% of the students attending DCSS had an integrated learning experience as a result of the M-to-M program. Id., at 40a.

In addition, in the 1980's, DCSS instituted a magnet school
program in schools located in the middle of the county. The
magnet school programs included a performing arts program, two science programs, and a foreign language program. There was testimony in the District Court that
DCSS also had plans to operate additional magnet programs
in occupational education and gifted and talented education,
as well as a preschool program and an open campus. By
locating these programs in the middle of the county, DCSS
sought to attract black students from the southern part of
the county and white students from the northern part.

Further, the District Court found that DCSS operates a
number of experience programs integrated by race, including

Opinion of the Court
a writing center for fifth and seventh graders, a drivingrange, summer school programs, and a dialectical speech program. DCSS employs measures to control the racial mix ineach of these special areas.

In determining whether DCSS has achieved unitary statuswith respect to student assignment, the District Court saw
its task as one of deciding if petitioners "have accomplishedmaximum practical desegregation of the DCSS or if the
DCSS must still do more to fulfill their affirmative consti-tutional duty."

Id., at 41a. Petitioners and respondentspresented conflicting expert testimony about the potential

effects that desegregative techniques not deployed mighthave had upon the racial mix of the schools. The District
Court found that petitioners' experts were more reliable, cit-ing their greater familiarity with DCSS, their experience,
and their standing within the expert community. The Dis-trict Court made these findings:

"[The actions of DCSS] achieved maximum practical de-segregation from 1969 to 1986. The rapid population
shifts in DeKalb County were not caused by any actionon the part of the DCSS. These demographic shifts
were inevitable as the result of suburbanization, that is,work opportunities arising in DeKalb County as well as
the City of Atlanta, which attracted blacks to DeKalb;the decline in the number of children born to white families during this period while the number of children bornto black families did not decrease; blockbusting of formerly white neighborhoods leading to selling and buyingof real estate in the DeKalb area on a highly dynamic
basis; and the completion of Interstate 20, which madeaccess from DeKalb County into the City of Atlanta
much easier. . . . There is no evidence that the schoolsystem's previous unconstitutional conduct may have
contributed to this segregation. This court is convincedthat any further actions taken by defendants, while the
actions might have made marginal adjustments in the

Opinion of the Court
population trends, would not have offset the factors thatwere described above and the same racial segregation

would have occurred at approximately the same speed."Id., at 44a-45a.

The District Court added:

"[A]bsent massive bussing, which is not considered as aviable option by either the parties or this court, the

magnet school program and the M-to-M program, whichthe defendants voluntarily implemented and to which
the defendants obviously are dedicated, are the most ef-fective ways to deal with the effects on student attendance of the residential segregation existing in DeKalbCounty at this time." Id., at 46a.

Having found no constitutional violation with respect tostudent assignment, the District Court next considered the
other Green factors, beginning with faculty and staff assign-ments. The District Court first found that DCSS had fulfilled its constitutional obligation with respect to hiring andretaining minority teachers and administrators. DCSS has
taken active steps to recruit qualified black applicants andhas hired them in significant numbers, employing a greater
percentage of black teachers than the statewide average.The District Court also noted that DCSS has an "equally
exemplary record" in retention of black teachers and admin-istrators. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. Nevertheless, the
District Court found that DCSS had not achieved or main-tained a ratio of black to white teachers and administrators
in each school to approximate the ratio of black to whiteteachers and administrators throughout the system. See
Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School Dist., 419F. 2d 1211 (CA5 1969), cert. denied, 396 U. S. 1032 (1970).
In other words, a racial imbalance existed in the assignmentof minority teachers and administrators. The District
Court found that in the 1984-1985 school year, seven schoolsdeviated by more than 10% from the system-wide average

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:45 PAGES OPINPGT
482 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
of 26.4% minority teachers in elementary schools and 24.9%minority teachers in high schools. The District Court also

found that black principals and administrators were over-represented in schools with high percentages of black students and underrepresented in schools with low percentages
of black students.The District Court found the crux of the problem to be

that DCSS has relied on the replacement process to attain aracial balance in teachers and other staff and has avoided
using mandatory reassignment. DCSS gave as its reasonfor not using mandatory reassignment that the competition
among local school districts is stiff, and that it is difficult to
attract and keep qualified teachers if they are required to
work far from their homes. In fact, because teachers prefer
to work close to their homes, DCSS has a voluntary transfer
program in which teachers who have taught at the same
school for a period of three years may ask for a transfer.
Because most teachers request to be transferred to schools
near their homes, this program makes compliance with the
objective of racial balance in faculty and staff more difficult.

The District Court stated that it was not "unsympathetic
to the difficulties that DCSS faces in this regard," but held
that the law of the Circuit requires DCSS to comply with
Singleton. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a. The court ordered
DCSS to devise a plan to achieve compliance with Singleton,
noting that "[i]t would appear that such compliance will
necessitate reassignment of both teachers and principals."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a. With respect to faculty, the
District Court noted that meeting Singleton would not be
difficult, citing petitioners' own estimate that most schools'
faculty could conform by moving, at most, two or three
teachers.

Addressing the more ineffable category of quality of education, the District Court rejected most of respondents' contentions that there was racial disparity in the provision of
certain educational resources (e. g., teachers with advanced

Opinion of the Court
degrees, teachers with more experience, library books), con-tentions made to show that black students were not being

given equal educational opportunity. The District Courtwent further, however, and examined the evidence concerning achievement of black students in DCSS. It cited expert
testimony praising the overall educational program in thedistrict, as well as objective evidence of black achievement:

Black students at DCSS made greater gains on the IowaTests of Basic Skills than white students, and black students
at DCSS are more successful than black students nation-wide on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. It made the following finding:

"While there will always be something more that the
DCSS can do to improve the chances for black studentsto achieve academic success, the court cannot find, as

plaintiffs urge, that the DCSS has been negligent in itsduties to implement programs to assist black students.
The DCSS is a very innovative school system. It has
implemented a number of programs to enrich the livesand enhance the academic potential of all students, both

blacks and whites. Many remedial programs are tar-geted in the majority black schools. Programs have
been implemented to involve the parents and offset neg-ative socio-economic factors. If the DCSS has failed in
any way in this regard, it is not because the school sys-tem has been negligent in its duties." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 69a-70a (footnote omitted).
Despite its finding that there was no intentional violation,
the District Court found that DCSS had not achieved unitary status with respect to quality of education because
teachers in schools with disproportionately high percentages
of white students tended to be better educated and have
more experience than their counterparts in schools with
disproportionately high percentages of black students, and
because per-pupil expenditures in majority white schools

484 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
exceeded per-pupil expenditures in majority black schools.From these findings, the District Court ordered DCSS to

equalize spending and remedy the other problems.The final

Green factors considered by the District Court
were: (1) physical facilities, (2) transportation, and (3) extracurricular activities. The District Court noted that al-though respondents expressed some concerns about the use

of portable classrooms in schools in the southern portion ofthe county, they in effect conceded that DCSS has achieved
unitary status with respect to physical facilities.In accordance with its factfinding, the District Court held
that it would order no further relief in the areas of student
assignment, transportation, physical facilities, and extracurricular activities. The District Court, however, did order
DCSS to establish a system to balance teacher and principal
assignments and to equalize per-pupil expenditures throughout DCSS. Having found that blacks were represented
on the school board and throughout DCSS administration,
the District Court abolished the biracial committee as no
longer necessary.

Both parties appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ultimate conclusion that DCSS
has not yet achieved unitary status, but reversed the District
Court's ruling that DCSS has no further duties in the area
of student assignment. 887 F. 2d 1438 (1989). The Court
of Appeals held that the District Court erred by considering
the six Green factors as separate categories. The Court of
Appeals rejected the District Court's incremental approach,
an approach that has also been adopted by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Morgan v. Nucci, 831 F. 2d 313,
318-319 (1987), and held that a school system achieves unitary status only after it has satisfied all six factors at the
same time for several years. 887 F. 2d, at 1446. Because,
under this test, DCSS had not achieved unitary status at any
time, the Court of Appeals held that DCSS could "not shirk

Opinion of the Court
its constitutional duties by pointing to demographic shiftsoccurring prior to unitary status."

Id., at 1448. The Court
of Appeals held that petitioners bore the responsibility forthe racial imbalance, and in order to correct that imbalance

would have to take actions that "may be administratively
awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations,"
Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Education, 402 U. S.
1, 28 (1971), such as pairing and clustering of schools, drastic
gerrymandering of school zones, grade reorganization, and
busing. We granted certiorari, 498 U. S. 1081 (1991).

II
Two principal questions are presented. The first is
whether a district court may relinquish its supervision and
control over those aspects of a school system in which there
has been compliance with a desegregation decree if other
aspects of the system remain in noncompliance. As we answer this question in the affirmative, the second question is
whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District
Court's order providing for incremental withdrawal of supervision in all the circumstances of this case.

A
The duty and responsibility of a school district once segregated by law is to take all steps necessary to eliminate the
vestiges of the unconstitutional de jure system. This is required in order to ensure that the principal wrong of the de
jure system, the injuries and stigma inflicted upon the race
disfavored by the violation, is no longer present. This was
the rationale and the objective of Brown I and Brown II.
In Brown I we said: "To separate [black students] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their
race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in
the community that may affect their hearts and minds in
a way unlikely ever to be undone." 347 U. S., at 494. We

486 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
quoted a finding of the three-judge District Court in the un-derlying Kansas case that bears repeating here:

" `Segregation of white and colored children in publicschools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction ofthe law; for the policy of separating the races is usually
interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negrogroup. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of
a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law,therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and
mental development of negro children and to deprive
them of some of the benefits they would receive in aracial[ly] integrated school system.' "

Ibid.

The objective of Brown I was made more specific by our
holding in Green that the duty of a former de jure district is
to "take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to aunitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch." 391 U. S., at 437-438. We alsoidentified various parts of the school system which, in addition to student attendance patterns, must be free from racialdiscrimination before the mandate of

Brown is met: faculty,
staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities.391 U. S., at 435. The

Green factors are a measure of the
racial identifiability of schools in a system that is not in compliance with Brown, and we instructed the District Courtsto fashion remedies that address all these components of elementary and secondary school systems.The concept of unitariness has been a helpful one in defining the scope of the district courts' authority, for it conveys
the central idea that a school district that was once a dual
system must be examined in all of its facets, both when a
remedy is ordered and in the later phases of desegregation
when the question is whether the district courts' remedial
control ought to be modified, lessened, or withdrawn. But,
as we explained last Term in Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:45 PAGES OPINPGT

487Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 245-246 (1991), theterm "unitary" is not a precise concept:

"[I]t is a mistake to treat words such as `dual' and`unitary' as if they were actually found in the Constitution. . . . Courts have used the terms `dual' to denotea school system which has engaged in intentional segregation of students by race, and `unitary' to describe aschool system which has been brought into compliance
with the command of the Constitution. We are not surehow useful it is to define these terms more precisely, or
to create subclasses within them."
It follows that we must be cautious not to attribute to the
term a utility it does not have. The term "unitary" does notconfine the discretion and authority of the District Court in

a way that departs from traditional equitable principles.

That the term "unitary" does not have fixed meaning orcontent is not inconsistent with the principles that control

the exercise of equitable power. The essence of a court'sequity power lies in its inherent capacity to adjust remedies
in a feasible and practical way to eliminate the conditions orredress the injuries caused by unlawful action. Equitable
remedies must be flexible if these underlying principles areto be enforced with fairness and precision. In this respect,
as we observed in Swann, "a school desegregation case does
not differ fundamentally from other cases involving the fram-ing of equitable remedies to repair the denial of a constitutional right. The task is to correct, by a balancing of theindividual and collective interests, the condition that offends
the Constitution." Swann, 402 U. S., at 15-16. The requirement of a unitary school system must be implemented
according to this prescription.

Our application of these guiding principles in Pasadena
Bd. of Education v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424 (1976), is instructive. There we held that a District Court exceeded its remedial authority in requiring annual readjustment of school

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:45 PAGES OPINPGT
488 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
attendance zones in the Pasadena school district whenchanges in the racial makeup of the schools were caused by

demographic shifts "not attributed to any segregative actson the part of the [school district]."

Id., at 436. In so holding we said:

"It may well be that petitioners have not yet totally
achieved the unitary system contemplated by . . .
Swann. There has been, for example, dispute as to the
petitioners' compliance with those portions of the planspecifying procedures for hiring and promoting teachers

and administrators. See 384 F. Supp. 846 (1974), vacated, 537 F. 2d 1031 (1976). But that does not undercutthe force of the principle underlying the quoted language from Swann. In this case the District Court ap-proved a plan designed to obtain racial neutrality in the
attendance of students at Pasadena's public schools. Noone disputes that the initial implementation of this plan
accomplished that objective. That being the case, the
District Court was not entitled to require the [PasadenaUnified School District] to rearrange its attendance

zones each year so as to ensure that the racial mix de-sired by the court was maintained in perpetuity. For
having once implemented a racially neutral attendancepattern in order to remedy the perceived constitutional
violations on the part of the defendants, the DistrictCourt had fully performed its function of providing the
appropriate remedy for previous racially discriminatory
attendance patterns." Ibid.

See also id., at 438, n. 5 ("Counsel for the original plaintiffs
has urged, in the courts below and before us, that the District Court's perpetual `no majority of any minority' requirement was valid and consistent with Swann, at least until the
school system achieved `unitary' status in all other respects
such as the hiring and promoting of teachers and administrators. Since we have concluded that the case is moot with

489Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
regard to these plaintiffs, these arguments are not properlybefore us. It should be clear from what we have said that

they have little substance").Today, we make explicit the rationale that was central in
Spangler. A federal court in a school desegregation case
has the discretion to order an incremental or partial with-drawal of its supervision and control. This discretion derives both from the constitutional authority which justifiedits intervention in the first instance and its ultimate objectives in formulating the decree. The authority of the courtis invoked at the outset to remedy particular constitutional
violations. In construing the remedial authority of the district courts, we have been guided by the principles that
"judicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of a
constitutional violation," and that "the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy." Swann, supra,
at 16. A remedy is justifiable only insofar as it advances the
ultimate objective of alleviating the initial constitutional
violation.

We have said that the court's end purpose must be to remedy the violation and, in addition, to restore state and local
authorities to the control of a school system that is operating
in compliance with the Constitution. Milliken v. Bradley,
433 U. S. 267, 280-281 (1977) ("[T]he federal courts in devising a remedy must take into account the interests of state
and local authorities in managing their own affairs, consistent with the Constitution"). Partial relinquishment of judicial control, where justified by the facts of the case, can be
an important and significant step in fulfilling the district
court's duty to return the operations and control of schools
to local authorities. In Dowell, we emphasized that federal
judicial supervision of local school systems was intended as
a "temporary measure." 498 U. S., at 247. Although this
temporary measure has lasted decades, the ultimate objective has not changed--to return school districts to the control of local authorities. Just as a court has the obligation

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT
490 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
at the outset of a desegregation decree to structure a planso that all available resources of the court are directed to

comprehensive supervision of its decree, so too must a courtprovide an orderly means for withdrawing from control when
it is shown that the school district has attained the requisite
degree of compliance. A transition phase in which controlis relinquished in a gradual way is an appropriate means to

this end.As we have long observed, "local autonomy of school districts is a vital national tradition." Dayton Bd. of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 410 (1977) (Dayton I).
Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the
earliest practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability in our governmental system. When the school
district and all state entities participating with it in operating the schools make decisions in the absence of judicial supervision, they can be held accountable to the citizenry, to
the political process, and to the courts in the ordinary course.
As we discuss below, one of the prerequisites to relinquishment of control in whole or in part is that a school district
has demonstrated its commitment to a course of action that
gives full respect to the equal protection guarantees of the
Constitution. Yet it must be acknowledged that the potential for discrimination and racial hostility is still present in
our country, and its manifestations may emerge in new and
subtle forms after the effects of de jure segregation have
been eliminated. It is the duty of the State and its subdivisions to ensure that such forces do not shape or control the
policies of its school systems. Where control lies, so too
does responsibility.

We hold that, in the course of supervising desegregation
plans, federal courts have the authority to relinquish supervision and control of school districts in incremental stages,
before full compliance has been achieved in every area of
school operations. While retaining jurisdiction over the
case, the court may determine that it will not order further

491Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
remedies in areas where the school district is in compliancewith the decree. That is to say, upon a finding that a school

system subject to a court-supervised desegregation plan isin compliance in some but not all areas, the court in appropriate cases may return control to the school system in those
areas where compliance has been achieved, limiting furtherjudicial supervision to operations that are not yet in full compliance with the court decree. In particular, the districtcourt may determine that it will not order further remedies in the area of student assignments where racial imbal-ance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to constitutional
violations.

A court's discretion to order the incremental withdrawal
of its supervision in a school desegregation case must be exercised in a manner consistent with the purposes and objectives of its equitable power. Among the factors which must
inform the sound discretion of the court in ordering partial
withdrawal are the following: whether there has been full
and satisfactory compliance with the decree in those aspects
of the system where supervision is to be withdrawn; whether
retention of judicial control is necessary or practicable to
achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the
school system; and whether the school district has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and students of the
once disfavored race, its good-faith commitment to the whole
of the court's decree and to those provisions of the law and
the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.

In considering these factors, a court should give particular
attention to the school system's record of compliance. A
school system is better positioned to demonstrate its goodfaith commitment to a constitutional course of action when
its policies form a consistent pattern of lawful conduct directed to eliminating earlier violations. And, with the passage of time, the degree to which racial imbalances continue
to represent vestiges of a constitutional violation may dimin503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ish, and the practicability and efficacy of various remediescan be evaluated with more precision.

These are the premises that guided our formulation inDowell of the duties of a district court during the final
phases of a desegregation case: "The District Court shouldaddress itself to whether the Board had complied in good
faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, andwhether the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated to the extent practicable." 498 U. S., at 249-250.

B
We reach now the question whether the Court of Appealserred in prohibiting the District Court from returning to

DCSS partial control over some of its affairs. We decidethat the Court of Appeals did err in holding that, as a matter
of law, the District Court had no discretion to permit DCSSto regain control over student assignment, transportation,
physical facilities, and extracurricular activities, while re-taining court supervision over the areas of faculty and administrative assignments and the quality of education, wherefull compliance had not been demonstrated.

It was an appropriate exercise of its discretion for the Dis-trict Court to address the elements of a unitary system discussed in Green, to inquire whether other elements ought tobe identified, and to determine whether minority students
were being disadvantaged in ways that required the formula-tion of new and further remedies to ensure full compliance
with the court's decree. Both parties agreed that qualityof education was a legitimate inquiry in determining DCSS'
compliance with the desegregation decree, and the trial courtfound it workable to consider the point in connection with its
findings on resource allocation. Its order retaining supervi-sion over this aspect of the case has not been challenged by
the parties, and we need not examine it except as it under-scores the school district's record of compliance in some areas
but not others. The District Court's approach illustrates

493Cite as: 503 U. S. 467 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
that the Green factors need not be a rigid framework. Itillustrates also the uses of equitable discretion. By withdrawing control over areas where judicial supervision is nolonger needed, a district court can concentrate both its own
resources and those of the school district on the areas where
the effects of de jure discrimination have not been eliminatedand further action is necessary in order to provide real and

tangible relief to minority students.The Court of Appeals' rejection of the District Court's
order rests on related premises: first, that given noncompli-ance in some discrete categories, there can be no partial
withdrawal of judicial control; and second, until there is full
compliance, heroic measures must be taken to ensure racial
balance in student assignments system wide. Under our
analysis and our precedents, neither premise is correct.

The Court of Appeals was mistaken in ruling that our
opinion in Swann requires "awkward," "inconvenient," and
"even bizarre" measures to achieve racial balance in student
assignments in the late phases of carrying out a decree, when
the imbalance is attributable neither to the prior de jure system nor to a later violation by the school district but rather
to independent demographic forces. In Swann we undertook to discuss the objectives of a comprehensive desegregation plan and the powers and techniques available to a district court in designing it at the outset. We confirmed that
racial balance in school assignments was a necessary part of
the remedy in the circumstances there presented. In the
case before us the District Court designed a comprehensive
plan for desegregation of DCSS in 1969, one that included
racial balance in student assignments. The desegregation
decree was designed to achieve maximum practicable desegregation. Its central remedy was the closing of black
schools and the reassignment of pupils to neighborhood
schools, with attendance zones that achieved racial balance.
The plan accomplished its objective in the first year of operation, before dramatic demographic changes altered residen503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tial patterns. For the entire 17-year period respondentsraised no substantial objection to the basic student assignment system, as the parties and the District Court concen-trated on other mechanisms to eliminate the

de jure taint.
That there was racial imbalance in student attendance
zones was not tantamount to a showing that the school dis-trict was in noncompliance with the decree or with its duties

under the law. Racial balance is not to be achieved for itsown sake. It is to be pursued when racial imbalance has
been caused by a constitutional violation. Once the racialimbalance due to the

de jure violation has been remedied,
the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that
is caused by demographic factors. Swann, 402 U. S., at
31-32 ("Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally required to make year-by-year adjustments of
the racial composition of student bodies once the affirmative
duty to desegregate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the system. This does not mean that federal courts are without
power to deal with future problems; but in the absence of a
showing that either the school authorities or some other
agency of the State has deliberately attempted to fix or alter
demographic patterns to affect the racial composition of the
schools, further intervention by a district court should not
be necessary"). If the unlawful de jure policy of a school
system has been the cause of the racial imbalance in student
attendance, that condition must be remedied. The school
district bears the burden of showing that any current imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior
violation.

The findings of the District Court that the population
changes which occurred in DeKalb County were not caused
by the policies of the school district, but rather by independent factors, are consistent with the mobility that is a distinct
characteristic of our society. In one year (from 1987 to 1988)
over 40 million Americans, or 17.6% of the total population,

moved households. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau ofCensus, Statistical Abstract of the United States 19 (111th

ed. 1991) (Table 25). Over a third of those people moved toa different county, and over six million migrated between
States. Ibid. In such a society it is inevitable that the demographic makeup of school districts, based as they are onpolitical subdivisions such as counties and municipalities,

may undergo rapid change.The effect of changing residential patterns on the racial
composition of schools, though not always fortunate, is some-what predictable. Studies show a high correlation between
residential segregation and school segregation. Wilson &
Taeuber, Residential and School Segregation: Some Tests of
Their Association, in Demography and Ethnic Groups 57-58
(F. Bean & W. Frisbie eds. 1978). The District Court in this
case heard evidence tending to show that racially stable
neighborhoods are not likely to emerge because whites prefer a racial mix of 80% white and 20% black, while blacks
prefer a 50-50 mix.

Where resegregation is a product not of state action but
of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications. It is beyond the authority and beyond the practical
ability of the federal courts to try to counteract these kinds
of continuous and massive demographic shifts. To attempt
such results would require ongoing and never-ending supervision by the courts of school districts simply because they
were once de jure segregated. Residential housing choices,
and their attendant effects on the racial composition of
schools, present an ever-changing pattern, one difficult to
address through judicial remedies.

In one sense of the term, vestiges of past segregation by
state decree do remain in our society and in our schools.
Past wrongs to the black race, wrongs committed by the
State and in its name, are a stubborn fact of history. And
stubborn facts of history linger and persist. But though we
cannot escape our history, neither must we overstate its con503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
sequences in fixing legal responsibilities. The vestiges ofsegregation that are the concern of the law in a school case

may be subtle and intangible but nonetheless they must beso real that they have a causal link to the

de jure violation
being remedied. It is simply not always the case that demographic forces causing population change bear any real andsubstantial relation to a

de jure violation. And the law need
not proceed on that premise.As the

de jure violation becomes more remote in time and
these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likelythat a current racial imbalance in a school district is a vestige

of the prior de jure system. The causal link between current conditions and the prior violation is even more attenuated if the school district has demonstrated its good faith.
In light of its finding that the demographic changes in
DeKalb County are unrelated to the prior violation, the District Court was correct to entertain the suggestion that
DCSS had no duty to achieve system-wide racial balance in
the student population. It was appropriate for the District
Court to examine the reasons for the racial imbalance before
ordering an impractical, and no doubt massive, expenditure
of funds to achieve racial balance after 17 years of efforts to
implement the comprehensive plan in a district where there
were fundamental changes in demographics, changes not attributable to the former de jure regime or any later actions
by school officials. The District Court's determination to
order instead the expenditure of scarce resources in areas
such as the quality of education, where full compliance had
not yet been achieved, underscores the uses of discretion in
framing equitable remedies.

To say, as did the Court of Appeals, that a school district
must meet all six Green factors before the trial court can
declare the system unitary and relinquish its control over
school attendance zones, and to hold further that racial balancing by all necessary means is required in the interim, is

Opinion of the Court
simply to vindicate a legal phrase. The law is not so formalistic. A proper rule must be based on the necessity to find
a feasible remedy that ensures system-wide compliance with
the court decree and that is directed to curing the effects of
the specific violation.

We next consider whether retention of judicial control over
student attendance is necessary or practicable to achieve
compliance in other facets of the school system. Racial balancing in elementary and secondary school student assignments may be a legitimate remedial device to correct other
fundamental inequities that were themselves caused by the
constitutional violation. We have long recognized that the
Green factors may be related or interdependent. Two or
more Green factors may be intertwined or synergistic in
their relation, so that a constitutional violation in one area
cannot be eliminated unless the judicial remedy addresses
other matters as well. We have observed, for example, that
student segregation and faculty segregation are often related problems. See Dayton Bd. of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 536 (1979) (Dayton II) (" `[P]urposeful
segregation of faculty by race was inextricably tied to racially motivated student assignment practices' "); Rogers v.
Paul, 382 U. S. 198, 200 (1965) (students have standing to
challenge racial allocation of faculty because "racial allocation of faculty denies them equality of educational opportunity without regard to segregation of pupils"). As a consequence, a continuing violation in one area may need to be
addressed by remedies in another. See, e. g., Bradley v.
Richmond School Bd., 382 U. S. 103, 105 (1965) (per curiam)
("There is no merit to the suggestion that the relation between faculty allocation on an alleged racial basis and the
adequacy of the desegregation plans is entirely speculative");
Vaughns v. Board of Education of Prince George's County,
742 F. Supp. 1275, 1291 (Md. 1990) ("[T]he components of

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT
498 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Opinion of the Court
a school desegregation plan are interdependent upon, and
interact with, one another, so that changes with respect to
one component may impinge upon the success or failure of
another").

There was no showing that racial balancing was an appropriate mechanism to cure other deficiencies in this case. It
is true that the school district was not in compliance with
respect to faculty assignments, but the record does not show
that student reassignments would be a feasible or practicable
way to remedy this defect. To the contrary, the District
Court suggests that DCSS could solve the faculty assignment problem by reassigning a few teachers per school.
The District Court, not having our analysis before it, did not
have the opportunity to make specific findings and conclusions on this aspect of the case, however. Further proceedings are appropriate for this purpose.

The requirement that the school district show its goodfaith commitment to the entirety of a desegregation plan so
that parents, students, and the public have assurance against
further injuries or stigma also should be a subject for more
specific findings. We stated in Dowell that the good-faith
compliance of the district with the court order over a reasonable period of time is a factor to be considered in deciding
whether or not jurisdiction could be relinquished. 498 U. S.,
at 249-250 ("The District Court should address itself to
whether the Board had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the
vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated to the
extent practicable"). A history of good-faith compliance is
evidence that any current racial imbalance is not the product
of a new de jure violation, and enables the district court to
accept the school board's representation that it has accepted
the principle of racial equality and will not suffer intentional
discrimination in the future. See Morgan v. Nucci, 831

Opinion of the Court
F. 2d, at 321 ("A finding of good faith . . . reduces the possibility that a school system's compliance with court orders is but
a temporary constitutional ritual").

When a school district has not demonstrated good faith
under a comprehensive plan to remedy ongoing violations,
we have without hesitation approved comprehensive and
continued district court supervision. See Columbus Bd. of
Education v. Penick, 443 U. S. 449, 461 (1979) (predicating
liability in part on the finding that the school board " `never
actively set out to dismantle [the] dual system,' " Penick v.
Columbus Bd. of Education, 429 F. Supp. 229, 260 (SD Ohio
1977)); Dayton II, supra, at 534 (adopting Court of Appeals
holding that the "intentionally segregative impact of various
practices since 1954 . . . were of systemwide import and an
appropriate basis for a systemwide remedy").

In contrast to the circumstances in Penick and Brinkman,
the District Court in this case stated that throughout the
period of judicial supervision it has been impressed by the
successes DCSS has achieved and its dedication to providing
a quality education for all students, and that DCSS "has
travelled the often long road to unitary status almost to its
end." With respect to those areas where compliance had
not been achieved, the District Court did not find that DCSS
had acted in bad faith or engaged in further acts of discrimination since the desegregation plan went into effect. This,
though, may not be the equivalent of a finding that the school
district has an affirmative commitment to comply in good
faith with the entirety of a desegregation plan, and further
proceedings are appropriate for this purpose as well.

The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the
Court of Appeals. It should determine what issues are open
for its further consideration in light of the previous briefs
and arguments of the parties and in light of the principles
set forth in this opinion. Thereupon it should order further

Each party is to bear its own costs.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
The District Court in the present case found that the imbalances in student assignment were attributable to private
demographic shifts rather than governmental action. Without disturbing this finding, and without finding that revision
of student assignments was necessary to remedy some other
unlawful government action, the Court of Appeals ordered
DeKalb County to institute massive busing and other programs to achieve integration. The Court convincingly demonstrates that this cannot be reconciled with our cases, and
I join its opinion.

Our decision will be of great assistance to the citizens of
DeKalb County, who for the first time since 1969 will be able
to run their own public schools, at least so far as student
assignments are concerned. It will have little effect, however, upon the many other school districts throughout the
country that are still being supervised by federal judges,
since it turns upon the extraordinarily rare circumstance of
a finding that no portion of the current racial imbalance is
a remnant of prior de jure discrimination. While it is perfectly appropriate for the Court to decide this case on that
narrow basis, we must resolve--if not today, then soon--
what is to be done in the vast majority of other districts,
where, though our cases continue to profess that judicial
oversight of school operations is a temporary expedient,
democratic processes remain suspended, with no prospect
of restoration, 38 years after Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U. S. 483 (1954).

Almost a quarter century ago, in Green v. School Bd. of
New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430, 437-438 (1968), this Court
held that school systems which had been enforcing de juresegregation at the time of

Brown had not merely an obligation to assign students and resources on a race-neutral basis
but also an "affirmative duty" to "desegregate," that is, toachieve insofar as practicable racial balance in their schools.

This holding has become such a part of our legal fabric thatthere is a tendency, reflected in the Court of Appeals opinion
in this case, to speak as though the Constitution requiressuch racial balancing. Of course it does not: The Equal Protection Clause reaches only those racial imbalances shown to
be intentionally caused by the State. As the Court reaffirms today, if "desegregation" (i. e., racial balancing) were
properly to be ordered in the present case, it would be not
because the extant racial imbalance in the DeKalb County
School System offends the Constitution, but rather because
that imbalance is a "lingering effect" of the pre-1969 de jure
segregation that offended the Constitution. For all our talk
about "unitary status," "release from judicial supervision,"
and "affirmative duty to desegregate," the sole question in
school desegregation cases (absent an allegation that current
policies are intentionally discriminatory) is one of remedies
for past violations.

Identifying and undoing the effects of some violations of
the law is easy. Where, for example, a tax is found to have
been unconstitutionally imposed, calculating the funds derived from that tax (which must be refunded), and distinguishing them from the funds derived from other taxes
(which may be retained), is a simple matter. That is not so
with respect to the effects of unconstitutionally operating a
legally segregated school system; they are uncommonly difficult to identify and to separate from the effects of other
causes. But one would not know that from our instructions
to the lower courts on this subject, which tend to be at a
level of generality that assumes facile reduction to specifics.

" `[Desegregation] decrees,' " we have said, " `exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that
does not violate the Constitution or does not flow from such
a violation,' " Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 247 (1991); Milliken v.
Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977). We have never sought to
describe how one identifies a condition as the effluent of a
violation, or how a "vestige" or a "remnant" of past discrimination is to be recognized. Indeed, we have not even betrayed an awareness that these tasks are considerably more
difficult than calculating the amount of taxes unconstitutionally paid. It is time for us to abandon our studied disregard
of that obvious truth and to adjust our jurisprudence to its
reality.

Since parents and school boards typically want children to
attend schools in their own neighborhood, "[t]he principal
cause of racial and ethnic imbalance in . . . public schools
across the country--North and South--is the imbalance in
residential patterns." Austin Independent School Dist. v.
United States, 429 U. S. 990, 994 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring). That imbalance in residential patterns, in turn,
"doubtless result[s] from a me' lange of past happenings
prompted by economic considerations, private discrimination, discriminatory school assignments, or a desire to reside
near people of one's own race or ethnic background." Columbus Bd. of Education v. Penick, 443 U. S. 449, 512
(1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also Pasadena Bd.
of Education v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 435-437 (1976).
Consequently, residential segregation "is a national, not a
southern[,] phenomenon" which exists " `regardless of the
character of local laws and policies, and regardless of the
extent of other forms of segregation or discrimination.' "

Racially imbalanced schools are hence the product of ablend of public and private actions, and any assessment that

they would not be segregated, or would not be as segregated,in the absence of a particular one of those factors is guesswork. It is similarly guesswork, of course, to say that they
would be segregated, or would be as segregated, in the ab-sence of one of those factors. Only in rare cases such as this

one and Spangler, see 427 U. S., at 435-437, where the racialimbalance had been temporarily corrected after the abandonment of de jure segregation, can it be asserted with any de-gree of confidence that the past discrimination is no longer
playing a proximate role. Thus, allocation of the burden of
proof foreordains the result in almost all of the "vestige of
past discrimination" cases. If, as is normally the case under
our equal protection jurisprudence (and in the law generally), we require the plaintiffs to establish the asserted facts
entitling them to relief--that the racial imbalance they wish
corrected is at least in part the vestige of an old de jure
system--the plaintiffs will almost always lose. Conversely,
if we alter our normal approach and require the school authorities to establish the negative--that the imbalance is not
attributable to their past discrimination--the plaintiffs will
almost always win. See Penick, supra, at 471 (Stewart, J.,
concurring in result).

Since neither of these alternatives is entirely palatable, an
observer unfamiliar with the history surrounding this issue
might suggest that we avoid the problem by requiring only
that the school authorities establish a regime in which parents are free to disregard neighborhood-school assignment,
and to send their children (with transportation paid) to
whichever school they choose. So long as there is free
choice, he would say, there is no reason to require that the
schools be made identical. The constitutional right is equal
racial access to schools, not access to racially equal schools;
whatever racial imbalances such a free-choice system might
produce would be the product of private forces. We appar503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT

ently envisioned no more than this in our initial post-Brown
cases.* It is also the approach we actually adopted in
Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385, 407-409 (1986) (White,
J., concurring), which concerned remedies for prior de jure
segregation of state university-operated clubs and services.

But we ultimately charted a different course with respect
to public elementary and secondary schools. We concluded
in Green that a "freedom of choice" plan was not necessarily sufficient, 391 U. S., at 439-440, and later applied this
conclusion to all jurisdictions with a history of intentional
segregation:

" `Racially neutral' assignment plans proposed by school
authorities to a district court may be inadequate; such
plans may fail to counteract the continuing effects of
past school segregation resulting from discriminatory location of school sites or distortion of school size in order
to achieve or maintain an artificial racial separation.
When school authorities present a district court with
a `loaded game board,' affirmative action in the form
of remedial altering of attendance zones is proper to
achieve truly nondiscriminatory assignments." Swann
v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Education, 402 U. S. 1,
28 (1971).

*See, e. g., Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 7 (1958) ("[O]bedience to the
duty of desegregation would require the immediate general admission of
Negro children . . . at particular schools"); Goss v. Board of Education of
Knoxville, 373 U. S. 683, 687 (1963) (holding unconstitutional a minorityto-majority transfer policy which was unaccompanied by a policy allowing
majority-to-minority transfers, but noting that "if the transfer provisions
were made available to all students regardless of their race and regardless
as well of the racial composition of the school to which he requested transfer we would have an entirely different case. Pupils could then at their
option (or that of their parents) choose, entirely free of any imposed racial considerations, to remain in the school of their zone or transfer to
another").

Thus began judicial recognition of an "affirmative duty" todesegregate,

id., at 15; Green, supra, at 437-438, achieved by
allocating the burden of negating causality to the defendant.Our postGreen cases provide that, once state-enforced
school segregation is shown to have existed in a jurisdiction
in 1954, there arises a presumption, effectively irrebuttable(because the school district cannot prove the negative), that

any current racial imbalance is the product of that violation,at least if the imbalance has continuously existed, see,

e. g.,
Swann, supra, at 26; Keyes, 413 U. S., at 209-210.In the context of elementary and secondary education, the

presumption was extraordinary in law but not unreasonable
in fact. "Presumptions normally arise when proof of one
fact renders the existence of another fact `so probable that it
is sensible and timesaving to assume the truth of [the inferred] fact . . . until the adversary disproves it.' " NLRB
v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 788-789
(1990), quoting E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence $ 343,
p. 969 (3d ed. 1984). The extent and recency of the prior
discrimination, and the improbability that young children (or
their parents) would use "freedom of choice" plans to disrupt
existing patterns "warrant[ed] a presumption [that] schools
that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition" were remnants of the de jure system. Swann, supra,
at 26.

But granting the merits of this approach at the time of
Green, it is now 25 years later. "From the very first, federal
supervision of local school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimination." Dowell, 498
U. S., at 247 (emphasis added). We envisioned it as temporary partly because "[n]o single tradition in public education
is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation
of schools," Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 741 (1974)
(Milliken I), and because no one's interest is furthered by
subjecting the Nation's educational system to "judicial tutelage for the indefinite future," Dowell, supra, at 249; see also

F. 2d 1239, 1245, n. 5 (CA9 1979) (Kennedy, J., concurring).
But we also envisioned it as temporary, I think, because the
rational basis for the extraordinary presumption of causation
simply must dissipate as the de jure system and the school
boards who produced it recede further into the past. Since
a multitude of private factors has shaped school systems in
the years after abandonment of de jure segregation--normal
migration, population growth (as in this case), "white flight"
from the inner cities, increases in the costs of new facilities--
the percentage of the current makeup of school systems attributable to the prior, government-enforced discrimination
has diminished with each passing year, to the point where it
cannot realistically be assumed to be a significant factor.

At some time, we must acknowledge that it has become
absurd to assume, without any further proof, that violations
of the Constitution dating from the days when Lyndon Johnson was President, or earlier, continue to have an appreciable
effect upon current operation of schools. We are close to
that time. While we must continue to prohibit, without
qualification, all racial discrimination in the operation of public schools, and to afford remedies that eliminate not only
the discrimination but its identified consequences, we should
consider laying aside the extraordinary, and increasingly
counterfactual, presumption of Green. We must soon revert
to the ordinary principles of our law, of our democratic heritage, and of our educational tradition: that plaintiffs alleging
equal protection violations must prove intent and causation
and not merely the existence of racial disparity, see Bazemore, supra, at 407-409 (White, J., concurring); Washington
v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 245 (1976); that public schooling, even
in the South, should be controlled by locally elected authorities acting in conjunction with parents, see, e. g., Dowell,

Justice Souter, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion holding that where there arevestiges of a dual system in some of a judicially supervised

school system's aspects, or Green-type factors,* a districtcourt will retain jurisdiction over the system, but need not
maintain constant supervision or control over factors as towhich compliance has been achieved. I write separately
only to explain my understanding of the enquiry required bya district court applying the principle we set out today.

We recognize that although demographic changes influ-encing the composition of a school's student population may
well have no causal link to prior de jure segregation, judicialcontrol of student assignments may still be necessary to remedy persisting vestiges of the unconstitutional dual system,such as remaining imbalance in faculty assignments. See
ante, at 497-498. This is, however, only one of several possi-ble causal relationships between or among unconstitutional
acts of school segregation and various Green-type factors. Ithink it is worth mentioning at least two others: the dual
school system itself as a cause of the demographic shifts withwhich the district court is faced when considering a partial
relinquishment of supervision, and a Green-type factor otherthan student assignments as a possible cause of imbalanced
student assignment patterns in the future.The first would occur when demographic change toward
segregated residential patterns is itself caused by past schoolsegregation and the patterns of thinking that segregation
creates. Such demographic change is not an independent,supervening cause of racial imbalance in the student body,
and we have said before that when demographic change is

list of specific factors, of course, need not be treated as exclusive. See

not independent of efforts to segregate, the causal relation-ship may be considered in fashioning a school desegregation remedy. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of
Education, 402 U. S. 1, 21 (1971). Racial imbalance in student assignments caused by demographic change is not insulated from federal judicial oversight where the demographicchange is itself caused in this way, and before deciding to

relinquish supervision and control over student assignments,a district court should make findings on the presence or absence of this relationship.The second and related causal relationship would occur
after the district court has relinquished supervision over a
remedied aspect of the school system, when future imbalance
in that remedied Green-type factor (here, student assignments) would be caused by remaining vestiges of the dual
system. Even after attaining compliance as to student composition, other factors such as racial composition of the faculty, quality of the physical plant, or per-pupil expenditures
may leave schools racially identifiable. (In this very case,
for example, there is a correlation in particular schools of
overrepresentation of black principals and administrators,
lower per-pupil expenditures, and high percentages of black
students. Moreover, the schools in the predominantly black
southern section of the school district are the only ones that
use "portable classrooms," i. e., trailers. See ante, at 481-
482, 484.) If such other factors leave a school identifiable as
"black," as soon as the district court stops supervising student assignments, nearby white parents may move in the
direction of racially identifiable "white" schools, or may simply move their children into these schools. In such a case,
the vestige of discrimination in one factor will act as an incubator for resegregation in others. Before a district court
ends its supervision of student assignments, then, it should
make a finding that there is no immediate threat of unremedied Green-type factors causing population or student enrollment changes that in turn may imbalance student composi503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT

tion in this way. And, because the district court retains
jurisdiction over the case, it should of course reassert control
over student assignments if it finds that this does happen.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice O'Connor join, concurring in the judgment.

It is almost 38 years since this Court decided Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954). In those 38 years
the students in DeKalb County, Ga., never have attended a
desegregated school system even for one day. The majority
of "black" students never have attended a school that was
not disproportionately black. Ignoring this glaring dual
character of the DeKalb County School System (DCSS), part
"white" and part "black," the District Court relinquished
control over student assignments, finding that the school
district had achieved "unitary status" in that aspect of the
system. No doubt frustrated by the continued existence of
duality, the Court of Appeals ordered the school district to
take extraordinary measures to correct all manifestations of
this racial imbalance. Both decisions, in my view, were in
error, and I therefore concur in the Court's decision to vacate
the judgment and remand the case.

I also am in agreement with what I consider to be the
holdings of the Court. I agree that in some circumstances
the District Court need not interfere with a particular portion of the school system, even while, in my view, it must
retain jurisdiction over the entire system until all vestiges
of state-imposed segregation have been eliminated. See
ante, at 490-491. I also agree that whether the District
Court must order DCSS to balance student assignments depends on whether the current imbalance is traceable to unlawful state policy and on whether such an order is necessary
to fashion an effective remedy. See ante, at 491, 493-494,
497-498. Finally, I agree that the good faith of the school
board is relevant to these inquiries. See ante, at 498-499.

237 (1991), this Court has recognized that when the localgovernment has been running de jure segregated schools, it
is the operation of a racially segregated school system thatmust be remedied, not discriminatory policy in some discrete
subpart of that system. Consequently, the Court in the pasthas required, and decides again today, that even if the school
system ceases to discriminate with respect to one of the
Green-type factors, "the [district] court should retain juris-diction until it is clear that state-imposed segregation has

been completely removed." Green v. School Bd. of New
Kent County, 391 U. S. 430, 439 (1968) (emphasis added);Raney v. Board of Ed. of Gould School Dist., 391 U. S. 443,

449 (1968); see ante, at 491.That the District Court's jurisdiction should continue until
the school board demonstrates full compliance with the Con-stitution follows from the reasonable skepticism that underlies judicial supervision in the first instance. This Courtnoted in

Dowell: "A district court need not accept at facevalue the profession of a school board which has intentionally

discriminated that it will cease to do so in the future." 498U. S., at 249. It makes little sense, it seems to me, for the
court to disarm itself by renouncing jurisdiction in one as-pect of a school system, while violations of the Equal Protec503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT

tion Clause persist in other aspects of the same system. Cf.
Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, 413 U. S. 189, 207 (1973).
It would seem especially misguided to place unqualified reli-ance on the school board's promises in this case, because the

two areas of the school system the District Court found still
in violation of the Constitution--expenditures and teacherassignments--are two of the

Green factors over which DCSS
exercises the greatest control.The obligations of a district court and a school district

under its jurisdiction have been clearly articulated in theCourt's many desegregation cases. Until the desegregation
decree is dissolved under the standards set forth in Dowell,
the school board continues to have "the affirmative duty to
take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch." Green, 391 U. S., at 437-438. The
duty remains enforceable by the district court without any
new proof of a constitutional violation, and the school district
has the burden of proving that its actions are eradicating the
effects of the former de jure regime. See Dayton Board of
Education v. Brinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 537 (1979); Keyes, 413
U. S., at 208-211; Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of
Education, 402 U. S. 1, 26 (1971); Green, 391 U. S., at 439.

Contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion, however,
retaining jurisdiction does not obligate the district court in
all circumstances to maintain active supervision and control,
continually ordering reassignment of students. The "duty"
of the district court is to guarantee that the school district
" `eliminate[s] the discriminatory effects of the past as well
as to bar like discrimination in the future.' " Green, 391
U. S., at 438, n. 4. This obligation requires the court to
review school-board actions to ensure that each one "will
further rather than delay conversion to a unitary, nonracial
nondiscriminatory school system." Monroe v. Board of
Comm'rs of Jackson, 391 U. S. 450, 459 (1968); see also Dayton Board of Education, 443 U. S., at 538; United States v.

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
Scotland Neck Board of Education, 407 U. S. 484, 489 (1972).But this obligation does not always require the district court

to order new, affirmative action simply because of racial im-balance in student assignment.

Whether a district court must maintain active supervisionover student assignment, and order new remedial actions,
depends on two factors. As the Court discusses, the districtcourt must order changes in student assignment if it "is necessary or practicable to achieve compliance in other facets ofthe school system."

Ante, at 497; see also ante, at 507 (Souter, J., concurring). The district court also must order af-firmative action in school attendance if the school district's

conduct was a "contributing cause" of the racially identifiableschools. Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U. S.
449, 465, n. 13 (1979); see also Keyes, 413 U. S., at 211, andn. 17 (the school board must prove that its conduct "did not
create or contribute to" the racial identifiability of schools orthat racially identifiable schools are "in no way the result
of " school board action). It is the application of this lattercausation requirement that I now examine in more detail.

A

DCSS claims that it need not remedy the segregation inDeKalb County schools because it was caused by demographic changes for which DCSS has no responsibility. It isnot enough, however, for DCSS to establish that demographics exacerbated the problem; it must prove that its own poli-cies did not contribute.

1 The Court's cases make clear that there is a presumption in a former de
jure segregated school district that the board's actions caused the racially
identifiable schools, and it is the school board's obligation to rebut that
presumption. See Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U. S.

least two ways: DCSS may have contributed to the demo-graphic changes themselves, or it may have contributed directly to the racial imbalance in the schools.To determine DCSS' possible role in encouraging the residential segregation, the court must examine the situationwith special care. "[A] connection between past segregative
acts and present segregation may be present even when notapparent and . . . close examination is required before concluding that the connection does not exist." Keyes, 413U. S., at 211. Close examination is necessary because what
might seem to be purely private preferences in housing mayin fact have been created, in part, by actions of the school
district.

"People gravitate toward school facilities, just as schoolsare located in response to the needs of people. The

location of schools may thus influence the patterns ofresidential development of a metropolitan area and have
important impact on composition of inner-city neighbor-hoods."

Swann, 402 U. S., at 20-21.

This interactive effect between schools and housing choicesmay occur because many families are concerned about the

racial composition of a prospective school and will make resi-dential decisions accordingly.

2 Thus, schools that are demonstrably black or white provide a signal to these families,perpetuating and intensifying the residential movement.

See Keyes, 413 U. S., at 202; Columbus Board of Education, 443 U. S., at 465, n. 13; ante, at 507-508 (Souter, J.,concurring).

School systems can identify a school as "black" or "white"in a variety of ways; choosing to enroll a racially identifiable

student population is only the most obvious. The Court has
noted: "[T]he use of mobile classrooms, the drafting of student transfer policies, the transportation of students, and the
assignment of faculty and staff, on racially identifiable bases,
have the clear effect of earmarking schools according to their
racial composition." Keyes, 413 U. S., at 202. Because of
the various methods for identifying schools by race, even if
a school district manages to desegregate student assignments at one point, its failure to remedy the constitutional
violation in its entirety may result in resegregation, as
neighborhoods respond to the racially identifiable schools.
See ante, at 508-509 (Souter, J., concurring). Regardless
of the particular way in which the school district has encouraged residential segregation, this Court's decisions require
that the school district remedy the effect that such segregation has had on the school system.

In addition to exploring the school district's influence on
residential segregation, the District Court here should examine whether school-board actions might have contributed to
school segregation. Actions taken by a school district can
aggravate or eliminate school segregation independent of
residential segregation. School-board policies concerning
placement of new schools and closure of old schools and programs such as magnet classrooms and majority-to-minority
(M-to-M) transfer policies affect the racial composition of the
schools. See Swann, 402 U. S., at 20-21, 26-27. A school
district's failure to adopt policies that effectively desegregate
its schools continues the violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Columbus Board of Education, 443 U. S., at
458-459; Dayton Board of Education, 443 U. S., at 538.
The Court many times has noted that a school district is not
responsible for all of society's ills, but it bears full responsibility for schools that have never been desegregated. See,
e. g., Swann, supra.

B
The District Court's opinion suggests that it did not exam-ine DCSS' actions in light of the foregoing principles. The

court did note that the migration farther into the suburbswas accelerated by "white flight" from black schools and the
"blockbusting" of former white neighborhoods. It did notexamine, however, whether DCSS might have encouraged
that flight by assigning faculty and principals so as to iden-tify some schools as intended respectively for black students
or white students. See App. 226-231. Nor did the courtconsider how the placement of schools, the attendance zone
boundaries, or the use of mobile classrooms might have af-fected residential movement. The court, in my view, failed
to consider the many ways DCSS may have contributed tothe demographic shifts.

Nor did the District Court correctly analyze whetherDCSS' past actions had contributed to the school segregation
independent of residential segregation. The court did notrequire DCSS to bear the "heavy burden" of showing that
student assignment policies--policies that continued the ef-fects of the dual system--served important and legitimate
ends. See Dayton Board of Education, 443 U. S., at 538;
Swann, 402 U. S., at 26. Indeed, the District Court saidflatly that it would "not dwell on what might have been," but

would inquire only as to "what else should be done now."App. 221. But this Court's decisions

require the DistrictCourt to "dwell on what might have been." In particular,

they require the court to examine the past to determinewhether the current racial imbalance in the schools is attributable in part to the former de jure segregated regime orany later actions by school officials.

As the Court describes, the District Court placed greatemphasis on its conclusion that DCSS, in response to the
court order, had desegregated student assignment in 1969.DCSS' very first action taken in response to the court
decree, however, was to shape attendance zones to result

503us2$57M 11-14-95 20:11:46 PAGES OPINPGT
516 FREEMAN v. PITTS

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
in two schools that were more than 50% black, despite adistrict-wide black student population of less than 6%. See

ante, at 477-478. Within a year, another school becamemajority black, followed by four others within the next two
years. App. 304, 314, 350, 351, 368. Despite the existence
of these schools, the District Court found that DCSS effec-tively had desegregated for a short period of time with

respect to student assignment. See ante, at 478. TheDistrict Court justified this finding by linking the school
segregation exclusively to residential segregation existingprior to the court order. See

ibid.
But residential segregation that existed prior to the desegregation decree cannot provide an excuse. It is not
enough that DCSS adopt race-neutral policies in response to
a court desegregation decree. Instead, DCSS is obligated
to "counteract the continuing effects of past school segregation." Swann, 402 U. S., at 28. Accordingly, the school district did not meet its affirmative duty simply by adopting a
neighborhood-school plan, when already existing residential
segregation inevitably perpetuated the dual system. See
Davis v. Board of School Comm'rs of Mobile County, 402
U. S. 33, 37 (1971); Swann, 402 U. S., at 25-28, 30.

Virtually all the demographic changes that DCSS claims
caused the school segregation occurred after 1975. See
ante, at 475; App. 215, 260. Of particular relevance to the
causation inquiry, then, are DCSS' actions prior to 1975; failures during that period to implement the 1969 decree render
the school district's contentions that its noncompliance is due
simply to demographic changes less plausible.

A review of the record suggests that from 1969 until 1975,
DCSS failed to desegregate its schools. During that period,
the number of students attending racially identifiable schools
actually increased, and increased more quickly than the increase in black students. By 1975, 73% of black elementary
students and 56% of black high school students were attending majority black schools, although the percentages of black

students in the district population were just 20% and 13%,respectively. Id., at 269-380.

Of the 13 new elementary schools DCSS opened between1969 and 1975, 6 had a total of four black students in 1975.
Id., at 272, 299, 311, 316, 337, 353. One of the two highschools DCSS opened had no black students at all.

3 Id., at

367, 361. The only other measure taken by DCSS duringthe 1969-1975 period was to adopt the M-to-M transfer program in 1972. Due, however, to limitations imposed byschool-district administrators--including a failure to provide
transportation, "unnecessary red tape," and limits on avail-able transfer schools--only one-tenth of 1% of the students
were participating in the transfer program as of the 1975-1976 school year.

Id., at 75, 80.In 1976, when the District Court reviewed DCSS' actions

in the M-to-M program, it concluded that DCSS' limitationson the program "perpetuate the vestiges of a dual system."
Id., at 83. Noting that the Department of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare had found that DCSS had ignored its
responsibility affirmatively to eradicate segregation and per-petuate desegregation, the District Court found that attendance zone changes had perpetuated the dual system in thecounty. Id., at 89, 91.

Thus, in 1976, before most of the demographic changes, theDistrict Court found that DCSS had not complied with the
1969 order to eliminate the vestiges of its former de jureschool system. Indeed, the 1976 order found that DCSS had
contributed to the growing racial imbalance of its schools.Given these determinations in 1976, the District Court, at a
minimum, should have required DCSS to prove that, but forthe demographic changes between 1976 and 1985, its actions
would have been sufficient to "convert promptly to a systemwithout a `white' school and a `Negro' school, but just

3 By 1986, one of those two high schools was 2.4% black. The other was
91.7% black. Of the 13 elementary schools, 8 were either virtually all
black or all white and all were racially identifiable. App. 269-359.

schools." Green, 391 U. S., at 442. The available evidencesuggests that this would be a difficult burden for DCSS to

meet.DCSS has undertaken only limited remedial actions since
the 1976 court order. The number of students participatingin the M-to-M program has expanded somewhat, composing
about 6% of the current student population. The districtalso has adopted magnet programs, but they involve fewer
than 1% of the system's students. Doubtless DCSS couldhave started and expanded its magnet and M-to-M programs
more promptly; it could have built and closed schools with aview toward promoting integration of both schools and
neighborhoods; redrawn attendance zones; integrated its fac-ulty and administrators; and spent its funds equally. But it
did not. DCSS must prove that the measures it actuallyimplemented satisfy its obligation to eliminate the vestiges
of de jure segregation originally discovered in 1969, and stillfound to exist in 1976.

III
The District Court apparently has concluded that DCSSshould be relieved of the responsibility to desegregate because such responsibility would be burdensome. To be sure,changes in demographic patterns aggravated the vestiges of
segregation and made it more difficult for DCSS to desegre-gate. But an integrated school system is no less desirable
because it is difficult to achieve, and it is no less a constitu-tional imperative because that imperative has gone unmet
for 38 years.Although respondents challenged the District Court's causation conclusions in the Court of Appeals, that court did notreach the issue. Accordingly, in addition to the issues the
Court suggests be considered in further proceedings, I wouldremand for the Court of Appeals to review, under the foregoing principles, the District Court's finding that DCSS hasmet its burden of proving the racially identifiable schools are
in no way the result of past segregative action.

YEE et al. v. CITY OF ESCONDIDO, CALIFORNIA

certiorari to the court of appeal of california,fourth appellate district

No. 90-1947. Argued January 22, 1992--Decided April 1, 1992
The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause generally requires just compensation where the government authorizes a physical occupation of property.
But where the government merely regulates the property's use, compensation is required only if considerations such as the regulation's purpose or the extent to which it deprives the owner of the property's
economic use suggests that the regulation has unfairly singled out the
property owner to bear a burden that should be borne by the public as a
whole. Petitioners, mobile home park owners in respondent Escondido,
California, rent pads of land to mobile home owners. When the homes
are sold, the new owners generally continue to rent the pads. Under
the California Mobilehome Residency Law, the bases upon which a park
owner may terminate a mobile home owner's tenancy are limited to,
inter alia, nonpayment of rent and the park owner's desire to change
the use of his land. The park owner may not require the removal of a
mobile home when it is sold and may neither charge a transfer fee for
the sale nor disapprove of a purchaser who is able to pay rent. The
state law does not limit the rent the park owner may charge, but Escondido has a rent control ordinance setting mobile home rents back to
their 1986 levels and prohibiting rent increases without the city council's
approval. The Superior Court dismissed lawsuits filed by petitioners
and others challenging the ordinance, rejecting the argument that the
ordinance effected a physical taking by depriving park owners of all use
and occupancy of their property and granting to their tenants, and their
tenants' successors, the right to physically permanently occupy and use
the property. The Court of Appeal affirmed.

Held:

1. The rent control ordinance does not authorize an unwanted physical occupation of petitioners' property and thus does not amount to a
per se taking. Petitioners' argument--that the rent control ordinance
authorizes a physical taking because, coupled with the state law's restrictions, it increases a mobile home's value by giving the homeowner
the right to occupy the pad indefinitely at a submarket rent--is unpersuasive. The government effects a physical taking only where it requires the landowner to submit to the physical occupation of his land.
Here, petitioners have voluntarily rented their land to mobile home

Syllabus
owners and are not required to continue to do so by either the city or
the State. On their face, the laws at issue merely regulate petitioners'
use of their land by regulating the relationship between landlord and
tenant. Any transfer of wealth from park owners to incumbent mobile
home owners in the form of submarket rent does not itself convert regulation into physical invasion. Additional contentions made by petitioners--that the ordinance benefits current mobile home owners but not
future owners, who must purchase the homes at premiums resulting
from the homes' increased value, and that the ordinance deprives petitioners of the ability to choose their incoming tenants--might have some
bearing on whether the ordinance causes a regulatory taking, but have
nothing to do with whether it causes a physical taking. Moreover, the
footnote in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S.
419, 439, n. 17--that a physical taking claim cannot be defeated by an
argument that a landlord can avoid a statute's restrictions by ceasing to
rent his property, because his ability to rent may not be conditioned on
forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical occupation--has no
relevance here, where there has been no physical taking. Since petitioners have made no attempt to change how their land is used, this case
also presents no occasion to consider whether the statute, as applied,
prevents them from making a change. Pp. 526-532.

2. Petitioners' claim that the ordinance constitutes a denial of substantive due process is not properly before this Court because it was
not raised below or addressed by the state courts. The question
whether this Court's customary refusal to consider claims not raised or
addressed below is a jurisdictional or prudential rule need not be resolved here, because even if the rule were prudential, it would be adhered to in this case. Pp. 532-533.

3. Also improperly before this Court is petitioners' claim that the
ordinance constitutes a regulatory taking. The regulatory taking claim
is ripe for review; and the fact that it was not raised below does not
mean that it could not be properly raised before this Court, since once
petitioners properly raised a taking claim, they could have formulated,
in this Court, any argument they liked in support of that claim. Nonetheless, the claim will not be considered because, under this Court's Rule
14.1(a), only questions set forth, or fairly included, in the petition for
certiorari are considered. Rule 14.1(a) is prudential, but is disregarded
only where reasons of urgency or economy suggest the need to address
the unpresented question in the case under consideration. The Rule
provides the respondent with notice of the grounds on which certiorari
is sought, thus relieving him of the expense of unnecessary litigation on
the merits and the burden of opposing certiorari on unpresented questions. It also assists the Court in selecting the cases in which certiorari

will be granted. By forcing the parties to focus on the questions the
Court views as particularly important, the Rule enables the Court to
use its resources efficiently. Petitioners' question presented was
whether the lower court erred in finding no physical taking, and the
regulatory taking claim is related to, but not fairly included in, that
question. Thus, petitioners must overcome the very heavy presumption against consideration of the regulatory taking claim, which they
have not done. While that claim is important, lower courts have not
reached conflicting results on the claim as they have on the physical
taking claim. Prudence also dictates awaiting a case in which the issue
was fully litigated below, to have the benefit of developed arguments
and lower court opinions squarely addressing the question. Thus, the
regulatory taking issue should be left for the California courts to address in the first instance. Pp. 533-538.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides:
"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." Most of our cases interpreting the
Clause fall within two distinct classes. Where the government authorizes a physical occupation of property (or actually takes title), the Takings Clause generally requires compensation. See, e. g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 426 (1982). But where the government merely regulates the use of property, compensation

is required only if considerations such as the purpose of the
regulation or the extent to which it deprives the owner of
the economic use of the property suggest that the regulation
has unfairly singled out the property owner to bear a burden
that should be borne by the public as a whole. See, e. g.,
Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S.
104, 123-125 (1978). The first category of cases requires
courts to apply a clear rule; the second necessarily entails
complex factual assessments of the purposes and economic
effects of government actions.

Petitioners own mobile home parks in Escondido, California. They contend that a local rent control ordinance, when
viewed against the backdrop of California's Mobilehome Residency Law, amounts to a physical occupation of their property, entitling them to compensation under the first category
of cases discussed above.

I

The term "mobile home" is somewhat misleading. Mobile
homes are largely immobile as a practical matter, because
the cost of moving one is often a significant fraction of the
value of the mobile home itself. They are generally placed
permanently in parks; once in place, only about 1 in every
100 mobile homes is ever moved. Hirsch & Hirsch, LegalEconomic Analysis of Rent Controls in a Mobile Home Context: Placement Values and Vacancy Decontrol, 35 UCLA L.
Rev. 399, 405 (1988). A mobile home owner typically rents
a plot of land, called a "pad," from the owner of a mobile
home park. The park owner provides private roads within
the park, common facilities such as washing machines or a
swimming pool, and often utilities. The mobile home owner
often invests in site-specific improvements such as a driveway, steps, walkways, porches, or landscaping. When the
mobile home owner wishes to move, the mobile home is usually sold in place, and the purchaser continues to rent the
pad on which the mobile home is located.

524 YEE v. ESCONDIDO

Opinion of the Court
In 1978, California enacted its Mobilehome Residency Law,Cal. Civ. Code Ann. $ 798 (West 1982 and Supp. 1991). The

legislature found "that, because of the high cost of movingmobilehomes, the potential for damage resulting therefrom,
the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes,
and the cost of landscaping or lot preparation, it is necessarythat the owners of mobilehomes occupied within mobilehome

parks be provided with the unique protection from actualor constructive eviction afforded by the provisions of this
chapter." $ 798.55(a).The Mobilehome Residency Law limits the bases upon
which a park owner may terminate a mobile home owner's
tenancy. These include the nonpayment of rent, the mobile
home owner's violation of law or park rules, and the park
owner's desire to change the use of his land. $ 798.56.
While a rental agreement is in effect, however, the park
owner generally may not require the removal of a mobile
home when it is sold. $ 798.73. The park owner may neither charge a transfer fee for the sale, $ 798.72, nor disapprove of the purchaser, provided that the purchaser has the
ability to pay the rent, $ 798.74. The Mobilehome Residency
Law contains a number of other detailed provisions, but none
limit the rent the park owner may charge.

In the wake of the Mobilehome Residency Law, various
communities in California adopted mobile home rent control
ordinances. See Hirsch & Hirsch, supra, at 408-411. The
voters of Escondido did the same in 1988 by approving Proposition K, the rent control ordinance challenged here. The
ordinance sets rents back to their 1986 levels and prohibits
rent increases without the approval of the city council.
Park owners may apply to the council for rent increases at
any time. The council must approve any increases it determines to be "just, fair and reasonable," after considering the
following nonexclusive list of factors: (1) changes in the
Consumer Price Index; (2) the rent charged for comparable
mobile home pads in Escondido; (3) the length of time since

the last rent increase; (4) the cost of any capital improve-ments related to the pad or pads at issue; (5) changes in

property taxes; (6) changes in any rent paid by the parkowner for the land; (7) changes in utility charges; (8) changes
in operating and maintenance expenses; (9) the need for
repairs other than for ordinary wear and tear; (10) theamount and quality of services provided to the affected

tenant; and (11) any lawful existing lease. Ordinance $ 4(g),App. 11-12.

Petitioners John and Irene Yee own the Friendly Hills andSunset Terrace Mobile Home Parks, both of which are located in the city of Escondido. A few months after the
adoption of Escondido's rent control ordinance, they filed suit
in San Diego County Superior Court. According to the complaint, "[t]he rent control law has had the effect of depriving
the plaintiffs of all use and occupancy of [their] real property
and granting to the tenants of mobilehomes presently in The
Park, as well as the successors in interest of such tenants,
the right to physically permanently occupy and use the real
property of Plaintiff." Id., at 3, || 6. The Yees requested
damages of $6 million, a declaration that the rent control
ordinance is unconstitutional, and an injunction barring the
ordinance's enforcement. Id., at 5-6.

In their opposition to the city's demurrer, the Yees relied
almost entirely on Hall v. Santa Barbara, 833 F. 2d 1270
(CA9 1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 940 (1988), which had held
that a similar mobile home rent control ordinance effected a
physical taking under Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982). The Yees candidly admitted that "in fact, the Hall decision was used [as] a guide
in drafting the present Complaint." 2 Tr. 318, Points & Authorities in Opposition to Demurrer 4. The Superior Court
nevertheless sustained the city's demurrer and dismissed the
Yees' complaint. App. to Pet. for Cert. C-42.

The Yees were not alone. Eleven other park owners filed
similar suits against the city shortly afterwards, and all were

dismissed. By stipulation, all 12 cases were consolidated forappeal; the parties agreed that all would be submitted for

decision by the California Court of Appeal on the briefs andoral argument in the Yee case.

The Court of Appeal affirmed, in an opinion primarilydevoted to expressing the court's disagreement with the
reasoning of Hall. The court concluded: "Loretto in noway suggests that the Escondido ordinance authorizes a
permanent physical occupation of the landlord's propertyand therefore constitutes a per se taking." 224 Cal. App.
3d 1349, 1358, 274 Cal. Rptr. 551, 557 (1990). The Califor-nia Supreme Court denied review. App. to Pet. for Cert.
B-41.Eight of the twelve park owners, including the Yees,
joined in a petition for certiorari. We granted certiorari,502 U. S. 905 (1991), to resolve the conflict between the decision below and those of two of the Federal Courts of Ap-peals, in Hall, supra, and Pinewood Estates of Michigan
v. Barnegat Township Leveling Board, 898 F. 2d 347 (CA31990).

II
Petitioners do not claim that the ordinary rent controlstatutes regulating housing throughout the country violate

the Takings Clause. Brief for Petitioners 7, 10. Cf. Pen-nell v. San Jose, 485 U. S. 1, 12, n. 6 (1988); Loretto, supra,
at 440. Instead, their argument is predicated on the unusualeconomic relationship between park owners and mobile home
owners. Park owners may no longer set rents or decide whotheir tenants will be. As a result, according to petitioners,
any reduction in the rent for a mobile home pad causes acorresponding increase in the value of a mobile home, because the mobile home owner now owns, in addition to a mo-bile home, the right to occupy a pad at a rent below the value
that would be set by the free market. Cf. Hirsch & Hirsch,35 UCLA L. Rev., at 425. Because under the California Mobilehome Residency Law the park owner cannot evict a mo503us2$58J 11-14-95 20:08:28 PAGES OPINPGT

527Cite as: 503 U. S. 519 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
bile home owner or easily convert the property to other uses,the argument goes, the mobile home owner is effectively a

perpetual tenant of the park, and the increase in the mobilehome's value thus represents the right to occupy a pad at
below-market rent indefinitely. And because the Mobilehome Residency Law permits the mobile home owner to sellthe mobile home in place, the mobile home owner can receive

a premium from the purchaser corresponding to this increasein value. The amount of this premium is not limited by the
Mobilehome Residency Law or the Escondido ordinance.As a result, petitioners conclude, the rent control ordinance
has transferred a discrete interest in land--the right to occupy the land indefinitely at a submarket rent--from the
park owner to the mobile home owner. Petitioners contend
that what has been transferred from park owner to mobile
home owner is no less than a right of physical occupation of
the park owner's land.

This argument, while perhaps within the scope of our regulatory taking cases, cannot be squared easily with our cases
on physical takings. The government effects a physical taking only where it requires the landowner to submit to the
physical occupation of his land. "This element of required
acquiescence is at the heart of the concept of occupation."
FCC v. Florida Power Corp., 480 U. S. 245, 252 (1987).
Thus whether the government floods a landowner's property,
Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166 (1872), or does no
more than require the landowner to suffer the installation of
a cable, Loretto, supra, the Takings Clause requires compensation if the government authorizes a compelled physical invasion of property.

But the Escondido rent control ordinance, even when considered in conjunction with the California Mobilehome Residency Law, authorizes no such thing. Petitioners voluntarily rented their land to mobile home owners. At least on
the face of the regulatory scheme, neither the city nor the
State compels petitioners, once they have rented their prop503us2$58J 11-14-95 20:08:28 PAGES OPINPGT
528 YEE v. ESCONDIDO

Opinion of the Court
erty to tenants, to continue doing so. To the contrary, theMobilehome Residency Law provides that a park owner who

wishes to change the use of his land may evict his tenants,albeit with 6 or 12 months notice. Cal. Civ. Code Ann.

$ 798.56(g). Put bluntly, no government has required any
physical invasion of petitioners' property. Petitioners' ten-ants were invited by petitioners, not forced upon them by

the government. See Florida Power, supra, at 252-253.While the "right to exclude" is doubtless, as petitioners assert, "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rightsthat are commonly characterized as property,"

Kaiser Aetna
v. United States, 444 U. S. 164, 176 (1979), we do not find that
right to have been taken from petitioners on the mere face
of the Escondido ordinance.

Petitioners suggest that the statutory procedure for
changing the use of a mobile home park is in practice "a kind
of gauntlet," in that they are not in fact free to change the
use of their land. Reply Brief for Petitioners 10, n. 16.
Because petitioners do not claim to have run that gauntlet,
however, this case provides no occasion to consider how the
procedure has been applied to petitioners' property, and we
accordingly confine ourselves to the face of the statute. See
Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S.
470, 493-495 (1987). A different case would be presented
were the statute, on its face or as applied, to compel a landowner over objection to rent his property or to refrain in
perpetuity from terminating a tenancy. See Florida Power,
supra, at 251-252, n. 6; see also Nollan v. California Coastal
Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 831-832 (1987); Fresh Pond Shopping
Center, Inc. v. Callahan, 464 U. S. 875, 877 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).

On their face, the state and local laws at issue here merely
regulate petitioners' use of their land by regulating the relationship between landlord and tenant. "This Court has consistently affirmed that States have broad power to regulate
housing conditions in general and the landlord-tenant rela503us2$58J 11-14-95 20:08:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tionship in particular without paying compensation for alleconomic injuries that such regulation entails."

Loretto,
458 U. S., at 440. See also Florida Power, supra, at 252("statutes regulating the economic relations of landlords and

tenants are not per se takings"). When a landowner decides
to rent his land to tenants, the government may place ceil-ings on the rents the landowner can charge, see,

e. g., Pennell, supra, at 12, n. 6, or require the landowner to accepttenants he does not like, see,

e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel,
Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 261 (1964), without auto-matically having to pay compensation. See also

PruneYard
Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 82-84 (1980). Such
forms of regulation are analyzed by engaging in the "essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries" necessary to determine
whether a regulatory taking has occurred. Kaiser Aetna,
supra, at 175. In the words of Justice Holmes, "while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes
too far it will be recognized as a taking." Pennsylvania
Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922).

Petitioners emphasize that the ordinance transfers wealth
from park owners to incumbent mobile home owners. Other
forms of land use regulation, however, can also be said to
transfer wealth from the one who is regulated to another.
Ordinary rent control often transfers wealth from landlords
to tenants by reducing the landlords' income and the tenants'
monthly payments, although it does not cause a one-time
transfer of value as occurs with mobile homes. Traditional
zoning regulations can transfer wealth from those whose activities are prohibited to their neighbors; when a property
owner is barred from mining coal on his land, for example,
the value of his property may decline but the value of his
neighbor's property may rise. The mobile home owner's
ability to sell the mobile home at a premium may make this
wealth transfer more visible than in the ordinary case, see
Epstein, Rent Control and the Theory of Efficient Regulation, 54 Brooklyn L. Rev. 741, 758-759 (1988), but the exist503us2$58J 11-14-95 20:08:28 PAGES OPINPGT
530 YEE v. ESCONDIDO

Opinion of the Court
ence of the transfer in itself does not convert regulation into
physical invasion.

Petitioners also rely heavily on their allegation that the
ordinance benefits incumbent mobile home owners without
benefiting future mobile home owners, who will be forced
to purchase mobile homes at premiums. Mobile homes, like
motor vehicles, ordinarily decline in value with age. But
the effect of the rent control ordinance, coupled with the restrictions on the park owner's freedom to reject new tenants,
is to increase significantly the value of the mobile home.
This increased value normally benefits only the tenant in
possession at the time the rent control is imposed. See
Hirsch & Hirsch, 35 UCLA L. Rev., at 430-431. Petitioners
are correct in citing the existence of this premium as a difference between the alleged effect of the Escondido ordinance
and that of an ordinary apartment rent control statute.
Most apartment tenants do not sell anything to their successors (and are often prohibited from charging "key money"),
so a typical rent control statute will transfer wealth from the
landlord to the incumbent tenant and all future tenants. By
contrast, petitioners contend that the Escondido ordinance
transfers wealth only to the incumbent mobile home owner.
This effect might have some bearing on whether the ordinance causes a regulatory taking, as it may shed some light
on whether there is a sufficient nexus between the effect of
the ordinance and the objectives it is supposed to advance.
See Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, supra, at 834-
835. But it has nothing to do with whether the ordinance
causes a physical taking. Whether the ordinance benefits
only current mobile home owners or all mobile home owners,
it does not require petitioners to submit to the physical occupation of their land.

The same may be said of petitioners' contention that the
ordinance amounts to compelled physical occupation because
it deprives petitioners of the ability to choose their incoming

Opinion of the Court
tenants.* Again, this effect may be relevant to a regula-tory taking argument, as it may be one factor a reviewing

court would wish to consider in determining whether theordinance unjustly imposes a burden on petitioners that
should "be compensated by the government, rather thanremain[ing] disproportionately concentrated on a few persons." Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,438 U. S., at 124. But it does not convert regulation into the
unwanted physical occupation of land. Because they volun-tarily open their property to occupation by others, petitioners cannot assert a per se right to compensation based ontheir inability to exclude particular individuals. See

Heart
of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S., at 261; seealso id., at 259 ("[A]ppellant has no `right' to select its guests

as it sees fit, free from governmental regulation"); Prune-Yard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S., at 82-84.

Petitioners' final line of argument rests on a footnote inLoretto, in which we rejected the contention that "the landlord could avoid the requirements of [the statute forcing herto permit cable to be permanently placed on her property]
by ceasing to rent the building to tenants." We found thispossibility insufficient to defeat a physical taking claim, because "a landlord's ability to rent his property may not beconditioned on his forfeiting the right to compensation for a
physical occupation." Loretto, 458 U. S., at 439, n. 17. Peti-tioners argue that if they have to leave the mobile home park
business in order to avoid the strictures of the Escondido

*Strictly speaking, the Escondido rent control ordinance only limits
rents. Petitioners' inability to select their incoming tenants is a product
of the State's Mobilehome Residency Law, the constitutionality of which
has never been at issue in this case. (The State, moreover, has never
been a party.) But we understand petitioners to be making a more subtle
argument--that before the adoption of the ordinance they were able to
influence a mobile home owner's selection of a purchaser by threatening
to increase the rent for prospective purchasers they disfavored. To the
extent the rent control ordinance deprives petitioners of this type of influence, petitioners' argument is one we must consider.

Opinion of the Court
ordinance, their ability to rent their property has in fact beenconditioned on such a forfeiture. This argument fails at its

base, however, because there has simply been no compelledphysical occupation giving rise to a right to compensation
that petitioners could have forfeited. Had the city requiredsuch an occupation, of course, petitioners would have a right
to compensation, and the city might then lack the power tocondition petitioners' ability to run mobile home parks on
their waiver of this right. Cf. Nollan v. California Coastal
Comm'n, 483 U. S., at 837. But because the ordinance doesnot effect a physical taking in the first place, this footnote in

Loretto does not help petitioners.With respect to physical takings, then, this case is not far
removed from FCC v. Florida Power Corp., 480 U. S. 245(1987), in which the respondent had voluntarily leased space
on its utility poles to a cable television company for the in-stallation of cables. The Federal Government, exercising its
statutory authority to regulate pole attachment agreements,substantially reduced the annual rent. We rejected the respondent's claim that "it is a taking under Loretto for a ten-ant invited to lease at a rent of $7.15 to remain at the regulated rent of $1.79." Id., at 252. We explained that "it isthe invitation, not the rent, that makes the difference. The
line which separates [this case] from Loretto is the unambig-uous distinction between a . . . lessee and an interloper with
a government license." Id., at 252-253. The distinction isequally unambiguous here. The Escondido rent control ordinance, even considered against the backdrop of California'sMobilehome Residency Law, does not authorize an unwanted
physical occupation of petitioners' property. It is a regula-tion of petitioners'

use of their property, and thus does notamount to a per se taking.

III
In this Court, petitioners attempt to challenge the ordi-nance on two additional grounds: They argue that it constitutes a denial of substantive due process and a regulatory

533Cite as: 503 U. S. 519 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
taking. Neither of these claims is properly before us. Thefirst was not raised or addressed below, and the second is

not fairly included in the question on which we grantedcertiorari.

A
The Yees did not include a due process claim in their com-plaint. Nor did petitioners raise a due process claim in the

Court of Appeal. It was not until their petition for reviewin the California Supreme Court that petitioners finally
raised a substantive due process claim. But the CaliforniaSupreme Court denied discretionary review. Such a denial,
as in this Court, expresses no view as to the merits. SeePeople v. Triggs, 8 Cal. 3d 884, 890-891, 506 P. 2d 232, 236
(1973). In short, petitioners did not raise a substantive dueprocess claim in the state courts, and no state court has addressed such a claim.In reviewing the judgments of state courts under the jurisdictional grant of 28 U. S. C. $ 1257, the Court has, withvery rare exceptions, refused to consider petitioners' claims
that were not raised or addressed below. Illinois v. Gates,462 U. S. 213, 218-220 (1983). While we have expressed inconsistent views as to whether this rule is jurisdictional orprudential in cases arising from state courts, see ibid., we
need not resolve the question here. (In cases arising fromfederal courts, the rule is prudential only. See, e. g., Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14, 17, n. 2 (1980).) Even if the rulewere prudential, we would adhere to it in this case. Because petitioners did not raise their substantive due processclaim below, and because the state courts did not address it,
we will not consider it here.

B
As a preliminary matter, we must address respondent'sassertion that a regulatory taking claim is unripe because

petitioners have not sought rent increases. While respond-ent is correct that a claim that the ordinance effects a regula503us2$58J 11-14-95 20:08:28 PAGES OPINPGT
534 YEE v. ESCONDIDO

Opinion of the Court
tory taking as applied to petitioners' property would beunripe for this reason, see

Williamson County Regional
Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473U. S. 172, 186-197 (1985), petitioners mount a

facial challenge to the ordinance. They allege in this Court that the
ordinance does not " `substantially advance' " a " `legitimatestate interest' " no matter how it is applied. See

Nollan v.
California Coastal Comm'n, supra, at 834; Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980). As this allegation does not
depend on the extent to which petitioners are deprived ofthe economic use of their particular pieces of property or the

extent to which these particular petitioners are compensated, petitioners' facial challenge is ripe. See Keystone
Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S., at 495;
Agins, supra, at 260.

We must also reject respondent's contention that the regulatory taking argument is not properly before us because it
was not made below. It is unclear whether petitioners made
this argument below: Portions of their complaint and briefing
can be read either to argue a regulatory taking or to support
their physical taking argument. For the same reason it is
equally ambiguous whether the Court of Appeal addressed
the issue. Yet petitioners' regulatory taking argument
stands in a posture different from their substantive due process claim.

Petitioners unquestionably raised a taking claim in the
state courts. The question whether the rent control ordinance took their property without compensation, in violation
of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, is thus properly
before us. Once a federal claim is properly presented, a
party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made
below. Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S.
71, 78, n. 2 (1988); Gates, supra, at 219-220; Dewey v. Des
Moines, 173 U. S. 193, 197-198 (1899). Petitioners' arguments that the ordinance constitutes a taking in two differ503us2$58J 11-14-95 20:08:28 PAGES OPINPGT

535Cite as: 503 U. S. 519 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
ent ways, by physical occupation and by regulation, are notseparate

claims. They are, rather, separate arguments in
support of a single claim--that the ordinance effects an un-constitutional taking. Having raised a taking claim in the

state courts, therefore, petitioners could have formulated
any argument they liked in support of that claim here.A litigant seeking review in this Court of a claim properly

raised in the lower courts thus generally possesses the abil-ity to frame the question to be decided in any way he
chooses, without being limited to the manner in which thequestion was framed below. While we have on occasion
rephrased the question presented by a petitioner, see, e. g.,
Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 502 U. S. 1023 (1992), or requested
the parties to address an important question of law not
raised in the petition for certiorari, see, e. g., Payne v. Tennessee, 498 U. S. 1080 (1991), by and large it is the petitioner
himself who controls the scope of the question presented.
The petitioner can generally frame the question as broadly
or as narrowly as he sees fit.

The framing of the question presented has significant consequences, however, because under this Court's Rule 14.1(a),
"[o]nly the questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court." While
"[t]he statement of any question presented will be deemed to
comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein,"
ibid., we ordinarily do not consider questions outside those
presented in the petition for certiorari. See, e. g., Berkemer
v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 443, n. 38 (1984). This rule is
prudential in nature, but we disregard it "only in the most
exceptional cases," Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 481, n. 15
(1976), where reasons of urgency or of economy suggest the
need to address the unpresented question in the case under
consideration.

Rule 14.1(a) serves two important and related purposes.
First, it provides the respondent with notice of the grounds
upon which the petitioner is seeking certiorari, and enables

503us2$58J 11-14-95 20:08:28 PAGES OPINPGT
536 YEE v. ESCONDIDO

Opinion of the Court
the respondent to sharpen the arguments as to why certio-rari should not be granted. Were we routinely to consider

questions beyond those raised in the petition, the respondentwould lack any opportunity in advance of litigation on the
merits to argue that such questions are not worthy of review.
Where, as is not unusual, the decision below involves issueson which the petitioner does

not seek certiorari, the respondent would face the formidable task of opposing certiorari onevery issue the Court might conceivably find present in the

case. By forcing the petitioner to choose his questions atthe outset, Rule 14.1(a) relieves the respondent of the expense of unnecessary litigation on the merits and the burden
of opposing certiorari on unpresented questions.

Second, Rule 14.1(a) assists the Court in selecting the
cases in which certiorari will be granted. Last Term alone
we received over 5,000 petitions for certiorari, but we have
the capacity to decide only a small fraction of these cases on
the merits. To use our resources most efficiently, we must
grant certiorari only in those cases that will enable us to
resolve particularly important questions. Were we routinely to entertain questions not presented in the petition
for certiorari, much of this efficiency would vanish, as parties
who feared an inability to prevail on the question presented
would be encouraged to fill their limited briefing space and
argument time with discussion of issues other than the one
on which certiorari was granted. Rule 14.1(a) forces the
parties to focus on the questions the Court has viewed as
particularly important, thus enabling us to make efficient use
of our resources.

We granted certiorari on a single question pertaining to
the Takings Clause: "Two federal courts of appeal have held
that the transfer of a premium value to a departing mobilehome tenant, representing the value of the right to occupy
at a reduced rate under local mobilehome rent control ordinances, constitute[s] an impermissible taking. Was it error
for the state appellate court to disregard the rulings and

Opinion of the Court
hold that there was no taking under the fifth and fourteenthamendments?" This was the question presented by petitioners. Pet. for Cert. i. It asks whether the court belowerred in disagreeing with the holdings of the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Ninth Circuits in Pinewood Estates
of Michigan v. Barnegat Township Leveling Board, 898F. 2d 347 (CA3 1990), and

Hall v. Santa Barbara, 833 F. 2d
1270 (CA9 1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 940 (1988). Thesecases, in turn, held that mobile home ordinances effected

physical takings, not regulatory takings. Fairly construed,then, petitioners' question presented is the equivalent of the
question "Did the court below err in finding no physical
taking?"

Whether or not the ordinance effects a regulatory taking
is a question related to the one petitioners presented, and
perhaps complementary to the one petitioners presented,
but it is not "fairly included therein." Consideration of
whether a regulatory taking occurred would not assist in
resolving whether a physical taking occurred as well; neither
of the two questions is subsidiary to the other. Both might
be subsidiary to a question embracing both--Was there a
taking?--but they exist side by side, neither encompassing
the other. Cf. American Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago
v. Haroco, Inc., 473 U. S. 606, 608 (1985) (question whether
complaint adequately alleges conduct of racketeering enterprise is not fairly included in question whether statute requires that plaintiff suffer damages through defendant's conduct of such an enterprise).

Rule 14.1(a) accordingly creates a heavy presumption
against our consideration of petitioners' claim that the ordinance causes a regulatory taking. Petitioners have not
overcome that presumption. While the regulatory taking
question is no doubt important, from an institutional perspective it is not as important as the physical taking question. The lower courts have not reached conflicting results,
so far as we know, on whether similar mobile home rent

Opinion of the Court
control ordinances effect regulatory takings. They havereached conflicting results over whether such ordinances

cause physical takings; such a conflict is, of course, a substan-tial reason for granting certiorari under this Court's Rule 10.
Moreover, the conflict is between two courts whose jurisdic-tion includes California, the State with the largest population and one with a relatively high percentage of the Nation'smobile homes. Forum shopping is thus of particular concern. See Azul Pacifico, Inc. v. Los Angeles, 948 F. 2d 575,579 (CA9 1991) (mobile home park owners may file physical
taking suits in either state or federal court). Prudence alsodictates awaiting a case in which the issue was fully litigated
below, so that we will have the benefit of developed argu-ments on both sides and lower court opinions squarely addressing the question. See Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc.,494 U. S. 545, 552, n. 3 (1990) ("Applying our analysis . . . to
the facts of a particular case without the benefit of a fullrecord or lower court determinations is not a sensible exercise of this Court's discretion"). In fact, were we to addressthe issue here, we would apparently be the first court in the
Nation to determine whether an ordinance like this one ef-fects a regulatory taking. We will accordingly follow Rule
14.1(a), and consider only the question petitioners raised inseeking certiorari. We leave the regulatory taking issue for
the California courts to address in the first instance.

We made this observation in Loretto:

"Our holding today is very narrow. We affirm thetraditional rule that a permanent physical occupation of

property is a taking. In such a case, the propertyowner entertains a historically rooted expectation of
compensation, and the character of the invasion is quali-tatively more intrusive than perhaps any other category
of property regulation. We do not, however, questionthe equally substantial authority upholding a State's

We respected this distinction again in Florida Power,where we held that no taking occurs under Loretto when a
tenant invited to lease at one rent remains at a lower regu-lated rent. Florida Power, 480 U. S., at 252-253. We continue to observe the distinction today. Because the Escon-dido rent control ordinance does not compel a landowner to
suffer the physical occupation of his property, it does noteffect a

per se taking under Loretto. The judgment of theCourt of Appeal is accordingly

Affirmed.
Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the Escondido ordinance is nota taking under this Court's analysis in

Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982). I also con-clude that the substantive due process and regulatory taking

claims are not properly raised in this Court. For that rea-son, I, unlike the Court, do not decide whether the regulatory taking claim is or is not ripe, or which of petitioners'arguments would or would not be relevant to such a claim.

Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the judgment and would join the Court's opin-ion except for its references to the relevance and significance

of petitioners' allegations to a claim of regulatory taking.

JACOBSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 90-1124. Argued November 6, 1991--Decided April 6, 1992
At a time when federal law permitted such conduct, petitioner Jacobson

ordered and received from a bookstore two Bare Boys magazines containing photographs of nude preteen and teenage boys. Subsequently,
the Child Protection Act of 1984 made illegal the receipt through the
mails of sexually explicit depictions of children. After finding Jacobson's name on the bookstore mailing list, two Government agencies sent
mail to him through five fictitious organizations and a bogus pen pal, to
explore his willingness to break the law. Many of those organizations
represented that they were founded to protect and promote sexual freedom and freedom of choice and that they promoted lobbying efforts
through catalog sales. Some mailings raised the spectre of censorship.
Jacobson responded to some of the correspondence. After 21/2 years
on the Government mailing list, Jacobson was solicited to order child
pornography. He answered a letter that described concern about child
pornography as hysterical nonsense and decried international censorship, and then received a catalog and ordered a magazine depicting
young boys engaged in sexual activities. He was arrested after a controlled delivery of a photocopy of the magazine, but a search of his house
revealed no materials other than those sent by the Government and the
Bare Boys magazines. At his jury trial, he pleaded entrapment and
testified that he had been curious to know the type of sexual actions to
which the last letter referred and that he had been shocked by the Bare
Boys magazines because he had not expected to receive photographs of
minors. He was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The prosecution failed, as a matter of law, to adduce evidence to

support the jury verdict that Jacobson was predisposed, independent of
the Government's acts and beyond a reasonable doubt, to violate the
law by receiving child pornography through the mails. In their zeal to
enforce the law, Government agents may not originate a criminal design,
implant in an innocent person's mind the disposition to commit a criminal act, and then induce commission of the crime so that the Government
may prosecute. Sorrells v. United States, 287 U. S. 435, 442. Jacobson
was not simply offered the opportunity to order pornography, after
which he promptly availed himself of that opportunity. He was the target of 26 months of repeated Government mailings and communications,

Syllabus
and the Government has failed to carry its burden of proving predisposition independent of its attention. The preinvestigation evidence--
the Bare Boys magazines--merely indicates a generic inclination to act
within a broad range, not all of which is criminal. Furthermore, Jacobson was acting within the law when he received the magazines, and he
testified that he did not know that they would depict minors. As for
the evidence gathered during the investigation, Jacobson's responses to
the many communications prior to the criminal act were at most indicative of certain personal inclinations and would not support the inference
that Jacobson was predisposed to violate the Child Protection Act. On
the other hand, the strong arguable inference is that, by waving the
banner of individual rights and disparaging the legitimacy and constitutionality of efforts to restrict the availability of sexually explicit materials, the Government not only excited Jacobson's interest in material
banned by law but also exerted substantial pressure on him to obtain
and read such material as part of the fight against censorship and the
infringement of individual rights. Thus, rational jurors could not find
beyond a reasonable doubt that Jacobson possessed the requisite predisposition before the Government's investigation and that it existed
independent of the Government's many and varied approaches to him.

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
On September 24, 1987, petitioner Keith Jacobson was indicted for violating a provision of the Child Protection Actof 1984 (Act), Pub. L. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204, which criminalizes

the knowing receipt through the mails of a "visual depiction[that] involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct . . . ." 18 U. S. C. $ 2252(a)(2)(A). Petitionerdefended on the ground that the Government entrapped him
into committing the crime through a series of communications from undercover agents that spanned the 26 monthspreceding his arrest. Petitioner was found guilty after a

jury trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction,holding that the Government had carried its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that petitioner was predisposedto break the law and hence was not entrapped.

Because the Government overstepped the line between
setting a trap for the "unwary innocent" and the "unwary
criminal," Sherman v. United States, 356 U. S. 369, 372
(1958), and as a matter of law failed to establish that petitioner was independently predisposed to commit the crime
for which he was arrested, we reverse the Court of Appeals'
judgment affirming his conviction.

In February 1984, petitioner, a 56-year-old veteranturned-farmer who supported his elderly father in Nebraska,
ordered two magazines and a brochure from a California
adult bookstore. The magazines, entitled Bare Boys I and
Bare Boys II, contained photographs of nude preteen and

Opinion of the Court
teenage boys. The contents of the magazines startledpetitioner, who testified that he had expected to receive

photographs of "young men 18 years or older." Tr. 425.On cross-examination, he explained his response to the
magazines:

"[PROSECUTOR]: [Y]ou were shocked and surprisedthat there were pictures of very young boys without

clothes on, is that correct?
"[JACOBSON]: Yes, I was.
"[PROSECUTOR]: Were you offended?. . . . .

"[JACOBSON]: I was not offended because I thoughtthese were a nudist type publication. Many of the
pictures were out in a rural or outdoor setting. Therewas--I didn't draw any sexual connotation or connection
with that." Id., at 463.
The young men depicted in the magazines were not engagedin sexual activity, and petitioner's receipt of the magazines

was legal under both federal and Nebraska law. Withinthree months, the law with respect to child pornography
changed; Congress passed the Act illegalizing the receiptthrough the mails of sexually explicit depictions of children.
In the very month that the new provision became law, postalinspectors found petitioner's name on the mailing list of the
California bookstore that had mailed him Bare Boys I andII. There followed over the next 2

1/2 years repeated efforts

by two Government agencies, through five fictitious organi-zations and a bogus pen pal, to explore petitioner's willingness to break the new law by ordering sexually explicit pho-tographs of children through the mail.

The Government began its efforts in January 1985 when apostal inspector sent petitioner a letter supposedly from the
American Hedonist Society, which in fact was a fictitious or-ganization. The letter included a membership application
and stated the Society's doctrine: that members had the

544 JACOBSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
"right to read what we desire, the right to discuss similarinterests with those who share our philosophy, and finally

that we have the right to seek pleasure without restrictionsbeing placed on us by outdated puritan morality." Record,
Government Exhibit 7. Petitioner enrolled in the organization and returned a sexual attitude questionnaire that askedhim to rank on a scale of one to four his enjoyment of various

sexual materials, with one being "really enjoy," two being"enjoy," three being "somewhat enjoy," and four being "do
not enjoy." Petitioner ranked the entry "[p]re-teen sex" as atwo, but indicated that he was opposed to pedophilia.

Ibid.
For a time, the Government left petitioner alone. But
then a new "prohibited mailing specialist" in the Postal
Service found petitioner's name in a file, Tr. 328-331, and
in May 1986, petitioner received a solicitation from a second
fictitious consumer research company, "Midlands Data Research," seeking a response from those who "believe in the
joys of sex and the complete awareness of those lusty and
youthful lads and lasses of the neophite [sic] age." Record,
Government Exhibit 8. The letter never explained whether
"neophite" referred to minors or young adults. Petitioner
responded: "Please feel free to send me more information, I
am interested in teenage sexuality. Please keep my name
confidential." Ibid.

Petitioner then heard from yet another Government creation, "Heartland Institute for a New Tomorrow" (HINT),
which proclaimed that it was "an organization founded to
protect and promote sexual freedom and freedom of choice.
We believe that arbitrarily imposed legislative sanctions restricting your sexual freedom should be rescinded through
the legislative process." Id., Defendant's Exhibit 102. The
letter also enclosed a second survey. Petitioner indicated
that his interest in "[p]reteen sex-homosexual" material was
above average, but not high. In response to another question, petitioner wrote: "Not only sexual expression but freedom of the press is under attack. We must be ever vigilant

Opinion of the Court
to counter attack right wing fundamentalists who are deter-mined to curtail our freedoms." Id., Government Exhibit 9.

HINT replied, portraying itself as a lobbying organizationseeking to repeal "all statutes which regulate sexual activities, except those laws which deal with violent behavior, suchas rape. HINT is also lobbying to eliminate any legal definition of `the age of consent.' " Id., Defendant's Exhibit 113.These lobbying efforts were to be funded by sales from a
catalog to be published in the future "offering the sale ofvarious items which we believe you will find to be both interesting and stimulating." Ibid. HINT also provided com-puter matching of group members with similar survey responses; and, although petitioner was supplied with a list ofpotential "pen pals," he did not initiate any correspondence.

Nevertheless, the Government's "prohibited mailing spe-cialist" began writing to petitioner, using the pseudonym
"Carl Long." The letters employed a tactic known as "mir-roring," which the inspector described as "reflect[ing] whatever the interests are of the person we are writing to." Tr.342. Petitioner responded at first, indicating that his interest was primarily in "male-male items." Record, Govern-ment Exhibit 9A. Inspector "Long" wrote back:

"My interests too are primarily male-male items.Are you satisfied with the type of VCR tapes available?
Personally, I like the amateur stuff better if its [sic]well produced as it can get more kinky and also seems
more real. I think the actors enjoy it more." Id., Gov-ernment Exhibit 13.

Petitioner responded:

"As far as my likes are concerned, I like good lookingyoung guys (in their late teens and early 20's) doing

their thing together." Id., Government Exhibit 14.
Petitioner's letters to "Long" made no reference to childpornography. After writing two letters, petitioner discontinued the correspondence.

Opinion of the Court
By March 1987, 34 months had passed since the Govern-ment obtained petitioner's name from the mailing list of the

California bookstore, and 26 months had passed since thePostal Service had commenced its mailings to petitioner. Although petitioner had responded to surveys and letters, theGovernment had no evidence that petitioner had ever intentionally possessed or been exposed to child pornography.The Postal Service had not checked petitioner's mail to determine whether he was receiving questionable mailingsfrom persons--other than the Government--involved in the
child pornography industry. Tr. 348.At this point, a second Government agency, the Customs
Service, included petitioner in its own child pornographysting, "Operation Borderline," after receiving his name on
lists submitted by the Postal Service. Id., at 71-72. Usingthe name of a fictitious Canadian company called "Produit
Outaouais," the Customs Service mailed petitioner a bro-chure advertising photographs of young boys engaging in
sex. Record, Government Exhibit 22. Petitioner placed anorder that was never filled.

Id., Government Exhibit 24.The Postal Service also continued its efforts in the Jacobson case, writing to petitioner as the "Far Eastern TradingCompany Ltd." The letter began:

"As many of you know, much hysterical nonsense hasappeared in the American media concerning `pornography' and what must be done to stop it from comingacross your borders. This brief letter does not allow us
to give much comments; however, why is your govern-ment spending millions of dollars to exercise international censorship while tons of drugs, which makesyours the world's most crime ridden country are passed
through easily." Id., Government Exhibit 1.
The letter went on to say:

"[W]e have devised a method of getting these to youwithout prying eyes of U. S. Customs seizing your

mail. . . . After consultations with American solicitors,we have been advised that once we have posted our material through your system, it cannot be opened for anyinspection without authorization of a judge." Ibid.

The letter invited petitioner to send for more information.It also asked petitioner to sign an affirmation that he was
"not a law enforcement officer or agent of the U. S. Govern-ment acting in an undercover capacity for the purpose of
entrapping Far Eastern Trading Company, its agents or cus-tomers." Petitioner responded.

Ibid. A catalog was sent,id., Government Exhibit 2, and petitioner ordered Boys Who

Love Boys, id., Government Exhibit 3, a pornographic maga-zine depicting young boys engaged in various sexual activities. Petitioner was arrested after a controlled delivery ofa photocopy of the magazine.

When petitioner was asked at trial why he placed such anorder, he explained that the Government had succeeded in
piquing his curiosity:

"Well, the statement was made of all the trouble and thehysteria over pornography and I wanted to see what the

material was. It didn't describe the--I didn't know forsure what kind of sexual action they were referring to
in the Canadian letter." Tr. 427-428.
In petitioner's home, the Government found the Bare Boysmagazines and materials that the Government had sent to

him in the course of its protracted investigation, but no othermaterials that would indicate that petitioner collected, or
was actively interested in, child pornography.Petitioner was indicted for violating 18 U. S. C. $ 2252(a)

There can be no dispute about the evils of child pornogra-phy or the difficulties that laws and law enforcement have

encountered in eliminating it. See generally Osborne v.
Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 110 (1990); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S.747, 759-760 (1982). Likewise, there can be no dispute that

the Government may use undercover agents to enforce thelaw. "It is well settled that the fact that officers or employees of the Government merely afford opportunities or facili-ties for the commission of the offense does not defeat the
prosecution. Artifice and stratagem may be employed tocatch those engaged in criminal enterprises."

Sorrells v.United States, 287 U. S. 435, 441 (1932); Sherman, 356 U. S.,

at 372; United States v. Russell, 411 U. S. 423, 435-436(1973).

In their zeal to enforce the law, however, Governmentagents may not originate a criminal design, implant in an

Government may prosecute. Sorrells, supra, at 442; Sherman, supra, at 372. Where the Government has induced an

agents did not have any intent or disposition to commit the crime charged

to commit that crime, then he was entrapped. On the other hand, if the
defendant before contact with law-enforcement officers or their agents did
have an intent or disposition to commit the crime charged, then he was not
entrapped even though law-enforcement officers or their agents provided a
favorable opportunity to commit the crime or made committing the crime
easier or even participated in acts essential to the crime." App. 11-12.

beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was disposed tocommit the criminal act prior to first being approached by
Government agents. United States v. Whoie, 288 U. S. App.D. C. 261, 263-264, 925 F. 2d 1481, 1483-1484 (1991).

Thus, an agent deployed to stop the traffic in illegal drugsmay offer the opportunity to buy or sell drugs and, if the

offer is accepted, make an arrest on the spot or later. In

2 Inducement is not at issue in this case. The Government does not
dispute that it induced petitioner to commit the crime. The sole issue is
whether the Government carried its burden of proving that petitioner was
predisposed to violate the law before the Government intervened. The
dissent is mistaken in claiming that this is an innovation in entrapment
law and in suggesting that the Government's conduct prior to the moment
of solicitation is irrelevant. See post, at 556-557. The Court rejected
these arguments six decades ago in Sorrells v. United States, 287 U. S.
435 (1932), when the Court wrote that the Government may not punish an
individual "for an alleged offense which is the product of the creative activity of its own officials" and that in such a case the Government "is in
no position to object to evidence of the activities of its representatives in
relation to the accused . . . ." Id., at 451. Indeed, the proposition that
the accused must be predisposed prior to contact with law enforcement
officers is so firmly established that the Government conceded the point
at oral argument, submitting that the evidence it developed during the
course of its investigation was probative because it indicated petitioner's
state of mind prior to the commencement of the Government's investigation. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 49.

This long-established standard in no way encroaches upon Government
investigatory activities. Indeed, the Government's internal guidelines for
undercover operations provide that an inducement to commit a crime
should not be offered unless:

"(a) [T]here is a reasonable indication, based on information developed
through informants or other means, that the subject is engaging, has engaged, or is likely to engage in illegal activity of a similar type; or

"(b) The opportunity for illegal activity has been structured so that
there is reason for believing that persons drawn to the opportunity, or
brought to it, are predisposed to engage in the contemplated illegal activity." Attorney General's Guidelines on FBI Undercover Operations (Dec.
31, 1980), reprinted in S. Rep. No. 97-682, p. 551 (1982).

503us2$59D 11-14-95 20:12:13 PAGES OPINPGT
550 JACOBSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
such a typical case, or in a more elaborate "sting" operationinvolving government-sponsored fencing where the defendant is simply provided with the opportunity to commit acrime, the entrapment defense is of little use because the
ready commission of the criminal act amply demonstrates
the defendant's predisposition. See United States v. Sherman, 200 F. 2d 880, 882 (CA2 1952). Had the agents in this
case simply offered petitioner the opportunity to order childpornography through the mails, and petitioner--who must

be presumed to know the law--had promptly availed himselfof this criminal opportunity, it is unlikely that his entrapment defense would have warranted a jury instruction.
Mathews v. United States, 485 U. S. 58, 66 (1988).

But that is not what happened here. By the time petitioner finally placed his order, he had already been the target
of 26 months of repeated mailings and communications from
Government agents and fictitious organizations. Therefore,
although he had become predisposed to break the law by
May 1987, it is our view that the Government did not prove
that this predisposition was independent and not the product
of the attention that the Government had directed at petitioner since January 1985. Sorrells, supra, at 442; Sherman, 356 U. S., at 372.

The prosecution's evidence of predisposition falls into two
categories: evidence developed prior to the Postal Service's
mail campaign, and that developed during the course of the
investigation. The sole piece of preinvestigation evidence is
petitioner's 1984 order and receipt of the Bare Boys magazines. But this is scant if any proof of petitioner's predisposition to commit an illegal act, the criminal character of
which a defendant is presumed to know. It may indicate a
predisposition to view sexually oriented photographs that
are responsive to his sexual tastes; but evidence that merely
indicates a generic inclination to act within a broad range,
not all of which is criminal, is of little probative value in
establishing predisposition.

Opinion of the Court
Furthermore, petitioner was acting within the law at thetime he received these magazines. Receipt through the

mails of sexually explicit depictions of children for noncom-mercial use did not become illegal under federal law until
May 1984, and Nebraska had no law that forbade petitioner's
possession of such material until 1988. Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 28-813.01 (1989). Evidence of predisposition to do what once

was lawful is not, by itself, sufficient to show predispositionto do what is now illegal, for there is a common understanding that most people obey the law even when they disap-prove of it. This obedience may reflect a generalized respect for legality or the fear of prosecution, but for whateverreason, the law's prohibitions are matters of consequence.
Hence, the fact that petitioner legally ordered and received
the Bare Boys magazines does little to further the Govern-ment's burden of proving that petitioner was predisposed to

commit a criminal act. This is particularly true given petitioner's unchallenged testimony that he did not know until
they arrived that the magazines would depict minors.

The prosecution's evidence gathered during the investigation also fails to carry the Government's burden. Petitioner's responses to the many communications prior to the ultimate criminal act were at most indicative of certain personal
inclinations, including a predisposition to view photographs
of preteen sex and a willingness to promote a given agenda
by supporting lobbying organizations. Even so, petitioner's
responses hardly support an inference that he would commit
the crime of receiving child pornography through the mails.3
Furthermore, a person's inclinations and "fantasies . . . are

3 We do not hold, as the dissent suggests, see post, at 559-560, that the
Government was required to prove that petitioner knowingly violated the
law. We simply conclude that proof that petitioner engaged in legal conduct and possessed certain generalized personal inclinations is not sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have
been predisposed to commit the crime charged independent of the Government's coaxing.

Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 67 (1973); Stanley v.
Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 565-566 (1969).On the other hand, the strong arguable inference is that,

by waving the banner of individual rights and disparaging
the legitimacy and constitutionality of efforts to restrict theavailability of sexually explicit materials, the Government

not only excited petitioner's interest in sexually explicit ma-terials banned by law but also exerted substantial pressure
on petitioner to obtain and read such material as part of afight against censorship and the infringement of individual
rights. For instance, HINT described itself as "an organization founded to protect and promote sexual freedom and
freedom of choice" and stated that "the most appropriate
means to accomplish [its] objectives is to promote honest dialogue among concerned individuals and to continue its lobbying efforts with State Legislators." Record, Defendant's
Exhibit 113. These lobbying efforts were to be financed
through catalog sales. Ibid. Mailings from the equally
fictitious American Hedonist Society, id., Government Exhibit 7, and the correspondence from the nonexistent Carl
Long, id., Defendant's Exhibit 5, endorsed these themes.

Similarly, the two solicitations in the spring of 1987 raised
the spectre of censorship while suggesting that petitioner
ought to be allowed to do what he had been solicited to do.
The mailing from the Customs Service referred to "the
worldwide ban and intense enforcement on this type of
material," observed that "what was legal and commonplace
is now an `underground' and secretive service," and emphasized that "[t]his environment forces us to take extreme
measures" to ensure delivery. Id., Government Exhibit 22.
The Postal Service solicitation described the concern about
child pornography as "hysterical nonsense," decried "international censorship," and assured petitioner, based on consultation with "American solicitors," that an order that had
been posted could not be opened for inspection without au503us2$59D 11-14-95 20:12:13 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
thorization of a judge. Id., Government Exhibit 1. It fur-ther asked petitioner to affirm that he was not a Government agent attempting to entrap the mail order companyor its customers.

Ibid. In these particulars, both Government solicitations suggested that receiving this material was
something that petitioner ought to be allowed to do.Petitioner's ready response to these solicitations cannot be

enough to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he waspredisposed, prior to the Government acts intended to create
predisposition, to commit the crime of receiving child por-nography through the mails. See

Sherman, 356 U. S., at
374. The evidence that petitioner was ready and willing to
commit the offense came only after the Government had devoted 21/2 years to convincing him that he had or should have
the right to engage in the very behavior proscribed by law.
Rational jurors could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that
petitioner possessed the requisite predisposition prior to the
Government's investigation and that it existed independent
of the Government's many and varied approaches to petitioner. As was explained in Sherman, where entrapment
was found as a matter of law, "the Government [may not]
pla[y] on the weaknesses of an innocent party and beguil[e]
him into committing crimes which he otherwise would not
have attempted." Id., at 376.

Law enforcement officials go too far when they "implant
in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit
the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that
they may prosecute." Sorrells, 287 U. S., at 442 (emphasis
added). Like the Sorrells Court, we are "unable to conclude
that it was the intention of the Congress in enacting this
statute that its processes of detection and enforcement
should be abused by the instigation by government officials
of an act on the part of persons otherwise innocent in order
to lure them to its commission and to punish them." Id., at
448. When the Government's quest for convictions leads to
the apprehension of an otherwise law-abiding citizen who, if

O'Connor, J., dissenting
left to his own devices, likely would have never run afoul of
the law, the courts should intervene.

Because we conclude that this is such a case and that the
prosecution failed, as a matter of law, to adduce evidence
to support the jury verdict that petitioner was predisposed,
independent of the Government's acts and beyond a reasonable doubt, to violate the law by receiving child pornography
through the mails, we reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment affirming the conviction of Keith Jacobson.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Kennedy join, and with whom Justice Scalia
joins except as to Part II, dissenting.

Keith Jacobson was offered only two opportunities to buy
child pornography through the mail. Both times, he ordered. Both times, he asked for opportunities to buy more.
He needed no Government agent to coax, threaten, or persuade him; no one played on his sympathies, friendship, or
suggested that his committing the crime would further a
greater good. In fact, no Government agent even contacted
him face to face. The Government contends that from the
enthusiasm with which Mr. Jacobson responded to the chance
to commit a crime, a reasonable jury could permissibly infer
beyond a reasonable doubt that he was predisposed to
commit the crime. I agree. Cf. United States v. Hunt, 749
F. 2d 1078, 1085 (CA4 1984) (ready response to solicitation
shows predisposition), cert. denied, 472 U. S. 1018 (1985);
United States v. Kaminski, 703 F. 2d 1004, 1008 (CA7 1983)
(" `the most important factor . . . is whether the defendant
evidenced reluctance to engage in criminal activity which
was overcome by repeated Government inducement' ") (quoting United States v. Reynoso-Ulloa, 548 F. 2d 1329, 1336
(CA9 1977), cert. denied, 436 U. S. 926 (1978)); United States

disposition is a defendant's willingness to commit the offense" `as evinced by ready complaisance' " (citation omitted)).

The first time the Government sent Mr. Jacobson a catalogof illegal materials, he ordered a set of photographs advertised as picturing "young boys in sex action fun." He enclosed the following note with his order: "I received yourbrochure and decided to place an order. If I like your product, I will order more later." Record, Government Exhibit24. For reasons undisclosed in the record, Mr. Jacobson's
order was never delivered.The second time the Government sent a catalog of illegal
materials, Mr. Jacobson ordered a magazine called "Boys
Who Love Boys," described as: "11 year old and 14 year old
boys get it on in every way possible. Oral, anal sex and
heavy masturbation. If you love boys, you will be delighted
with this." Id., Government Exhibit 2. Along with his
order, Mr. Jacobson sent the following note: "Will order other
items later. I want to be discreet in order to protect you
and me." Id., Government Exhibit 3.

Government agents admittedly did not offer Mr. Jacobson
the chance to buy child pornography right away. Instead,
they first sent questionnaires in order to make sure that he
was generally interested in the subject matter. Indeed, a
"cold call" in such a business would not only risk rebuff and
suspicion, but might also shock and offend the uninitiated, or
expose minors to suggestive materials. Cf. FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 748 (1978) (right to be free from
offensive material in one's home); 39 U. S. C. $ 3010 (regulating the mailing of sexually explicit advertising materials).
Mr. Jacobson's responses to the questionnaires gave the investigators reason to think he would be interested in photographs depicting preteen sex.

The Court, however, concludes that a reasonable jury
could not have found Mr. Jacobson to be predisposed beyond
a reasonable doubt on the basis of his responses to the Government's catalogs, even though it admits that, by that time,

503us2$59D 11-14-95 20:12:13 PAGES OPINPGT
556 JACOBSON v. UNITED STATES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
he was predisposed to commit the crime. The Government,the Court holds, failed to provide evidence that Mr. Jacobson's obvious predisposition at the time of the crime "wasindependent and not the product of the attention that the
Government had directed at petitioner." Ante, at 550. Inso holding, I believe the Court fails to acknowledge the reasonableness of the jury's inference from the evidence, rede-fines "predisposition," and introduces a new requirement
that Government sting operations have a reasonable suspi-cion of illegal activity before contacting a suspect.

I
This Court has held previously that a defendant's predis-position is to be assessed as of the time the Government

agent first suggested the crime, not when the Governmentagent first became involved.

Sherman v. United States, 356U. S. 369, 372-376 (1958). See also

United States v. Wil-liams, 705 F. 2d 603, 618, n. 9 (CA2), cert. denied, 464 U. S.

1007 (1983). Until the Government actually makes a sug-gestion of criminal conduct, it could not be said to have "implant[ed] in the mind of an innocent person the disposition tocommit the alleged offense and induce its commission . . . ."
Sorrells v. United States, 287 U. S. 435, 442 (1932). Even in
Sherman v. United States, supra, in which the Court heldthat the defendant had been entrapped as a matter of law,

the Government agent had repeatedly and unsuccessfullycoaxed the defendant to buy drugs, ultimately succeeding
only by playing on the defendant's sympathy. The Courtfound lack of predisposition based on the Government's numerous unsuccessful attempts to induce the crime, not on thebasis of preliminary contacts with the defendant.

Today, the Court holds that Government conduct may beconsidered to create a predisposition to commit a crime, even
before any Government action to induce the commission ofthe crime. In my view, this holding changes entrapment
doctrine. Generally, the inquiry is whether a suspect is pre503us2$59D 11-14-95 20:12:13 PAGES OPINPGT

557Cite as: 503 U. S. 540 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
disposed before the Government induces the commission ofthe crime, not before the Government makes initial contact

with him. There is no dispute here that the Government'squestionnaires and letters were not sufficient to establish inducement; they did not even suggest that Mr. Jacobson
should engage in any illegal activity. If all the Governmenthad done was to send these materials, Mr. Jacobson's entrapment defense would fail. Yet the Court holds that the Gov-ernment must prove not only that a suspect was predisposed
to commit the crime before the opportunity to commit itarose, but also before the Government came on the scene.
Ante, at 548-549.

The rule that preliminary Government contact can create
a predisposition has the potential to be misread by lower
courts as well as criminal investigators as requiring that the
Government must have sufficient evidence of a defendant's
predisposition before it ever seeks to contact him. Surely
the Court cannot intend to impose such a requirement, for it
would mean that the Government must have a reasonable
suspicion of criminal activity before it begins an investigation, a condition that we have never before imposed. The
Court denies that its new rule will affect run-of-the-mill
sting operations, ante, at 549-550, and one hopes that it
means what it says. Nonetheless, after this case, every defendant will claim that something the Government agent did
before soliciting the crime "created" a predisposition that
was not there before. For example, a bribetaker will claim
that the description of the amount of money available was so
enticing that it implanted a disposition to accept the bribe
later offered. A drug buyer will claim that the description
of the drug's purity and effects was so tempting that it
created the urge to try it for the first time. In short, the
Court's opinion could be read to prohibit the Government
from advertising the seductions of criminal activity as part
of its sting operation, for fear of creating a predisposition in
its suspects. That limitation would be especially likely to

503us2$59D 11-14-95 20:12:13 PAGES OPINPGT
558 JACOBSON v. UNITED STATES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
hamper sting operations such as this one, which mimic theadvertising done by genuine purveyors of pornography. No

doubt the Court would protest that its opinion does not standfor so broad a proposition, but the apparent lack of a principled basis for distinguishing these scenarios exposes a flaw
in the more limited rule the Court today adopts.The Court's rule is all the more troubling because it does

not distinguish between Government conduct that merelyhighlights the temptation of the crime itself, and Government conduct that threatens, coerces, or leads a suspectto commit a crime in order to fulfill some other obligation.
For example, in Sorrells, the Government agent repeatedly
asked for illegal liquor, coaxing the defendant to accede on
the ground that " `one former war buddy would get liquor for
another.' " 287 U. S., at 440. In Sherman, the Government
agent played on the defendant's sympathies, pretending to
be going through drug withdrawal and begging the defendant to relieve his distress by helping him buy drugs. 356
U. S., at 371.

The Government conduct in this case is not comparable.
While the Court states that the Government "exerted substantial pressure on petitioner to obtain and read such material as part of a fight against censorship and the infringement
of individual rights," ante, at 552, one looks at the record in
vain for evidence of such "substantial pressure." The most
one finds is letters advocating legislative action to liberalize
obscenity laws, letters which could easily be ignored or
thrown away. Much later, the Government sent separate
mailings of catalogs of illegal materials. Nowhere did the
Government suggest that the proceeds of the sale of the illegal materials would be used to support legislative reforms.
While one of the HINT letters suggested that lobbying efforts would be funded by sales from a catalog, Record, Defendant's Exhibit 113, the catalogs actually sent, nearly a
year later, were from different fictitious entities (Produit
Outaouais and Far Eastern Trading Company), and gave no

O'Connor, J., dissenting
suggestion that money would be used for any political pur-poses. Id., Government Exhibit 22, Government Exhibit 2.

Nor did the Government claim to be organizing a civil dis-obedience movement, which would protest the pornography
laws by breaking them. Contrary to the gloss given the evi-dence by the Court, the Government's suggestions of illegality may also have made buyers beware, and increased themystique of the materials offered: "For those of you who
have enjoyed youthful material . . . we have devised amethod of getting these to you without prying eyes of U. S.
Customs seizing your mail." Id., Government Exhibit 1.Mr. Jacobson's curiosity to see what " `all the trouble and the
hysteria' " was about, ante, at 547, is certainly susceptible ofmore than one interpretation. And it is the jury that is
charged with the obligation of interpreting it. In sum, theCourt fails to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and fails to draw all reasonable in-ferences in the Government's favor. It was surely reasonable for the jury to infer that Mr. Jacobson was predisposedbeyond a reasonable doubt, even if other inferences from the
evidence were also possible.

II
The second puzzling thing about the Court's opinion is itsredefinition of predisposition. The Court acknowledges that

"[p]etitioner's responses to the many communications priorto the ultimate criminal act were . . . indicative of certain
personal inclinations, including a predisposition to view pho-tographs of preteen sex . . . ." Ante, at 551. If true, this
should have settled the matter; Mr. Jacobson was predis-posed to engage in the illegal conduct. Yet, the Court concludes, "petitioner's responses hardly support an inferencethat he would commit the crime of receiving child pornography through the mails." Ibid.The Court seems to add something new to the burden of
proving predisposition. Not only must the Government

503us2$59D 11-14-95 20:12:13 PAGES OPINPGT
560 JACOBSON v. UNITED STATES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
show that a defendant was predisposed to engage in the ille-gal conduct, here, receiving photographs of minors engaged

in sex, but also that the defendant was predisposed to breakthe law knowingly in order to do so. The statute violated
here, however, does not require proof of specific intent to
break the law; it requires only knowing receipt of visual de-pictions produced by using minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. See 18 U. S. C. $ 2252(a)(2); United States v.
Moncini, 882 F. 2d 401, 404-406 (CA9 1989). Under the
Court's analysis, however, the Government must prove moreto show predisposition than it need prove in order to convict.

The Court ignores the judgment of Congress that specific
intent is not an element of the crime of receiving sexually
explicit photographs of minors. The elements of predisposition should track the elements of the crime. The predisposition requirement is meant to eliminate the entrapment defense for those defendants who would have committed the
crime anyway, even absent Government inducement. Because a defendant might very well be convicted of the crime
here absent Government inducement even though he did not
know his conduct was illegal, a specific intent requirement
does little to distinguish between those who would commit
the crime without the inducement and those who would not.
In sum, although the fact that Mr. Jacobson's purchases of
Bare Boys I and Bare Boys II were legal at the time may
have some relevance to the question of predisposition, it is
not, as the Court suggests, dispositive.

The crux of the Court's concern in this case is that the
Government went too far and "abused" the " `processes of
detection and enforcement' " by luring an innocent person to
violate the law. Ante, at 553, quoting Sorrells, 287 U. S., at
448. Consequently, the Court holds that the Government
failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Jacobson
was predisposed to commit the crime. It was, however, the
jury's task, as the conscience of the community, to decide
whether Mr. Jacobson was a willing participant in the crimi503us2$59D 11-14-95 20:12:13 PAGES OPINPGT

nal activity here or an innocent dupe. The jury is the tradi-tional "defense against arbitrary law enforcement." Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 156 (1968). Indeed, inSorrells, in which the Court was also concerned about overzealous law enforcement, the Court did not decide itself thatthe Government conduct constituted entrapment, but left the
issue to the jury. 287 U. S., at 452. There is no dispute thatthe jury in this case was fully and accurately instructed on
the law of entrapment, and nonetheless found Mr. Jacobsonguilty. Because I believe there was sufficient evidence to
uphold the jury's verdict, I respectfully dissent.

TREVINO v. TEXAS
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court ofcriminal appeals of texas

No. 91-6751. Decided April 6, 1992
Before jury selection began in petitioner Trevino's capital murder trial, he

filed a "Motion to Prohibit the State from Using Peremptory Challenges
to Strike Members of a Cognizable Group," stating that the prosecution
and the State of Texas had historically and habitually used such challenges to strike black people and other minorities. After the State exercised its peremptory challenges to strike the only black members of
the venire, the court denied his motion, and he was convicted by an allwhite jury and sentenced to death. While Trevino's case was pending
on appeal, this Court decided, in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, that
equal protection is violated where the prosecution uses race based peremptory challenges to exclude members of a defendant's racial group
from a jury. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding, inter alia, that Trevino's arguments did not
amount to reliance on the Equal Protection Clause.

Held: Trevino is entitled to review under the rule announced in Batson.

He presented his equal protection claim to the trial court when he relied
on a claim of a historical pattern of discriminatory use of peremptory
challenges, and preserved that claim on appeal when he included in his
argument caption an express reference to the Fourteenth Amendment,
presenting for review the very issue he had raised in the trial court.
Moreover, the State did not argue that Trevino failed to make an equal
protection claim, but rather disputed the legal basis for his claim. To
hold that he had forfeited his equal protection claim by failing to state
it with sufficient precision would require applying a stricter standard
than applied in Batson itself. Since Trevino's case is in this Court on
direct review, he is entitled to the Batson rule.

Certiorari granted; 815 S. W. 2d 592, reversed and remanded.

The State of Texas charged petitioner Joe Mario Trevinofor the murder and rape of Blanche Miller, a capital offense.

lenges to Strike Members of a Cognizable Group." Themotion recited:

"The Accused requests of the Court that the State ofTexas be prohibited from its use of peremptory challenges to strike prospective jurors merely based on thefact of race. The prosecution, the State of Texas, historically and habitually uses its peremptory challengesto strike black people and other minorities who are otherwise qualified. These peremptory challenges are ex-ercised by the State of Texas to strike prospective black
jurors in its effort to produce an ethnically pure, all
white, jury. This common use of the State's peremp-tory challenge in a criminal trial deprives the Accused

of due process and a fair trial. This practice deprivesthe Accused of a jury representing a fair cross-section
of the community in violation of the Sixth Amendmentto the United States Constitution.

"A hearing is requested on this Motion." 1A Record
280.

The trial court delayed ruling on the motion until the voir
dire. During the course of voir dire, the prosecution exercised its peremptory challenges to excuse the only threeblack members of the venire. After each of these peremptory strikes, petitioner, who is Hispanic, renewed his motion,
asking that the prosecution state its reasons for striking thejurors. The first time petitioner renewed the motion, the

court stated: "I know of no requirement yet for either partyto announce his reasons for exercising a preemptory

[sic]
challenge. Can you cite me some law on that?" 11 Record
356. In response, petitioner's counsel cited McCray v. Abrams, 576 F. Supp. 1244 (EDNY), aff 'd in part and rev'd in
part, 750 F. 2d 1113 (CA2 1984). He went on to note that
when we denied the petition for a writ of certiorari in McCray v. New York, 461 U. S. 961 (1983), five Justices expressed the view that Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202

Per Curiam
(1965), ought to be reexamined. 11 Record 356. The trial
court denied petitioner's motion, and denied it again after
two more black venire members were excluded.

The all-white jury returned a verdict of guilty and after a
sentencing hearing returned affirmative answers to the two
special questions posed by the court. See Jurek v. Texas,
428 U. S. 262, 267-269 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart,
Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). As required under such circumstances, see ibid., the trial court sentenced petitioner to
death. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, filing his brief on December 19, 1985. This
is the cause now before us. He cited 24 errors in the guilt
and punishment phases of the trial court proceedings. The
only one of concern now is the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges based on race.

Petitioner contended in the Court of Criminal Appeals
that the prosecution's race based use of challenges violated
his "rights to due process of law and to an impartial jury
fairly drawn from a representative cross section of the community." Brief for Appellant in No. 69337, p. 11. He found
these rights in "the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to
the United States Constitution," as well as provisions of the
Texas Constitution. Ibid. He asserted he was renewing
the objections pressed at trial. Ibid. He acknowledged
that under Swain v. Alabama, the use of peremptory challenges to discriminate in a single case would not be an equal
protection violation but noted that in Batson v. Kentucky,
cert. granted, 471 U. S. 1052 (1985), we would reconsider the
question under the Sixth Amendment. When his brief was
filed, we had heard oral argument in Batson but had not
announced our decision. Petitioner urged that even if Batson did not alter the requirement of alleging an overall
scheme of discrimination, the Court of Criminal Appeals
should prohibit peremptory challenges based on race as a
matter of state law.

Per Curiam
On April 30, 1986, not long after petitioner filed his briefin the Court of Criminal Appeals, our decision in

Batson
came down. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79. The caseannounced the now familiar rule that when a defendant

makes a prima facie showing that the State has exercised its
peremptory challenges to exclude members of the defend-ant's racial group, the State bears the burden of coming forward with a race neutral justification. Just over a monthafter

Batson was decided, the State filed its brief in the
Court of Criminal Appeals. The State argued Batson couldnot avail petitioner because he is not a member of the same

race as the excluded jurors. According to the State, petitioner's claim could not be considered an equal protection
claim but was instead a claim that he was entitled to a jury
composed of a "fair cross-section" of the community. Brief
for Appellee in No. 69337, pp. 15-17. In drawing this distinction, the State relied on the view that a criminal defendant does not state an equal protection claim unless he alleges
that the excluded jurors are members of the same protected
class as he. We rejected this view last Term in Powers v.
Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991).

The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, sitting en banc,
affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence on June 12,
1991, and denied petitioner's application for rehearing on
September 18, 1991. The opinion of the Court of Criminal
Appeals does not set forth the reason for the delay of over
five years between the submission of briefs and the resolution of the appeal. With respect to the peremptory challenge question, the court stated that the argument was foreclosed by Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474 (1990), in which
we held that the Sixth Amendment does not prohibit the
prosecution from exercising its peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based on race. 815 S. W. 2d 592, 598.
In a footnote, the Court of Criminal Appeals stated that the
arguments in petitioner's brief did not amount to reliance on
the Equal Protection Clause. Id., at 598, n. 3. The court's

Per Curiam
opinion cited neither Powers nor Ford v. Georgia, 498 U. S.411, which we decided on February 19, 1991. We now

grant certiorari. II

In Ford v. Georgia, we addressed what steps a defendantin a criminal case was required to take to preserve an equal
protection objection to the State's race based use of peremp-tory challenges during the preBatson era. Here we con-sider whether petitioner took those steps.

In Ford, the petitioner filed a pretrial "Motion to RestrictRacial Use of Peremptory Challenges," 498 U. S., at 413,
wording which is in all material respects parallel to the pres-ent petitioner's pretrial "Motion to Prohibit the State from
Using Peremptory Challenges to Strike Members of a Cogni-zable Group." The ultimate issue in

Ford concerned the va-lidity of a state procedural rule, but before reaching it we

ruled on a preliminary issue, and that ruling is dispositivehere. We stated:

"The threshold issues are whether and, if so, whenpetitioner presented the trial court with a cognizable
Batson claim that the State's exercise of its peremptorychallenges rested on the impermissible ground of race
in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment. We think petitioner must be
treated as having raised such a claim, although he cer-tainly failed to do it with the clarity that appropriate
citations would have promoted. The pretrial motionmade no mention of the Equal Protection Clause, and
the later motion for a new trial cited the Sixth Amend-ment, not the Fourteenth."

Id., at 418.

Despite the inartfulness of the Ford petitioner's assertion ofhis rights, we held he had presented his claim to the trial

court. We noted that his reference in his motion to exclu-sion of black jurors " `over a long period of time,' " and his
argument to the same effect "could reasonably have been

intended and interpreted to raise a claim under the EqualProtection Clause on the evidentiary theory articulated in

Batson's antecedent, Swain v. Alabama." Id., at 419. Weplaced this interpretation on the reference to history because
the standard of proof for an equal protection violation under
Swain required a showing of racial exclusion in "case aftercase." 380 U. S., at 223.

In the matter now before us petitioner also relied on aclaim of a historical pattern of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. That alone would have been sufficientunder

Ford to place the equal protection claim before the
trial court. Of course, petitioner did more. He made an express reference to Swain in his argument to the trial court.
11 Record 356. In fact, petitioner argued that we would
modify Swain's burden of proof and that the Texas courts
should anticipate our decision. We decide that petitioner
presented his equal protection claim to the trial court.

We determine further that petitioner preserved his equal
protection claim before the Court of Criminal Appeals. His
argument caption made an express reference to the Fourteenth Amendment, and the issue presented for review was
the very one that he had raised before the trial court.

The State in its brief to the Court of Criminal Appeals
recognized that petitioner's argument contained an equal
protection claim, albeit one which the State believed to lack
merit. The State did not argue that petitioner was not making an equal protection claim but that petitioner's equal protection claim had no legal support. Given our later holding
in Powers v. Ohio, supra, the State's contention is incorrect.

We cannot ignore the fact that were we to hold petitioner
had forfeited his equal protection claim by failing to state
it with sufficient precision, we would be applying a stricter
standard than applied in Batson itself. There petitioner had
conceded in the state courts that Swain foreclosed a direct
equal protection claim, and he based his argument on the
Sixth Amendment and a provision of the Kentucky Constitu503us2$60z 11-14-95 20:17:08 PAGES OPINPGT

as sufficient to present the question. Id., at 84-85, n. 4. Be-cause petitioner's case is here on direct review, he is entitled
to the rule we announced in Batson. Compare Griffith v.
Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987) (giving retroactive applicationto Batson for cases pending on direct review or not yet final

when Batson was decided), with Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.288, 296 (1989) (denying similar application for cases on collateral review).The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari isgranted, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of
Texas is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

on bill of complaint
No. 118, Orig. Argued February 24, 1992--Decided April 21, 1992
Pursuant to, inter alia, $ 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act

of 1899 (RHA), the Secretary of the Army, through the Army Corps of
Engineers, granted Nome, Alaska, a federal permit to build port facilities extending into Norton Sound. The permit's issuance was conditioned on the submission by Alaska of a disclaimer of rights to additional
submerged lands that it could claim within its boundary if the facilities'
construction moved the coastline seaward. However, the disclaimer
also provided that Alaska reserved its right to the accreted submerged
lands pending a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction that federal officials lacked the authority to compel a disclaimer of sovereignty
as a condition of permit issuance. After the facilities were constructed,
the United States Department of the Interior proposed a lease sale for
minerals in Norton Sound. Alleging that the proposal involved lands
subject to its disclaimer, Alaska announced its intention to file suit challenging the Corps' authority to require the disclaimer. The United
States was granted leave of this Court to commence this action, and
both parties have filed motions for summary judgment.

Held: The Secretary of the Army acted within his discretion in conditioning approval of the Nome port facilities on a disclaimer by Alaska of
a change in the federal-state boundary that the project might cause.
Pp. 575-593.

(a) This Court's review of the Corps' construction of a statute that
it administers involves an examination of $ 10's language, this Court's
decisions interpreting $ 10, and the Corps' longstanding construction
in fulfilling Congress' mandate. On its face, $ 10--which prohibits the
building of any structure in navigable waters of the United States "except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized
by the Secretary of the Army"--appears to give the Secretary unlimited
discretion to grant or deny a permit for construction of a structure such
as the one at issue. While both the RHA's legislative history and $ 10's
statutory antecedents offer little insight into Congress' intent, the idea
of delegating authority to the Secretary was well established in the
immediate precursors to the RHA. This Court's decisions also support
the view that $ 10 should be construed broadly, see, e. g., United States
ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U. S. 352, to authorize consideration
of factors other than navigation during the permit review process, cf.

503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT
570 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Syllabus
United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp., 411 U. S.
655. In addition, since the late 1960's, the regulations adopted by the
Corps have interpreted its statutory authority as empowering it to take
into account several "public interest" factors--including a full range
of economic, social, and environmental factors--in addition to navigation in deciding whether to issue a $ 10 permit. See, e. g., 33 CFR

$ 320.4(a)(1). Pp. 576-583.

(b) There is no merit to Alaska's argument that any statutory mandate authorizing the Secretary to consider factors in addition to navigation is exceeded by 33 CFR $ 320.4(f), which authorizes consideration of
a project's consequences on the federal-state boundary. Contrary to
Alaska's position, the Corps' practice does not conflict with the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), which provides that a coastal State's boundary extends three miles from its coastline. Although coastlines are subject to change from natural or artificial alterations, see, e. g., United
States v. California, 381 U. S. 139, 176-177 (California II), the Secretary is making no effort to alter a State's existing rights to sovereignty
over submerged lands within three miles of the coastline. Rather the
Corps is, in a reasonable exercise of its authority, determining whether
an artificial addition to the coastline will increase the State's control
over submerged lands to the detriment of the United States' legitimate
interests. Neither the SLA nor its legislative history addresses the
effect of artificial additions to the coastline, and this Court sanctioned,
in California II, supra, at 177, the mechanism exercised by the Secretary in this case. Nor do this Court's decisions prohibit the Secretary
from considering in the permit review process changes in federal-state
boundaries that will result in the establishment of one boundary for
international purposes--since artificial additions always affect such
boundaries--and a different one for domestic purposes. Specifically,
the Secretary's action does not conflict with California II, because that
case did not specify a goal of achieving a single domestic and international coastline. Pp. 583-591.

(c) There is also no merit to Alaska's argument that, even if the regulations are valid, they do not authorize the Corps to force a coastal
State to abdicate rights to submerged lands as a condition to a permit's
issuance. It is untenable to say that the United States' legitimate property interests fall outside the relevant criteria for a decision that requires the Secretary to determine whether a permit's issuance would
affect the "public interest." And it would make little sense, and be
inconsistent with Congress' intent, to hold that the Corps legitimately
may prohibit construction of a port facility, and yet to deny it the authority to seek the less drastic alternative of conditioning the permit's
issuance on the State's disclaimer of rights to accreted submerged lands.

Opinion of the Court
The Corps' failure to identify in the regulations the option of conditioning disclaimers does not render the policy contrary to law. See United
States v. Gaubert, 499 U. S. 315, 324. The Corps cannot be said to have
acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, since it notified state officials promptly of the objection to the project, specified a curative option,
and afforded Alaska ample time to consider the disclaimer, consult with
federal officials, and then draft the disclaimer. Nor can Alaska contend
that it lacked notice, since the disclaimer is similar to those Alaska has
filed in past $ 10 proceedings. Pp. 591-592.

summary judgment denied.

Opinion of the Court
to gain control over the region's natural riches. See In reMcKenzie, 180 U. S. 536 (1901). The city of Nome sprang to

life almost overnight, with some 20,000 gold seekers arrivingby vessel in the summer of 1900 when the spring thaw
opened up seaward passage. Since that time, Nome hasnever been linked to interior Alaska by road--travelers and
traders must arrive by air, sea, or dog sled. This heavy reli-ance on seaward traffic, and the lack of a natural port in the
region, inspired Nome in the early 1980's to develop plans toconstruct port facilities, including a causeway with road, a
breakwater, and an offshore terminal area, extending intoNorton Sound. The implications of this construction for the
federal-state offshore boundary lie at the heart of this law-suit, which comes to us on a bill of complaint filed by the
United States. The question presented is whether the Sec-retary of the Army may decline to issue a permit to build an
artificial addition to the coastline unless Alaska agrees thatthe construction will be deemed not to alter the location of
the federal-state boundary. I

On August 25, 1982, the city of Nome applied for a federalpermit to build port facilities with the Alaska District Corps
of Engineers of the United States Department of the Army
under $ 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of1899 (RHA), 30 Stat. 1151, 33 U. S. C. $ 403, and $ 404 of

the Clean Water Act, 86 Stat. 884, as amended, 33 U. S. C.$ 1344.

1 The Corps issued a Public Notice of Application for

Permit on October 20, 1982, and invited interested persons
to comment on whether the permit should be granted. OnNovember 22, 1982, a division of the United States Department of the Interior filed an objection to the issuance of aDepartment of the Army permit on the ground that Nome's
construction of these port facilities would cause an "artificial

accretion to the legal coast line." Joint Stipulation of Facts2. It requested that the Corps require Alaska to waive any

future claims pursuant to the Submerged Lands Act (SLA),67 Stat. 29, as amended, 43 U. S. C. $ 1301 et seq., that might
arise from a seaward extension of Alaska's coastline causedby the building of these facilities. The Solicitor of the Interior Department issued an opinion to the same effect, statingthat the Nome project would " `move Alaska's coastline or
baseline seaward of its present location' " and that " `[f]ederalmineral leasing offshore Alaska would be affected because
the state-federal boundary, as well as international bound-aries, are measured from the coastline or baseline.' " Joint
Stipulation of Facts 2-3. Accordingly, the Solicitor recom-mended that " `approval of the permit application be conditioned upon Alaska executing an agreement or a quit claimdeed preserving the coastline and the state-federal boundary.' " Id., at 3.On July 1, 1983, the Corps transmitted the Solicitor's letter
to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources and advisedthe State that the federal permit would not be issued until
a " `waiver or quit claim deed has been issued preservingthe coastline and the State-Federal boundary.' "

Ibid. TheAlaska Department of Natural Resources responded on May

9, 1984, by submitting a conditional disclaimer of rights toadditional submerged lands that could be claimed by the
State as a result of the construction of the Nome port facility.This disclaimer provided that Alaska reserved its right to
the accreted submerged lands pending a decision by a courtof competent jurisdiction that the federal officials lacked
the authority to compel a disclaimer of sovereignty as a con-dition of permit issuance.

partment of Justice that this disclaimer was satisfactory, theCorps completed the permitting process and issued the

permit.3On March 11, 1988, the Minerals Management Service of
the Interior Department published a "Request for Com-ments and Nominations for a Lease Sale in Norton Sound
and Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement," which solicited public comment on the MineralsManagement Service's proposed lease sale for minerals, such

as gold, near Nome in Norton Sound. Id., at 5. Alaska sub-mitted comments the following month, alleging that the proposed Norton Sound Lease Sale involved submerged landssubject to its Nome project disclaimer and announcing its
intention to file a suit challenging the Corps' authority to
ing disclaimer by the State of Alaska to the effect that the state does not,
and will not, treat the Nome port development as extending its coast line
for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act, again subject to paragraph
4 below.

"2. This disclaimer is executed solely for the purpose of complying with
the conditions recommended by the Solicitor of the Department of the
Interior and the Attorney General and maintains the status quo of the
baseline and the state-federal boundary. It does not affect property or
claims to which Alaska is now entitled. It is not an admission by the
State of Alaska or by the United States as to the present location of the
shoreline, coast line, or the boundaries of the State of Alaska, and is without prejudice to any contention that any party may now or hereafter make
regarding such present location.

"3. This disclaimer is entered without prejudice to Alaska's right to file
an appropriate action leading to a determination whether the Corps of
Engineers has the legal authority to require such a disclaimer before issuing a permit for a project which might affect the coast line.

"4. This disclaimer becomes ineffective and without force and effect
upon a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction in any
appropriate action that the Corps of Engineers does not have the legal
authority to require such a disclaimer before issuing a permit for a project
which might affect the coast line." Joint Stipulation of Facts 3-4.

3 The Department of the Army permit was later modified to reflect

changes in the project. See id., at 5. These changes are not relevant to
the legal issues presented in this case.

from the proposed lease sale the approximately 730 acres indispute from the Nome project.

The United States then sought leave of this Court tocommence this action, which we granted on April 1, 1991.
499 U. S. 946. The two parties entered into an agreementpursuant to $ 7 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
(OCSLA), 43 U. S. C. $ 1336, and Alaska Stat. Ann.$ 38.05.137 (1989), to direct revenues from the disputed
acreage into an escrow account that would then be paid tothe prevailing party.

4 The United States and Alaska both

filed motions for summary judgment, which we now consider.

II
Our principles for evaluating agency interpretations ofcongressional statutes are by now well settled. Generally,

when reviewing an agency's construction of a statute admin-istered by that agency, we first determine "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue."
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). Should the statute be silent

or ambiguous on the direct question posed, we must thendecide whether the "agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Id., at 843. In applyingthese principles, we examine in turn the language of $ 10 of
the RHA, the decisions of this Court interpreting it, and thelongstanding construction of the Corps in fulfilling Congress' mandate.

4 Although the bidding period closed without receipt of any bids, both
sides agree that a live controversy exists in light of their continuing disagreement as to the location of the federal-state boundary and the prospect of future lease sales in the area. We agree that the controversy
is not moot, since it involves a continuing controversy about territorial
sovereignty over these submerged lands. United States v. Alaska, 422
U. S. 184, 186 (1975).

576 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court

A
Section 10 of the RHA provides in pertinent part:

"The creation of any obstruction not affirmatively au-thorized by Congress, to the navigable capacity of any

of the waters of the United States is prohibited; and itshall not be lawful to build or commence the building of
any . . . structures in any . . . water of the United States. . . except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army; andit shall not be lawful to excavate or fill, or in any manner
to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or ca-pacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, lake,
harbor or refuge . . . unless the work has been recom-mended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the
Secretary of the Army prior to beginning the same."33 U. S. C. $ 403.

The language of this provision is quite broad. It flatlyprohibits the "creation of

any obstruction" to navigable ca-pacity that Congress itself has not authorized, and it bans

construction of any structure in any water of the UnitedStates "except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army." Ibid.The statute itself contains no criteria by which the Secretary
is to make an authorization decision; on its face, the provisionappears to give the Secretary unlimited discretion to grant
or deny a permit for construction of a structure such as theone at issue in this case. The Reports of the Senate and
House Committees charged with making recommendationson the Act contain no hint of whether the drafters sought to
vest in the Secretary the apparently unbridled authority theplain language of the statute seems to suggest. See H. R.
Rep. No. 1826, 55th Cong., 3d Sess. (1899); S. Rep. No. 1686,55th Cong., 3d Sess. (1899).

The statutory antecedents of this provision similarly offerlittle insight into Congress' intent. The precursors to $ 10 of

577Cite as: 503 U. S. 569 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
the 1899 Act were $$ 7 and 10 of the 1890 River and HarborAppropriation Act, Act of Sept. 19, 1890, 26 Stat. 454-455.

Section 10 prohibited creation of "any obstruction, not af-firmatively authorized by law, to the navigable capacity of
any waters, in respect of which the United States has juris-diction," and $ 7 made unlawful the building of any "wharf,
pier, . . . or structure of any kind outside established harbor-lines . . . without the permission of the Secretary of War."
Ibid. Congress slightly amended the statute in 1892 to adda prohibition on any construction that would "in any manner
. . . alter or modify the course, location, condition or capacityof any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, harbor of refuge, or
inclosure . . . unless approved and authorized by the Secre-tary of War." 1892 Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act,
Act of July 13, 1892, $ 3, 27 Stat. 110. This statute reflectedthe reality that Congress could not itself attend to each such
project individually, as it had from the earliest days of theRepublic. As the House Report accompanying this law observed: "The most important feature of the bill now pre-sented is the extent it goes in authorizing the Secretary of
War to make contracts for the completion of some of themore important works of river and harbor improvement."
H. R. Rep. No. 967, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1892). "The de-parture from the old driblet system of appropriations," the
House Report continued, "was found to work so well thatyour committee determined to apply it on a larger scale than
in the last act." Ibid. See also S. Rep. No. 666, 52d Cong.,1st Sess., 4-5 (1892). By the time Congress passed the 1899
Act, therefore, the idea of delegating authority to the Secre-tary was well established even if the explanations for the
broad language employed by Congress to carry out such adirective were sparse.

B
The substance of the RHA has been unchanged since itsenactment, and the Court has had only a few occasions to

decide whether to construe it broadly or narrowly. In one

503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT
578 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
such case, for example, the Court considered whether to
issue a writ of mandamus to order the Secretary of War and
the Chief of Engineers to grant a permit to build a wharf in
navigable waters. United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern,
289 U. S. 352 (1933). Although it was stipulated that the
project would not interfere with navigability, the Secretary
nevertheless denied the permit on the ground that the wharf
would impede plans developed by the United States to create
a means of access to the proposed George Washington Memorial Parkway along the Potomac River in northern Virginia.
Id., at 355. The permit applicant argued that the Secretary's refusal to grant it was contrary to law on the theory
that RHA $ 10 authorized consideration only of the proposed
construction's effects on navigation. In refusing to issue the
writ of mandamus under equitable principles, the Court
noted that petitioners' argument could be accepted "only if
several doubtful questions are resolved in [petitioners']
favor," one of which was "whether a mandatory duty is imposed upon the Secretary of War by $ 10 of the Rivers and
Harbors Appropriation Act to authorize the construction of
the proposed wharf if he is satisfied that it will not interfere
with navigation." Id., at 357.

Nor has such a broad interpretation of the RHA been exceptional. In United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362
U. S. 482, 491 (1960), the Court observed: "We read the 1899
Act charitably in light of the purpose to be served. The
philosophy of the statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in New
Jersey v. New York, 283 U. S. 336, 342 [1931], that `A river is
more than an amenity, it is a treasure,' forbids a narrow,
cramped reading of either $ 13 or of $ 10." And as we stated
in a later case: "Despite some difficulties with the wording
of the Act, we have consistently found its coverage to be
broad. And we have found that a principal beneficiary of
the Act, if not the principal beneficiary, is the Government

Opinion of the Court
itself." Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, 389
U. S. 191, 201 (1967) (citations omitted).

In United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical
Corp., 411 U. S. 655 (1973), we applied this broad approach
to the RHA in a somewhat analogous situation under a provision enacted contemporaneously with $ 10. RHA $ 13 provides that the Secretary of the Army "may permit the deposit" of refuse matter "whenever in the judgment of the
Chief of Engineers anchorage and navigation will not be injured thereby." 33 U. S. C. $ 407. The case presented the
question whether the statute required the Secretary to allow
such discharges where they had no effect on navigation. We
held that the statute should not be so construed. In reaching this conclusion, we observed that "even in a situation
where the Chief of Engineers concedes that a certain deposit
will not injure anchorage and navigation, the Secretary need
not necessarily permit the deposit, for the proviso makes the
Secretary's authority discretionary--i. e., it provides that the
Secretary `may permit' the deposit." 411 U. S., at 662. We
further noted that $ 13 "contains no criteria to be followed
by the Secretary in issuing such permits," id., at 668, and
rejected the argument that the agency's statutory authority
should be construed narrowly.

In our view, $ 10 should be construed with similar breadth.
Without specifying the factors to be considered, $ 10 provides
that "it shall not be lawful to build or commence the building" of any structure in navigable waters of the United
States "except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army." 33
U. S. C. $ 403 (emphasis added). In light of our holding in
Pennsylvania Chemical Corp. that the Secretary's discretion under $ 13 was not limited to considering the effect of
a refuse deposit on navigation, it logically follows that the
Secretary's authority is not confined solely to considerations

of navigation in deciding whether to issue a permit under$ 10.

C
We now examine the administrative interpretation of $ 10down through the years with respect to the range of discretion extended to the Corps and the Secretary. An opinionby Attorney General George W. Wickersham in 1909, for
example, denied the Secretary of War and the Chief of En-gineers the authority to decide whether to issue a permit
under RHA $ 10 after "consider[ation of] questions relatingto other interests than those having to do with the navigation of the waters." 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 284, 288.This narrow view of the Secretary's authority persisted
within the agency for many decades. "Until 1968," accord-ing to one document produced by the Corps of Engineers,
"the Corps administered the 1899 Act regulatory programonly to protect navigation and the navigable capacity of the
nation's waters." 42 Fed. Reg. 37122 (1977). In 1968, theregulations were amended so that the general policy guidance for permit issuance included consideration of "the ef-fects of permitted activities on the public interest including

5 Alaska reads Pennsylvania Chemical Corp. differently, suggesting
that the case does not relate to the scope of the Corps' permitting authority under RHA $ 10, but instead is confined to the issue of how broadly the
agency's prosecutorial discretion should be defined. We disagree. Our
analysis of the RHA in that case was not at all contingent on the underlying issue relating to a prosecution rather than a permitting decision. We
placed great weight on the reading by the federal courts, which "almost
universally agreed, as did the courts below, that $ 13 is to be read in accordance with its plain language as imposing a flat ban on the unauthorized
deposit of foreign substances into navigable waters, regardless of the effect on navigation." 411 U. S., at 671. Alaska also cites Wisconsin v.
Illinois, 278 U. S. 367, 418 (1929), for the proposition that $ 10 only authorizes considerations of navigability in permit issuance decisions. We do
not read the case in the same way. In our view, Wisconsin v. Illinois is
more properly read to limit the Secretary's authority to issue a permit for
nonnavigability reasons when an effect of the project would be to obstruct
navigation. Id., at 417.

effects upon water quality, recreation, fish and wildlife, pollu-tion, our natural resources, as well as the effects on navigation." 33 CFR $ 209.330(a).6Yet even after the Corps adopted this more expansive
reading, which the language of the statute and our decisionsinterpreting it plainly authorized, the House Committee on
Government Operations nevertheless concluded that theCorps in practice was still not interpreting its statutory
authority broadly enough. See H. R. Rep. No. 91-917, p. 6(1970). The Committee was of the view that the Corps' earlier "restricted view of the 1899 act . . . was not required bythe law."

Id., at 2. The Report summarized our holdingsto the effect that the statutory language of RHA $ 10 should

be interpreted generously, id., at 2-4, and commended theCorps "for recognizing [in 1968] its broader responsibilities"
pursuant to its permitting authority under the RHA, id., at5. The Committee emphasized that the Corps "should instruct its district engineers . . . to increase their emphasison how the work will affect

all aspects of the public interest,including not only navigation but also conservation of natural

resources, fish and wildlife, air and water quality, esthetics,scenic view, historic sites, ecology, and other public interest
aspects of the waterway." Id., at 6 (emphasis added). TheCorps did not react to this "advice" until after the Fifth Circuit's decision in Zabel v. Tabb, 430 F. 2d 199 (1970). Therethe court upheld the Corps' consideration of environmental
factors in its permitting decision even though the projectwould not interfere with navigation, flood control, or power
production. After this decision, the Corps began the longprocess of changing its regulations governing permit application evaluations. See 42 Fed. Reg. 37122 (1977) (describinghistorical background of the agency's practice). In 1976, the
Corps issued regulations interpreting its statutory authority

whether a permit will be issued must rest primarily upon the effect of the
proposed work on navigation." 33 CFR $ 209.330(a) (1967).

Opinion of the Court
as empowering it to take into account a full range of
economic, social, and environmental factors. See 33 CFR

$ 209.120(f )(1).

The regulations at issue in this lawsuit, therefore, reflect
a broad interpretation of agency power under $ 10 that was
consistent with the language used by Congress and was well
settled by this Court and the Army Corps of Engineers.
With respect to the breadth of the Corps' public interest review, these regulations are substantially the same as those
adopted in 1976 and provide:

"(a) Publ ic Interest Rev i ew. (1) The decision
whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation
of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, of
the proposed activity and its intended use on the public
interest. Evaluation of the probable impact which the
proposed activity may have on the public interest
requires a careful weighing of all those factors which
become relevant in each particular case. The benefits
which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the
proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. The decision whether to authorize
a proposal, and if so, the conditions under which it will
be allowed to occur, are therefore determined by the
outcome of this general balancing process. That decision should reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal must be considered including the cumulative effects thereof: among
those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties,
fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values,
land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in

general, the needs and welfare of the people." 33 CFR$ 320.4(a)(1) (1991).

These regulations guide the Secretary's consideration of"public interest" factors to evaluate in determining whether
to issue a permit under $ 10 of the RHA. To the extentAlaska contends that these regulations are invalid because
they authorize the Secretary to consider a wider range offactors than just the effects of a project on navigability, we
reject this position. The State's reading of the Secretary'sregulatory authority in this respect is inconsistent with the
statute's language, our cases interpreting it, and the agency'spractice since the late 1960's.

III
Alaska appears to concede some ground by acknowledgingthat the Secretary may not be limited solely to issues of navigability in considering whether to issue a $ 10 permit.7 TheState in effect contends that, even if the statute authorizes
consideration of factors other than just navigability, theregulations authorizing consideration of a project's consequences on the federal-state boundary exceed the Secre-tary's statutory mandate. The regulation at issue provides
in pertinent part as follows:

7 Alaska acknowledges, for example, that the Secretary can take into
account the polluting consequences of a project, see Brief for Alaska 17,
though the language of $ 10 includes no mention of such effects. And a
brief filed by numerous States and the Coastal States Organization as
amici curiae appears to go even further by suggesting that "the Army
Corps may deny a permit for the construction of a harbor facility if it is
determined that the construction or facility would result in an obstruction
to navigation, endanger human health or welfare, the marine environment, or the economic potential." Brief for Alabama et al. as Amici
Curiae 17 (emphasis added). Plainly these factors are not mentioned in
RHA $ 10. As our analysis will make clear, the United States is fundamentally correct that there is no legal basis for authorizing the Secretary
to consider these factors but not the effects of a project on the federalstate boundary.

Opinion of the Court
"(f) Effects on limits of the territorial sea. Struc-tures or work affecting coastal waters may modify the

coast line or base line from which the territorial sea ismeasured for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act and
international law. . . . Applications for structures or
work affecting coastal waters will therefore be reviewedspecifically to determine whether the coast line or base

line might be altered. If it is determined that such achange might occur, coordination with the Attorney
General and the Solicitor of the Department of the Inte-rior is required before final action is taken. The district
engineer will . . . request [the Solicitor's] comments con-cerning the effects of the proposed work on the outer
continental rights of the United States. . . . The decision
on the application will be made by the Secretary of theArmy after coordination with the Attorney General."

33 CFR $ 320.4 (1991).
Alaska advances several arguments why such concerns ex-ceed the scope of the Secretary's authority. We address

each in turn.

A

Alaska's first argument proceeds from the premise that theSLA trumps the RHA for purposes of determining whether

the Secretary may condition issuance of a permit on the
State's disclaimer of sovereignty over the accreted sub-merged lands. The SLA establishes that a coastal State's

boundary extends seaward "to a line three geographicalmiles distant from its coast line." 43 U. S. C. $ 1312. The
seaward boundary of state-owned lands is measured from a
base line that is subject to change from natural and artificial
alterations. See United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139,
176-177 (1965); United States v. Louisiana (Louisiana
Boundary Case), 394 U. S. 11, 40, n. 48 (1969). In applying
these rules, Alaska asserts that because the SLA extends a
State's boundary seaward three miles from its coastline and

585Cite as: 503 U. S. 569 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
because our decisions have authorized artificial additions toaffect determinations of the base line, the Army cannot by

agency fiat override the will of Congress, as interpreted byour Court. Cf.

Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476
U. S. 355, 376 (1986). According to Alaska, federalism interests should preclude our finding that the RHA confers poweron the Secretary to condition issuance of a $ 10 construction permit on the disclaimer of a change in the preprojectfederal-state boundary. See

Organized Village of Kake v.
Egan, 369 U. S. 60 (1962).The United States responds that Congress has already

given the requisite authority to the agency through enactment of the RHA, and that the Secretary appropriately complied with that statute. In the Federal Government's view,
the RHA sets out an absolute prohibition on construction of
"any obstruction" in navigable waters, 33 U. S. C. $ 403, and
vests discretion in the Secretary of the Army to grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis when a structure is recommended by the Army Corps of Engineers. The United
States maintains that the Secretary has the discretion to
identify relevant considerations for issuing or denying a permit. Cf. Jay v. Boyd, 351 U. S. 345, 353-354 (1956).

We find the United States' argument to be the more persuasive one. Contrary to Alaska's position, the agency here
is not usurping authority. The Secretary is making no effort to alter the existing rights of a State to sovereignty over
submerged lands within three miles of the coastline. The
SLA makes this guarantee and nothing in the Corps' practice, as exercised in this case, alters this right. What the
Corps is doing, and what we find a reasonable exercise of
agency authority, is to determine whether an artificial addition to the coastline will increase the State's control over
submerged lands to the detriment of the United States' legitimate interests. If the Secretary so finds, nothing in the
SLA prohibits this fact from consideration as part of the
"public interest" review process under RHA $ 10. Were we

503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT
586 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
to accept Alaska's position, the Federal Government's interests in submerged lands outside the State's zone of control
would conceivably become hostage to a State's plans to add
artificial additions to its coastline. And if Alaska's reading
of the applicable law were followed to its logical extreme,
the United States would be powerless to protect its interests
in submerged lands if a State were to build an artificial addition to the coastline for the sole purpose of gaining sovereignty over submerged lands within the United States' zone,
so long as the project did not affect navigability or cause
pollution. Alaska points us to nothing in the SLA or to its
legislative history that mandates such a result.8

It is important to note that neither the SLA itself, nor
any of its legislative history, addresses the question of how
artificial additions to the coastline affect the 3-mile limit, as
we observed in United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139,
176, and n. 50 (1965). In that case, however, we did hold
that international law recognized the seaward expansion of
sovereignty through artificial additions to the coastline. Id.,
at 177. But we also stated that "the Special Master recognized that the United States, through its control over navigable waters, had power to protect its interests from encroachment by unwarranted artificial structures, and that the effect
of any future changes could thus be the subject of agreement
between the parties." Id., at 176. Alaska suggests that
this language should not be read to vest power in the Secretary to condition permits on sovereignty disclaimers because
the Special Master's report cited by the Court was written

8 Indeed, the SLA also excepts from its operation "any rights the United
States has in lands presently and actually occupied by the United States
under claim of right." 43 U. S. C. $ 1313(a). Furthermore, as to the lands
granted to the States, the SLA provides that "[t]he United States retains
all its navigational servitude and rights in and powers of regulation and
control of said lands and navigable waters for the constitutional purposes
of commerce, navigation, national defense, and international affairs."

$ 1314(a).

Opinion of the Court
prior to enactment of the SLA. Brief for Alaska 26 (citingCalifornia, supra, at 143). This contention fails to persuade

us, however, because we have already noted that the SLAdid not specifically address artificial changes to the coastline,
and because our opinion in California sanctioned the mecha-nism exercised by the Secretary in this case: "Arguments
based on the inequity to the United States of allowing Cali-fornia to effect changes in the boundary between federal and
state submerged lands by making future artificial changes inthe coastline are met, as the Special Master pointed out, by
the ability of the United States to protect itself through itspower over navigable waters." 381 U. S., at 177. Such
"power over navigable waters" would be meaningless indeedif we were to accept Alaska's view that RHA $ 10 permitted
the United States to exercise it only when the State's projectaffected navigability or caused pollution.

9

B
Alaska next contends that our decisions do not permit theSecretary to consider changes in federal-state boundaries as

part of the $ 10 "public interest" review process. First, theState suggests that such consideration would conflict with
our decision in California, supra, at 176-177. In that casewe adopted the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the

9 Alaska's argument is also weakened by the existence of the OCSLA,
43 U. S. C. $ 1331 et seq., which provides that the United States has "jurisdiction, control, and power of disposition" over the Outer Continental
Shelf, submerged lands identified by Congress as a "vital national resource
reserve" of great value. $$ 1332(1) and (3). The "public interest" review
undertaken by the Secretary in determining whether to issue a $ 10 permit
explicitly considers "the effects of the proposed work on the outer continental rights of the United States." 33 CFR $ 320.4(f) (1991). Such a
consideration in some form has been part of the equation of factors subject
to the Secretary's review process since 1969. See 33 CFR $ 209.120(d)(4)
(1969). It is perfectly consistent with the OCSLA for the Secretary to
consider a project's effects on United States' rights to submerged lands in
deciding whether to issue a $ 10 permit.

Opinion of the Court
Contiguous Zone, Apr. 29, 1958, 15 U. S. T. 1607, T. I. A. S.
No. 5639, for purposes of the SLA, explaining that such a
result would establish "a single coastline for both the administration of the Submerged Lands Act and the conduct of our
future international relations (barring an unexpected change
in the rules established by the Convention)." 381 U. S., at
165. Because construction of an artificial port facility will,
in certain circumstances, cause a change in the United
States' international seaward boundary,10 Alaska contends
that the goal of a "single" coastline will be frustrated if we
permit the Secretary to establish, in effect, one boundary
for international purposes and a different one for domestic
purposes.

As the United States maintains, however, our decision in
California did not specify a "goal" of achieving a "single"
coastline. Rather, our purpose was to give the SLA a
"definiteness and stability." Such aims, of course, can be
achieved without creating perfect symmetry between the
Convention and the Act. Stability in a boundary line is
achieved when the Secretary decides whether a State must
disclaim its rights to accreted submerged lands caused by
artificial additions just as surely as it is with ordinary coastline determinations occasioned by natural changes. The
State intimates that problems relating to fishing, salvage operations, and criminal jurisdiction will result from "[u]nstable and unpredictable administrative rules [that] will create
confusion in many areas." Reply Brief for Alaska 6. Such
speculative concerns, however, arise only when the 3-mile

10 Under international law, artificial alterations to the coastline will extend a country's boundaries for purposes of determining the territorial sea
and exclusive economic zone. Convention on the Territorial Sea and the

Opinion of the Court
boundary itself is indefinite.11 But uncertainty in cases suchas this one surely ends when the State disclaims its sovereignty over accreted submerged lands. The 3-mile bound-ary remains the same. And in those circumstances in which
the Secretary does not require a disclaimer and the 3-milefederal-state boundary extends from the new base line, presumably should there arise any of the federal-state problemsAlaska identifies, changes in nautical maps could readily be
amended to reflect such changes. Nothing in the parties'lodgings with the Court suggests why fishermen and other
sailors who rely on such charts will suffer prejudice by therule we announce today.

12

11 We add that variations between international and federal-state boundaries are not uncommon. As we recognized in United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139, 165-166 (1965), changes in Convention rules might render the international and federal-state boundaries noncoincident. In the
SLA itself, Congress recognized the possibility that variations between
international and federal-state boundaries might occur by providing that
a decree fixed by our Court "shall not be ambulatory" even though erosion
or accretion may alter the international boundary. 43 U. S. C. $ 1301(b).
We also note that the President's proclamation of a 12-mile territorial sea
for international law purposes functionally established a distinction between the international and the federal-state boundaries. See Argentine
Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 441, n. 8 (1989).
Finally, as the United States accurately points out, some coastal States
have created or permitted variations between the international boundary
and the federal-state boundaries through compromise agreements reached
with the United States. See Mississippi v. United States, 498 U. S. 16
(1990).

12 Alaska also suggests that the regulations at issue in this case conflict

with our decision in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825
(1987), which held that a coastal commission could not condition the granting of a construction permit on the conferring of a public access easement
across a landowner's beach. Alaska quotes language in Nollan to the effect that "unless the permit condition serves the same governmental purpose as the development ban, the building restriction is not a valid regulation of land use but an `out-and-out plan of extortion.' " Id., at 837. This
rule, however, has no applicability in a situation such as this one, in which
we evaluate the statutory authority underlying an agency's action. Id.,
at 836. Even were the Nollan situation analogous to that presented here,

503us2$61D 11-16-95 13:22:54 PAGES OPINPGT
590 UNITED STATES v. ALASKA

Opinion of the Court
Accordingly, we find no merit in Alaska's argument that,in conducting the permit review process under RHA $ 10,

the Secretary cannot consider a project's effects on thefederal-state boundary.

IV
Finally, Alaska maintains that even if the regulations are
authorized by the RHA, the Secretary's actions were notconsistent with those regulations. The State argues that

nothing in the applicable regulations authorizes the Army
Corps of Engineers to force a coastal State to abdicate rightsto submerged lands as a condition to issuance of a permit

for construction of a shoreline project. Alaska suggests that"the regulation addresses activities on submerged lands, not
the property interests in the submerged lands." Brief forAlaska 28. Nor can the Secretary derive authority to condition disclaimers on interagency coordination responsibilities,according to the State, because 33 CFR $ 320.4(g)(6) (1991)
states specifically that "dispute[s] over property ownership
will not be a factor in the Corps' public interest decision."Alaska further posits that the regulations at $ 320.4(a)(1),

which include numerous factors to be evaluated in balancingthe public interest, do not make reference to the United
States' property interests.As our analysis in Parts III-A and III-B suggests, we do
not find this argument persuasive. The regulations indicatethat the Corps may include in its evaluation the "effects of
the proposed work on the outer continental rights of the
United States." 33 CFR $ 320.4(f) (1991). It is untenableto maintain that the legitimate property interests of the

United States fall outside the relevant criteria for a decisionthat requires the Secretary to determine whether issuance
of a permit would affect the "public interest." The regulawe note that Alaska would gain no benefit because the purpose behind
imposing a condition for issuance of the permit--to protect federal rights
to submerged lands--is the same as that for denying the permit.

Opinion of the Court
tions at $ 320.4(g)(6), upon which Alaska places some weight,
clearly do not speak to property disputes of the type at issue
here. Moreover, we are unpersuaded by Alaska's contention
that the authority to require disclaimers cannot be inferred
from the regulatory scheme. It would make little sense, and
be inconsistent with Congress' intent, to hold that the Corps
legitimately may prohibit construction of a port facility, and
yet to deny it the authority to seek the less drastic alternative of conditioning issuance of a permit on the State's disclaimer of rights to accreted submerged lands.

Alaska also makes various challenges to the administrative
procedures followed in this case, and especially to the alleged
shortcoming of the Secretary in not formalizing the authority to condition disclaimers of sovereignty in the permitissuance process.13 The "policy" followed in this case,
however, is not contrary to law simply because of its specific omission from the regulations. See United States v.
Gaubert, 499 U. S. 315, 324 (1991) (observing that some
agencies "establish policy on a case-by-case basis, whether
through adjudicatory proceedings or through administration
of agency programs"). Certainly the Corps communicated
its intention openly to the appropriate state officials, and
therefore did not force Alaska " `to litigate with agencies on
the basis of secret laws.' " Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U. S. 1, 9 (1974) (quoting the case
below, 151 U. S. App. D. C. 174, 181, 466 F. 2d 345, 352 (1972)).
See Joint Stipulation of Facts 24a-25a. The United States
avers that such disclaimers have been requested on a case13 The State also contests the legality of the Secretary's actions in this
case under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706, especially
the regulations at 33 CFR $ 320.4(f) (1991) that authorize the Secretary
to take into account changes in the base line in making $ 10 permit issuance decisions. Contrary to Alaska's contention, these regulations were
adopted through notice and comment proceedings, see 39 Fed. Reg. 12115
(1974); 38 Fed. Reg. 12217 (1973), as were subsequent amendments, see 51
Fed. Reg. 41220 (1986); 42 Fed. Reg. 37122 (1977).

would result from identifying the option through a formalregulation." Brief for United States in Opposition 16.

We cannot say that in this case the Corps acted in anarbitrary or capricious manner. It notified state officials
promptly that the Solicitor of the Interior Department ob-jected to issuance of the permit; it specified a curative option
that could be pursued; and it afforded Alaska ample time toconsider the disclaimer, to consult with federal officials, and
then to draft the disclaimer. See Joint Stipulation of Facts2-7, App. to Joint Stipulation of Facts 11a-16a, 17a-19a, 20a-
21a, 22a-23a, 24a, 26a-31a. Nor can Alaska contend that itlacked notice, since the disclaimer it filed in this case is similar in form to those which it has filed in past $ 10 permitproceedings. See Joint Lodging of Permits and Disclaimers.14 We conclude that the Corps' actions in this case wereneither arbitrary nor capricious.

V
Accordingly, we hold that the Secretary of the Army acted
within his discretion in conditioning approval of the Nome

the oil-rich Prudhoe Bay, stated as follows:

"In consideration of the issuance, by the Secretary of the Army or his

designed to result in substantial secondary recovery from the existing

and SOHIO, the State of Alaska agrees that the shoreline, coast line, and
boundaries of the State of Alaska are not to be deemed to be in any way
affected by the construction, maintenance, or operation of such extension.

BARKER et al. v. KANSAS et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of kansas
No. 91-611. Argued March 3, 1992--Decided April 21, 1992
Title 4 U. S. C. $ 111 authorizes the States to tax federal employees' compensation if the taxation does not discriminate against the employees
because of the compensation's source. After Davis v. Michigan Dept.
of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, invalidated, under $ 111 and the doctrine of
intergovernmental tax immunity, the Michigan income tax imposed on
the benefits of federal, but not state and local, civil service retirees,
petitioners filed suit in a Kansas state court challenging that State's
imposition of an income tax on federal military retirement benefits but
not on the benefits received by retired state and local government employees. In affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment for
the state defendants, the State Supreme Court concluded that military
retirement benefits constitute reduced pay for reduced current services,
in contrast to the deferred compensation for past services embodied in
state and local government retirement benefits, and that this "significant differenc[e]" justified the State's differential treatment of the two
classes of retirees under Davis, supra, at 816.

Held: The Kansas tax on military retirees is inconsistent with $ 111. The

State Supreme Court's conclusion that, for purposes of state taxation,
military retirement benefits may be characterized as current compensation for reduced current services does not survive analysis on several
bases. First, there are no "significant differences" between military
retirees and state and local government retirees in terms of calculating
retirement benefits. The amount of retired pay a service member receives is computed not on the basis of the continuing duties he actually
performs, but on the basis of years served on active duty and the rank
obtained prior to retirement. Military benefits thus are determined in
a manner very similar to that of the Kansas Public Employee Retirement System. Second, this Court's precedents discussing military retirement pay provide no support for the state court's holding. The
statement in United States v. Tyler, 105 U. S. 244, 245, that such pay is
effectively indistinguishable from current compensation at a reduced
rate was made in the context of the particular holding of that case,
and cannot be taken as establishing that retirement benefits are for all
purposes the equivalent of current compensation for reduced current
services. And, although McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S. 210, 222, referred to Tyler, it did not expressly approve Tyler's description of mili503us2$62z 11-14-95 20:34:21 PAGES OPINPGT

tary retirement pay, but specifically reserved the question whether federal law prohibits a State from characterizing such pay as deferred
compensation and urged the States to tread with caution in this area.
Third, an examination of other federal statutes treating military retirement pay indicates that Congress for many purposes does not consider
such pay to be current compensation for reduced current services. See,
e. g., 10 U. S. C. $ 1408(c)(1); 26 U. S. C. $ 219(f)(1). Thus, military retirement benefits, like the benefits paid to Kansas government retirees, are
to be considered deferred pay for past services for purposes of $ 111.

596 BARKER v. KANSAS

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
The State of Kansas taxes the benefits received from the
United States by military retirees but does not tax the benefits received by retired state and local government employees. Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 79-3201 et seq. (1989).1 The issue
before us is whether the tax imposed on the military retirees
is inconsistent with 4 U. S. C. $ 111, which provides:

"The United States consents to the taxation of pay or
compensation for personal service as an officer or employee of the United States, a territory or possession
or political subdivision thereof, the government of the
District of Columbia, or an agency or instrumentality of
one or more of the foregoing, by a duly constituted taxing authority having jurisdiction, if the taxation does
not discriminate against the officer or employee because
of the source of the pay or compensation."

Shortly after our decision in Davis v. Michigan Dept. of
Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), which invalidated under $ 111
the Michigan income tax imposed on federal civil service re1 As the Kansas Supreme Court explained, to arrive at the adjusted
gross income of a taxpayer under the Kansas Income Tax Act, the starting
point is the adjusted gross income under the federal Internal Revenue
Code, which includes retirement benefits received by retired military officials and state and local government retirees. 249 Kan. 186, 190-191, 815
P. 2d 46, 49-50 (1991). As relevant for present purposes, in calculating
Kansas' adjusted gross income, the retirement benefits of state and local
governments are deducted and are exempt from taxation. See Kan. Stat.
Ann. $ 79-32,117(c)(ii) (Supp. 1990); $ 74-4923(b) (Supp. 1990); see also 249
Kan., at 190-191, 815 P. 2d, at 49-50 (listing classes exempt from state
taxation). Benefits received under the Federal Civil Service Retirement
System and by retired railroad employees are also exempt. Kan. Stat.
Ann. $$ 79-32,117(c)(vii) and (viii) (Supp. 1990). Not deducted and hence
taxable are benefits received by retired military personnel, certain Central
Intelligence Agency employees, officials serving in the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Association or the Public Health Service, and retired
federal judges. See 249 Kan., at 205, 815 P. 2d, at 58.

Opinion of the Court
tirees, two class actions were filed in Kansas District Court
challenging the state income tax imposed on military retirement benefits. Together the classes comprised some 14,000
military retirees, who received federal Armed Forces retirement benefits and were subject to the Kansas income tax for
one or more of the tax years from 1984 through 1989. The
classes also included spouses of the retirees, where applicable. Plaintiff taxpayers sought a declaratory judgment that
the Kansas income tax discriminates against them in favor
of state and local government retirees, in violation of $ 111
and the constitutional principles of intergovernmental tax
immunity applied in Davis. They also requested a permanent injunction to prohibit assessment of the tax against military retirees, as well as refunds of any taxes paid by class
members for the tax years 1984 through 1989.2 The District
Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and
the Supreme Court of Kansas affirmed, 249 Kan. 186, 815
P. 2d 46 (1991). We granted certiorari because the holding
below is arguably inconsistent with our decision in Davis and
conflicts with decisions of other state courts of last resort.
502 U. S. 977 (1991).3

Our approach to deciding this case is controlled by Davis,
which invalidated a Michigan law that imposed taxes on federal civil service retirees' benefits but not on benefits received by state and local government retirees. In reaching

States Constitution, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article 11, $ 2, of the Kansas Constitution. The
taxpayers further alleged that the State deprived them of their civil rights
as secured by the United States Constitution and laws in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment and of 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. See 249 Kan., at 188,
815 P. 2d, at 48.

598 BARKER v. KANSAS

Opinion of the Court
that decision, we traced the history of 4 U. S. C. $ 111 and
concluded that "the retention of immunity in $ 111 is coextensive with the prohibition against discriminatory taxes embodied in the modern constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity." 489 U. S., at 813. Under that
doctrine, we evaluate a state tax that is alleged to discriminate against federal employees in favor of state employees
by inquiring "whether the inconsistent tax treatment is
directly related to, and justified by, `significant differences
between the two classes.' " Id., at 816 (quoting Phillips
Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U. S.
376, 383 (1960)).

Well aware of Davis, the State Supreme Court undertook
such an inquiry and concluded that significant differences existed between military retirees, who are taxed by Kansas,
and state and local government retirees, who are not. The
court proceeded to consider the State's six proffered distinctions between military retirees and state and local government pensioners:

"(1) [F]ederal military retirees remain members of
the armed forces of the United States after they retire
from active duty; they are retired from active duty only;
(2) federal military retirees are subject to the Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and may be court martialed for offenses committed after retirement; (3) they
are subject to restrictions on civilian employment after
retirement; (4) federal military retirees are subject to
involuntary recall; (5) federal military retirement benefits are not deferred compensation but current pay for
continued readiness to return to duty; and (6) the federal military retirement system is noncontributory and
funded by annual appropriations from Congress; thus,
all benefits received by military retirees have never
been subject to tax." 249 Kan., at 196, 815 P. 2d, at 53.

Opinion of the Court
The court deemed the first four differences significant, notbecause in themselves they justified disparate tax treatment,

but because they supported the fifth distinction--that mili-tary retirement benefits constitute reduced pay for reduced
current services, rather than deferred compensation for past
services. Id., at 197, 815 P. 2d, at 53. By contrast, "[s]tateand local government retirement benefits are deferred compensation," the court found, and "not current pay." Ibid.The court concluded that this principal distinction between
military retirees and state and local government retirees jus-tified their differential treatment under the State's tax laws.
Accordingly, it held that a military retiree's benefits were
as legally subject to state taxation as the income of active
military personnel, whose pay was liable for state taxation
pursuant to the United States' consent, as expressed in 4
U. S. C. $ 111.

Military retirees unquestionably remain in the service and
are subject to restrictions and recall; in these respects they
are different from other retirees, including the state and
local government retirees whom Kansas does not tax. But
these differences, standing alone, do not justify the differential tax treatment at issue in this case. Nor do these differences persuasively indicate that, for purposes of 4 U. S. C.

$ 111, Kansas may treat military retirement pay as reduced
pay for reduced services. As a general matter, a military
retiree is entitled to a stated percentage of the pay level
achieved at retirement, multiplied by the years of creditable
service. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11, n. 16.
In this respect, "retired [military] pay bears some of the features of deferred compensation. The amount of retired pay
a service member receives is calculated not on the basis of
the continuing duties he actually performs, but on the basis
of years served on active duty and the rank obtained prior
to retirement." McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S. 210, 223,
n. 16 (1981) (citation omitted). By taking into account years
of service, the formula used to calculate retirement benefits

600 BARKER v. KANSAS

Opinion of the Court
leaves open the possibility of creating disparities amongmembers of the same preretirement rank. Such disparities

cannot be explained on the basis of "current pay for currentservices," since presumably retirees subject to these benefit
differentials would be performing the same "services." Fur-thermore, military benefits are determined in a manner very
similar to that of the Kansas Public Employee RetirementSystem. Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 11,n. 16. In terms of calculating retirement benefits, therefore,

we see no significant differences between military retireesand state and local government retirees that justify disparate tax treatment by the State.In holding to the contrary, however, the Kansas Supreme
Court found support in some of our precedents. In United
States v. Tyler, 105 U. S. 244 (1882), for example, the Courtdecided that officers retired from active military service

were entitled to the same percentage increase in pay that astatute had provided for active officers. The Court reached
this result in part by characterizing military retirement payas "compensation [that] is continued at a reduced rate, and
the connection is continued, with a retirement from activeservice only."

Id., at 245.4The State Supreme Court also found support in McCarty,

supra. In that case the California courts considered the ap-plicability of state community property laws to the military
retirement benefits for which an officer who had 18 years ofservice would be eligible 2 years hence. The California
courts had held these benefits subject to division upon disso4 The Court explained:
"It is impossible to hold that men who are by statute declared to be a
part of the army, who may wear its uniform, whose names shall be borne
upon its register, who may be assigned by their superior officers to specified duties by detail as other officers are, who are subject to the rules and
articles of war, and may be tried, not by a jury, as other citizens are, but
by a military court-martial, for any breach of those rules, and who may
finally be dismissed on such trial from the service in disgrace, are still not
in the military service." United States v. Tyler, 105 U. S., at 246.

lution of the marriage. In this Court the officer challengedthe holding on two grounds: first, that his prospective retirement benefits would be current pay, not subject to divisionas deferred compensation for services performed during the
marriage; and second, that applying the community property
law to retirement benefits conflicted with the federal mili-tary scheme regardless of whether retired pay is current income or deferred compensation. See id., at 221. Citing andquoting

Tyler, supra, our opinion noted that military retirees differed in some respects from other retired federal per-sonnel and that these differences had led various courts,

"including this one," to opine that military retirement
pay is reduced compensation for reduced current services.
453 U. S., at 222. We found no need, however, to decide
"whether federal law prohibits a State from characterizing
retired pay as deferred compensation," because we sustained
petitioner's alternative ground for overturning the judgment
below. Id., at 223.

The Kansas Supreme Court reasoned that McCarty's recognition of the Tyler holding, as well as the decisions of several Courts of Appeals, indicated that Tyler controlled the
description of military retirement pay. It thus concluded
that taxing military retirement pay as current income could
not validly be characterized as discriminating in favor of
state and local government employees, whose benefits were
exempt as being deferred compensation for past services.
See 249 Kan., at 198, 815 P. 2d, at 54. For several reasons,
we find this reading of our precedents unpersuasive.

First, Tyler's statement that retirement pay is effectively
indistinguishable from current compensation at a reduced
rate was unnecessary to reach the result that Congress intended to include the retirement benefits of a certain class
of retired officers in its provision for increasing the pay of
active-duty officers. In holding that such retired officers
were eligible for this increase, the Court based its holding
on the "uniform treatment" of retired and active officers in

503us2$62z 11-14-95 20:34:21 PAGES OPINPGT
602 BARKER v. KANSAS

Opinion of the Court
various statutory provisions that made the retired officers"a part of the army" for purposes of determining eligibility

for the increase. Tyler, 105 U. S., at 245-246. The Courtdescribed "a manifest difference in the two kinds of retirement, namely, retiring from active service and retiring
wholly and altogether from the service." Id., at 245. Thelatter group were ineligible for the pay increase because

their connection to the service had been completely termi-nated. In interpreting the applicable statutory provisions,
therefore, the "uniform treatment" of active-duty officersand the one class of retired officers was crucial to the decision; Tyler thus cannot be taken as establishing that retirement benefits are for all purposes the equivalent of current
compensation for reduced current services.

Moreover, although McCarty referred to Tyler, it did not
expressly approve Tyler's description of military retirement
pay. To the contrary, by declining to hold that federal law
forbade the States to treat military retirement pay as deferred income and resting our decision on another ground,
we reserved the question for another case. To punctuate
this point, we noted that, despite Tyler, the state courts
were divided as to whether military retirement pay is current income or deferred compensation. See McCarty, 453
U. S., at 222-223, nn. 15 and 16. We also stated that although military retirement pay bears some of the features of
deferred compensation, two indicia of retired military service
include a restriction on activities and a chance of being recalled to active duty. Hence, "the possibility that Congress
intended military retired pay to be in part current compensation for those risks and restrictions suggests that States
must tread with caution in this area, lest they disrupt the
federal scheme." Id., at 224, n. 16 (emphasis added).

In urging States to be cautious in treating military retirement pay, McCarty thus should not be read to consider Tyler
as settling the issue. Indeed, our handling of the community
property dissolution issue suggests the opposite. In Mc503us2$62z 11-14-95 20:34:21 PAGES OPINPGT

603Cite as: 503 U. S. 594 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Carty we said that "[t]he community property division of military retired pay rests on the premise that that pay, like a
typical pension, represents deferred compensation for services performed during the marriage." 453 U. S., at 221.
Had we accepted as definitive for all purposes Tyler's characterization of such pay as current income, our decision in McCarty would have been simple because we would have been
foreclosed from treating military retired pay as deferred
compensation. Such a holding would have been a much
easier way of deciding McCarty than the alternative basis
for decision--that the application of California's community
property law conflicted with the federal military retirement
scheme.

Finding no support for the Kansas Supreme Court's holding either in differences in the method of calculating benefits or in our precedents discussing military retirement pay,
we examine congressional intent, as inferred through other
applicable statutes that treat military retirement pay.
Promptly after McCarty, for example, Congress enacted the
Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10
U. S. C. $ 1408(c)(1), which negated McCarty's holding by giving the States the option of treating military retirement pay
"either as property solely of the member or as property of
the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of
the jurisdiction of such court." Because the premise behind
permitting the States to apply their community property
laws to military retirement pay is that such pay is deferred
compensation for past services, see McCarty, supra, at 221,
Congress clearly believed that payment to military retirees
is in many respects not comparable to ordinary remuneration
for current services. To extend to States the option of
deeming such benefits as part of the marital estate as a matter of state law would be inconsistent with the notion that
military retirement pay should be treated as indistinguishable from compensation for reduced current services.

604 BARKER v. KANSAS

Opinion of the Court
Furthermore, both federal and Kansas income tax law
treat military retirement pay as deferred compensation for
the purpose of determining deductibility of contributions to
an individual retirement account (IRA). For federal purposes, an IRA deduction is limited to the amount of the taxpayer's compensation or $2,000, whichever is less. But the
term "compensation" does not include "any amount received
as a pension or annuity and does not include any amount
received as deferred compensation." 26 U. S. C. $ 219(f )(1).
Under this provision, military retirement benefits are not
compensation for the purpose of making deductible contributions to an IRA. See generally M. Weinstein, Mertens Law
of Federal Income Taxation $ 25C.12, p. 58 (1988). The State
Supreme Court in this case noted that the Kansas tax law
follows the federal scheme and does not treat military retirement pay as current compensation for IRA purposes, like
other types of retirement benefits. 249 Kan., at 201-202, 815
P. 2d, at 56. The court believed that this treatment of military retirement pay was limited to the IRA context, id., at
202-203, 815 P. 2d, at 57, a position we find unpersuasive.
The court's view ignores the importance of this provision
to understanding that Congress for many purposes does not
consider military retirement pay to be current compensation
for current services. The State's position is weakened further by another fact, that Kansas tax law considers military
retirement benefits as current compensation under its general income tax provision but it does not for IRA deductibility purposes. The court asserted that "the distinction is not
so much the characterization as current income or deferred
compensation, but rather active versus passive activities required to earn the income." Id., at 203, 815 P. 2d, at 57.
But as the United States persuasively contends: "The State's
failure to treat military retired pay consistently suggests
that the State's articulated rationale is not in fact the basis
for the disparate treatment, but only a cloak for discrimina503us2$62z 11-14-95 20:34:21 PAGES OPINPGT

tion against federally funded benefits." Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 22.

We therefore determine that the Kansas Supreme Court's
conclusion that, for purposes of state taxation, military retirement benefits may be characterized as current compensation for reduced current services does not survive analysis
in light of the manner in which these benefits are calculated,
our prior cases, or congressional intent as expressed in other
provisions treating military retirement pay. For purposes
of 4 U. S. C. $ 111, military retirement benefits are to be considered deferred pay for past services. In this respect they
are not significantly different from the benefits paid to Kansas state and local government retirees.5 Accordingly, we
reverse the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring.

While I agree with the Court's explanation of why this
case is controlled by Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,
489 U. S. 803 (1989), I remain convinced that that case seri5 In listing the differences between the two classes of retirees involved
here, the State Supreme Court also observed that Kansas state and local
retirees have contributed to their retirement benefits and that their contributions have been taxed as part of their current income. Military personnel, on the other hand, do not contribute to their retirement benefits,
which are paid out of annual appropriations. As we read the court, however, it did not rest its decision on this difference and in the end returned
to its basic holding that military retirees "receive current compensation
while all persons receiving state and local government retirement benefits
receive deferred compensation." 249 Kan., at 205, 815 P. 2d, at 58. Moreover, we note that the State applies its income tax to other federal retirees
who contributed to their benefits, such as members of the Central Intelligence Agency, Foreign Service, bankruptcy judges, and United States
magistrates. See ibid.

ously misapplied the doctrine of intergovernmental tax im-munity. A state tax burden that is shared equally by federal retirees and the vast majority of the State's citizens doesnot discriminate against those retirees. See id., at 823-824
(Stevens, J., dissenting). The Federal Government has alegitimate interest in protecting its employees from disparate treatment, but federal judges should not be able to claima tax exemption simply because a State decides to give such
a benefit to the members of its judiciary instead of raisingtheir salaries. I write separately to make this point because
what I regard as this Court's perverse application of the non-discrimination principle is subject to review and correction
by Congress. See Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin,328 U. S. 408 (1946).

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY v.OHIO

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 90-1341. Argued December 3, 1991--Decided April 21, 1992*
The Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery

Act of 1976 (RCRA) prohibit the discharge or disposal of pollutants
without a permit, assign primary authority to issue permits to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and allow EPA to authorize a
State to supplant the federal permit program with one of its own under
specified circumstances. Respondent State sued petitioner Department
of Energy (DOE) over its operation of a uranium-processing plant in
Ohio, seeking, among other relief, both state and federal civil penalties
for past violations of the CWA and RCRA and of state laws enacted to
supplant those federal statutes. Although conceding, inter alia, that
both statutes render federal agencies liable for "coercive" fines imposed
to induce compliance with injunctions or other judicial orders designed
to modify behavior prospectively, DOE asserted sovereign immunity
from liability for "punitive" fines imposed to punish past violations.
The District Court held that both statutes waived federal sovereign
immunity from punitive fines, by both their federal-facilities and citizensuit sections. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, holding that
Congress had waived immunity as to punitive fines in the CWA's
federal-facilities section and RCRA's citizen-suit section, but not in
RCRA's federal-facilities section.

Held: Congress has not waived the National Government's sovereign immunity from liability for civil fines imposed by a State for past violations
of the CWA or RCRA. Pp. 615-629.

(a) This Court presumes congressional familiarity with the common
rule that any waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity must
be unequivocal. See United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, 538-539.
Such waivers must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign and
not enlarged beyond what the language requires. See, e. g., Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685-686. P. 615.

(b) Although both the CWA and RCRA citizen-suit sections authorize
a State to commence a civil action "against any person (including . . .

the United States . . .)," and authorize the district courts to impose
punitive fines under the Acts' civil-penalties sections, the incorporation
of the latter sections must be read to encompass their exclusion of the
United States from among the "person[s]" who may be fined, see, e. g.,
Engel v. Davenport, 271 U. S. 33, 38. The citizen-suit sections' initial
inclusion of the United States as a "person" goes only to the clauses
subjecting the Government to suit, and a broader waiver may not be
inferred. Both the CWA and RCRA contain various provisions expressly defining "person" for purposes of the entire section in which
the term occurs, thereby raising the inference that a special definition
not described as being for purposes of its "section" or "subchapter" was
intended to have the more limited application to its own clause or sentence. This textual analysis gives effect to all the language of the
citizen-suit sections, since their incorporations of their statutes' civilpenalties sections will effectively authorize punitive fines where a polluter other than the United States is brought to court, while their
explicit authorizations for suits against the United States concededly
authorize coercive sanctions. Pp. 615-620.

(c) The relevant portion of the CWA's federal-facilities section, 33
U. S. C. $ 1323(a)--which, inter alia, subjects the Government to "all . . .
State . . . requirements . . . and process and sanctions"; explains that
the Government's corresponding liability extends to "any requirement,
whether substantive or procedural . . . , and . . . to any process and
sanction . . . enforced in . . . cour[t]"; and provides that the Government
"shall be liable only for those civil penalties arising under Federal law
or imposed by a State . . . court . . . to enforce [its] order or . . . process"--does not waive the Government's immunity as to punitive fines.
Ohio's first argument, that $ 1323(a)'s use of the word "sanction" must
be understood to encompass punitive fines, is mistaken, as the term's
meaning is spacious enough to cover coercive as well as punitive fines.
Moreover, good reason to infer that Congress was using "sanction" in
its coercive sense, to the exclusion of punitive fines, lies in the fact that

$ 1323(a) twice speaks of "sanctions" in conjunction with judicial "process," which is characteristically "enforced" through forward-looking
coercive measures, and distinguishes "process and sanctions" from substantive "requirements," which may be enforced either by coercive or
punitive means. Pp. 620-623.

(d) Ohio's second $ 1323(a) argument, that fines authorized under an
EPA-approved state permit program are within the scope of the "civil
penalties" covered by the section's final waiver proviso, also fails. The
proviso's second modifier makes it plain that "civil penalties" must at
least include a coercive penalty since they are exemplified by penalties
"imposed by a State . . . court to enforce [its] order." Moreover, the

Syllabus
contention that the proviso's "arising under federal law" modifier is
broad enough to include penalties prescribed by EPA-approved state
statutes supplanting the CWA is answered by this Court's interpretation of the phrase "arising under" federal law in 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 to
exclude cases in which the plaintiff relies on state law, even when the
State's exercise of power in the particular circumstances is expressly
permitted by federal law, see, e. g., Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 116, and by the probability that Congress adopted
the same interpretation of "arising under federal law" here, see, e. g.,
ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270, 284-285. The plain language of the "civil penalties arising under federal law" phrase suggests an apparently expansive, but uncertain, waiver that is in tension
with the clear waiver for coercive fines evinced in $ 1323(a)'s antecedent text; that tension is resolved by the requirement that any statement of waiver be unequivocal and the rule that waivers be narrowly
construed. Pp. 623-627.

(e) RCRA's federal-facilities section--which, in relevant part, subjects the Government to "all . . . State . . . requirements, both substantive and procedural (including any requirement for permits or reporting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may
be imposed by a court to enforce such relief)," and provides that the
United States "shall [not] be immune . . . from any process or sanction
of any . . . Court with respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive
relief"--is most reasonably interpreted as including substantive standards and the coercive means for implementing those standards, but excluding punitive measures. All of the textual indications of the kinds of
requirements meant to bind the Government refer either to mechanisms
requiring review for substantive compliance (permit and reporting requirements) or to mechanisms for enforcing substantive compliance in
the future (injunctive relief and sanctions to enforce it), in stark contrast
to the statute's failure to mention any mechanism for penalizing past
violations. Moreover, the fact that the only specific reference to an
enforcement mechanism in the provision's final sentence describes
"sanction" as a coercive means of injunctive enforcement bars any inference that a waiver of immunity from "requirements" somehow extends
to punitive fines that are never so much as mentioned. Pp. 627-628.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question in these cases is whether Congress has
waived the National Government's sovereign immunity from
liability for civil fines imposed by a State for past violations
of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 86 Stat. 816, as amended,
33 U. S. C. $ 1251 et seq., or the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 90 Stat. 2796, as amended, 42
U. S. C. $ 6901 et seq. We hold it has not done so in either
instance.

I

The CWA prohibits the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters without a permit. Section 402, codified at 33
U. S. C. $ 1342, gives primary authority to issue such permits
to the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), but allows EPA to authorize a State to supplant the
federal permit program with one of its own, if the state
scheme would include, among other features, sufficiently
stringent regulatory standards and adequate provisions
for penalties to enforce them. See generally 33 U. S. C.

$ 1342(b) (requirements and procedures for EPA approval
of state water-pollution permit plans); see also 40 CFR

$$ 123.1-123.64 (1991) (detailed requirements for state plans).
RCRA regulates the disposal of hazardous waste in much the
same way, with a permit program run by EPA but subject to
displacement by an adequate state counterpart. See generally 42 U. S. C. $ 6926 (requirements and procedures for EPA

approval of state hazardous-waste disposal permit plans); seealso 40 CFR $$ 271.1-271.138 (1991) (detailed requirements

for state plans).This litigation began in 1986 when respondent State of
Ohio sued petitioner Department of Energy (DOE) in Fed-eral District Court for violations of state and federal pollution laws, including the CWA and RCRA, in operating itsuranium-processing plant in Fernald, Ohio. Ohio sought,
among other forms of relief, both state and federal civil pen-alties for past violations of the CWA and RCRA and of state
laws enacted to supplant those federal statutes. See, e. g.,Complaint || 64 (seeking penalties for violations of state law
and of regulations issued pursuant to RCRA); id., || 115(seeking penalties for violations of state law and of CWA).

Before the District Court ruled on DOE's motion for dis-missal, the parties proposed a consent decree to settle all

but one substantive claim,2 and Ohio withdrew all outstand-ing claims for relief except its request for civil penalties
for DOE's alleged past violations. See Consent DecreeBetween DOE and Ohio, App. 63. By a contemporaneous
stipulation, DOE and Ohio agreed on the amount of civilpenalties DOE will owe if it is found liable for them, see
Stipulation Between DOE and Ohio, id., at 87. The partiesthus left for determination under the motion to dismiss only
the issue we consider today: whether Congress has waivedthe National Government's sovereign immunity from liability for civil fines imposed for past failure to comply

1 Federal- and state-law fines differ both as to their amounts and the
sovereign that gets them, state-law fines going to the State, and federallaw fines going to the federal treasury. Ohio's state-law fines are currently lower than their federal-law counterparts. See generally Tr. of
Oral Arg. 36-37, 49-52; see also Brief for Respondent Ohio 36. The parties have agreed that if DOE is liable for both federal- and state-law fines
it will be assessed only for the latter. See Stipulation Between DOE and
Ohio, |||| 2.1, 3.1, App. 87, 89, 90.

2 The parties agreed to stay one claim pending completion of a technical

study. See Stipulation Between DOE and Ohio, App. 87-88.

DOE admits that the CWA and RCRA obligate a federalpolluter, like any other, to obtain permits from EPA or the
state permitting agency, see Brief for Petitioner DOE 24 (discussing CWA); id., at 34-40 (discussing RCRA).3 DOE alsoconcedes that the CWA and RCRA render federal agencies

liable for fines imposed to induce them to comply with injunc-tions or other judicial orders designed to modify behavior
prospectively, which we will speak of hereafter as "coercivefines." See

id., at 19-20, and n. 10; see also n. 14, infra.
The parties disagree only on whether the CWA and RCRA,in either their "federal-facilities"

4 or "citizen-suit" 5 sections,

waive federal sovereign immunity from liability for fines,

4 33 U. S. C. $ 1323(a) (CWA); 42 U. S. C. $ 6961 (RCRA). The federalfacilities sections of the CWA and RCRA govern the extent to which federally operated facilities, such as DOE's Fernald facility, are subject to the
requirements, including fines, of both their respective statutes and EPAapproved, state-law regulation and enforcement programs.

5 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(a) (CWA); 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(a) (RCRA). The citizensuit sections of the CWA and RCRA authorize private enforcement of the
provisions of their respective statutes. Unlike the waivers in the federalfacilities sections, which set forth the scope of federal sovereign immunity
from the requirements, including fines, of both their respective statutes
and EPA-approved, state-law regulation and enforcement programs, the
citizen-suit sections, to the extent they waive federal immunity at all,
waive such immunity only from federal-law penalties.

States may sue the United States under the citizen-suit sections. See
33 U. S. C. $ 1365(a) (any "citizen" may bring citizen suit under CWA); id.,

$ 1365(g) (defining "citizen" for purposes of CWA citizen-suit section as

614 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY v. OHIO

Opinion of the Court
which we will refer to as "punitive," imposed to punish pastviolations of those statutes or state laws supplanting them.

The United States District Court for the Southern Districtof Ohio held that both statutes waived federal sovereign immunity from punitive fines, by both their federal-facilitiesand citizen-suit sections. 689 F. Supp. 760 (1988). A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit affirmed in part, holding that Congress had
waived immunity from punitive fines in the CWA's federal-facilities section and RCRA's citizen-suit section, but not in
RCRA's federal-facilities section. 904 F. 2d 1058 (1990).6Judge Guy dissented, concluding that neither the CWA's
federal-facilities section nor RCRA's citizen-suit section suf-ficed to provide the waiver at issue.

Id., at 1065-1069.In No. 90-1341, DOE petitioned for review insofar as the

Sixth Circuit found any waiver of immunity from punitivefines, while in No. 90-1517, Ohio cross-petitioned on the holding that RCRA's federal-facilities section failed to effect sucha waiver.

7 We consolidated the two petitions and granted

certiorari, 500 U. S. 951 (1991).8

6 The court held that its ruling on the CWA's federal-facilities section
obviated any need to consider that statute's citizen-suit section. 904 F.
2d, at 1062.

7 Ohio's petition also asked that if we reversed the lower court's conclusion on the CWA's federal-facilities section, we consider whether that statute's citizen-suit section contained a waiver, an issue the Sixth Circuit
declined to reach.

8 The Sixth Circuit's holding that the CWA's federal-facilities section

waives federal sovereign immunity from punitive fines conflicts with the
Ninth Circuit's conclusion that that section does not constitute such a
waiver. See California v. Department of Navy, 845 F. 2d 222 (1988).
One Court of Appeals has found such a waiver in the CWA's citizen-suit
section. See Sierra Club v. Lujan, 931 F. 2d 1421 (CA10 1991). Two
other Courts of Appeals agree with the Sixth Circuit that RCRA's federalfacilities section does not waive federal sovereign immunity from punitive
fines. See Mitzelfelt v. Department of Air Force, 903 F. 2d 1293 (CA10
1990); United States v. Washington, 872 F. 2d 874 (CA9 1989). No other

Opinion of the Court

II
We start with a common rule, with which we presumecongressional familiarity, see

McNary v. Haitian RefugeeCenter, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496 (1991), that any waiver of

the National Government's sovereign immunity must beunequivocal, see

United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535,
538-539 (1980). "Waivers of immunity must be `construedstrictly in favor of the sovereign,'

McMahon v. United
States, 342 U. S. 25, 27 (1951), and not `enlarge[d] . . . beyond
what the language requires.' Eastern Transportation Co.v.

United States, 272 U. S. 675, 686 (1927)." Ruckelshaus v.
Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685-686 (1983). By these lightswe examine first the two statutes' citizen-suit sections, which

can be treated together because their relevant provisions aresimilar, then the CWA's federal-facilities section, and, finally,
the corresponding section of RCRA.

A
So far as it concerns us, the CWA's citizen-suit section
reads that

"any citizen may commence a civil action on his own
behalf--"(1) against any person (including . . . the United

States . . .) who is alleged to be in violation of (A) aneffluent standard or limitation under this chapter or (B)
an order issued by the Administrator or a State withrespect to such a standard or limitation . . . .

. . . . .
"The district courts shall have jurisdiction . . . to en-force such an effluent standard or limitation, or such an

order . . . as the case may be, and to apply any approCourt of Appeals appears to have considered whether RCRA's citizen-suit
section constitutes such a waiver.

Opinion of the Court
priate civil penalties under [33 U. S. C. $ 1319(d)]." 33U. S. C. $ 1365(a).

The relevant part of the corresponding section of RCRAis similar:

"[A]ny person may commence a civil action on hisown behalf --
"(1)(A) against any person (including . . . the UnitedStates) . . . who is alleged to be in violation of any permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, prohi-bition, or order which has become effective pursuant to
this chapter . . ."(B) against any person, including the United States
. . . who has contributed or who is contributing to thepast or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste whichmay present an imminent and substantial endangerment
to health or the environment . . . .. . . . .

". . . The district court shall have jurisdiction . . . toenforce the permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, prohibition, or order, referred to in para-graph (1)(A), to restrain any person who has contributed
or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any
solid or hazardous waste referred to in paragraph (1)(B),to order such person to take such other action as may
be necessary, or both, . . . and to apply any appropriatecivil penalties under [42 U. S. C. $$ 6928(a) and (g)]." 42
U. S. C. $ 6972(a).
A State is a "citizen" under the CWA and a "person" underRCRA,

9 and is thus entitled to sue under these provisions.

Ohio and its amici argue that by specifying the UnitedStates as an entity subject to suit and incorporating the civil9 See n. 5, supra.

503us2$63D 11-14-95 20:54:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
penalties sections of the CWA and RCRA into their respective citizen-suit sections, "Congress could not avoid noticing
that its literal language subject[ed] federal entities to penalties." Brief for Respondent Ohio 36; see also, e. g., Brief for
National Governors' Association et al. as Amici Curiae 14-
16. It is undisputed that each civil-penalties provision authorizes fines of the punitive sort.

The effect of incorporating each statute's civil-penalties
section into its respective citizen-suit section is not, however,
as clear as Ohio claims. The incorporations must be read as
encompassing all the terms of the penalty provisions, including their limitations, see, e. g., Engel v. Davenport, 271 U. S.
33, 38 (1926) (adoption of earlier statute by reference "makes
it as much a part of the later act as though it had been incorporated at full length"); see also 2B N. Singer, Sutherland on
Statutory Construction $ 51.08 (5th rev. ed. 1992), and significant limitations for present purposes result from restricting the applicability of the civil-penalties sections to "person[s]." 10 While both the CWA and RCRA define "person"

to cover States, subdivisions of States, municipalities, and
interstate bodies (and RCRA even extends the term to cover
governmental corporations),11 neither statute defines "person" to include the United States.12 Its omission has to be

10 See 33 U. S. C. $ 1319(d) (CWA civil-penalties section); 42 U. S. C.

$$ 6928(a), (g) (RCRA civil-penalties sections).

11 See 33 U. S. C. $ 1362(5) (defining "person" for purposes of CWA as

"an individual, corporation, partnership, association, State, municipality,
commission, or political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body"); 42
U. S. C. $ 6903(15) (defining "person" for purposes of RCRA as "an individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation (including a government
corporation), partnership, association, State, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body").

12 A subsection of RCRA dealing with a federal demonstration program

tracking the disposal of medical waste does in fact require that "each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States" "be treated
as" a "person." See Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988, $ 2(a), Pub. L.
100-582, 102 Stat. 2955, 42 U. S. C. $ 6992e(b). This broader provision,

618 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY v. OHIO

Opinion of the Court
seen as a pointed one when so many other governmental
entities are specified, see 2A Singer, supra, $ 47.23, a fact
that renders the civil-penalties sections inapplicable to the
United States.

Against this reasoning, Ohio argues that the incorporated
penalty provisions' exclusion of the United States is overridden by the National Government's express inclusion as a
"person" by each of the citizen-suit sections. There is, of
course, a plausibility to the argument. Whether that plausibility suffices for the clarity required to waive sovereign
immunity is, nonetheless, an issue we need not decide, for
the force of Ohio's argument wanes when we look beyond
the citizen-suit sections to the full texts of the respective
statutes.

What we find elsewhere in each statute are various provisions specially defining "person" and doing so expressly for
purposes of the entire section in which the term occurs.
Thus, for example, "[f]or the purpose of this [CWA] section,"
33 U. S. C. $ 1321(a)(7) defines "person" in such a way as
to exclude the various governmental entities included in
the general definition of "person" in 33 U. S. C. $ 1362(5).13
Again, "[f]or the purpose of this section," $ 1322(a)(8) defines
"person" so as to exclude "an individual on board a public
vessel" as well as the governmental entities falling within
the general definition. Similarly in RCRA, "[f]or the purpose of . . . subchapter [IX]" the general definition of "person" is expanded to include "the United States Government,"
among other entities. 42 U. S. C. $ 6991(6). Within each
statute, then, there is a contrast between drafting that
merely redefines "person" when it occurs within a particular
clause or sentence and drafting that expressly alters the
definition for any and all purposes of the entire section in

however, applies only "[f]or purposes of this Act," ibid., which refers to
the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 itself, see 102 Stat. 2950.

13 See n. 11, supra.

503us2$63D 11-14-95 20:54:20 PAGES OPINPGT

619Cite as: 503 U. S. 607 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
which the special definition occurs.14 Such differences intreatment within a given statutory text are reasonably understood to reflect differences in meaning intended, see 2ASinger, supra, $ 46.06, and the inference can only be that a
special definition not described as being for purposes of the"section" or "subchapter" in which it occurs was intended to
have the more limited application to its own clause or sen-tence alone. Thus, in the instances before us here, the inclusion of the United States as a "person" must go to the clausessubjecting the United States to suit, but no further.

This textual analysis passes the test of giving effect toall the language of the citizen-suit sections. Those sections'
incorporations of their respective statutes' civil-penaltiessections will have the effect of authorizing punitive fines
when a polluter other than the United States is brought tocourt by a citizen, while the sections' explicit authorizations
for suits against the United States will likewise be effective,since those sections concededly authorize coercive sanctions
against the National Government.15A clear and unequivocal waiver of anything more cannot
be found; a broader waiver may not be inferred, see Ruckels14 The dissent fails to appreciate this difference, arguing that $ 1365(a)
"states that any person, as used in that subdivision, includes the United
States," post, at 633. That statement is simply incorrect; the citizen-suit
section does no more than include the United States in the class of entities
that may be the subject of a suit brought under this section. In stark
contrast to the examples we have given, see n. 12, supra, $ 1365(a) does
not purport to apply the more expansive definition of "person" throughout the subsection; by its terms it speaks only to the first mention of
"person."

15 DOE explicitly concedes that such relief is available against the

United States in the context of citizen suits pursuant to the CWA, see
Brief for Petitioner DOE 33, and implicitly so concedes with regard to
RCRA, see id., at 40-41. DOE also concedes that both statutes' federalfacilities sections authorize imposition of injunctive-type relief against the
National Government, see id., at 19-20, and n. 10; see also id., at 35. DOE
concedes federal liability to such penalties without reference to the civilpenalties sections of the CWA or RCRA.

haus, 463 U. S., at 685-686. Ohio's reading is therefore to
be rejected. See United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., ante,
at 37.

B

The relevant portion of the CWA's federal-facilities section
provides that

"[e]ach department, agency, or instrumentality of the
. . . Federal Government . . . shall be subject to, and
comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, administrative authority, and process and
sanctions respecting the control and abatement of water
pollution in the same manner . . . as any nongovernmental entity . . . . The preceding sentence shall apply (A)
to any requirement whether substantive or procedural
(including any recordkeeping or reporting requirement,
any requirement respecting permits and any other requirement, whatsoever), (B) to the exercise of any Federal, State or local administrative authority, and (C) to
any process and sanction, whether enforced in Federal,
State, or local courts or in any other manner. . . . [T]he
United States shall be liable only for those civil penalties
arising under Federal law or imposed by a State or local
court to enforce an order or the process of such court."
33 U. S. C. $ 1323(a).

Ohio rests its argument for waiver as to punitive fines on
two propositions: first, that the statute's use of the word
"sanction" must be understood to encompass such fines, see
Brief for Respondent Ohio 26-29; and, second, with respect
to the fines authorized under a state permit program approved by EPA, that they "aris[e] under Federal law" despite
their genesis in state statutes, and are thus within the scope
of the "civil penalties" covered by the congressional waiver,
id., at 29-35.

Opinion of the Court

1
Ohio's first proposition is mistaken. As a general matter,the meaning of "sanction" is spacious enough to cover not

only what we have called punitive fines, but coercive ones aswell, and use of the term carries no necessary implication
that a reference to punitive fines is intended. One of thetwo dictionaries Ohio itself cites reflects this breadth. See
Black's Law Dictionary 1341 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "sanc-tion" as a "[p]enalty or other mechanism of enforcement used
to provide incentives for obedience with the law or withrules and regulations. That part of a law which is designed
to secure enforcement by imposing a penalty for its violationor offering a reward for its observance"). Ohio's other such
source explicitly adopts the coercive sense of the term. SeeBallentine's Law Dictionary 1137 (3d ed. 1969) (defining sanction in part as "[a] coercive measure").Beyond the dictionaries, examples of usage in the coercive
sense abound. See, e. g., Penfield Co. of Cal. v. SEC, 330U. S. 585, 590 (1947) (fines and imprisonment imposed as "coercive sanctions" when imposed to compel target "to do whatthe law made it his duty to do");

Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S.624, 633-634, n. 6 (1988) ("sanction" in Penfield was civil because it was conditional; contemnor could avoid "sanction"by agreeing to comply with discovery order); Fed. Rule Civ.

orders, including holding recalcitrant deponent in contempt);
United States v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 648 F. 2d 642, 649(CA9 1981) (discussing "sanctions," imposed pursuant to Fed.

Rule Civ. Proc. 37(b), consisting of fine for each day litigant
remained in noncompliance with District Court's discoveryorder);

"coercive contempt sanction"); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann.

litigant's failure to obey discovery order, "terminating sanction[s]," including "contempt sanction[s]" and orders staying
further proceedings by recalcitrant litigant). Cf. 42 U. S. C.

$ 6992e(a) (waiving federal medical-waste disposal facilities'
sovereign immunity from various requirements, including
such "sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce
[injunctive] relief "); id., $ 6961 (using same language to waive
other federal facilities' immunity from RCRA provisions).
Thus, resort to a "sanction" carries no necessary implication
of the punitive as against the coercive.

The term's context, of course, may supply a clarity that
the term lacks in isolation, see, e. g., Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa
Dept. of Revenue, 488 U. S. 19, 26 (1988). It tends to do so
here, but once again the clarity so found cuts against Ohio's
position. The word "sanction" appears twice in $ 1323(a),
each time within the phrase "process and sanction[s]." The
first sentence subjects Government agencies to "process and
sanctions," while the second explains that the Government's
corresponding liability extends to "any process and sanction,
whether enforced in Federal, State, or local courts or in any
other manner."

Opinion of the Court
Three features of this context are significant. The first isthe separate statutory recognition of three manifestations of

governmental power to which the United States is subjected:substantive and procedural requirements; administrative
authority; and "process and sanctions," whether "enforced"in courts or otherwise. Substantive requirements are thus
distinguished from judicial process, even though each mightrequire the same conduct, as when a statute requires and a
court orders a polluter to refrain from discharging without apermit. The second noteworthy feature is the conjunction
of "sanction[s]" not with the substantive "requirements," butwith "process," in each of the two instances in which "sanction" appears. "Process" normally refers to the procedureand mechanics of adjudication and the enforcement of decrees or orders that the adjudicatory process finally pro-vides. The third feature to note is the statute's reference
to "process and sanctions" as "enforced" in courts or other-wise. Whereas we commonly understand that "requirements" may be enforced either by backward-looking penal-ties for past violations or by the "process" of forward-looking
orders enjoining future violations, such forward-looking or-ders themselves are characteristically given teeth by equity's traditional coercive sanctions for contempt: fines andbodily commitment imposed pending compliance or agreement to comply. The very fact, then, that the text speaksof sanctions in the context of enforcing "process" as distinct
from substantive "requirements" is a good reason to inferthat Congress was using "sanction" in its coercive sense, to
the exclusion of punitive fines.

2
The last relevant passage of $ 1323(a), which provides that"the United States shall be liable only for those civil penalties arising under Federal law or imposed by a State or localcourt to enforce an order or the process of such court," is not
to the contrary. While this proviso is unlike the preceding

624 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY v. OHIO

Opinion of the Court
text in that it speaks of "civil penalties," not "sanctions," itis obviously phrased to clarify or limit the waiver preceding

it. Here our concern is with its clarifying function (leavingits limiting effect until later), and it must be said that as a
clarifier the proviso speaks with an uncertain voice. To be
sure, the second modifier of "civil penalties" at least makesit plain that the term (like "sanction," to which it relates)

must include a coercive penalty, since "civil penalties" areexemplified by those "imposed by a State or local court to
enforce an order or the process of such court." To this ex-tent, then, the proviso serves to confirm the reading we
reached above.

The role of the first modifier is problematical, however.
On the one hand, it tugs toward a more expansive reading of
"civil penalties." If by using the phrase "civil penalties arising under Federal law" Congress meant nothing more than
coercive fines arising under federal law, it would have been
simpler to describe all such penalties as imposed to enforce
an order or process, whether of a local, state, or federal
court. Thus, the first modifier suggests that the civil penalties arising under federal law may indeed include the punitive along with the coercive. Nevertheless, a reading expansive enough to reflect a waiver as to punitive fines would
raise a new and troublesome question about the source of
legal authority to impose such a fine. As far as federal law
is concerned, the only available source of authority to impose
punitive fines is the civil-penalties section, $ 1319(d). But,
as we have already seen, that section does not authorize liability against the United States, since it applies only against
"persons," from whom the United States is excluded.

Ohio urges us to find a source of authority good against
the United States by reading "arising under Federal law" to
include penalties prescribed by state statutes approved by
EPA and supplanting the CWA. Ohio argues for treating a
state statute as providing penalties "arising under Federal
law" by stressing the complementary relationship between

Opinion of the Court
the relevant state and federal statutes and the role of suchstate statutes in accomplishing the purpose of the CWA.

This purpose, as Ohio states it, is "to encourage compliancewith comprehensive, federally approved water pollution programs while shielding federal agencies from unauthorized
penalties." Brief for Respondent Ohio 34-35. Ohio assertsthat "federal facility compliance . . . cannot be . . . accomplished without the [punitive] penalty deterrent." Id., at 35.The case for such pessimism is not, however, self-evident.
To be sure, an agency of the Government may break the lawwhere it might have complied voluntarily if it had faced the
prospect of punitive fines for past violations. But to say
that its "compliance cannot be . . . accomplished" without
such fines is to assume that without sanctions for past conduct a federal polluter can never be brought into future compliance, that an agency of the National Government would
defy an injunction backed by coercive fines and even a threat
of personal commitment. The position seems also to ignore
the fact that once such fines start running they can be every
dollar as onerous as their punitive counterparts; it could be
a very expensive mistake to plan on ignoring the law indefinitely on the assumption that contumacy would be cheap.

Nor does the complementary relationship between state
and federal law support Ohio's claim that state-law fines
thereby "arise under Federal law." Plain language aside,
the far more compelling interpretative case rests on the best
known statutory use of the phrase "arising under federal
law," appearing in the grant of federal-question jurisdiction
to the courts of the United States. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1331.
There, we have read the phrase "arising under" federal law
to exclude cases in which the plaintiff relies on state law,
even when the State's exercise of power in the particular
circumstances is expressly permitted by federal law. See,
e. g., Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109,
116 (1936) (suit over state taxation of nationally chartered
bank does not arise under federal law even though such taxa503us2$63D 11-14-95 20:54:20 PAGES OPINPGT

tion would not be possible without federal approval); International Bridge Co. v. New York, 254 U. S. 126, 133 (1920)
(congressional approval of construction of bridge by statechartered company does not make federal law the source of
right to build bridge).16 Congress' use of the same language
in $ 1323(a) indicates a likely adoption of our prior interpretation of that language. See, e. g., ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270, 284-285 (1987) (interpreting statute
based on previous interpretation of same language in another statute); Northcross v. Memphis Bd. of Education, 412
U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam) (similarity of language in
two statutes "strong indication that [they] should be interpreted pari passu"). The probability is enough to answer
Ohio's argument that "arising under Federal law" in $ 1323(a)
is broad enough to cover provisions of state statutes approved by a federal agency but nevertheless applicable ex
proprio vigore.

Since Ohio's argument for treating state-penalty provisions as arising under federal law thus fails, our reading of
the last-quoted sentence from $ 1323(a) leaves us with an
unanswered question and an unresolved tension between
closely related statutory provisions. The question is still
what Congress could have meant in using a seemingly expansive phrase like "civil penalties arising under Federal

law." Perhaps it used it just in case some later amendment
might waive the Government's immunity from punitive sanctions. Perhaps a drafter mistakenly thought that liability for
such sanctions had somehow been waived already. Perhaps

16 Of course, the phrase "arising under" federal law appears in Article
III, $ 2, of the Constitution, where it has received a broader construction
than in its statutory counterpart. See Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank
of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 494-495 (1983). Ohio, however, has offered no
reason to believe Congress intended this broader reading rather than the
narrower statutory reading. Even assuming an equal likelihood for each
intent, our rule requiring a narrow construction of waiver language tips
the balance in favor of the narrow reading.

Opinion of the Court
someone was careless. The question has no satisfactoryanswer.

We do, however, have a response satisfactory for sovereignimmunity purposes to the tension between a proviso suggesting an apparently expansive but uncertain waiver and itsantecedent text that evinces a narrower waiver with greater
clarity. For under our rules that tension is resolved by therequirement that any statement of waiver be unequivocal: as
against the clear waiver for coercive fines the indication of awaiver as to those that are punitive is less certain. The rule
of narrow construction therefore takes the waiver no furtherthan the coercive variety.

C
We consider, finally, the federal-facilities section ofRCRA, which provides, in relevant part, that the National

Government

"shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State,interstate, and local requirements, both substantive and

procedural (including any requirement for permits or re-porting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such
sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce suchrelief) . . . in the same manner, and to the same extent,
as any person is subject to such requirements . . . . Nei-ther the United States, nor any agent, employee, or officer thereof, shall be immune or exempt from any processor sanction of any State or Federal Court with respect
to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief." 42U. S. C. $ 6961.

Ohio and its amici stress the statutory subjection of federalfacilities to "all . . . requirements," which they would have
us read as an explicit and unambiguous waiver of federalsovereign immunity from punitive fines. We, however,
agree with the Tenth Circuit that "all . . . requirements" "canreasonably be interpreted as including substantive standards
and the means for implementing those standards, but exclud503us2$63D 11-14-95 20:54:20 PAGES OPINPGT

ing punitive measures." Mitzelfelt v. Department of AirForce, 903 F. 2d 1293, 1295 (1990).

We have already observed that substantive requirementscan be enforced either punitively or coercively, and the Tenth
Circuit's understanding that Congress intended the latterfinds strong support in the textual indications of the kinds
of requirements meant to bind the Government. Signifi-cantly, all of them refer either to mechanisms requiring
review for substantive compliance (permit and reportingrequirements) or to mechanisms for enforcing substantive
compliance in the future (injunctive relief and sanctions toenforce it). In stark contrast, the statute makes no mention
of any mechanism for penalizing past violations, and this ab-sence of any example of punitive fines is powerful evidence
that Congress had no intent to subject the United States toan enforcement mechanism that could deplete the federal fisc
regardless of a responsible officer's willingness and capacityto comply in the future.

The drafters' silence on the subject of punitive sanctionsbecomes virtually audible after one reads the provision's
final sentence, waiving immunity "from any process or sanc-tion of any State or Federal Court with respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief." The fact that thedrafters' only specific reference to an enforcement mechanism described "sanction" as a coercive means of injunctiveenforcement bars any inference that a waiver of immunity
from "requirements" somehow unquestionably extends topunitive fines that are never so much as mentioned.

17

17 We also reject Ohio's argument purporting to rest on Hancock v.
Train, 426 U. S. 167 (1976). In Hancock we determined that, as then written, $ 118 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1857f (1970 ed.), did not require
federal facilities to obtain state pollution permits as a condition of continued operation. The relevant portion of $ 1857 required the National Government to "comply with Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements
respecting control . . . of air pollution." Ohio and its amici stress the
point in our analysis where we found it significant that $ 1857 did not
require federal compliance with "all federal, state, interstate, and local

requirements," or with "all requirements of the applicable state implementation plan." See 426 U. S., at 182 (emphasis in original). They read
our opinion as drawing a distinction between substantive and procedural
requirements, and as interpreting $ 1857 as not waiving federal immunity
from procedural requirements, the group in which we classified the state
permit programs. Ohio and its amici conclude that the drafters of RCRA
took our observations in Hancock to heart, and, seeking to waive federal
sovereign immunity for all purposes, including liability for civil punitive
fines, waived immunity for "all . . . requirements, both substantive and
procedural." 42 U. S. C. $ 6961; see Brief for Respondent Ohio 41; see
also, e. g., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 21.

The answer to this is twofold. Indications of the breadth of the Government's obligation to comply with substantive or procedural requirements
dealt with in Hancock do not necessarily translate into indications that
the Government's subjection to mechanisms for enforcing those obligations
extends to punitive as well as to coercive sanctions. In any event, if Congress had in fact entertained the intention Ohio suggests, it would hardly
have avoided any example of punitive fines at the same time as it expressly
mentioned the coercive injunctive remedy.

In an effort to compel Government agencies to adhere tothe environmental laws under which private industry must

operate, Congress waived sovereign immunity for civil pen-alties in the federal facilities and citizen suit provisions of
the CWA, 33 U. S. C. $$ 1323, 1365(a), and in the citizen suitprovision of the RCRA, 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(a). Today, the majority thwarts this effort by adopting "an unduly restrictiveinterpretation" of both statutes and writing the waivers out
of existence. Canadian Aviator, Ltd. v. United States, 324U. S. 215, 222 (1945);

Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Bd. ofUniv. and School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 287 (1983). In so

doing, the majority ignores the "unequivocally expressed"intention of Congress, United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,

provisions of the CWA are so read, the conclusion becomesinescapable that Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity for civil penalties under the statute.The federal facilities provision, 33 U. S. C. $ 1323(a), see
ante, at 620, both establishes the Government's duty to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of theCWA and explicitly waives immunity for civil penalties.

The first part of the federal facilities provision states thatthe Federal Government is subject to "any process and sanction," regardless of the court in which it is enforced.The majority devotes three pages of its opinion to a tortured discussion of whether subjecting the Government to"process and sanction" encompasses liability for civil penalties. See ante, at 621-623. Rather than engaging in these
analytic gymnastics, the Court needed to do nothing morethan read the rest of the federal facilities provision. It

clearly states:

"[T]he United States shall be liable only for those civil
penalties arising under Federal law or imposed by aState or local court to enforce an order or the process of

such court." 33 U. S. C. $ 1323(a).
Obviously, Congress intended the United States to be liablefor civil penalties. The plain language of the statute says

so. Therefore, the broad term "sanctions" used earlier in
the same subsection must include these penalties. Anyother reading would contravene the "ancient and sound rule

of construction that each word in a statute should, if possible,be given effect."

The question, then, is not whether Congress has waived
federal immunity for civil penalties. The waiver here unambiguously reached those claims for civil penalties "arising

under" federal law. The critical inquiry is under what cir-cumstances civil penalties arise under federal law.

A
Ohio contends that it is entitled to recover civil penaltieson two different claims: the first brought under the CWA

itself, through its citizen suit provision, 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(a),and the second under the Ohio water pollution laws that
arise under the CWA's distinctive mechanism allowingStates to administer CWA enforcement within their own
boundaries. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 6111.09 (Supp. 1987). Iagree that the waiver of immunity covers both types of
claims. 1

First, the CWA waives sovereign immunity for civil pen-alty claims brought under the Act's citizen suit clause. 33
U. S. C. $ 1365(a). See ante, at 615-616. That section un-ambiguously provides authority to sue "any person (including . . . the United States . . .)" and to recover "any appro-priate civil penalties" under the civil penalties clause of the
CWA enforcement provision, $ 1319(d). It is impossible tofathom a clearer statement that the United States may be
sued and found liable for civil penalties. The enforcementprovision lists those violations that may be subject to a civil
penalty, sets a ceiling on the size of the penalty, and listsfactors that the court should consider in determining the
amount of a penalty. Ibid.Nevertheless, the majority concludes that this straightforward approach is not sufficient to waive immunity. TheCourt latches onto the fact that the enforcement provision
does not include its own definition of "person" and that theCWA's general purpose definition of the word "person" does
not include the United States. $ 1362(5).4 Again, there is a

4 Section 1362(5) states: "The term `person' means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, State, municipality, commission, or political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body."

short answer to this claim. The statute says, in plain Eng-lish, that its general definitions apply "[e]xcept as otherwise

specifically provided." $ 1362. The citizen suit provision isone of the exceptions to the general rule; it states that any
person, as used in that subdivision, includes the UnitedStates. $ 1365(a). Certainly this special definition applies
to the civil penalty enforcement provisions it incorporates.To conclude otherwise is to resort to "ingenuity to create
ambiguity" that simply does not exist in this statute.
Rothschild v. United States, 179 U. S. 463, 465 (1900).

2
The CWA also waives immunity for civil penalties arisingunder state laws enacted to allow local administration of

the CWA permit program. The majority rejects this propo-sition by relying on cases in which the Court has held that
state laws approved by the Federal Government do not"arise under" federal law. See ante, at 625-626. But these
cases are inapposite because the CWA regime goes farbeyond simple federal approval of state action. Instead,
the Act establishes a distinctive variety of cooperativefederalism.

As we recently explained: "The Clean Water Act antici-pates a partnership between the States and the Federal
Government . . . ." Arkansas v. Oklahoma, ante, at 101.To effectuate this partnership, the CWA authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue pollution dis-charge permits, 33 U. S. C. $ 1342, but provides that a State
may "administer" its own permit system if it complies withdetailed statutory and regulatory requirements. 33 U. S. C.

$ 1342(b); 40 CFR $$ 123.1-123.64 (1991). A State that seeksto "administer" a permitting program is required to adopt a
system of civil penalties. 33 U. S. C. $ 1342(b)(7). Federalregulations establish the minimum size of the penalties and
mandate how, and when, they must be imposed. 40 CFR$$ 123.27(a)(3)(i), 123.27(b)(1), 123.27(c) (1991).

Opinion of White, J.
Even when a State obtains approval to administer itspermitting system, the Federal Government maintains an

extraordinary level of involvement. EPA reviews statewater quality standards. 33 U. S. C. $ 1313(c). It retains
authority to object to the issuance of particular permits,$ 1342(d)(2), to monitor the state program for continuing compliance with federal directives, $ 1342(c), and even to enforcethe terms of state permits when the State has not instituted
enforcement proceedings, $ 1319(a).Under this unusual statutory structure, compliance with
a state-administered permit is deemed compliance with theCWA. $ 1342(k). Indeed, in

EPA v. Oklahoma, decidedtogether with
Arkansas v. Oklahoma, the EPA assertedthat "the showing necessary to determine under the CWA

whether there is compliance with any particular state [pol-lution] standard is itself a matter of federal, not state,
law." Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1991, No. 90-1266, p. 18,n. 21 (emphasis added). Cf. Arkansas v. Oklahoma, ante, at
110 (recognizing the "federal character" of state pollutionstandards in interstate pollution controversy). This conclusion is not surprising, since the citizen suit provision of theCWA authorizes any citizen to sue under federal law for a
"violation of . . . an order issued by . . . a State with respectto [any effluent] standard or limitation . . . ." 33 U. S. C.

$ 1365(a).Given the structure of the CWA, it is apparent that the
"arising under" limitation on the waiver of sovereign immu-nity was not intended to protect the Federal Government
from exposure to penalties under state laws that merely pro-vide for the administration of a CWA permit system. Instead, the limitation shields the Government from liabilityunder state laws that have not been subject to initial EPA
review and ongoing agency supervision.5 Only by resorting

5 States may adopt more rigorous water quality standards than those
established under the CWA. EPA regulations provide that a State is not
precluded from:

to "an unduly restrictive interpretation" of the CWA andfocusing on the "arising under" language in isolation can the

majority reach a contrary result. Canadian Aviator, 324U. S., at 222.

B
Because of its determination to find that civil penalties arenot available against the Government, the majority paints

itself into a corner. The Court acknowledges that its distor-tion of the statute leaves the phrase "civil penalties arising
under Federal law" devoid of meaning. See ante, at 626-627. But rather than reading the CWA as Congress wrote
it and recognizing that it effects a waiver of immunity, themajority engages in speculation about why Congress could
not have meant what it unambiguously said:

"Perhaps it used [civil penalties arising under federallaw] just in case some later amendment might waive the

Government's immunity from punitive sanctions. Per-haps a drafter mistakenly thought that liability for such
sanctions had somehow been waived already. Perhapssomeone was careless." Ibid.

It is one thing to insist on an unequivocal waiver of sovereignimmunity. It is quite another "to impute to Congress a desire for incoherence" as a basis for rejecting an explicitwaiver. Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, 306 U. S. 381, 394 (1939); Franchise Tax Bd. ofCalifornia v. Postal Service, 467 U. S. 512, 524 (1984). Cf.
Canadian Aviator, supra, at 225. That is what the majoritydoes today. "Surely the interest in requiring the Congress

more extensive than those required under this part;

is not part of the Federally approved program." 40 CFR $ 123.1(h)(i)

the actual meaning of the message it tried to convey in astatutory provision that is already on the books." Nordic
Village, ante, at 45 (Stevens, J., dissenting).The unambiguous language of the federal facilities and citizen suit provisions of the CWA clearly contemplate a waiverof immunity as to suit for civil damages, and "once Congress
has waived sovereign immunity over certain subject matter,the Court should be careful not to `assume the authority

II
Turning to the RCRA, I agree with the majority and withthe Court of Appeals that the RCRA federal facilities provision does not effect an unambiguous waiver of immunityfrom civil penalties, 42 U. S. C. $ 6961. See ante, at 627-628.
The section makes no reference to civil penalties and, in-stead, waives immunity for "any such injunctive relief."
This language comports with the Government's claim thatthe waiver is intended to reach only coercive and not punitive sanctions. The provision certainly does not unequivo-cally encompass civil penalties. Therefore, I join Part II-C
of the Court's opinion.However, I would find a waiver under RCRA's citizen suit
provision, 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(a), see ante, at 616, which is verysimilar to the citizen suit provision in the CWA, for the reasons I have explained above. See Part I-A-1, supra.

TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZ et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 91-571. Argued March 2, 1992--Decided April 21, 1992
On the schedule she filed pursuant to $ 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code,

debtor Davis listed as exempt property the expected proceeds from her
pending employment discrimination suit. Petitioner Taylor, the trustee
of Davis' bankruptcy estate, did not object to the claimed exemption
within the 30-day period allowed by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4003(b). However, upon later learning that the discrimination suit
had been settled for a substantial sum, Taylor filed a complaint in the
Bankruptcy Court against respondents, Davis' attorneys in that suit,
demanding that they turn over settlement proceeds as property of
Davis' estate. Concluding that Davis had no statutory basis for claiming the proceeds as exempt, the court ordered respondents to "return"
to Taylor a sum sufficient to pay off all of Davis' unpaid creditors, and
the District Court affirmed. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding
that the Bankruptcy Court had erred because Davis had claimed the
money in question as exempt, and Taylor had failed to object to the
claimed exemption in a timely manner.

Held: A trustee may not contest the validity of a claimed exemption after

the Rule 4003(b) 30-day period has expired, even though the debtor had
no colorable basis for claiming the exemption. Pp. 642-646.

(a) Because the parties agree that Davis did not have a statutory
right to exempt more than a small portion of the lawsuit proceeds, let
alone the full amount, Taylor apparently could have made a valid objection under $ 522(l)--which provides, inter alia, that "property claimed
as exempt . . . is exempt" "[u]nless a party in interest objects," but does
not specify the time for objecting--if he had acted promptly under Rule
4003(b)--which establishes the 30-day objections period for trustees and
creditors "unless, within such period, further time is granted by the
court." P. 642.

(b) However, Taylor's failure to promptly object precludes him from
challenging the validity of the exemption at this time, regardless of
whether or not Davis had a colorable statutory basis for claiming it.
By negative implication, Rule 4003(b) indicates that a trustee may not
object after 30 days unless a further extension of time is granted. Because no such extension was allowed by the Bankruptcy Court in this
case, $ 522(l) has made the settlement proceeds exempt. This Court

Opinion of the Court
rejects Taylor's argument that, in order to discourage debtors from
claiming meritless exemptions merely in hopes that no one will object,
a court may invalidate an exemption after expiration of the 30-day period where the debtor did not have a good-faith or reasonably disputable
basis for claiming it. To the extent that the various Code and Rules
provisions aimed at penalizing debtors and their attorneys for improper
conduct fail to limit bad-faith exemption claims, Congress, rather than
this Court, may rewrite $ 522(l) to include a good-faith requirement.
Pp. 643-645.

(c) Taylor's assertion that $ 105(a) of the Code permits courts to disallow exemptions not claimed in good faith despite the absence of timely
objections to such exemptions will not be considered by this Court, since
that argument was first raised in Taylor's opening brief on the merits
and was neither raised nor resolved in the lower courts. Pp. 645-646.

938 F. 2d 420, affirmed.

Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist,
C. J., and White, Blackmun, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Souter,
JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, post, p. 646.

Phillip S. Simon argued the cause for respondents. With
him on the brief was Kenneth P. Simon.*

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code requires a debtor
to file a list of the property that the debtor claims as statutorily exempt from distribution to creditors. Federal Rule of
Bankruptcy Procedure 4003 affords creditors and the bankruptcy trustee 30 days to object to claimed exemptions. We
must decide in this case whether the trustee may contest the
validity of an exemption after the 30-day period if the debtor
had no colorable basis for claiming the exemption.

640 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZ

Opinion of the Court

I
The debtor in this case, Emily Davis, declared bankruptcywhile she was pursuing an employment discrimination claim

in the state courts. The relevant proceedings began in 1978when Davis filed a complaint with the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations. Davis alleged that her employer,Trans World Airlines (TWA), had denied her promotions on
the basis of her race and sex. The Commission held forDavis as to liability but did not calculate the damages owed
by TWA. The Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas re-versed the Commission, but the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court reversed that court and reinstated the Com-mission's determination of liability. TWA next appealed to
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.In October 1984, while that appeal was pending, Davis
filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Petitioner, RobertJ. Taylor, became the trustee of Davis' bankruptcy estate.
Respondents, Wendell G. Freeland, Richard F. Kronz, andtheir law firm, represented Davis in the discrimination
suit. On a schedule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Davisclaimed as exempt property the money that she expected to
win in her discrimination suit against TWA. She describedthis property as "Proceeds from lawsuit--[Davis] v. TWA"
and "Claim for lost wages" and listed its value as "unknown."App. 18.

Performing his duty as a trustee, Taylor held the requiredinitial meeting of creditors in January 1985. See 11 U. S. C.

$ 341; Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 2003(a). At this meeting, re-spondents told Taylor that they estimated that Davis might
win $90,000 in her suit against TWA. Several days after themeeting, Taylor wrote a letter to respondents telling them
that he considered the potential proceeds of the lawsuit tobe property of Davis' bankruptcy estate. He also asked
respondents for more details about the suit. Respondentsdescribed the procedural posture of the case and expressed
optimism that they might settle with TWA for $110,000.

Opinion of the Court
Taylor decided not to object to the claimed exemption.The record reveals that Taylor doubted that the lawsuit had

any value. Taylor at one point explained: "I have had pastexperience in examining debtors . . . [.] [M]any of them . . .
indicate they have potential lawsuits. . . . [M]any of them do
not turn out to be advantageous and . . . many of them mightwind up settling far within the exemption limitation." App.

52. Taylor also said that he thought Davis' discriminationclaim against TWA might be a "nullity."

Id., at 58.
Taylor proved mistaken. In October 1986, the Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court affirmed the Commonwealth Court's

determination that TWA had discriminated against Davis.
In a subsequent settlement of the issue of damages, TWA
agreed to pay Davis a total of $110,000. TWA paid part of
this amount by issuing a check made to both Davis and respondents for $71,000. Davis apparently signed this check
over to respondents in payment of their fees. TWA paid the
remainder of the $110,000 by other means. Upon learning
of the settlement, Taylor filed a complaint against respondents in the Bankruptcy Court. He demanded that respondents turn over the money that they had received from Davis
because he considered it property of Davis' bankruptcy estate. Respondents argued that they could keep the fees
because Davis had claimed the proceeds of the lawsuit as
exempt.

The Bankruptcy Court sided with Taylor. It concluded
that Davis had "no statutory basis" for claiming the proceeds
of the lawsuit as exempt and ordered respondents to "return" approximately $23,000 to Taylor, a sum sufficient to
pay off all of Davis' unpaid creditors. In re Davis, 105 B. R.
288 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Pa. 1989). The District Court affirmed,
In re Davis, 118 B. R. 272 (WD Pa. 1990), but the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, 938 F. 2d 420 (1991).
The Court of Appeals held that the Bankruptcy Court could
not require respondents to turn over the money because
Davis had claimed it as exempt, and Taylor had failed to

Opinion of the Court
object to the claimed exemption in a timely manner. Wegranted certiorari, 502 U. S. 976 (1991), and now affirm.

II
When a debtor files a bankruptcy petition, all of hisproperty becomes property of a bankruptcy estate. See 11

U. S. C. $ 541. The Code, however, allows the debtor to pre-vent the distribution of certain property by claiming it as
exempt. Section 522(b) allowed Davis to choose the exemp-tions afforded by state law or the federal exemptions listed
in $ 522(d). Section 522(l) states the procedure for claimingexemptions and objecting to claimed exemptions as follows:

"The debtor shall file a list of property that the debtorclaims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section. . . .
Unless a party in interest objects, the property claimedas exempt on such list is exempt."

Although $ 522(l) itself does not specify the time for object-ing to a claimed exemption, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4003(b) provides in part:

"The trustee or any creditor may file objections to thelist of property claimed as exempt within 30 days after

the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuantto Rule 2003(a) . . . unless, within such period, further
time is granted by the court."
In this case, as noted, Davis claimed the proceeds from heremployment discrimination lawsuit as exempt by listing

them in the schedule that she filed under $ 522(l). The par-ties agree that Davis did not have a right to exempt more
than a small portion of these proceeds either under state lawor under the federal exemptions specified in $ 522(d). Davis
in fact claimed the full amount as exempt. Taylor, as a re-sult, apparently could have made a valid objection under

$ 522(l) and Rule 4003 if he had acted promptly. We hold,however, that his failure to do so prevents him from challenging the validity of the exemption now.

Opinion of the Court

A
Taylor acknowledges that Rule 4003(b) establishes a 30-day period for objecting to exemptions and that $ 522

(l)states that "[u]nless a party in interest objects, the property

claimed as exempt . . . is exempt." He argues, nonetheless,that his failure to object does not preclude him from challenging the exemption at this time. In Taylor's view,$ 522(l) and Rule 4003(b) serve only to narrow judicial inquiry into the validity of an exemption after 30 days, not topreclude judicial inquiry altogether. In particular, he maintains that courts may invalidate a claimed exemption afterexpiration of the 30-day period if the debtor did not have a
good-faith or reasonably disputable basis for claiming it. Inthis case, Taylor asserts, Davis did not have a colorable basis
for claiming all of the lawsuit proceeds as exempt and thuslacked good faith.

Taylor justifies his interpretation of $ 522(l) by arguingthat requiring debtors to file claims in good faith will discourage them from claiming meritless exemptions merely inhopes that no one will object. Taylor does not stand alone
in this reading of $ 522(b). Several Courts of Appeals haveadopted the same position upon similar reasoning. See In
re Peterson, 920 F. 2d 1389, 1393-1394 (CA8 1990); In re
Dembs, 757 F. 2d 777, 780 (CA6 1985); In re Sherk, 918 F. 2d1170, 1174 (CA5 1990).

We reject Taylor's argument. Davis claimed the lawsuitproceeds as exempt on a list filed with the Bankruptcy
Court. Section 522(l), to repeat, says that "[u]nless a partyin interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such
list is exempt." Rule 4003(b) gives the trustee and creditors30 days from the initial creditors' meeting to object. By
negative implication, the Rule indicates that creditors maynot object after 30 days "unless, within such period, further
time is granted by the court." The Bankruptcy Court didnot extend the 30-day period. Section 522

(l) therefore hasmade the property exempt. Taylor cannot contest the ex503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT
644 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZ

Opinion of the Court
emption at this time whether or not Davis had a colorable
statutory basis for claiming it.

Deadlines may lead to unwelcome results, but they prompt
parties to act and they produce finality. In this case, despite
what respondents repeatedly told him, Taylor did not object
to the claimed exemption. If Taylor did not know the value
of the potential proceeds of the lawsuit, he could have sought
a hearing on the issue, see Rule 4003(c), or he could have
asked the Bankruptcy Court for an extension of time to
object, see Rule 4003(b). Having done neither, Taylor cannot now seek to deprive Davis and respondents of the
exemption.

Taylor suggests that our holding will create improper incentives. He asserts that it will lead debtors to claim property exempt on the chance that the trustee and creditors, for
whatever reason, will fail to object to the claimed exemption
on time. He asserts that only a requirement of good faith
can prevent what the Eighth Circuit has termed "exemption
by declaration." Peterson, supra, at 1393. This concern,
however, does not cause us to alter our interpretation of

$ 522(l).

Debtors and their attorneys face penalties under various
provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy
proceedings. See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $ 727(a)(4)(B) (authorizing
denial of discharge for presenting fraudulent claims); Rule
1008 (requiring filings to "be verified or contain an unsworn
declaration" of truthfulness under penalty of perjury); Rule
9011 (authorizing sanctions for signing certain documents
not "well grounded in fact and . . . warranted by existing law
or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or
reversal of existing law"); 18 U. S. C. $ 152 (imposing criminal
penalties for fraud in bankruptcy cases). These provisions
may limit bad-faith claims of exemptions by debtors. To the
extent that they do not, Congress may enact comparable provisions to address the difficulties that Taylor predicts will

645Cite as: 503 U. S. 638 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
follow our decision. We have no authority to limit the appli-cation of $ 522(l) to exemptions claimed in good faith.

B
Taylor also asserts that courts may consider the validity ofthe exemption under a different provision of the Bankruptcy

Code, 11 U. S. C. $ 105(a), despite his failure to object in atimely manner. That provision states:

"The court may issue any order, process, or judgmentthat is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title. No provision of this title providing
for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shallbe construed to preclude the court from, sua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessaryor appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or
rules, or to prevent an abuse of process." Ibid. (empha-sis added).

Although Taylor stresses that he is not asserting that courtsin bankruptcy have broad authorization to do equity in derogation of the Code and Rules, he maintains that $ 105 permitscourts to disallow exemptions not claimed in good faith. Several courts have accepted this position. See, e. g., Ragsdalev. Genesco, Inc., 674 F. 2d 277, 278 (CA4 1982); In re Staniforth, 116 B. R. 127, 131 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Wis. 1990); In re
Budinsky, No. 90-01099, 1991 WL 105640 (WD Pa., June10, 1991).

We decline to consider $ 105(a) in this case because Taylorraised the argument for the first time in his opening brief on
the merits. Our Rule 14.1(a) makes clear that "[o]nly thequestions set forth in the petition [for certiorari], or fairly
included therein, will be considered by the Court," and ourRule 24.1(a) states that a brief on the merits should not
"raise additional questions or change the substance of thequestions already presented" in the petition. See

Yee v.Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992). In addition, we have

said that "[o]rdinarily, this Court does not decide questionsnot raised or resolved in the lower court[s]." Youakim v.

Miller, 425 U. S. 231, 234 (1976) (per curiam). These princi-ples help to maintain the integrity of the process of certiorari. Cf. Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985).The Court decides which questions to consider through wellestablished procedures; allowing the able counsel who arguebefore us to alter these questions or to devise additional
questions at the last minute would thwart this system. Wesee no "unusual circumstances" that warrant addressing Taylor's $ 105(a) argument at this time. Berkemer v. McCarty,468 U. S. 420, 443, n. 38 (1984).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The Court states that it has "no authority to limit theapplication of $ 522(l) to exemptions claimed in good faith."

Ante, at 645. It does not deny, however, that it has ampleauthority to hold that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies
to the 30-day limitations period in Federal Rule of Bank-ruptcy Procedure 4003(b).

1 In my view, such a result is supported not only by strong equitable considerations, but alsoby the common law, the widespread practice of the bankruptcy courts, and the text of $ 522(b).

I
Rule 4003, which is derived from $ 522(l) of the Code andin part from former Bankruptcy Rule 403, shifted the em1 Rule 4003(b) provides:
"The trustee or any creditor may file objections to the list of property
claimed as exempt within 30 days after the conclusion of the meeting of
creditors held pursuant to Rule 2003(a) or the filing of any amendment to
the list or supplemental schedules unless, within such period, further time
is granted by the court. Copies of the objections shall be delivered or
mailed to the trustee and to the person filing the list and the attorney for
such person."

Stevens, J., dissenting
phasis of the earlier Rule, placing the burden on the debtorto list her exemptions and the burden on the parties in interest to raise objections. Rule 4003(b) in particular fills a gapthat remains in $ 522

(l), which is silent as to the time in
which parties in interest must file their objections. Rule
4003(b) provides for a 30-day period for objections. Al-though the adoption of Rule 4003 has furthered the interest

in orderly administration, there is no suggestion that it wasput into effect in order to avoid prejudice to the debtor.
Thus, there is no identifiable reason why ordinary tollingprinciples that apply in other contexts should not also apply
in bankruptcy proceedings; indeed, the generally equitable
character of bankruptcy makes it especially appropriate to
apply such rules in this context.

It is familiar learning that the harsh consequences of federal statutes of limitations have been avoided at times by
relying on either fraudulent concealment or undiscovered
fraud to toll the period of limitation. For example, in Bailey
v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 349-350 (1875), the Court described
two situations in which the "strict letter of general statutes
of limitation" would not be followed, id., at 347. The first
situation is "where the ignorance of the fraud has been
produced by affirmative acts of the guilty party in concealing
the facts," and the second is "where the party injured by the
fraud remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of
diligence or care on his part." Id., at 347-348. The former
involves fraudulent concealment; the latter defines undiscovered fraud. The Court concluded in Bailey that fraudulent
concealment, which was at issue in that case, tolls the running of the statute of limitations when the fraud "has been
concealed, or is of such character as to conceal itself." Id.,
at 349-350. To hold otherwise, reasoned the Court, would
"make the law which was designed to prevent fraud the
means by which it is made successful and secure." Id., at
349. In Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397 (1946),
the Court extended the reach of this tolling doctrine when

503us2$64N 11-14-95 20:58:26 PAGES OPINPGT
648 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZ

Stevens, J., dissenting
it observed that it is to be "read into every federal statuteof limitation."

2

In this case, even if there was no fraud, and even if it isassumed that the trustee failed to exercise due diligence, it

remains true that the parties injured by the trustee's failureto object within the 30-day period are innocent creditors.
Moreover, it is apparently undisputed that there was no le-gitimate basis for the claim of an exemption for the entire
award. See ante, at 642. Under these circumstances, un-less the debtor could establish some prejudice caused by the
trustee's failure to object promptly, I would hold that thefiling of a frivolous claim for an exemption is tantamount to
fraud for purposes of deciding when the 30-day period beginsto run.

II
This, in essence, is also the position adopted by numerousBankruptcy Courts and three Courts of Appeals.

3 Over a

period of years, they have held that the failure to make atimely objection is not dispositive, Rule 4003(b) notwithstanding. For example, in In re Hackett, 13 B. R. 755, 756(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Pa. 1981), the court explained that "[e]quita2 The tolling of a statute of limitations is not limited to cases of fraud.
In medical malpractice suits, for example, this Court has long endorsed
the view that the statute of limitations will not bar the claim of one who
was "blameless[ly] ignoran[t]" of his injury; rather, the statute of limitations will not begin to run until he has knowledge of his injury. Urie v.
Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 170 (1949).

3 Some Bankruptcy Courts, however, have read the statute and Rule

narrowly and have refused to examine any exemption in the absence of a
timely objection. See, e. g., In re Bradlow, 119 B. R. 330, 331 (Bkrtcy. Ct.
SD Fla. 1990); In re Duncan, 107 B. R. 754 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Okla. 1988);
In re Payton, 73 B. R. 31, 32 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex. 1987); In re Kretzer,
48 B. R. 585, 587 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Nev. 1985); In re Gullickson, 39 B. R. 922
(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Wis. 1984). Although the court in In re Hawn, 69 B. R.
567 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 1987), took a similar view, it at least recognized
that the result might be different if there had been "evidence that the
debtor fraudulently or negligently concealed any facts from the trustee or
any creditors." Id., at 568.

Stevens, J., dissenting
ble considerations dictate that a debtor should not be allowedexemptions to which she is obviously not entitled." This

view was echoed in In re Rollins, 63 B. R. 780, 783-784(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 1986): "[T]he debtor cannot make
property exempt simply by claiming it as exempt when thereis no apparent legal basis for the exemption. In that situation, the trustee's failure to object to the claim of exemptionwithin the time limit of Rule 4003(b) does not create an exemption." More recently, the court in In re Ehr, 116 B. R.665, 667 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Wis. 1988), reaffirmed this approach, as did the court in In re Staniforth, 116 B. R. 127,130 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Wis. 1990). As one court explained:
"Read strictly, Rule 4003 and Section 522(l) support appel-lants' position concerning waiver. But, most courts have
not followed appellants' interpretation of these provisions.Instead, most courts hold that an exemption must have an
apparent legal basis for an exemption to overcome an un-timely objection." In re Stutterheim, 109 B. R. 1010, 1012
(Kan. 1989).The equitable principles that motivated these Bankruptcy
Courts are best encapsulated by the court in In re Bennett,36 B. R. 893 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Ky. 1984). There, the court
explained that to apply Rule 4003(b) rigidly would be to en-courage a debtor to claim that all of her property was exempt, thus leaving it to the trustee and creditors to siftthrough the myriad claimed exemptions to assess their validity. Such a policy would result in reversion to "the law ofthe streets, with bare possession constituting not nine, but
ten, parts of the law; orderly administration of estates wouldbe replaced by uncertainty and constant litigation if not outright anarchy." Id., at 895.4

4 Bankruptcy courts would understandably be reluctant to encourage a
policy that would contribute to the overburdening of the bankruptcy court
system. As counsel for the trustee explained: "Last year there were
880,000 bankruptcy filings, 291 bankruptcy judges to deal with all of those
filings, and a real need on the part of the bankruptcy courts to rely on the

650 TAYLOR v. FREELAND & KRONZ

Stevens, J., dissenting
Although several Courts of Appeals and BankruptcyCourts did not go as far as these courts, preferring instead

in the case of an untimely objection to examine a claimedexemption to determine if there was a "good-faith statutory
basis" for the exemption, they nevertheless eschewed the lit-eral reading of the statute and rule adopted by the Court
today. They did so because they believed it was importantto strike a proper balance between avoiding the undesirable
effect of "exemption by declaration" and yet not permittinga trustee "another bite at the debtor's apple where the
debtor has claimed certain property exempt in good faith."
In re Peterson, 920 F. 2d 1389, 1393-1394 (CA8 1990); see In
re Sherk, 918 F. 2d 1170, 1174 (CA5 1990); In re Dembs, 757F. 2d 777, 780 (CA6 1985).

Here, the trustee would succeed under either approach.Whether the court is always permitted to entertain an
objection to a claimed exemption (at least until the case isclosed)

5 when the claimed exemption is invalid or whether

the court can do so only if the claimed exemption lacks agood-faith statutory basis would mean that in this case the

court could review the debtor's claimed exemption. Here,the parties acknowledge that the debtor could not claim a
statutory basis for her claimed exemption for the full awardbecause neither backpay nor tort recovery is exempt under

$ 522(d)(5). III

The practice of these lower courts has been motivated notonly by equitable considerations, but also by the requirement
set forth in $ 522(b). Section 522(l) explicitly provides that"[t]he debtor shall file a list of property that the debtor

good faith of debtors in claiming exemptions, otherwise the whole system
would collapse." Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. For example, this trustee alone
"had approximately two or three hundred of these cases a year, which . . .
is typical of bankruptcy trustees all across the country." Id., at 15.

5 The parties have stipulated that the debtor's case has never been

closed. App. 56.

claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section." Sub-section (b) limits exemptions claimed by the debtor to "any

property that is exempt under federal law . . . or State orlocal law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the
petition." 11 U. S. C. $ 522(b)(2)(A). When a debtor claims
exemptions that do not even arguably satisfy this condition,6there is good reason to hold that the filing does not comply

with $ 522 and therefore the 30-day objection period does notbegin to run. As one court noted: "If Debtor may select in
any manner her exemptions, then no purpose is served bythe inclusion of the . . . terms."

In re Kingsbury, 124 B. R.
146, 148, n. 9 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Me. 1991). It declined to conclude
that Congress added the requirements that the property
be exempted "under federal law . . . or state law or local
law" but "refused to grant them meaning." Ibid. (emphasis omitted).

IV

The Court's disposition of this case is straightforward.
Because it regards the meaning of the statute and Rule as
"plain," that is the end of the case. I have no doubt, however, that if the debtor or the trustee were guilty of fraud,
the Court would readily ignore what it now treats as the
insurmountable barrier of "plain meaning." The equities in
this case are not as strong as if fraud were implicated, but
our power to reach a just result despite the "plain meaning"
barrier is exactly the same as it was in Bailey v. Glover, 21

6 The debtor's claimed exemptions in this case not only failed to satisfy
any statutory basis, but also failed to provide even the basic information
necessary to inform the trustee adequately about the exemption. For
example, the debtor indicated on her Schedule B-4 Property Claimed As
Exempt form that she was claiming the "[p]roceeds from lawsuit," but that
the value was "unknown." App. 14-15. Although the value of the full
award ended up amounting to $110,000, and only an amount of approximately $24,000 was required to satisfy the claims of all of her creditors,
the debtor never amended her schedule to reflect the precise value of
the award.

need for a similar rule to achieve both equitable results andfair administration in cases of this kind. In my view, it is a

653OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Per Curiam

GOMEZ et al. v. UNITED STATES DISTRICTCOURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT

OF CALIFORNIA et al.
on application to vacate stay

No. A-767. Decided April 21, 1992
The Court of Appeals granted Robert Alton Harris a stay of execution

pending a review of his 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 claim that his execution by
lethal gas would be cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth
Amendment.

Held: The application to vacate the stay of execution is granted. Harris'

action is an obvious attempt to avoid the application of McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S. 467, to bar this successive claim for relief. He has made
no convincing showing of cause for his failure to raise this claim in his
four prior federal habeas petitions. Even assuming that he could avoid
the application of McCleskey, his claim should not be considered on the
merits. Since he is seeking an equitable remedy, the State's strong
interest in proceeding with its judgment and Harris' obvious attempt at
manipulation must be taken into consideration. This claim could have
been raised more than a decade ago, and there is no reason for this
abusive delay, which has been compounded by the last-minute attempts
to manipulate the judicial process.

Application granted.

framed as a habeas petition or as a $ 1983 action, Harris
seeks an equitable remedy. Equity must take into consideration the State's strong interest in proceeding with its judgment and Harris' obvious attempt at manipulation. See In
re Blodgett, 502 U. S. 236 (1992); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320,
322 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring). This claim could have
been brought more than a decade ago. There is no good
reason for this abusive delay, which has been compounded
by last-minute attempts to manipulate the judicial process.
A court may consider the last-minute nature of an application
to stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable
relief.

The application to vacate the stay of execution of death is
granted, and it is ordered that the orders staying the execution of Robert Alton Harris entered by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in No. 92-70237 on
April 20, 1992, are vacated.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,
dissenting.

In a time when the Court's jurisprudence concerning the
imposition of the death penalty grows ever more complicated, Robert Alton Harris brings a simple claim. He argues that California's method of execution--exposure to cyanide gas--constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and
therefore violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
In light of all that we know today about the extreme and
unnecessary pain inflicted by execution by cyanide gas, and
in light of the availability of more humane and less violent
methods of execution, Harris' claim has merit. I would deny
the State's application to vacate the stay imposed by the
Court of Appeals and allow the courts below to hear and rule
on Harris' claim.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Execution by cyanide gas is "in essence asphyxiation by
suffocation or strangulation." 1 As dozens of uncontroverted expert statements filed in this case illustrate, execution by cyanide gas is extremely and unnecessarily painful.

"Following inhalation of cyanide gas, a person will first
experience hypoxia, a condition defined as a lack of oxygen in the body. The hypoxic state can continue for
several minutes after the cyanide gas is released in the
execution chamber. During this time, a person will remain conscious and immediately may suffer extreme
pain throughout his arms, shoulders, back, and chest.
The sensation may be similar to pain felt by a person
during a massive heart attack." 2

"Execution by gas . . . produces prolonged seizures, incontinence of stool and urine, salivation, vomiting, retching,
ballistic writhing, flailing, twitching of extremities, [and]
grimacing." 3 This suffering lasts for 8 to 10 minutes, or
longer.4

Eyewitness descriptions of executions by cyanide gas lend
depth to these clinical accounts. On April 6, 1992, Arizona
executed Don Eugene Harding.

"When the fumes enveloped Don's head he took a
quick breath. A few seconds later he again looked in
my direction. His face was red and contorted as if he
were attempting to fight through tremendous pain. His
mouth was pursed shut and his jaw was clenched tight.
Don then took several more quick gulps of the fumes.

"At this point Don's body started convulsing violently
. . . . His face and body turned a deep red and the veins
in his temple and neck began to bulge until I thought
they might explode.

"After about a minute Don's face leaned partially forward, but he was still conscious. Every few seconds he
continued to gulp in. He was shuddering uncontrollably and his body was racked with spasms. His head
continued to snap back. His hands were clenched.

"After several more minutes, the most violent of the
convulsions subsided. At this time the muscles along
Don's left arm and back began twitching in a wavelike motion under his skin. Spittle drooled from his
mouth. . . .

"Don did not stop moving for approximately eight
minutes, and after that he continued to twitch and jerk
for another minute. Approximately two minutes later,
we were told by a prison official that the execution was
complete.

"Don Harding took ten minutes and thirty one seconds
to die." 5

The unnecessary cruelty of this method of execution convinced Arizona's Attorney General that that State should
abandon execution by gas in favor of execution by lethal injection.6 His conclusion coincides with that of numerous
medical, legal, and ethical experts.7

fastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning as public

opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice." Weemsv. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 378 (1910). Accordingly, we

have "interpreted the [Eighth] Amendment `in a flexible anddynamic manner.' " Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 369
(1989) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 171 (1976)(opinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.)). When theCalifornia statute requiring execution by cyanide gas was

enacted in 1937, the gas chamber was considered a humanemethod of execution. Fifty-five years of history and moral
development have superseded that judgment. The barbaricuse of cyanide gas in the Holocaust, the development of cyanide agents as chemical weapons, our contemporary under-standing of execution by lethal gas, and the development of
less cruel methods of execution all demonstrate that execu-tion by cyanide gas is unnecessarily cruel. "The traditional
humanity of modern Anglo-American law forbids the inflic-tion of unnecessary pain in the execution of the death sentence." Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S.459, 463 (1947) (opinion of Reed, J.).

Nowhere is this moral progress better demonstrated thanin the decisions of the state legislatures. Of the 20 or so
States to adopt new methods of execution since our rulingin Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), not a single State
has chosen execution by lethal gas. Ten years ago, 10 Statesmandated execution by lethal gas; one by one, those States
have abandoned that method as inhumane and torturous.Only California, Maryland, and Arizona currently mandate
execution by gas.8 Of the 168 persons executed in theUnited States since 1977, only 6 have been executed by lethal
gas. We have frequently emphasized that "[t]he clearestand most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values
is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures."Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989). These "objec8 As noted above, Arizona is considering abandoning lethal gas as a
means of execution. See n. 6, supra. Maryland has not yet resumed

tive indicia that reflect the public attitude" toward execution
by lethal gas, Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S., at 370, clearly
exhibit a nearly universal rejection of that means of execution.9 Cf. Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 788-796 (1982);
Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 593-597 (1977). All of this
leads me to conclude that execution by cyanide gas is both
cruel and unusual, and that it violates contemporary standards of human decency.10

More than a century ago, we declared that "[p]unishments
are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death."
In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890). In light of our
contemporary understanding of the methods of execution
and in light of less cruel alternatives presently available, I
believe that execution by cyanide gas is "incompatible with
`the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of
a maturing society.' " Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102
(1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).

The State contends that Harris should have brought his
claim earlier. This is not reason enough to upset the stay
issued by the Court of Appeals and dispatch the considered
judgment of the 14 appellate judges who voted to rehear
the case en banc. Indeed, although reluctant to recognize

9 Notably, a memorandum prepared by California corrections officials
correctly observes that "[l]ethal injection is considered to be more humane
than other methods of execution (e. g., hanging, firing squad, lethal gas, or
electrocution)." 1 Exhibits, Exh. 11, at 4.

10 In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 135-136 (1879), we ruled that punishments of "unnecessary cruelty" violated the Eighth Amendment, citing
the ancient practices of drawing and quartering and "public dissection" as
examples. Similarly in In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 446 (1890), we indicated that "burning at the stake, crucifixion, [and] breaking on the wheel"
were as well cruel and unusual. To that list we might have added the
garrotte, a device for execution by strangulation developed--and abandoned--centuries ago in Spain. See G. Scott, The History of Capital Punishment 159-160 (1950). To my mind, the gas chamber is nothing more
than a chemical garrotte.

Stevens, J., dissenting
as much, the State itself could have avoided this last-minutelitigation. In 1983, seven States authorized executions by

exposure to cyanide gas. In that year, three Members ofthis Court indicated that that method of execution raised sufficiently serious questions under the Eighth Amendment tomerit review by writ of certiorari. See

Gray v. Lucas, 463U. S. 1237 (1983). Thereafter, four States (Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wyoming) abandoned cyanide gas as amethod of execution. In light of these events and the decisions of other legislatures, California as well should have re-visited its 55-year-old statute.

More fundamentally, if execution by cyanide gas is in factunconstitutional, then the State lacks the

power to imposesuch punishment. Harris' delay, even if unjustified, cannot

endow the State with the authority to violate the Constitu-tion. It was this principle that animated Justice Harlan's
opinion in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 692-693(1971), and that a plurality of this Court embraced in Teague
v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 306-307 (1989) (opinion of O'Connor,
J.). As Harlan emphasized, there are some instances inwhich the State's interest in finality must give way. When

the challenged conduct falls clearly beyond the State's legiti-mate power, "[t]here is little societal interest in permitting
the criminal process to rest at a point where it ought prop-erly never to repose." 401 U. S., at 693. For these reasons,
the State's interest in an immediate execution must yield toa deliberate and careful study of the merits of Harris' claims.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Earlier this Term, the Court applied its new Rule 39.8 1 forthe first time, denying in forma pauperis status to two indigent
litigants--Vladimir Zatko and James Martin. Zatko v. Califor-nia, 502 U. S. 16 (1991) (per curiam). In explaining its action,
the Court emphasized that Zatko and Martin were "unique." Id.,at 18. What distinguished these petitioners, the Court explained,
was not the frivolousness, but the frequency of their filings. In-deed, the Court found it "important to observe" that it had not
applied Rule 39.8 to numerous other frivolous petitions. Ibid.The Court noted that these other petitions were denied "in the
usual manner, underscoring our commitment to hearing theclaims, however meritless, of the poor." Ibid.

Zatko had filed 73 petitions in this Court over the past 10 years;Martin had filed more than 45. Id., at 17. In invoking Rule 39.8
today, the Court denies leave to proceed in forma pauperis topetitioner Joseph Head. Head has previously filed one petition
in this Court.2Today's action thus represents an unexplained expansion of
Rule 39.8 and an apparent rejection of the explanation for theaction taken with respect to petitioners Zatko and Martin. I
would grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny the petitionfor writ of certiorari, and get on with the business of the Court.

Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.
This case concerns the appropriate standard for determiningthe admissibility of expert testimony. It is an issue that has long
divided the federal courts, see Mustafa v. United States, 479 U. S.953 (1986) (White, J., joined by Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and here deeply divided the Court of Appealsfor the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc.

913ORDERS
March 2, 1992503 U. S.
Albert Roy Christophersen died of a rare form of cancer in1986. Petitioners, his widow and son, brought suit, claiming that
Christophersen's illness was caused by fumes from the manufac-ture of nickel/cadmium batteries in the factory where he had
worked for 14 years. Petitioners based this claim upon the ex-pert opinion of an internist and toxicologist. Respondents contended that there was no reliable basis for the expert's views andmoved for summary judgment. The United States District Court
for the Western District of Texas agreed that the doctor's affida-vit was "not based upon the type of evidence usually relied upon
by experts in the field of cancer research" and entered judgmentfor respondents. App. C to Pet. for Cert. 74-75.

A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, 902 F. 2d 362 (1990),but on rehearing en banc, eight members of the court voted to
affirm the judgment of the District Court, based in part on theirconclusion that the admissibility of an expert witness' evidence
should turn on whether his or her methodology is generally ac-cepted within the scientific community. 939 F. 2d 1106 (1991) (per
curiam). This standard, known as the Frye test, was announcedalmost 70 years ago. See Frye v. United States, 54 App. D. C.
46, 293 F. 1013 (1923). But five members of the Court of Appealsconcluded that the Frye test was not the applicable evidentiary
standard. 939 F. 2d, at 1116 (Clark, C. J., concurring in result);id., at 1122, 1136 (Reavley, King, Johnson, Wiener, JJ., dissenting
in two opinions).As the Fifth Circuit is divided, so the Courts of Appeals are
in disagreement. Some continue to apply the approach set forthin Frye in deciding whether expert evidence is admissible. E. g.,
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 951 F. 2d 1128(CA9 1991); United States v. Two Bulls, 918 F. 2d 56 (CA8 1990);
United States v. Smith, 869 F. 2d 348 (CA7 1989). But courts inother Circuits have concluded that Frye was superseded in 1975
by the Federal Rules of Evidence, which they maintain estab-lished a lower threshold for determining the admissibility of expert evidence. E. g., United States v. Jakobetz, 955 F. 2d 786(CA2 1992); DeLuca v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 911
F. 2d 941 (CA3 1990). Because this is an important and recurringissue, I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict.

Opinion of Justice Stevens, respecting the denial of the peti-tion for writ of certiorari.

Petitioner asks us to resolve a recurring conflict among theCourts of Appeals concerning the meaning of a once obscure sentence in $ 3 of the Mississippi River Flood Control Act of 1928.1

1 Section 3 of the statute, which is now codified as 33 U. S. C. $ 702c, reads
in full as follows:"

Sec. 3. Except when authorized by the Secretary of War upon the rec-ommendation of the Chief of Engineers, no money appropriated under authority of this Act shall be expended on the construction of any item of theproject until the States or levee districts have given assurances satisfactory

924 OCTOBER TERM, 1991

Opinion of Stevens, J. 503 U. S.
During the past decade that sentence has assumed greater andgreater importance because it has provided the Government with

a defense to claims for personal injury and death caused by federal negligence, gross negligence, and even "conscious governmen-tal indifference to the safety of the public."

United States v.
James, 478 U. S. 597, 600 (1986) (citation and internal quotationmarks omitted).

2

This is the latest in an expanding series of tragic cases. Je-rome Hiersche, a professional diver, contracted with the Government to inspect submerged fish screens at the hydroelectric intake
on the John Day Dam on the Columbia River between Oregonand Washington. Although Government employees assured him

that the water flow to the fish bypass system would be shut off,they negligently failed to do so. Petitioner's head was drawn
into an orifice in the fish bypass system, and he suffered fatal
injuries. The Government defended this wrongful-death action

to the Secretary of War that they will (a) maintain all flood-control worksafter their completion, except controlling and regulating spillway structures,
including special relief levees; maintenance includes normally such mattersas cutting grass, removal of weeds, local drainage, and minor repairs of main
river levees; (b) agree to accept land turned over to them under the provi-sions of section 4; (c) provide without cost to the United States, all rights of
way for levee foundations and levees on the main stem of the MississippiRiver between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and the Head of Passes.

"No liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United Statesfor any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place: Provided,
however, That if in carrying out the purposes of this Act it shall be foundthat upon any stretch of the banks of the Mississippi River it is impracticable to construct levees, either because such construction is not economicallyjustified or because such construction would unreasonably restrict the flood
channel, and lands in such stretch of the river are subjected to overflow anddamage which are not now overflowed or damaged by reason of the construction of levees on the opposite banks of the river it shall be the duty ofthe Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers to institute proceedings on
behalf of the United States Government to acquire either the absolute own-ership of the lands so subjected to overflow and damage or floodage rights
over such lands." 45 Stat. 535-536 (emphasis added).

2 As one court noted, while Congress often enacts special legislation to aid

the victims of floods, thus mitigating the harsh effect of $ 702c with respectto property damage, Congress does not pass special legislation to assist individuals who suffer personal injury in flood-control waters as a result of Gov-ernment negligence. See Fryman v. United States, 901 F. 2d 79, 80 (CA7),
cert. denied, 498 U. S. 920 (1990).

925ORDERS
Opinion of Stevens, J.923
on the ground that the 1928 Act immunizes it from liability for
all personal injuries caused by its employees in federal floodcontrol projects. Following this Court's unfortunate decision in
James, as well as settled precedent in the Ninth Circuit,3 the
District Court and the Court of Appeals sustained that defense.

Since 1928 when Congress authorized the construction of the
levees on the banks of the Mississippi River, the number and
importance of federal flood-control projects has grown dramatically. In addition to controlling floods, these projects generate
hydroelectric power and create artificial lakes that serve important recreational and conservation purposes. In some Circuits
the Government's flood-control immunity would not constitute a
defense in the case of injuries resulting from Government conduct
that was unrelated to any flood-control purpose, see, e. g., Boyd v.
United States ex rel. United States Army, Corps of Engineers,
881 F. 2d 895 (CA10 1989); Hayes v. United States, 585 F. 2d 701
(CA4 1978). If this case had arisen in one of those Circuits, the
claim would likely succeed because Hiersche's assignment related
to fish conservation and power generation, rather than flood control. But in the Ninth Circuit, if flood control was one of the
purposes of the Act of Congress authorizing the project itself,
the immunity applies.4 The Seventh Circuit has suggested that
immunity might depend on whether the flood-control activities at
the project increased the probability of injury. See Fryman v.
United States, 901 F. 2d 79 (CA7), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 920
(1990).

This Court has a duty to resolve conflicts among the courts of
appeals. As several scholars have recognized, however, that duty
is not absolute.5 Some conflicts are tolerable. Others can be resolved more effectively by Congress. This is such a case.

3 See McCarthy v. United States, 850 F. 2d 558 (1988), cert. denied, 489
U. S. 1052 (1989).

4 See McCarthy v. United States, 850 F. 2d, at 562; see also Zavadil v.

The statute at issue here is an anachronism. It was enacted18 years before the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2671 et
seq., waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity fromliability for personal injuries. At the time of its enactment, no
consideration was given to the power generation, recreational,and conservation purposes of flood-control projects, or to their
possible impact on the then nonexistent federal liability for per-sonal injury and death caused by the negligent operation of such
projects. Today this obsolete legislative remnant is nothing morethan an engine of injustice. Congress, not this Court, has the
primary duty to confront the question whether any part of thisharsh immunity doctrine should be retained.

S. 386 (1987), a statelaw cause of action is pre-empted under $ 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act by a defense based on a collectivebargaining agreement. A state-law cause of action is pre-emptedunder $ 301 if its resolution is "substantially dependent on analysis of a collective-bargaining agreement." Electrical Workers v.Hechler, 481 U. S. 851, 859, n. 3 (1987). See also Allis-Chalmers
Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202, 220 (1985).In the decision below, petitioners based their claims solely on
state law, but respondent's defense invoked the provisions of acollective-bargaining agreement. The Illinois court held that

927ORDERS
March 9, 1992503 U. S.
petitioners' state-law claims were pre-empted under $ 301 becausetheir resolution was substantially dependent on interpretation of
the applicable collective-bargaining agreement. 213 Ill. App. 3d169, 175-176, 571 N. E. 2d 1215, 1218 (1991). Several Federal
Courts of Appeals similarly have held that a court must look todefenses to determine whether a claim requires interpretation of
a collective-bargaining agreement. See, e. g., Smith v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 943 F. 2d 764, 769-771 (CA7 1991); Hanks v. General Motors Corp., 859 F. 2d 67, 70 (CA8 1988).By contrast, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, relying
on our decision in Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, has held that "inorder for there to be section 301 preemption, the plaintiff, in
its well-pleaded complaint, must plead an action that requiresinterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement." That
court accordingly examined the claims presented in the complaintand found no $ 301 pre-emption. Berda v. CBS Inc., 881 F. 2d
20, 25 (1989). See also McCormick v. AT & T Technologies, Inc.,934 F. 2d 531, 545 (CA4 1991) (en banc) (Phillips, J., dissenting).
The Illinois court below expressly rejected the reasoning ofBerda.

I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.

Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.
The issue in this case is whether the Ex Post Facto Clause ofthe Constitution, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3, is violated when a newly modified state parole regulation is applied to a prisoner who beganserving his sentence prior to the rule change.

Petitioner pleaded guilty to the 1976 kidnap, sexual abuse, andmurder of a young girl; he was sentenced to three concurrent jail
terms, the longest of which was 40 years. In 1981, the MinnesotaCorrections Board determined that, because of the severity of
petitioner's crimes, the target date for his release should be theexpiration of his sentence. In a letter to petitioner, the board
stated that it would "not consider any form of release prior tothe expiration of your sentence unless psychiatric, psychological,
and correctional staff can certify that you are no longer a dangerto the public in general and/or young females specifically."

A year later, the Minnesota Legislature abolished the correc-tions board and transferred parole responsibility to the commis503ORD$Pt1 11-14-95 15:35:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

953ORDERS
March 23, 1992503 U. S.
sioner of corrections. Minn. Stat. $ 243.05 (1990). The commis-sioner enacted new parole regulations, including a rule that "[a]ll
release dates established by the Minnesota corrections board willbe left in full force and effect by the commissioner." 3 Minn.
Rule $ 2940.1500, subp. 2 (1991). Petitioner was informed thatthis new regulation effectively froze his release date.

Petitioner filed this civil rights action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,42 U. S. C. $ 1983, asserting that application of the new parole
regulation to his case violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. TheUnited States District Court for the District of Minnesota entered
summary judgment for respondents. A divided panel of theCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that
"the Minnesota parole regulations are not `laws' for ex post factopurposes . . . ." Bailey v. Gardebring, 940 F. 2d 1150, 1157 (1991).
The court, again divided, denied rehearing en banc.The judgment of the Court of Appeals conflicts with decisions
of other Courts of Appeals, which have held that application ofchanged state parole regulations may pose ex post facto problems.
See, e. g., Akins v. Snow, 922 F. 2d 1558 (CA11), cert. denied, 501U. S. 1260 (1991); Royster v. Fauver, 775 F. 2d 527 (CA3 1985).
Because the issue is likely to arise frequently, I would grantcertiorari to resolve the disagreement.

enforce Act's provision that conditions federal funding for state child welfare, foster care, and adoption programs upon, inter alia, a State's express

BANKRUPTCY. See also Appeals.

1. Chapter 11--Trustee's tax obligations.--A trustee appointed to liquidate and distribute property as part of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan must
file federal income tax returns and pay tax on income attributable to debtors' property. Holywell Corp. v. Smith, p. 47.

2. Exempt property--Untimely contest of exemption's validity.--A
trustee may not contest a claimed exemption's validity after expiration of
30-day period to object allowed by Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, even if debtor has no colorable basis for claiming such an exemption.
Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, p. 638.

3. Federal Government's immunity from suit--Monetary recovery.--
Section 106(c) of Bankruptcy Code does not waive United States' sovereign immunity in an action seeking monetary recovery in bankruptcy.
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., p. 30.

4. Preferential transfer--Date of transfer made by check.--For purposes of 11 U. S. C. $ 547b--which permits a trustee to avoid a property
transfer made within 90 days of a bankruptcy filing--a transfer made by

Municipal employees--Availability of remedy--Failure to warn of
workplace hazards.--Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 did not provide a remedy for
municipal employees who were fatally injured in course of their employment, since city's customary failure to train or warn its employees about
known workplace hazards did not violate Due Process Clause. Collins v.

CLEAN WATER ACT. See also Environmental Laws.

Water quality standards--Discharge permit--Protection of downstream State's interests.--Where Environmental Protection Agency issued a discharge permit to a new point source in Arkansas, near Oklahoma
state line, EPA's finding that discharges from new source would not cause

EPA's duty under Act to protect interests of downstream State. Arkansas v. Oklahoma, p. 91.

it applied Hill Method--method of equal proportions--to 1990 census to
determine number of Representatives to which each State is entitled.

II. Contracts Clause.

Workers' compensation benefits--Retroactive payments.--1987 Michigan law requiring, in effect, that petitioners repay workers' compensation
benefits they had withheld in reliance on a 1981 workers' compensation
statute did not violate Contracts Clause or Due Process Clause. General

dure is not required before a federal prisoner can initiate an action solely
for money damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,
403 U. S. 388. McCarthy v. Madigan, p. 140.

2. Excessive physical force--Seriousness of injury.--Use of excessive
physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though inmate does not suffer serious injury. Hudson v. McMillian, p. 1.

IV. Double Jeopardy.

Drug offenses and conspiracy charge.--Where defendant was convicted
on federal drug offenses in Missouri using evidence that he had manufactured drugs in Oklahoma, Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar his subsequent federal trial in Oklahoma on substantive drug charges, since those
offenses were different from offense for which he was prosecuted in Missouri and since mere overlap in proof does not establish a double jeopardy
violation; nor did Clause bar his prosecution on conspiracy to make, possess, and distribute drugs in Oklahoma, since a substantive crime and
conspiracy to commit that crime are not same offense for double jeopardy
purposes. United States v. Felix, p. 378.

V. Equal Protection of the Laws.

Jury selection--Preservation of Batson claim.--Trevino was entitled
to review under rule announced, while his appeal was pending, in Batson
v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79--that equal protection is violated where prosecution uses race-based peremptory challenges to exclude members of a defendant's racial group from a jury--since he presented such a claim to trial
court and preserved it on appeal. Trevino v. Texas, p. 562.

VI. Freedom of Association.

Membership in racist organization--Admission at trial.--Petitioner's
First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by admission in
his capital sentencing proceeding of fact that he was a member of Aryan
Brotherhood--a white racist prison gang--since such evidence was not
relevant to issues being decided in proceeding; whether its admission was
harmless error was left to be decided on remand. Dawson v. Delaware,
p. 159.

VII. Separation of Powers.

Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
1990--Effect on ongoing litigation.--Enactment of $ 318(b)(6)(a) of Act,
known as Northwest Timber Compromise--which was Congress' response
to two ongoing challenges to Federal Government's efforts to allow harvesting and sale of old-growth forest timber--did not violate Article III
because it compelled changes in law, not results under old law, by replacing

legal standards underlying those two cases with standards set forth in

$$ 318(b)(3) and (b)(5). Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc., p. 429.

VIII. Taking of Property.

Rent control ordinance--Effect on mobile home park owners.--A city
rent control ordinance limiting rents that could be charged for mobile
homes did not authorize an unwanted physical occupation of property of
petitioner mobile home park owners and thus did not constitute a per
se taking; petitioners' arguments that ordinance constituted a denial of
substantive due process and a regulatory taking were improperly before
this Court. Yee v. Escondido, p. 519.

verdict that Jacobson was predisposed, independent of Government's
acts--which included 26 months of unsolicited mailings and communications--and beyond a reasonable doubt, to violate Child Protection Act
of 1984 by receiving child pornography through mail. Jacobson v. United
States, p. 540.

2. Juvenile Delinquency Act--Maximum term of imprisonment.--
Act's provision requiring length of official detention in certain circumstances to be limited to "maximum term . . . that would be authorized if
juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult" refers to maximum
sentence that could be imposed if juvenile were being sentenced after
application of United States Sentencing Guidelines. United States v.
R. L. C., p. 291.

3. Sentence for federal crime--Credit for time served.--It is Attorney
General who computes credit that a defendant may receive for certain
time spent in official detention before his sentence began after he has
begun to serve his sentence on federal crime. United States v. Wilson,
p. 329.

4. Stay of execution.--Application to vacate a stay of execution pending
review of Harris' 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 claim that his execution by lethal gas
