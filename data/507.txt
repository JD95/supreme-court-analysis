CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1992

UNITED STATES v. NACHTIGAL
on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 92-609. Decided February 22, 1993
Respondent was charged with operating a motor vehicle in a national park

while under the influence of alcohol (DUI), a federal misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.
As an alternative to imprisonment, a court may impose a probation term
not to exceed five years. Relying on this Court's decision in Blanton
v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538, a Magistrate Judge denied respondent's motion for a jury trial, concluding that DUI's maximum imprisonment term made it presumptively a "petty" offense which is not embraced by the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee, and that the
additional penalties did not transform it into a "serious" offense for
Sixth Amendment purposes. Respondent was tried, convicted, and
sentenced to a fine and one year's probation. The District Court reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to a jury trial under relevant Ninth Circuit precedent. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding
that Blanton was inapposite to respondent's case.
Held: The Court of Appeals erred in refusing to recognize that this case

was controlled by the opinion in Blanton rather than its own precedent.
Applying the Blanton rule, DUI, with its 6-month maximum prison
term established by Congress, is presumptively a petty offense. The
additional penalties imposed are not sufficiently severe to overcome this
presumption, for neither a fine nor a parole alternative can approximate
in severity the loss of liberty that a prison term entails.
Certiorari granted; 953 F. 2d 1389, reversed.

Per Curiam.
Respondent Jerry Nachtigal was charged with operating amotor vehicle in Yosemite National Park while under the

influence of alcohol, in violation of 36 CFR $$ 4.23(a)(1) and(a)(2) (1992). Driving under the influence (DUI) is a class B
misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of six months'imprisonment, $ 1.3(a); 18 U. S. C. $ 3581(b)(7), and a $5,000
fine, $$ 3571(b)(6) and (e). As an alternative to a term ofimprisonment, the sentencing court may impose a term of
probation not to exceed five years. $$ 3561(a)(3), (b)(2).The sentencing court has discretion to attach a host of discretionary conditions to the probationary term. $ 3563(b).Respondent moved for a jury trial. Applying our decision
in Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538 (1989), the Mag-istrate Judge denied the motion. He reasoned that because
DUI carries a maximum term of imprisonment of six months,it is presumptively a "petty" offense which is not embraced
by the jury trial guaranty of the Sixth Amendment. He re-jected respondent's contention that the additional penalties
transformed DUI into a "serious" offense for Sixth Amend-ment purposes. Respondent was then tried by the Magistrate Judge and convicted of operating a motor vehicle underthe influence of alcohol in violation of 36 CFR $ 4.23(a)(1)
(1992). He was fined $750 and placed on unsupervised pro-bation for one year.

The District Court reversed the Magistrate Judge on theissue of entitlement to a jury trial, commenting that the language in our opinion in Blanton was "at variance with theNinth Circuit precedent of

United States v. Craner, [652
F. 2d 23 (1981)]," and electing to follow Craner because our
opinion in Blanton did not "expressly overrule" Craner.App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a, 20a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed withthe District Court, holding that

Blanton is "[in]apposite,"
that Craner controls, and that respondent is entitled to ajury trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a, judgt. order re507us1$27z 10-20-95 16:27:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n

ported at 953 F. 2d 1389 (1992). The Court of Appeals rea-soned that since the Secretary of the Interior, and not Congress, set the maximum prison term at six months, "[t]hereis no controlling legislative determination" regarding the seriousness of the offense. App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a; see also
United States v. Craner, 652 F. 2d 23, 25 (CA9 1981). Thecourt also found it significant that the Secretary of the Interior, in whom Congress vested general regulatory authorityto fix six months as the maximum sentence for any regulatory offense dealing with the use and management of thenational parks, monuments, or reservations, see 16 U. S. C.

$ 3, chose the harshest penalty available for DUI offenses.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a; see also Craner, supra, at 25.
Finally, the court noted that seven of the nine States within
the Ninth Circuit guarantee a jury trial for a DUI offense.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a; see also Craner, supra, at 27.

Unlike the Court of Appeals and the District Court, we
think that this case is quite obviously controlled by our decision in Blanton. We therefore grant the United States' petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court
of Appeals. The motion of respondent for leave to proceed
in forma pauperis is granted.

In Blanton, we held that in order to determine whether
the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial attaches to a particular offense, the court must examine "objective indications
of the seriousness with which society regards the offense."
Blanton, 489 U. S., at 541 (internal quotation marks omitted). The best indicator of society's views is the maximum
penalty set by the legislature. Ibid. While the word "penalty" refers both to the term of imprisonment and other statutory penalties, we stated that "[p]rimary emphasis . . . must
be placed on the maximum authorized period of incarceration." Id., at 542. We therefore held that offenses for
which the maximum period of incarceration is six months or
less are presumptively " `petty.' " A defendant can overcome this presumption, and become entitled to a jury trial,

Per Curiam
only by showing that the additional penalties, viewed together with the maximum prison term, are so severe that
the legislature clearly determined that the offense is a " `serious' " one. Id., at 543. Finally, we expressly stated that
the statutory penalties in other States are irrelevant to the
question whether a particular legislature deemed a particular offense " `serious.' " Id., at 545, n. 11.

Applying the above rule, we held that DUI was a petty
offense under Nevada law. Since the maximum prison term
was six months, the presumption described above applied.
We did not find it constitutionally significant that the defendant would automatically lose his license for up to 90 days,
and would be required to attend, at his own expense, an alcohol abuse education course. Id., at 544, and n. 9. Nor did
we believe that a $1,000 fine or an alternative sentence of 48
hours' community service while wearing clothing identifying
him as a DUI offender was more onerous than six months in
jail. Id., at 544-545.

The present case, we think, requires only a relatively routine application of the rule announced in Blanton. Because
the maximum term of imprisonment is six months, DUI
under 36 CFR $ 4.23(a)(1) (1992) is presumptively a petty offense to which no jury trial right attaches. The Court of
Appeals refused to apply the Blanton presumption, reasoning that the Secretary of the Interior, and not Congress, ultimately determined the maximum prison term. But there
is a controlling legislative determination present within the
regulatory scheme. In 16 U. S. C. $ 3, Congress set six
months as the maximum penalty the Secretary could impose
for a violation of any of his regulations. The Court of Appeals offered no persuasive reason why this congressional
determination is stripped of its "legislative" character
merely because the Secretary has final authority to decide,
within the limits given by Congress, what the maximum
prison sentence will be for a violation of a given regulation.

The additional penalties imposed under the regulations arenot sufficiently severe to overcome this presumption. As

we noted in Blanton, it is a rare case where "a legislaturepacks an offense it deems `serious' with onerous penalties
that nonetheless do not puncture the 6-month incarcerationline."

Blanton, 489 U. S., at 543 (internal quotation marksomitted). Here, the federal DUI offense carries a maximum

fine of $5,000, and respondent faced, as an alternative to in-carceration, a maximum 5-year term of probation. While
the maximum fine in this case is $4,000 greater than the onein Blanton, this monetary penalty "cannot approximate in
severity the loss of liberty that a prison term entails." Id.,at 542.

Nor do we believe that the probation alternative rendersthe DUI offense "serious." * Like a monetary penalty, the
liberty infringement caused by a term of probation is farless intrusive than incarceration.

Ibid. The discretionaryprobation conditions do not alter this conclusion; while they

obviously entail a greater infringement on liberty than pro-bation without attendant conditions, they do not approximate the severe loss of liberty caused by imprisonment formore than six months.

We hold that the Court of Appeals was wrong in refusingto recognize that this case was controlled by our opinion in
Blanton rather than by its previous opinion in Craner. Anindividual convicted of driving under the influence in viola*There are 21 discretionary conditions which the sentencing court may
impose upon a defendant. Under 18 U. S. C. $ 3563(b), a court may require, among other things, that the defendant (1) pay restitution; (2) take
part in a drug and alcohol dependency program offered by an institution,
and if necessary, reside at the institution; (3) remain in the custody of the
Bureau of Prisons during nights and weekends for a period not exceeding
the term of imprisonment; (4) reside at or participate in a program of a
community correctional facility for all or part of the probationary term; or
(5) remain at his place of residence during nonworking hours, and, if necessary, this condition may be monitored by telephonic or electronic devices.

the exceptions of the United States to the Report of its Special Master insofar as it challenged the Master's determination that the whole of Mississippi Sound constitutes historic
inland waters, and, to this extent, adopted the Master's recommendations and confirmed his Report.

On March 1, 1988, the Court resolved the disagreement
between the United States and Mississippi as to that portion
of the Mississippi coastline at issue in the above-captioned
litigation and directed parties to submit to the Special Master a proposed appropriate decree defining the claims of
Alabama and Mississippi with respect to Mississippi Sound.
On August 17, 1990, the parties agreed on and submitted to
the Special Master a proposed decree in accordance with the
Court's decision of March 1, 1988, which was approved by the
Court on November 5, 1990. Pursuant to that supplemental
decree, the baseline (coastline) of the State of Mississippi as
well as a portion of the baseline of the State of Alabama was
delimited and, by stipulation of the parties, fixed, as described by coordinates in that decree. That portion of the
Alabama coastline not described by coordinates in the decree
remained ambulatory.

Supplemental Decree
Thereafter, a dispute arose between the State of Alabamaand the United States regarding their respective claims

under the Submerged Lands Act, 43 U. S. C. $ 1301 et seq., tooffshore areas in which the baseline had not been fixed by
the Court's November 5, 1990, Decree. The parties thereafter filed a joint motion with this Court, requesting that theCourt invoke its continuing jurisdiction to supplement the

November 5, 1990, Decree. 498 U. S. 9 (1990). With thatmotion the parties submitted for the Court's consideration a
supplemental decree which would fix that portion of the Ala-bama baseline that had heretofore remained ambulatory, resolve the existing dispute, and avoid future jurisdictionalcontroversies over the State of Alabama Submerged Lands
Act grant.

Accordingly,

IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED as
follows:

1. The parties' joint motion to supplement the Court's Decree of November 5, 1990, is granted.

2. For the purpose of the Court's Decree herein dated December 12, 1960, 364 U. S. 502 (defining the boundary line
between the submerged lands of the States bordering the
Gulf of Mexico), the coastline of the States of Alabama and
Mississippi shall be determined on the basis that the whole
Mississippi Sound constitutes state inland waters;

3. For the purposes of the said Decree of December 12,
1960, the coastline of Alabama includes:

(a) That portion of a straight line from a point on the eastern tip of Petit Bois Island where X = 215985 and Y = 77920
in the Alabama plane coordinate system, west zone, and
X = 637152.89 and Y = 198279.25 in the Mississippi plane
coordinate system, east zone, to a fixed point previously
described as the western tip of Dauphin Island by the
Court's Decree of November 5, 1990, where X = 238690 and
Y = 84050 in the Alabama plane coordinate system, west

zone, and X = 659783.79 and Y = 204674.56 in the Mississippiplane coordinate system, east zone, lying on the Alabama

side of the Alabama-Mississippi boundary;(b) A straight line from the fixed point previously
described as the western tip of Dauphin Island whereX = 238690 and Y = 84050 in the Alabama plane coordinate
system, west zone, to a point on the western tip of DauphinIsland where X = 240239.49 and Y = 85266.90 in the same
coordinate system;(c) The baseline delimiting Dauphin Island determined by
the following points in the Alabama plane coordinate system,west zone:

GROWE, SECRETARY OF STATE OF MINNESOTA,

et al. v. EMISON et al.

appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of minnesota

No. 91-1420. Argued November 2, 1992--Decided February 23, 1993
Shortly after a group of Minnesota voters filed a state-court action against

the Minnesota Secretary of State and other election officials, appellee
voters filed a similar action against essentially the same officials in the
Federal District Court. Both suits alleged that, in light of the 1990
census results, the State's congressional and legislative districts were
malapportioned, in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions; the
federal suit contained the additional claim that the current districts diluted the vote of minority groups in Minneapolis, in violation of $ 2 of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Both suits sought declaration that the
current districts were unlawful, and judicial construction of new districts if the state legislature failed to act. After the state legislature
adopted a new legislative districting plan, which contained numerous
drafting errors, a second federal action was filed raising constitutional
challenges to the new legislative districts; the two federal suits were
consolidated. The District Court set a deadline for the legislature to
act on redistricting plans, but refused to abstain or defer to the statecourt proceedings. The state court, having found the new legislative
districts defective because of the drafting errors, issued a preliminary
legislative redistricting plan correcting most of those errors, to be held
in abeyance pending further action by the legislature. Before the state
court could take additional action, the District Court stayed the statecourt proceedings; this Court vacated that stay. When the Governor
vetoed the legislature's effort to correct the defective legislative redistricting plan, and to adopt new congressional districts, the state court
issued a final order adopting its legislative plan, and held hearings on
the congressional plans submitted by the parties. Before the state
court could issue a congressional plan, however, the District Court
adopted its own redistricting plans, both legislative and congressional,
and permanently enjoined interference with state implementation of
those plans. The District Court found, in effect, that the state court's
legislative plan violated the Voting Rights Act because it did not contain
a "super-majority minority" Senate district; its own plan contained such
a district, designed to create a majority composed of at least three separately identifiable minority groups.

Syllabus
Held:

1. The District Court erred in not deferring to the state court's timely
efforts to redraw the legislative and congressional districts. States
have the primary duty and responsibility to perform that task, and federal courts must defer their action when a State, through its legislative
or judicial branch, has begun in timely fashion to address the issue.
Scott v. Germano, 381 U. S. 407. Absent evidence that these branches
cannot timely perform their duty, a federal court cannot affirmatively
obstruct, or permit federal litigation to impede, state reapportionment.
Judged by these principles, the District Court erred in several respects:
It set a deadline for reapportionment directed only to the state legislature, instead of to the legislature and courts; it issued an injunction that
treated the state court's provisional legislative plan as "interfering" in
the reapportionment process; it failed to give the state court's final
order adopting a legislative plan legal effect under the principles of federalism and comity embodied in the full faith and credit statute; and it
actively prevented the state court from issuing its own congressional
plan, although it appears that the state court was prepared to do so.
Pp. 32-37.

2. The District Court erred in its conclusion that the state court's
legislative plan violated $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The three prerequisites that were identified in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, as
necessary to establish a vote-dilution claim with respect to a multimember districting plan--a minority group that is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district,
minority political cohesion, and majority bloc voting that enables defeat
of the minority's preferred candidate--are also necessary to establish a
vote-fragmentation claim with respect to a single-member district. In
the present case, even making the dubious assumption that the minority
voters were geographically compact, the record contains no statistical or
anecdotal evidence of majority bloc voting or minority political cohesion
among the distinct ethnic and language minority groups the District
Court combined in the new district. The Gingles preconditions were
not only ignored but were on this record unattainable. Pp. 37-42.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case raises important issues regarding the proprietyof the District Court's pursuing reapportionment of Minnesota's state legislative and federal congressional districts inthe face of Minnesota state-court litigation seeking similar
relief, and regarding the District Court's conclusion that thestate court's legislative plan violated $ 2 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973.

I
In January 1991, a group of Minnesota voters filed a state-court action against the Minnesota Secretary of State and

other officials responsible for administering elections, claim-ing that the State's congressional and legislative districts
were malapportioned, in violation of the Fourteenth Amend-ment of the Federal Constitution and Article 4, $ 2, of the
Minnesota Constitution. Cotlow v. Growe, No. C8-91-985.The plaintiffs asserted that the 1990 federal census results

revealed a significant change in the distribution of the statepopulation, and requested that the court declare the current
districts unlawful and draw new districts if the legislaturefailed to do so. In February, the parties stipulated that, in
light of the new census, the challenged districting plans were

Opinion of the Court
unconstitutional. The Minnesota Supreme Court appointeda Special Redistricting Panel (composed of one appellate

judge and two district judges) to preside over the case.In March, a second group of plaintiffs filed an action in
federal court against essentially the same defendants, raising
similar challenges to the congressional and legislative dis-tricts.

Emison v. Growe, Civ. No. 4-91-202. The Emison
plaintiffs (who include members of various racial minorities)in addition raised objections to the legislative districts under

$ 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, alleging thatthose districts needlessly fragmented two Indian reservations and divided the minority population of Minneapolis.
The suit sought declaratory relief and continuing federal
jurisdiction over any legislative efforts to develop new
districts. A three-judge panel was appointed pursuant to
28 U. S. C. $ 2284(a).

While the federal and state actions were getting underway, the Minnesota Legislature was holding public hearings
on, and designing, new legislative districts. In May, it
adopted a new legislative districting plan, Chapter 246,
Minn. Stat. $$ 2.403-2.703 (Supp. 1991), and repealed the
prior 1983 apportionment. It was soon recognized that
Chapter 246 contained many technical errors--mistaken
compass directions, incorrect street names, noncontiguous
districts, and a few instances of double representation. By
August, committees of the legislature had prepared curative
legislation, Senate File 1596 and House File 1726 (collectively, Senate File 1596), but the legislature, which had adjourned in late May, was not due to reconvene until January
6, 1992.

Later in August, another group of plaintiffs filed a second
action in federal court, again against the Minnesota Secretary of State. Benson v. Growe, No. 4-91-603. The Benson plaintiffs, who include the Republican minority leaders
of the Minnesota Senate and House, raised federal and state
constitutional challenges to Chapter 246, but no Voting

Opinion of the Court
Rights Act allegations. The Benson action was consolidated
with the Emison suit; the Cotlow plaintiffs, as well as the
Minnesota House of Representatives and State Senate,
intervened.

With the legislature out of session, the committees' proposed curative measures for Chapter 246 pending, and the
state court in Cotlow considering many of the same issues,
the District Court granted the defendants' motion to defer
further proceedings pending action by the Minnesota Legislature. It denied, however, defendants' motion to abstain in
light of the Cotlow suit, or to allow the state court first to
review any legislative action or, if the legislature failed to
act, to allow the state court first to issue a court-ordered
redistricting plan. The District Court set a January 20,
1992, deadline for the state legislature's action on both redistricting plans, and appointed special masters to develop contingent plans in the event the legislature failed to correct
Chapter 246 or to reapportion Minnesota's eight congressional districts.

Meanwhile, the Cotlow panel concluded (in October) that
Chapter 246, applied as written (i. e., with its drafting errors), violated both the State and Federal Constitutions, and
invited the parties to submit alternative legislative plans
based on Chapter 246. It also directed the parties to submit
by mid-October written arguments on any Chapter 246 violations of the Voting Rights Act. In late November, the state
court issued an order containing its preliminary legislative
redistricting plan--essentially Chapter 246 with the technical corrections (though not the stylistic corrections) contained in Senate File 1596. (Since no party had responded
to its order concerning Voting Rights Act violations, the
court concluded that Chapter 246 did not run afoul of that
Act.) It proposed putting its plan into effect on January 21,
1992, if the legislature had not acted by then. Two weeks
later, after further argument, the Cotlow panel indicated it

Opinion of the Court
would release a revised and final version of its legislativeredistricting plan in a few days.

In early December, before the state court issued its finalplan, the District Court stayed all proceedings in the

Cotlow
case, and enjoined parties to that action from "attempting to
enforce or implement any order of the . . . Minnesota SpecialRedistricting Panel which has proposed adoption of a reapportionment plan relating to state redistricting or Congres-sional redistricting." App. to Juris. Statement 154. The
court explained its action as necessary to prevent the statecourt from interfering with the legislature's efforts to redistrict and with the District Court's jurisdiction. It mentioned the Emison Voting Rights Act allegations as grounds
for issuing the injunction, which it found necessary in aid of
its jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1651. One judge dissented.

Four days later the state court issued an order containing
its final legislative plan, subject to the District Court's injunction and still conditioned on the legislature's failure to
adopt a lawful plan. The same order provided, again subject
to the District Court's injunction, that congressional redistricting plans be submitted by mid-January. The obstacle of
the District Court injunction was removed on January 10,
1992, when, upon application of the Cotlow plaintiffs, we vacated the injunction. 502 U. S. 1022.

When the legislature reconvened in January, both Houses
approved the corrections to Chapter 246 contained in Senate
File 1596 and also adopted a congressional redistricting plan
that legislative committees had drafted the previous October. The Governor, however, vetoed the legislation. On
January 30, the state court issued a final order adopting its
legislative plan and requiring that plan to be used for the
1992 primary and general elections. By February 6, pursuant to an order issued shortly after this Court vacated the
injunction, the parties had submitted their proposals for congressional redistricting, and on February 17 the state court
held hearings on the competing plans.

Opinion of the Court
Two days later, the District Court issued an order adopting its own legislative and congressional districting plans and
permanently enjoining interference with state implementation of those plans. 782 F. Supp. 427, 448-449 (Minn. 1992).
The Emison panel found that the state court's modified version of Chapter 246 "fails to provide the equitable relief necessary to cure the violation of the Voting Rights Act," id., at
440, which in its view required at least one "super-majority
minority" Senate district, a district in which the minority
constitutes a clear majority. The District Court rejected
Chapter 246 as a basis for its plan, and instead referred to
state policy as expressed in the Minnesota Constitution and
in a resolution adopted by both Houses of the legislature.
See Minn. Const., Art. 4, $ 2; H. R. Con. Res. No. 2, 77th Leg.,
Reg. Sess. (1991). Judge MacLaughlin dissented in part.
The District Court was unanimous, however, in its adoption
of a congressional redistricting plan, after concluding that
the pre-existing 1982 plan violated Art. I, $ 2, of the Federal
Constitution. Although it had received the same proposed
plans submitted to the state court earlier that month, it used
instead a congressional plan prepared by its special masters.
Finally, the District Court retained jurisdiction to ensure
adoption of its reapportionment plans and to enforce the permanent injunction.

In early March, the state court indicated that it was "fully
prepared to release a congressional plan" but that the federal
injunction prevented it from doing so. In its view, the federal plan reached population equality "without sufficient regard for the preservation of municipal and county boundaries." App. to Juris. Statement 445-446.

Appellants sought a stay of the District Court's February
order pending this appeal. Justice Blackmun granted
the stay with respect to the legislative redistricting plan.

32 GROWE v. EMISON

Opinion of the Court

II
In their challenge to both of the District Court's redistricting plans, appellants contend that, under the principles of
Scott v. Germano, 381 U. S. 407 (1965) (per curiam), the
court erred in not deferring to the Minnesota Special Redistricting Panel's proceedings. We agree.

The parties do not dispute that both courts had jurisdiction to consider the complaints before them. Of course federal courts and state courts often find themselves exercising
concurrent jurisdiction over the same subject matter, and
when that happens a federal court generally need neither
abstain (i. e., dismiss the case before it) nor defer to the state
proceedings (i. e., withhold action until the state proceedings
have concluded). See McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268,
282 (1910). In rare circumstances, however, principles of
federalism and comity dictate otherwise. We have found
abstention necessary, for example, when the federal action
raises difficult questions of state law bearing on important
matters of state policy, or when federal jurisdiction has been
invoked to restrain ongoing state criminal proceedings. See
Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,
424 U. S. 800, 814-817 (1976) (collecting examples). We have
required deferral, causing a federal court to "sta[y] its
hands," when a constitutional issue in the federal action will
be mooted or presented in a different posture following conclusion of the state-court case. Railroad Comm'n of Texas
v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496, 501 (1941).1

1 We have referred to the Pullman doctrine as a form of "abstention,"
see 312 U. S., at 501-502. To bring out more clearly, however, the distinction between those circumstances that require dismissal of a suit and those
that require postponing consideration of its merits, it would be preferable
to speak of Pullman "deferral." Pullman deferral recognizes that federal courts should not prematurely resolve the constitutionality of a state
statute, just as Germano deferral recognizes that federal courts should
not prematurely involve themselves in redistricting.

Opinion of the Court
In the reapportionment context, the Court has required
federal judges to defer consideration of disputes involving
redistricting where the State, through its legislative or judicial branch, has begun to address that highly political task
itself. In Germano, a Federal District Court invalidated
Illinois' Senate districts and entered an order requiring the
State to submit to the court any revised Senate districting
scheme it might adopt. An action had previously been filed
in state court attacking the same districting scheme. In
that case the Illinois Supreme Court held (subsequent to the
federal court's order) that the Senate districting scheme was
invalid, but expressed confidence that the General Assembly
would enact a lawful plan during its then current session,
scheduled to end in July 1965. The Illinois Supreme Court
retained jurisdiction to ensure that the upcoming 1966 general elections would be conducted pursuant to a constitutionally valid plan.

This Court disapproved the District Court's action. The
District Court "should have stayed its hand," we said, and
in failing to do so overlooked this Court's teaching that state
courts have a significant role in redistricting. 381 U. S., at
409.

"The power of the judiciary of a State to require valid
reapportionment or to formulate a valid redistricting
plan has not only been recognized by this Court but appropriate action by the States in such cases has been
specifically encouraged.

". . . The case is remanded with directions that the
District Court enter an order fixing a reasonable time
within which the appropriate agencies of the State of
Illinois, including its Supreme Court, may validly redistrict the Illinois State Senate; provided that the same
be accomplished within ample time to permit such plan
to be utilized in the 1966 election . . . ." Ibid. (citations omitted).

34 GROWE v. EMISON

Opinion of the Court
Today we renew our adherence to the principles expressedin

Germano, which derive from the recognition that the Constitution leaves with the States primary responsibility forapportionment of their federal congressional and state legislative districts. See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2. "We say once
again what has been said on many occasions: reapportion-ment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State

through its legislature or other body, rather than of a federalcourt."

Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975). Absent
evidence that these state branches will fail timely to performthat duty, a federal court must neither affirmatively obstruct

state reapportionment nor permit federal litigation to be
used to impede it.

Judged by these principles, the District Court's December
injunction of state-court proceedings, vacated by this Court
in January, was clear error. It seems to have been based
upon the mistaken view that federal judges need defer only
to the Minnesota Legislature and not at all to the State's
courts. Thus, the January 20 deadline the District Court
established was described as a deadline for the legislature,
ignoring the possibility and legitimacy of state judicial redistricting. And the injunction itself treated the state
court's provisional legislative redistricting plan as "interfering" in the reapportionment process. But the doctrine of
Germano prefers both state branches to federal courts as
agents of apportionment. The Minnesota Special Redistricting Panel's issuance of its plan (conditioned on the legislature's failure to enact a constitutionally acceptable plan in
January), far from being a federally enjoinable "interference," was precisely the sort of state judicial supervision of
redistricting we have encouraged. See Germano, 381 U. S.,
at 409 (citing cases).

Nor do the reasons offered by the District Court for its
actions in December and February support departure from
the Germano principles. It is true that the Emison plaintiffs alleged that the 1983 legislative districting scheme vio507us1$29K 11-26-96 16:26:56 PAGES OPINPGT

35Cite as: 507 U. S. 25 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
lated the Voting Rights Act, while the Cotlow complaintnever invoked that statute.

Germano, however, does not
require that the federal and state-court complaints be identi-cal; it instead focuses on the nature of the relief requested:

reapportionment of election districts. Minnesota can have
only one set of legislative districts, and the primacy of theState in designing those districts compels a federal court to

defer.The District Court also expressed concern over the lack of
time for orderly appeal, prior to the State's primaries, of anyjudgment that might issue from the state court, noting that
Minnesota allows the losing party 90 days to appeal. See
Minn. Rule Civ. App. Proc. 104.01. We fail to see the relevance of the speed of appellate review. Germano requires
only that the state agencies adopt a constitutional plan
"within ample time . . . to be utilized in the [upcoming] election," 381 U. S., at 409. It does not require appellate review
of the plan prior to the election, and such a requirement
would ignore the reality that States must often redistrict in
the most exigent circumstances--during the brief interval
between completion of the decennial federal census and the
primary season for the general elections in the next evennumbered year. Our consideration of this appeal, long after
the Minnesota primary and final elections have been held,
itself reflects the improbability of completing judicial review
before the necessary deadline for a new redistricting scheme.

It may be useful to describe what ought to have happened
with respect to each redistricting plan. The state court entered its judgment adopting its modified version of Chapter
246 in late January (nearly three weeks before the federal
court issued its opinion). That final order, by declaring the
legislature's version of Chapter 246 unconstitutional and
adopting a legislative plan to replace it, altered the status
quo: The state court's plan became the law of Minnesota. At
the very least, the elementary principles of federalism and
comity embodied in the full faith and credit statute, 28

Opinion of the Court
U. S. C. $ 1738, obligated the federal court to give that judg-ment

legal effect, rather than treating it as simply one of
several competing legislative redistricting proposals avail-able for the District Court's choosing. See

Atlantic Coast
Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281, 286, 296
(1970). In other words, after January 30 the federal courtwas empowered to entertain the

Emison plaintiffs' claims
relating to legislative redistricting only to the extent thoseclaims challenged the

state court's plan. Cf. Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U. S. 535, 540 (1978) (opinion of White, J.).With respect to the congressional plan, the District Court

did not ignore any state-court judgment, but only because it
had actively prevented such a judgment from issuing. The
wrongfully entered December injunction prevented the Special Redistricting Panel from developing a contingent plan
for congressional redistricting, as it had for legislative redistricting prior to the injunction. The state court's December
order to the parties for mid-January submission of congressional plans was rendered a nullity by the injunction, which
was not vacated until January 10. The net effect was a
delay of at least a few weeks in the submissions to the state
court, and in hearings on those submissions. A court may
not acknowledge Germano in one breath and impede a state
court's timely development of a plan in the next. It would
have been appropriate for the District Court to establish a
deadline by which, if the Special Redistricting Panel had not
acted, the federal court would proceed. But the January 20
deadline that the District Court established here was explicitly directed solely at the legislature. The state court was
never given a time by which it should decide on reapportionment, legislative or congressional, if it wished to avoid federal intervention.

Of course the District Court would have been justified in
adopting its own plan if it had been apparent that the state
court, through no fault of the District Court itself, would
not develop a redistricting plan in time for the primaries.

Opinion of the Court
Germano requires deferral, not abstention. But in thiscase, in addition to the fact that the federal court itself had

been (through its injunction) a cause of the state court'sdelay, it nonetheless appeared that the state court was fully
prepared to adopt a congressional plan in as timely a manneras the District Court. The Special Redistricting Panel received the same plans submitted to the federal court, andheld hearings on those plans two days before the federal
court issued its opinion. The record simply does not sup-port a conclusion that the state court was either unwilling
or unable to adopt a congressional plan in time for the elec-tions.

2 What occurred here was not a last-minute federalcourt rescue of the Minnesota electoral process, but a raceto beat the Minnesota Special Redistricting Panel to the finish line. That would have been wrong, even if the Panel hadnot been tripped earlier in the course. The District Court
erred in not deferring to the state court's timely consider-ation of congressional reapportionment.

to apply the preconditions for a vote-dilution violation setout by this Court for challenges to multimember districts,

see Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986), the court in-stead proceeded directly to the "totality of circumstances"
test in $ 2(b) and found unlawful dilution. It rejected, as a
basis for its redistricting plan, Chapter 246, Chapter 246 as
modified by Senate File 1596, and the state court's version
of Chapter 246, and adopted instead its special masters'
legislative plan, which includes a Senate district stretching
from south Minneapolis, around the downtown area, and then
into the northern part of the city in order to link minority
populations. This oddly shaped creation, Senate District
59, is 43 percent black and 60 percent minority, including at
least three separately identifiable minority groups.4 In the
District Court's view, based on "[ j]udicial experience, as well
as the results of past elections," a super-majority minority
Senate district in Minneapolis was required in order for a
districting scheme to comply with the Voting Rights Act.

leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are
not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political
process and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which
members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or
political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of
a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the
population."

4 These percentages refer to total population. To establish whether a

$ 2 violation has occurred (which presumably requires application of the
same standard that measures whether a $ 2 violation has been remedied)
other courts have looked to, not the district's total minority population,
but the district's minority population of voting age. See, e. g., Romero v.
Pomona, 883 F. 2d 1418, 1425-1426, and n. 13 (CA9 1989) (citing cases).
Gingles itself repeatedly refers to the voting population, see, e. g., 478
U. S., at 48, 50. We have no need to pass upon this aspect of the District
Court's opinion.

Opinion of the Court
782 F. Supp., at 440. We must review this analysis because,
if it is correct, the District Court was right to deny effect to
the state-court legislative redistricting plan.

As an initial matter, it is not clear precisely which legislative districting plan produced the vote dilution that necessitated the super-majority remedy. For almost a decade prior
to the 1992 election season, the only legislative districting
plan that had been in use in Minnesota was the 1983 plan,
which all parties agreed was unconstitutional in light of the
1990 census. More importantly, the state court had declared
the 1983 plan to be unconstitutional in its final order of January 30. Once that order issued, the Emison plaintiffs'
claims that the 1983 plan violated the Voting Rights Act became moot, unless those claims also related to the superseding plan. But no party to this litigation has ever alleged
that either Chapter 246, or the modified version of Chapter
246 adopted by the state court, resulted in vote dilution.
The District Court did not hold a hearing or request written
argument from the parties on the $ 2 validity of any particular plan; nor does the District Court's discussion focus on any
particular plan.

Although the legislative plan that in the court's view
produced the $ 2 "dilution" violation is unclear, the District
Court did clearly conclude that the state court's plan could
not remedy that unspecified violation because it "fail[ed] to
provide the affirmative relief necessary to adequately protect minority voting rights." Id., at 448. The District
Court was of the view, in other words, as the dissenting
judge perceived, see id., at 452, and n. 6 (MacLaughlin, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part), that any legislative plan lacking a super-majority minority Senate district
in Minneapolis violated $ 2. We turn to the merits of this
position.

Our precedent requires that, to establish a vote-dilution
claim with respect to a multimember districting plan (and

507us1$29K 11-26-96 16:26:56 PAGES OPINPGT
40 GROWE v. EMISON

Opinion of the Court
hence to justify a super-majority districting remedy), a plaintiff must prove three threshold conditions: first, "that [the
minority group] is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district";
second, "that it is politically cohesive"; and third, "that the
white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . .
usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate." Gingles, 478 U. S., at 50-51. We have not previously considered
whether these Gingles threshold factors apply to a $ 2 dilution challenge to a single-member districting scheme, a socalled "vote fragmentation" claim. See id., at 46-47, n. 12.
We have, however, stated on many occasions that multimember districting plans, as well as at-large plans, generally pose
greater threats to minority-voter participation in the political process than do single-member districts, see, e. g., id., at
47, and n. 13; id., at 87 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U. S. 613, 616-617 (1982); see
also Burns v. Richardson, 384 U. S. 73, 88 (1966)--which is
why we have strongly preferred single-member districts for
federal-court-ordered reapportionment, see, e. g., Connor v.
Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 415 (1977). It would be peculiar to conclude that a vote-dilution challenge to the (more dangerous)
multimember district requires a higher threshold showing
than a vote-fragmentation challenge to a single-member district. Certainly the reasons for the three Gingles prerequisites continue to apply: The "geographically compact majority" and "minority political cohesion" showings are needed
to establish that the minority has the potential to elect a
representative of its own choice in some single-member district, see Gingles, supra, at 50, n. 17. And the "minority
political cohesion" and "majority bloc voting" showings are
needed to establish that the challenged districting thwarts a
distinctive minority vote by submerging it in a larger white
voting population, see Gingles, supra, at 51. Unless these

Opinion of the Court
points are established, there neither has been a wrong norcan be a remedy.

5

In the present case, even if we make the dubious assump-tion that the minority voters were "geographically compact,"

there was quite obviously a higher-than-usual need for thesecond of the

Gingles showings. Assuming (without decid-ing) that it was permissible for the District Court to combine

distinct ethnic and language minority groups for purposes ofassessing compliance with $ 2, when dilution of the power of
such an agglomerated political bloc is the basis for an allegedviolation, proof of minority political cohesion is all the more
essential. See Badillo v. Stockton, 956 F. 2d 884, 891 (CA91992);

Concerned Citizens of Hardee County v. HardeeCounty Bd. of Comm'rs, 906 F. 2d 524 (CA11 1990); Campos

v. Baytown, 840 F. 2d 1240, 1244 (CA5 1988), cert. denied,492 U. S. 905 (1989). Since a court may not presume bloc
voting within even a single minority group, see Gingles,supra, at 46, it made no sense for the District Court to (in
effect) indulge that presumption as to bloc voting within anagglomeration of distinct minority groups.

We are satisfied that in the present case the Gingles pre-conditions were not only ignored but were unattainable. As
the District Court acknowledged, the record simply "con-tains no statistical evidence" of minority political cohesion
(whether of one or several minority groups) or of majoritybloc voting in Minneapolis. 782 F. Supp., at 436, n. 30. And
even anecdotal evidence is lacking. Recognizing this void,the court relied on an article identifying bloc voting as a

5 Gingles expressly declined to resolve whether, when a plaintiff alleges
that a voting practice or procedure impairs a minority's ability to influence,
rather than alter, election results, a showing of geographical compactness
of a minority group not sufficiently large to constitute a majority will suffice. 478 U. S., at 46-47, n. 12. We do not reach that question in the
present case either: Although the Emison plaintiffs alleged both vote
dilution and minimization of vote influence (in the 1983 plan), the District
Court considered only the former issue in reviewing the state court's plan.

not consider the other points of error raised by appellants.The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded with

43OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

FEX v. MICHIGAN
certiorari to the supreme court of michigan
No. 91-7873. Argued December 8, 1992--Decided February 23, 1993
Indiana and Michigan are parties to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), Article III(a) of which provides that a prisoner of one party
State who is the subject of a detainer lodged by another such State
must be brought to trial within 180 days "after he shall have caused to
be delivered" to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the
latter State a request for final disposition of the charges on which the
detainer is based. Petitioner Fex, a prisoner in Indiana, was brought
to trial in Michigan 196 days after he gave such a request to Indiana
prison authorities and 177 days after the request was received by the
Michigan prosecutor. His pretrial motion pursuant to Article V(c) of
the IAD, which provides for dismissal with prejudice if trial does not
commence within the 180-day period, was denied on the ground that the
statutory period did not begin until the Michigan prosecutor received
his request. His conviction was set aside by the Michigan Court of
Appeals, which held that the 180-day period was triggered by transmittal of his request to the Indiana officials. The State Supreme Court
summarily reversed.

Held: It is self-evident that no one can have "caused something to be delivered" unless delivery in fact occurs. The textual possibility still exists, however, that once delivery has been made, the 180 days must be
computed from the date the prisoner "caused" that delivery. Although
the text of Article III(a) is ambiguous in isolation, commonsense indications and the import of related provisions compel the conclusion that
the 180-day period does not commence until the prisoner's disposition
request has actually been delivered to the court and prosecutor of the
jurisdiction that lodged the detainer against him. Delivery is a more
likely choice for triggering the time limit than is causation of delivery
because the former concept is more readily identifiable as a point in
time. Moreover, if delivery is the trigger, the consequence of a warden's delay in forwarding the prisoner's request will merely be postponement of the starting of the 180-day clock, whereas if causation is
the trigger, the consequence will be total preclusion of the prosecution,
even before the prosecutor knew it had been requested. Delivery as
the critical event is confirmed by the fact that the IAD provides for
documentary evidence of the time of receipt (by requiring the request

This case arises out of a "detainer," which is a request filed
by a criminal justice agency with the institution in which a
prisoner is incarcerated, asking that the prisoner be held for
the agency, or that the agency be advised when the prisoner's release is imminent. Indiana and Michigan, along with
46 other States, the District of Columbia, and the United
States, are parties to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers
(IAD). See Ind. Code $ 35-33-10-4 (1988); Mich. Comp.

which are set forth in the margin.1

1 Title 18 U. S. C. App. $ 2 contains the full text of the IAD, and we
refer to its provisions by their original article numbers, as set forth there.
Article III of the IAD provides in relevant part as follows:

"(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a
penal or correctional institution of a party State, and whenever during the
continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other
party State any untried indictment, information, or complaint on the basis
of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be
brought to trial within one hundred and eighty days after he shall have
caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court
of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his
imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the
indictment, information, or complaint: Provided, That, for good cause
shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court
having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable
continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating
the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time
already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the
amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner,
and any decision of the State parole agency relating to the prisoner.

"(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in
paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden,
commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of him, who
shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate
prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.

"(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having
custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his
right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information,
or complaint on which the detainer is based."

Article V(c) of the IAD provides, in relevant part:

to trial within the period provided in article III . . . hereof, the appropriate

46 FEX v. MICHIGAN

Opinion of the Court
On February 29, 1988, petitioner was charged in Jackson
County, Michigan, with armed robbery, possession of a firearm during a felony, and assault with intent to murder. At
the time, he was held in connection with unrelated offenses
at the Westville Correctional Center in Westville, Indiana.
The Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney therefore lodged
a detainer against him. On September 7, 1988, the Indiana
correctional authorities informed petitioner of the detainer,
and he gave them his request for final disposition of the
Michigan charges. On September 22, the prison authorities
mailed petitioner's request; and on September 26, 1988, the
Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney and the Jackson
County Circuit Court received it. Petitioner's trial on the
Michigan charges began on March 22, 1989, 177 days after
his request was delivered to the Michigan officials and 196
days after petitioner gave his request to the Indiana prison
authorities. 439 Mich. 117, 118, 479 N. W. 2d 625 (1992)
(per curiam).

Prior to trial, petitioner moved for dismissal with prejudice pursuant to Article V(c) of the IAD, on the ground that
his trial would not begin until after the 180-day time limit
set forth in Article III(a). The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that the 180-day time period did not commence until the Michigan prosecutor's office received petitioner's request. App. 36. Petitioner was convicted on all
charges except assault with intent to murder, but his conviction was set aside by the Michigan Court of Appeals, which
held that "the commencement of the 180-day statutory period was triggered by [petitioner's] request for final disposition to the [Indiana] prison officials." Id., at 39. The
Supreme Court of Michigan summarily reversed. 439 Mich.

Opinion of the Court
The outcome of the present case turns upon the meaning
of the phrase, in Article III(a), "within one hundred and
eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered." The
issue, specifically, is whether, within the factual context before us, that phrase refers to (1) the time at which petitioner
transmitted his notice and request (hereinafter simply "request") to the Indiana correctional authorities; or rather
(2) the time at which the Michigan prosecutor and court
(hereinafter simply "prosecutor") received that request.

Respondent argues that no one can have "caused something to be delivered" unless delivery in fact occurs. That
is self-evidently true,2 and so we must reject petitioner's contention that a prisoner's transmittal of an IAD request to

2 Not, however, to the dissent: "The fact that the rule for marking the
start of the 180-day period is written in a fashion that contemplates actual
delivery . . . does not mean that it cannot apply if the request is never
delivered." Post, at 55. Of course it vastly understates the matter to
say that the provision is "written in a fashion that contemplates actual
delivery," as one might say Hamlet was written in a fashion that contemplates 16th-century dress. Causation of delivery is the very condition of
this provision's operation--and the dissent says it does not matter whether
delivery is caused.

The dissent asserts that "the logical way to express the idea that receipt
must be perfected before the provision applies would be to start the clock
180 days `after he has caused the request to have been delivered.' " Post,
at 53. But that reformulation changes the meaning in two respects that
have nothing to do with whether receipt must be perfected: First, by using
the perfect indicative ("after he has caused") rather than the future perfect ("after he shall have caused"), it omits the notion that the "causing"
is to occur not merely before the statutory deadline, but in the future;
second, by using the perfect infinitive ("to have been delivered") rather
than the present ("to be delivered"), it adds the utterly fascinating notion
that the receipt is to occur before the causing of receipt. The omission of
futurity and the addition of a requirement of antecedence are the only
differences between saying, for example, "after he shall have found the
hostages to be well treated" and "after he has found the hostages to have
been well treated." In both cases good treatment must be established,
just as under both the statutory text and the dissent's reformulation delivery must be established.

48 FEX v. MICHIGAN

Opinion of the Court
the prison authorities commences the 180-day period even if
the request gets lost in the mail and is never delivered to
the "receiving" State (i. e., the State lodging the detainer,
see Article II(c)). That still leaves open the textual possibility, however, that, once delivery has been made, the 180 days
must be computed, not from the date of delivery but from
the date of transmittal to the prison authorities. That is the
only possibility the balance of our discussion will consider;
and for convenience we shall refer to it as petitioner's
interpretation.

Respondent places great reliance upon the provision's use
of the future perfect tense ("shall have caused to be delivered"). It seems to us, however, that the future perfect
would be an appropriate tense for both interpretations:
The prisoner's transmittal of his request to the warden (if
that is the triggering event), or the prosecutor's receipt of
the request (if that is the triggering event), is to be completed ("perfected") at some date in the future (viewed from
the time of the IAD's adoption) before some other date in
the future that is under discussion (expiration of the 180
days). We think it must be acknowledged that the language
will literally bear either interpretation--i. e., that the crucial
point is the prisoner's transmittal of his request, or that it is
the prosecutor's receipt of the request. One can almost be
induced to accept one interpretation or the other on the basis
of which words are emphasized: "shall have caused to be delivered" versus "shall have caused to be delivered." 3

3 The dissent contends that the phrase "he shall have caused" puts the
focus "on the prisoner's act, and that act is complete when he transmits
his request to the warden." Ibid. It is not evident to us that the act of
"causing to be delivered" is complete before delivery. Nor can we agree
that, unless it has the purpose of starting the clock running upon transmittal to the warden, the phrase "he shall have caused" is "superfluous."
Ibid. It sets the stage for the succeeding paragraph, making it clear to
the reader that the notice at issue is a notice which (as paragraph (b) will
clarify) the prisoner is charged with providing.

Opinion of the Court
Though the text alone is indeterminate, we think resolu-tion of the ambiguity is readily to be found in what might be

called the sense of the matter, and in the import of relatedprovisions. As to the former: Petitioner would have us believe that the choice of "triggers" for the 180-day time period
lies between, on the one hand, the date the request is re-ceived by the prosecutor and, on the other hand, the date the

request is delivered to the warden of the prison. In fact,however, while the former option is clearly identified by the
textual term "delivered," there is no textual identification ofa clear alternative at the other end. If one seeks to determine the moment at which a prisoner "caused" the later delivery of a properly completed request, nothing in law or
logic suggests that it must be when he placed the request in
the hands of the warden. Perhaps it was when he gave the
request to a fellow inmate to deliver to the warden--or even
when he mailed it to the warden (Article III(b) provides that
the request "shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the
warden" (emphasis added)). It seems unlikely that a legislature would select, for the starting point of a statute of limitations, a concept so indeterminate as "caused." It makes
more sense to think that, as respondent contends, delivery is
the key concept, and that paragraph (a) includes the notion
of causality (rather than referring simply to "delivery" by
the prisoner) merely to be more precise, anticipating the
requirement of paragraph (b) that delivery be made by the
warden upon the prisoner's initiation.

Another commonsense indication pointing to the same conclusion is to be found in what might be termed (in current
political jargon) the "worst-case scenarios" under the two interpretations of the IAD. Under respondent's interpretation, it is possible that a warden, through negligence or even
malice, can delay forwarding of the request and thus postpone the starting of the 180-day clock. At worst, the prisoner (if he has not checked about the matter for half a year)
will not learn about the delay until several hundred days

Opinion of the Court
have elapsed with no trial. The result is that he will spendseveral hundred additional days under detainer (which entails certain disabilities, such as disqualification from certainrehabilitative programs, see United States v. Mauro, 436
U. S. 340, 359 (1978)), and will have his trial delayed severalhundred days.

4 That result is bad, given the intent of the

IAD. It is, however, no worse than what regularly occurredbefore the IAD was adopted, and in any event cannot be

entirely avoided by embracing petitioner's view that trans-mittal to the warden is the measuring event. As we have
said, the IAD unquestionably requires delivery, and onlyafter that has occurred can one entertain the possibility of
counting the 180 days from the transmittal to the warden.Thus, the careless or malicious warden, under petitioner's
interpretation, may be unable to delay commencement of the180-day period, but can

prevent it entirely, by simply failing
to forward the request. More importantly, however, theworst-case scenario under petitioner's interpretation produces results that are significantly worse: If, through negli-gence of the warden, a prisoner's IAD request is delivered
to the prosecutor more than 180 days after it was transmitted to the warden, the prosecution will be precluded beforethe prosecutor even knows it has been requested. It is possible, though by no means certain, that this consequencecould be avoided by the receiving state court's invocation of

4 There is no substance to the dissent's assertion that one of the "reason[s] for the IAD's creation" was to prevent the inmate from being "deprived of an opportunity to obtain a sentence to run concurrently with the
sentence being served at the time the detainer is filed." Post, at 56, 57
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Since the IAD does not
require detainers to be filed, giving a prisoner the opportunity to achieve
concurrent sentencing on outstanding offenses is obviously an accidental
consequence of the scheme rather than its objective. Moreover, we are
unaware of any studies showing that judges willing to impose concurrent
sentences are not willing (in the same circumstances) to credit out-of-state
time. If they are (as they logically should be), the opportunity of obtaining a concurrent sentence would ordinarily have zero value.

Opinion of the Court
the "good-cause continuance" clause of Article III(a) 5--but
it seems to us implausible that such a plainly undesirable
result was meant to be avoided only by resort to the (largely
discretionary) application of that provision. It is more reasonable to think that the receiving State's prosecutors are in
no risk of losing their case until they have been informed of
the request for trial.

Indications in the text of Article III confirm, in our view,
that the receiving State's receipt of the request starts the
clock. The most significant is the provision of Article III(b)
requiring the warden to forward the prisoner's request and
accompanying documents "by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested." The IAD thus provides for documentary evidence of the date on which the request is delivered to the officials of the receiving State, but requires no
record of the date on which it is transmitted to the warden
(assuming that is to be considered the act of "causing").
That would be peculiar if the latter rather than the former
were the critical date. Another textual clue, we think, is
the IAD's apparent indifference as to the manner of transmittal to the warden: Article III(b) says only that the request "shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden"
(emphasis added). A strange nonchalance, if the giving or
sending (either one) is to start the 180 days. Petitioner
avoids this difficulty by simply positing that it is the warden's receipt, no matter what the manner of giving or sending, that starts the clock--but there is simply no textual

5 Some courts have held that a continuance must be requested and
granted before the 180-day period has expired. See, e. g., Dennett v.
State, 19 Md. App. 376, 381, 311 A. 2d 437, 440 (1973) (citing Hoss v. State,
266 Md. 136, 143, 292 A. 2d 48, 51 (1972)); Commonwealth v. Fisher, 451

basis for that; surely the "causing" which petitioner consid-ers central occurs upon the giving or sending.

Petitioner makes the policy argument that "[f]airness re-quires the burden of compliance with the requirements of the
IAD to be placed entirely on the law enforcement officials
involved, since the prisoner has little ability to enforce com-pliance," Brief for Petitioner 8, and that any other approach

would "frustrate the higher purpose" of the IAD, leaving"neither a legal nor a practical limit on the length of time
prison authorities could delay forwarding a [request]," id., at20. These arguments, however, assume the availability of a
reading that would give effect to a request that is never de-livered

at all. (Otherwise, it remains within the power of
the warden to frustrate the IAD by simply not forwarding.)
As we have observed, the textual requirement "shall have
caused to be delivered" is simply not susceptible of such a
reading. Petitioner's "fairness" and "higher purpose" arguments are, in other words, more appropriately addressed to
the legislatures of the contracting States, which adopted the
IAD's text.

Our discussion has addressed only the second question presented in the petition for writ of certiorari; we have concluded that our grant as to the first question was improvident, and do not reach the issue it presents. We hold that
the 180-day time period in Article III(a) of the IAD does not
commence until the prisoner's request for final disposition of
the charges against him has actually been delivered to the
court and prosecuting officer of the jurisdiction that lodged
the detainer against him. The judgment of the Supreme
Court of Michigan is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

I am not persuaded that the language of Article III is ambiguous. The majority suggests that a search for the literal

53Cite as: 507 U. S. 43 (1993)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
meaning of the contested phrase comes down to an unresolv-able contest between a reading that emphasizes the word

"caused" and one that emphasizes the word "delivered."But Article III contains another word that is at least as
significant. That word favors petitioner's interpretation.
The word is "he." The 180-day clock begins after he--theprisoner--"shall have caused" the request to be delivered.

The focus is on the prisoner's act, and that act is completewhen he transmits his request to the warden. That is the
last time at which the inmate can be said to have doneanything to "have caused to be delivered" the request.
Any other reading renders the words "he shall have
caused" superfluous.

Even if the provision's focus on the prisoner's act were not
so clear, the statute could not be read as Michigan suggests.
The provision's use of the future perfect tense is highly significant. Contrary to the majority's contention that "the future perfect would be an appropriate tense for both interpretations," ante, at 48, the logical way to express the idea that
receipt must be perfected before the provision applies would
be to start the clock 180 days "after he has caused the request to have been delivered." But the IAD does not say
that, nor does it use the vastly more simple, "after delivery."

That this construction was intentional is supported by the
drafting history of the IAD. When the Council of State
Governments proposed the agreement governing interstate
detainers, it also proposed model legislation governing intrastate detainers. See Suggested State Legislation Program
for 1957, pp. 77-78 (1956). Both proposals contained language virtually identical to the language in Article III(a).
See id., at 77. The Council stated that the intrastate proposal was "based substantially on statutes now operative in
California and Oregon." Id., at 76. Critically, however,
neither State's provision referred to a delivery "caused" by
the prisoner. The Oregon statute required trial "within 90
days of receipt" by the district attorney of the prisoner's

notice, Act of Apr. 29, 1955, ch. 387, $ 2(1), 1955 Ore. Laws435, and the California law required trial "within ninety days

after [he] shall have delivered" his request to the prosecutor,Act of May 28, 1931, ch. 486, $ 1, 1931 Cal. Stats. 1060-1061.
If, as Michigan insists here, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26, 37,
the Council's use of "caused to be delivered" was somehowmeant to convey "actual receipt," then the drafters' failure

to follow the clear and uncomplicated model offered by theOregon provision is puzzling in the extreme. When asked
at oral argument about this failure, counsel for amicus theUnited States replied that "the problem with using the verb
receive rather than the verb deliver in Article III is that . . .
[t]hat would shift the focus away from the prisoner, and the
prisoner has a vital role under article III . . . because he
initiates the process." Id., at 41. I submit that the focus
on the prisoner is precisely the point, and that the reason
the drafters used the language they did is because the 180-
day provision is triggered by the action of the inmate.

Nevertheless, the majority finds the disputed language to
be ambiguous, ante, at 47-48, and it exhibits no interest in
the history of the IAD. Instead, the majority asserts that
the answer to the problem is to be found in "the sense of the
matter." Ante, at 49. But petitioner's reading prevails in
the arena of "sense," as well.

I turn first to the majority's assumption that the 180-day
provision is not triggered if the request is never delivered.
Because "the IAD unquestionably requires delivery, and
only after that has occurred can one entertain the possibility
of counting the 180 days from the transmittal to the warden,"
ante, at 50, the majority attacks as illogical a reading under
which the negligent or malicious warden--who can prevent
entirely the operation of the 180-day rule simply by failing
to forward the prisoner's request--could not delay the starting of the clock. Ante, at 49-50. That premise is flawed.
Obviously, the rule anticipates actual delivery. Article
III(b) requires prison officials to forward a prisoner's request

55Cite as: 507 U. S. 43 (1993)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
promptly, as well. The fact that the rule for marking the
start of the 180-day period is written in a fashion that contemplates actual delivery, however, does not mean that it cannot
apply if the request is never delivered. Although the IAD assumes that its signatories will abide by its terms, I find nothing strange in the notion that the 180-day provision might be
construed to apply as well to an unanticipated act of bad faith.1

Even on its own terms, the majority's construction is not
faithful to the purposes of the IAD. The IAD's primary purpose is not to protect prosecutors' calendars, or even to protect prosecutions, but to provide a swift and certain means
for resolving the uncertainties and alleviating the disabilities
created by outstanding detainers. See Article I; Carchman
v. Nash, 473 U. S. 716, 720 (1985); Note, The Effect of Violations of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers on Subject
Matter Jurisdiction, 54 Ford. L. Rev. 1209, 1210, n. 12 (1986).
If the 180 days from the prisoner's invocation of the IAD is
allowed to stretch into 200 or 250 or 350 days, that purpose
is defeated.

In each of this Court's decisions construing the IAD, it
properly has relied upon and emphasized the purpose of the
IAD. See Carchman v. Nash, 473 U. S., at 720, 729-734;

1 For the prisoner aggrieved by a flagrant violation of the IAD, other
remedies also may be available. The Courts of Appeals have split over
the question of an IAD violation's cognizability on habeas. Compare, e. g.,
Kerr v. Finkbeiner, 757 F. 2d 604 (CA4) (denying habeas relief), cert.
denied, 474 U. S. 929 (1985), with United States v. Williams, 615 F. 2d
585, 590 (CA3 1980) (IAD violation cognizable on habeas). See generally
M. Mushlin & F. Merritt, Rights of Prisoners 324 (Supp. 1992); Note, The

States v. Mauro, 436 U. S. 340, 361-362 (1978). The major-ity, however, gives that purpose short shrift, focusing instead on "worst-case scenarios," ante, at 49, and on an as-sessment of the balance of harms under each interpretation.
Two assumptions appear to underlie that inquiry. Thefirst--evident in the cursory and conditional nature of the
concession that to spend several hundred additional daysunder detainer "is bad, given the intent of the IAD,"

ante,at 50--is that the burden of spending extra time under detainer is relatively minor. The failure to take seriously theharm suffered by a prisoner under detainer is further apparent in the majority's offhand and insensitive description ofthe practical impact of such status. To say that the prisoner
under detainer faces "certain disabilities, such as disqualifi-cation from certain rehabilitative programs,"

ibid., is to un-derstate the matter profoundly. This Court pointed out in

Carchman v. Nash, that the prisoner under detainer bears avery heavy burden:

" `[T]he inmate is (1) deprived of an opportunity to ob-tain a sentence to run concurrently with the sentence
being served at the time the detainer is filed; (2) classi-fied as a maximum or close custody risk; (3) ineligible
for initial assignments to less than maximum securityprisons (i. e., honor farms or forestry camp work); (4)
ineligible for trustee [sic] status; (5) not allowed to livein preferred living quarters such as dormitories; (6)
ineligible for study-release programs or work-releaseprograms; (7) ineligible to be transferred to preferred
medium or minimum custody institutions within thecorrectional system, which includes the removal of any
possibility of transfer to an institution more appropriatefor youthful offenders; (8) not entitled to preferred

These harms are substantial and well recognized. See, e. g.,Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374, 379 (1969); United States v.

they were the reason for the IAD's creation in the first place.The majority's sanguine reassurance that delays of several
hundred days, while "bad," are "no worse than what regu-larly occurred before the IAD was adopted,"

ante, at 50, isthus perplexing. The fact that the majority's reading leaves

prisoners no worse off than if the IAD had never beenadopted proves nothing at all, except perhaps that the majority's approach nullifies the ends that the IAD was meant toachieve. Our task, however, is not to negate the IAD but
to interpret it. That task is impossible without a properunderstanding of the seriousness with which the IAD regards the damage done by unnecessarily long periods spentunder detainer.

The majority's misunderstanding of the stakes on the in-mate's side of the scale is matched by its miscalculation of
the interest of the State. It is widely acknowledged thatonly a fraction of all detainers ultimately result in conviction
or further imprisonment. See J. Gobert & N. Cohen, Rightsof Prisoners 284 (1981); Dauber, Reforming the Detainer
System: A Case Study, 7 Crim. L. Bull. 669, 689-690 (1971);Note, 54 Ford. L. Rev., at 1210, n. 12. It is not uncommon
for a detainer to be withdrawn just prior to the completionof the prisoner's sentence. See

detainers are filed groundlessly or even in bad faith, see
United States v. Mauro, 436 U. S., at 358, and n. 25, solely
for the purpose of harassment, see Carchman v. Nash, 473U. S., at 729, n. 6. For this reason, Article III is intended to

provide the prisoner " `with a procedure for bringing about a
prompt test of the substantiality of detainers placed againsthim by other jurisdictions.' "

Id., at 730, n. 6 (quoting House
and Senate Reports).These two observations--that detainers burden prisoners

with onerous disabilities and that the paradigmatic detainerdoes not result in a new conviction--suggest that the majority has not properly assessed the balance of interests that
underlies the IAD's design. Particularly in light of Article
IX's command that the IAD "shall be liberally construed so
as to effectuate its purposes," I find the majority's interpretation, which countenances lengthy and indeterminate delays
in the resolution of outstanding detainers, impossible to
sustain.

Finally, I must emphasize the somewhat obvious fact that
a prisoner has no power of supervision over prison officials.
Once he has handed over his request to the prison authorities, he has done all that he can do to set the process in
motion. For that reason, this Court held in Houston v.
Lack, 487 U. S. 266 (1988), that a pro se prisoner's notice
of appeal is "filed" at the moment it is conveyed to prison
authorities for forwarding to the district court. Because of
the prisoner's powerlessness, the IAD's inmate-initiated 180-
day period serves as a useful incentive to prison officials to
forward IAD requests speedily. The Solicitor General asserts that the prisoner somehow is in a better position than
are officials in the receiving State to ensure that his request
is forwarded promptly, because, for example, "the prisoner
can insist that he be provided with proof that his request has
been mailed to the appropriate officials." Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 16-17. This seems to me to be
severely out of touch with reality. A prisoner's demands

cannot be expected to generate the same degree of concernas do the inquiries and interests of a sister State. Because

of the IAD's reciprocal nature, the signatories, who can pressfor a speedy turnaround from a position of strength, are far
better able to bear the risk of a failure to meet the 180-day deadline.

2

The IAD's 180-day clock is intended to give the prisoner alever with which to move forward a process that will enable

him to know his fate and perhaps eliminate burdensome con-ditions. It makes no sense to interpret the IAD so as to
remove from its intended beneficiary the power to start thatclock. Accordingly, I dissent.

2 Even the Solicitor General acknowledged that "a State that has been
negligent in fulfilling its duty may well be subject to political pressure
from other States that are parties to the IAD." Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. The
fact that nevertheless in some cases the 180-day rule may cause legitimate
cases to be dismissed is no small matter, but dismissal is, after all, the
result mandated by the IAD. Moreover, where a diligent prosecutor is
surprised by the late arrival of a request, I would expect that, under appropriate circumstances, a good-cause continuance would be in order. See
Article III(a). (I acknowledge, however, that, as the majority points out,
ante, at 51, n. 5, some courts have refused to grant a continuance after the
expiration of the 180-day period.) The majority finds this obvious solution "implausible," but to me it is far more plausible than a regime under
which the inmate is expected to "insist" that recalcitrant prison authorities move more quickly.

ITEL CONTAINERS INTERNATIONAL CORP. v.HUDDLESTON, COMMISSIONER OF

REVENUE OF TENNESSEE
certiorari to the supreme court of tennessee
No. 91-321. Argued October 14, 1992--Decided February 23, 1993
Petitioner Itel Containers International Corporation is a domestic company that leases cargo containers for use exclusively in international
shipping. After paying under protest a Tennessee sales tax on its proceeds from the lease of containers delivered in the State, Itel filed a
refund action, challenging the tax's constitutionality under the Commerce, Import-Export, and Supremacy Clauses. The last challenge was
based on an alleged conflict with federal regulations and with two international Container Conventions signed by the United States: the 1956
Convention prohibiting the imposition of a tax "chargeable by reason of
importation," and the 1972 Convention prohibiting taxes "collected on,
or in connexion with, the importation of goods." The State Chancery
Court reduced the assessment on state-law grounds but rejected the
constitutional claims, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.

Held: Tennessee's sales tax, as applied to Itel's leases, does not violate the

Commerce, Import-Export, or Supremacy Clause. Pp. 64-78.

(a) The sales tax is not pre-empted by the 1972 or 1956 Container
Convention. The Conventions' text makes clear that only those taxes
imposed based on the act of importation itself are disallowed, not, as
Itel contends, all taxes on international cargo containers. The fact that
other signatory nations may place only an indirect value added tax
(VAT) on container leases does not demonstrate that Tennessee's direct
tax on container leases is prohibited, because the Conventions do not
distinguish between direct and indirect taxes. While the VAT system
is not equivalent to Tennessee's sales tax for the purposes of calculation
and assessment, it is equivalent for purposes of the Conventions: neither
imposes a tax based on importation. The Federal Government agrees
with this Court's interpretation of the Container Conventions, advocating a position that does not conflict with the one it took in Japan Line,
Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434. Pp. 64-69.

(b) The tax, which applies to domestic and foreign goods without differentiation, does not impede the federal objectives expressed in the
Conventions and related federal statutes and regulations. The federal
regulatory scheme for containers used in foreign commerce discloses no
congressional intent to exempt those containers from all or most domes507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT

61Cite as: 507 U. S. 60 (1993)
Syllabus
tic taxation, in contrast to the regulatory scheme for customs bonded
warehouses, which pre-empts most state taxes on warehoused goods,
see, e. g., McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corp., 309 U. S. 414. Nor is the
scheme so pervasive that it demonstrates a federal purpose to occupy
the field of container regulation and taxation. The precise federal policy regarding promotion of container use is satisfied by a limited proscription against taxes that are imposed upon or discriminate against
the containers' importation. Pp. 69-71.

(c) The tax does not violate the Foreign Commerce Clause under
Japan Line's three-part test. First, as concluded by the State Supreme
Court and accepted by Itel, the tax satisfies the Domestic Commerce
Clause test of Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279.
This conclusion confirms both the State's legitimate interest in taxing
the transaction and the absence of an attempt to interfere with the
free flow of commerce. Second, the tax does not create a substantial
risk of multiple taxation implicating foreign commerce concerns because
Tennessee is simply taxing a discrete transaction occurring within the
State. Tennessee need not refrain from taxing a transaction merely
because it is also potentially subject to taxation by a foreign sovereign.
Moreover, Tennessee reduces, if not eliminates, the risk of multiple taxation by crediting against its own tax any tax paid in another jurisdiction on the same transaction. Third, the tax does not prevent the Federal Government from speaking with one voice when regulating
commercial relations with foreign governments. The tax creates no
substantial risk of multiple taxation, is consistent with federal conventions, statutes and regulations, and does not conflict with international
custom. Pp. 71-76.

(d) The tax does not violate the Import-Export Clause under the test
announced in Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276, 285-286. Because Michelin's first component mirrors the Japan Line one voice requirement, and its third component mirrors the Complete Auto requirements, these components are satisfied for the same reasons the tax
survives Commerce Clause scrutiny. Michelin's second component--
ensuring that import revenues are not being diverted from the Federal
Government--is also met because Tennessee's tax is neither a tax on
importation or imported goods nor a direct tax on imports and exports
in transit within the meaning of Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of
Equalization, 329 U. S. 69, 78-79, 84. Pp. 76-78.

In this case we consider the validity of a state tax affect-ing cargo containers used in international trade, a subject

Tennessee's sales tax on leases of containers owned by adomestic company and used in international shipping.

The use of large steel containers to transport goods bytruck, rail, and oceangoing carrier was a major innovation

in transportation technology. In 1990, the United Statesshipped, by value, 60% of its marine imports and 52% of its
marine exports in these containers. Itel Containers Inter*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by William Karas and David

Opinion of the Court
national Corporation, the petitioner here, is a Delaware cor-poration with its principal place of business in California.

Itel's primary business is leasing cargo containers to partici-pants in the international shipping industry, and all its leases
restrict use of its containers to international commerce.
The leases are solicited and negotiated through Itel market-ing offices in California, Illinois, New Jersey, South Carolina,

Texas, and Washington, and the leased containers are deliv-ered to lessees or their agents in many of the 50 States, including Tennessee. The Tennessee deliveries occur eitherat Itel's Memphis terminal or at several designated thirdparty terminals.

In December 1986, the Tennessee Department of Revenue
assessed $382,465 in sales tax, penalties, and interest on the
proceeds Itel earned from leased containers delivered in Tennessee for the period of January 1983 through November
1986. Itel paid under protest and filed an action for a refund, challenging the constitutionality of the Tennessee tax
under the Commerce Clause, the Import-Export Clause and
the Supremacy Clause. The last challenge to the tax was
based on an alleged conflict both with federal regulations
and with two international conventions to which the United
States is a signatory. Customs Convention on Containers,
Dec. 2, 1972, [1975] 988 U. N. T. S. 43 (hereinafter 1972 Container Convention); Customs Convention on Containers, May
18, 1956, [1969] 20 U. S. T. 301, T. I. A. S. No. 6634 (hereinafter 1956 Container Convention). The Tennessee Chancery Court reduced the assessment to $158,012 on state-law
grounds but rejected Itel's constitutional claims.

On appeal to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, Itel maintained that the Tennessee tax is pre-empted by the Container Conventions and their implementing federal regulations. The court concluded, however, that congressional
regulation of cargo containers is not pervasive and that Congress has not otherwise acted to bar state sales taxes on
cargo container leases. Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Card507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
well, 814 S. W. 2d 29, 34 (1991). Instead, the court held,Congress merely prohibits the imposition of federal customs

duties on containers, and that prohibition does not pre-emptTennessee's sales tax, which is not a customs duty. Id., at
35-36.Itel also claimed that Tennessee's tax violates the Foreign
Commerce Clause principles announced in Japan Line, Ltd.v.

County of Los Angeles, supra, because the tax "preventsthe Federal Government from `speaking with one voice when

regulating commercial relations with foreign governments' "and "creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation." Id., at 451. The state court rejected this argumentbecause the tax is imposed only upon a discrete transaction--
the transferred possession of cargo containers within Ten-nessee--and therefore does not risk multiple taxation or impede federal regulation of foreign trade. 814 S. W. 2d, at36-37.

Last, Itel argued that the tax violates the Import-ExportClause because it prevents the Federal Government from
speaking with one voice in international affairs and is a taxon exports that is per se impermissible under Richfield Oil
Corp. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 329 U. S. 69 (1946). Thecourt dismissed Itel's one voice argument for reasons similar
to those given in its Commerce Clause analysis, 814 S. W. 2d,at 38, and held the Tennessee tax does not violate Richfield's
per se restriction because it is not a direct tax on the value ofgoods destined for export. 814 S. W. 2d, at 33. We granted
certiorari, 502 U. S. 1090 (1992), and now affirm.

II
Itel's primary challenge is that the imposition of the Ten-nessee sales tax is proscribed by both the 1972 and 1956 Container Conventions. The Conventions restrict the authorityof signatories to tax cargo containers by requiring signatory
nations to grant the containers "temporary admission" intotheir borders, subject to exportation "within three months

Opinion of the Court
from the date of importation" unless this period is extendedby customs authorities. 1972 Container Convention, Arts. 3

and 4; 1956 Container Convention, Arts. 2 and 3. Tempo-rary admission status permits the containers to enter a nation "free of import duties and taxes" under the 1972 Convention and "free of import duties and import taxes" underthe 1956 Convention. 1972 Container Convention, Art. 1;

1956 Container Convention, Art. 2.The Conventions define these key phrases in similar
terms. The 1972 Convention defines "import duties andtaxes" to mean "Customs duties and all other duties, taxes,
fees and other charges which are collected on, or in connexion with, the importation of goods, but not including fees and
charges limited in amount to the approximate cost of services
rendered." 1972 Container Convention, Art. 1. The 1956
Convention defines "import duties and import taxes" to
mean "not only Customs duties but also all duties and taxes
whatsoever chargeable by reason of importation." 1956
Container Convention, Art. 1. Itel does not claim the Tennessee sales taxes on its container leases is a "Customs
dut[y]" under either Convention. Rather, it says that because its containers would not be available for lease, and
hence taxation, in Tennessee but for their importation into
the United States, the Tennessee tax must be a tax "collected on, or in connexion with, the importation of goods" in
contravention of the 1972 Convention and a tax "chargeable
by reason of importation" in contravention of the 1956
Convention.

We cannot accept Itel's interpretation of the Container
Conventions. Our interpretation must begin, as always,
with the text of the Conventions. See Air France v. Saks,
470 U. S. 392, 397 (1985). The text, instead of supporting
Itel's broad construction, makes clear that it is the reason a
State imposes a tax, not the reason for the presence of the
containers within a State's jurisdiction, that determines
whether a tax violates the Container Conventions. The

507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT
66 ITEL CONTAINERS INT'L CORP. v. HUDDLESTON

Opinion of the Court
Conventions thus disallow only those taxes imposed basedon the act of importation itself. In contrast, Itel's interpretation would bar all taxes on containers covered by the Con-ventions, because each covered container is, by definition, in
the United States as a result of its temporary importation.
This reading makes superfluous the Conventions' qualifyinglanguage that the only taxes proscribed are those "collected

on, or in connexion with, the importation of goods" and those"chargeable by reason of importation." 1972 Container
Convention, Art. 1; 1956 Container Convention, Art. 1.In an attempt to counteract the interpretation that the
Conventions prohibit only those taxes based on the importation of containers, Itel asserts that the consistent practice of
other signatory nations and a prior interpretation of the 1956
Convention by the United States prove that signatory nations read the Conventions to proscribe all taxes on containers within their borders. See Factor v. Laubenheimer, 290
U. S. 276, 294-295 (1933). Itel, however, overstates the probative value of these actions.

As evidence that other signatory nations free cargo containers of all domestic taxation, Itel places primary reliance
on the Economic Community Sixth Directive and the United
Kingdom Value Added Tax (VAT), as illuminated in an amicus brief filed by the United Kingdom. Brief for United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as Amicus
Curiae 7-9. Under the European VAT system, no direct
tax, be it a VAT, sales, or use tax, is imposed on the value of
international container leases. See Sixth Council Directive
of May 17, 1977, Arts. 14(1)(i) and 15(13), reprinted in CCH
Common Mkt. Rep. |||| 3165P and 3165Q.

The value of international container leases, however, is included in the cost of transporting goods, which in turn is
added to the value of the goods when calculating VAT tax
liability. Itel admits this is tantamount to an indirect tax
on the value of international container leases, but claims the
distinction between an indirect tax (paid by the consumer of

507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT

67Cite as: 507 U. S. 60 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
import goods) and a direct tax on the container itself (paidby either the lessor or lessee of the container) is significant.

Whether or not, in the abstract, there is a significant differ-ence between direct and indirect taxation, the Container
Conventions do not distinguish between the two methods or
differentiate depending upon the legal incidence of a tax.For example, the first declaration in both Convention Protocols of Signature states that inclusion of the weight or valueof containers in the weight or value of goods for calculating
import duties and taxes upon those goods conflicts with theConventions, even though this would be only an indirect tax
on the containers and the legal incidence of the tax would
not fall on the container lessor or lessee. 1972 Container
Convention, Protocol of Signature, [1975] 988 U. N. T. S., at
74; 1956 Container Convention, Protocol of Signature, [1969]
20 U. S. T., at 326. The Conventions, in short, prohibit both
direct and indirect taxes imposed based on the importation
of a container, but permit direct and indirect taxes imposed
on some other basis.

As further evidence in support of its position, Itel points to
the statements of signatory nations objecting to Tennessee's
taxation of container leases. With all due respect to those
statements, we adhere to our interpretation. We are mindful that 11 nations (Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and
the United Kingdom), each a signatory to at least one Container Convention, have sent a diplomatic note to the United
States Department of State submitting that they do not
"impose sales taxes (or equivalent taxes of different nomenclatures) on the lease of cargo containers that are used in
international commerce among the Contracting Parties to
the Conventions." App. to Brief for United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland as Amicus Curiae 1a.
The meaning these nations ascribe to the phrase "equivalent
taxes" is not clear. For purposes of calculation and assessment, the European VAT system, enacted in most of the

507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT
68 ITEL CONTAINERS INT'L CORP. v. HUDDLESTON

Opinion of the Court
objecting nations, is by no means equivalent to a sales tax.See

Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 498 U. S.
358, 365-366, n. 3 (1991). But as we discussed above, forthe purpose of determining whether a tax is one based on

importation, the European VAT system is equivalent to Tennessee's sales tax system--that is, neither system imposes atax based on the act of importation. Only this latter form

of equivalence is relevant under the Container Conventions.Directing our attention to the

amicus brief filed by the
United States in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles,441 U. S. 434 (1979), Itel next claims the United States Government once interpreted the 1956 Container Convention to
prohibit all domestic taxes on international cargo containers.
Even if this were true, the Government's current position is
quite different; its amicus brief in this case expresses agreement with our interpretation of both the 1972 and the 1956
Container Conventions. Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 12.

In its amicus brief in Japan Line, moreover, the United
States did not say that the 1956 Container Convention prohibited the imposition of any domestic tax on international
cargo containers. Its position was simply that under the
1956 Convention the United States gave containers "the
same status it gives under the customs laws to articles
admitted to a `bonded manufacturing warehouse.' " Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae in Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles, O. T. 1978, No. 77-1378, p. 25 (quoting
19 U. S. C. $ 1311). Starting from this premise the Government argued that, like state taxes on goods in customs
bonded warehouses destined for foreign trade, see McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corp., 309 U. S. 414, 428-429 (1940), state
taxes on containers would frustrate a federal scheme designed to benefit international commerce. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae in Japan Line, at 27-29, and n. 22.
We declined, and continue to decline, to adopt this expansive
view of McGoldrick and the pre-emptive effect of the Con507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT

69Cite as: 507 U. S. 60 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
tainer Conventions. See infra, at 70-71. And, in anyevent, the Government's pre-emption argument in Japan

Line does not conflict with its present interpretation thatthe Container Conventions themselves are violated only by
a tax assessed upon the importation of containers.Tennessee's sales tax is imposed upon the "transfer of title
or possession, or both, exchange, barter, lease or rental, con-ditional, or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever of tangible personal property for a consideration."Tenn. Code Ann. $ 67-6-102(23)(A) (Supp. 1992). It is a
sales tax of general application that does not discriminateagainst imported products either in its purpose or effect. Indeed, its assessment bears no relation to importation whatso-ever. The tax is not pre-empted by the 1972 or 1956 Container Convention. III

Itel next argues that the application of Tennessee's salestax to its container leases is pre-empted because it would
frustrate the federal objectives underlying the ContainerConventions and the laws and regulations granting favored
status to international containers, in particular 19 U. S. C.$ 1322 and 19 CFR $ 10.41a (1992). See Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941) (state law pre-empted when it"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution
of the full purposes and objectives of Congress"). The fed-eral regulatory scheme for cargo containers, it claims, parallels the regulatory scheme creating customs bonded ware-houses which we have found to pre-empt most state taxes on
warehoused goods. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Durham
County, 479 U. S. 130 (1986); Xerox Corp. v. County of Harris, 459 U. S. 145 (1982); McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corp.,supra.

Itel's reliance on these decisions is misplaced. In McGold-rick and its progeny, we stated that Congress created a system for bonded warehouses where imports could be storedfree of federal customs duties while under the continuous

Opinion of the Court
supervision of local customs officials "in order to encouragemerchants here and abroad to make use of American ports."

Xerox Corp., supra, at 151. By allowing importers to defertaxes on imported goods for a period of time and to escape
taxes altogether on reexported goods, the bonded warehouse
system "enabled the importer, without any threat of financialloss, to place his goods in domestic markets or to return them

to foreign commerce and, by this flexibility, encouraged im-porters to use American facilities."

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., supra, at 147. This federal objective would be frus-trated by the imposition of state sales and property taxes on

goods not destined for domestic distribution, regardless of
whether the taxes themselves discriminated against goods
based on their destination. Xerox Corp., supra, at 150-154.
See also R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., supra, at 144-147;
McGoldrick, supra, at 428-429.

In contrast, the federal regulatory scheme for containers
used in foreign commerce discloses no congressional intent
to exempt those containers from all or most domestic taxation. In Japan Line we said that the 1956 Container Convention acknowledged "[t]he desirability of uniform treatment of containers used exclusively in foreign commerce"
and "reflect[ed] a national policy to remove impediments to
the use of containers." 441 U. S., at 452-453. But we did
not hold that the Convention and the federal regulatory
scheme for cargo containers expressed a national policy to
exempt containers from all domestic taxation. Rather, we
relied on the federal laws, along with proof of an international customary norm of home port taxation and California's
creation of an asymmetry in international maritime taxation,
for our conclusion that California's ad valorem property tax
violated the Foreign Commerce Clause by impeding the Government's ability to " `spea[k] with one voice' " in conducting
our Nation's foreign affairs. Ibid.

Itel does not better its pre-emption argument by claiming
that the federal regulatory scheme for containers, like the

Opinion of the Court
customs bonded warehouse scheme, is so pervasive that itdemonstrates a federal purpose to occupy the field of container regulation and taxation. We doubt that the containerregulatory scheme can be considered as pervasive as the customs warehouse scheme. The latter provides for continualfederal supervision of warehouses, strict bonding requirements, and special taxing rules, see 19 U. S. C. $$ 1555 and1557; 19 CFR pt. 19 (1992), whereas the former is limited
more to the general certification and taxing of containers,see 19 U. S. C. $ 1322; 19 CFR $$ 10.41a and 115.25-115.43
(1992). Even if Itel were correct on this point, however, wehave not held that state taxation of goods in bonded warehouses is pre-empted by Congress' intent to occupy the fieldof bonded warehouse regulation. In fact, in R. J. Reynolds
we specifically held that the bonded warehouse statutes andregulations did not evidence such a purpose. 479 U. S., at
149. So, too, we cannot conclude that in adopting laws gov-erning the importation of containers Congress intended to
foreclose any and all concurrent state regulation or taxationof containers.

The precise federal policy regarding promotion of con-tainer use is satisfied by a proscription against taxes that
are imposed upon, or discriminate against, the importationof containers. We find that Tennessee's general sales tax,
which applies to domestic and foreign goods without differ-entiation, does not impede the federal objectives expressed
in the 1972 and 1956 Container Conventions and related fed-eral statutes and regulations.

A

Itel's third challenge to Tennessee's tax on container leasesis that the tax violates the Foreign Commerce Clause as interpreted by Japan Line. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Webegan our analysis in

Japan Line with a reformulation of theForeign Commerce Clause test:

507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT
72 ITEL CONTAINERS INT'L CORP. v. HUDDLESTON

Opinion of the Court
"In addition to answering the nexus, apportionment, andnondiscrimination questions posed in Complete Auto

[Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977)], a courtmust also inquire, first, whether the tax, notwithstanding apportionment, creates a substantial risk of interna-tional multiple taxation, and, second, whether the tax
prevents the Federal Government from `speaking withone voice when regulating commercial relations with
foreign governments.' " 441 U. S., at 451.
Without passing on the point, we assumed the Californiaproperty tax in question would have met the test of Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977). See441 U. S., at 451. Proceeding to the two foreign commerce
requirements we had identified, we found the California taxincompatible with both. We held that because Japan had
the established right, consistent with the custom of nations,see

id., at 447, to tax the property value of the containers infull, California's tax "produce[d] multiple taxation in fact,"

id., at 452. We held further that California's tax preventedthe United States from speaking with one voice in foreign
affairs, in that "[t]he risk of retaliation by Japan, under thesecircumstances, [was] acute, and such retaliation of necessity
would be felt by the Nation as a whole." Id., at 453.Four years later we again addressed whether a California
tax offended the Foreign Commerce Clause, this time in thecontext of a unitary business income tax.

Container Corp.of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159 (1983). Although recognizing that California's income tax shared someof the same characteristics as the property tax involved in
Japan Line, see 463 U. S., at 187, we nevertheless upheld itbased on two distinguishing characteristics.

First, the problem of double taxing in Container Corp.,"although real, [was] not the `inevitabl[e]' result of the
California [income] taxing scheme." Id., at 188 (quoting
Japan Line, supra, at 447). On the other hand, "[i]n JapanLine, we relied strongly on the fact that one taxing juris507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
diction claimed the right to tax a given value in full, andanother taxing jurisdiction claimed the right to tax the same

entity in part--a combination resulting necessarily in doubletaxation." 463 U. S., at 188. That the Japan Line Court
adopted a rule requiring States to forgo assessing propertytaxes against foreign-owned cargo containers "was by no
means unfair, because the rule did no more than reflect con-sistent international practice and express federal policy."
Container Corp., supra, at 190.Second, we noted that "in

[Container Corp.], unlike JapanLine, the Executive Branch ha[d] decided not to file an amicus curiae brief in opposition to the state tax." 463 U. S.,at 195. Together with our conclusion that the California income tax did not result in automatic double taxation, theGovernment's nonintervention suggested that the tax presented no serious threat to United States foreign policy.See

id., at 196. B

Before reconciling the holdings of Japan Line and Con-tainer Corp., we first address the Complete Auto test, a test
we assumed, arguendo, was satisfied by the tax in Japan Line.441 U. S., at 451. A state tax satisfies the Complete Auto
Domestic Commerce Clause test "when the tax is applied toan activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State,
is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against inter-state commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided
by the State." Complete Auto, supra, at 279. Because Itelaccepts the Supreme Court of Tennessee's conclusion that
"Tennessee's sales tax meets the four-fold requirements of
Complete Auto," 814 S. W. 2d, at 36, we need not retrace thatcourt's careful analysis. We do note, however, that Tennessee's compliance with the Complete Auto test has relevanceto our conclusion that the state tax meets those inquiries
unique to the Foreign Commerce Clause. That the tax is afair measure of the State's contacts with a given commercial transaction in all four aspects of the Complete Auto test

74 ITEL CONTAINERS INT'L CORP. v. HUDDLESTON

Opinion of the Court
confirms both the State's legitimate interest in taxing thetransaction and the absence of an attempt to interfere with

the free flow of commerce, be it foreign or domestic.

C
We proceed to evaluate the tax under Japan Line's twoForeign Commerce Clause factors. Left to decide whether

Tennessee's tax rests on the Japan Line or the Container
Corp. side of the scale, we have no doubt that the analysisand holding of

Container Corp. control.Itel asserts that Tennessee's law invites multiple taxation

of container leases because numerous foreign nations have asufficient taxing nexus with the leases to impose equivalent
taxes, and many nations in fact would do so were it not forthe Container Conventions' prohibitions. As an initial matter, of course, we have concluded that the Conventions donot prohibit Tennessee's sales tax or equivalent taxes imposed by other nations. To the extent Tennessee has in-vited others to tax cargo container leases, foreign sovereigns, in an exercise of their independent judgment, havechosen not to accept.

Furthermore, the Foreign Commerce Clause cannot beinterpreted to demand that a State refrain from taxing any
business transaction that is also potentially subject to taxa-tion by a foreign sovereign. "Japan Line does not require
forbearance so extreme or so one-sided." Container Corp.,supra, at 193. Tennessee has decided to tax a discrete
transaction occurring within the State. See Wardair Can-ada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1, 9 (1986).
And, according to its interpretation of its revenue code,which we accept, Tennessee credits against its own tax any
tax properly paid in another jurisdiction, foreign or domestic,on the same transaction. Tenn. Code Ann. $ 67-6-313(f)
(1989). By these measures, Tennessee's sales tax reduces,if not eliminates, the risk of multiple international taxation.
Absent a conflict with a "consistent international practice

Opinion of the Court
[or] . . . federal policy," Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 190, thecareful apportionment of a state tax on business transactions

conducted within state borders does not create the substan-tial risk of international multiple taxation that implicates
Foreign Commerce Clause concerns.

Itel further claims that if other States in this country fol-low Tennessee's lead and tax international container leases,

the United States will be unable to speak with one voice inforeign trade because international container leases will be
subject to various degrees of domestic taxation. As a conse-quence, Itel insists, container owners and users will be hit
by retaliatory foreign taxes. To the extent Itel is arguing
that the risk of double taxation violates the one voice test,
our response is the same as above: Tennessee's tax does not
create the substantial risk of international multiple taxation
that implicates Foreign Commerce Clause concerns.

To the extent Itel is arguing that taxes like Tennessee's
engender foreign policy problems, the United States disagrees. The Federal Government, in adopting various conventions, statutes, and regulations that restrict a State's
ability to tax international cargo containers in defined circumstances, has acted on the subject of taxing cargo containers and their use. It has chosen to eliminate state taxes
collected in connection with the importation of cargo containers. The state tax here does not fall within that proscription, and the most rational inference to be drawn is that this
tax, one quite distinct from the general class of import duties, is permitted. Unlike in Japan Line or Container Corp.,
moreover, the United States has filed an amicus brief defending Tennessee's law: "Far from conflicting with international custom, the Tennessee tax appears to promote it.
The Tennessee tax thus does not interfere with our ability
`to speak with one voice' on this issue involving foreign commerce." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.
This submission "is by no means dispositive." Container
Corp., 463 U. S., at 195-196. But given the strong indica507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tions from Congress that Tennessee's method of taxation isallowable, and with due regard for the fact that the nuances

of foreign policy "are much more the province of the Execu-tive Branch and Congress than of this Court," id., at 196, we
find no reason to disagree with the United States' submissionthat Tennessee's tax does not infringe the Government's ability to speak with one voice when regulating commercial rela-tions with other nations. "It would turn dormant Commerce Clause analysis entirely upside down to apply it wherethe Federal Government has acted, and to apply it in such a
way as to reverse the policy that the Federal Governmenthas elected to follow."

Wardair Canada, supra, at 12.

V
Itel's final avenue of attack on the Tennessee tax is that,as applied to international container leases, it violates the

Import-Export Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 2. Ourmodern Import-Export Clause test was first announced in
Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276, 285-286 (1976):

"The Framers of the Constitution . . . sought to allevi-ate three main concerns by committing sole power to lay

imposts and duties on imports in the Federal Govern-ment, with no concurrent state power: [1] the Federal
Government must speak with one voice when regulatingcommercial relations with foreign governments, and tariffs, which might affect foreign relations, could not beimplemented by the States consistently with that exclusive power; [2] import revenues were to be the majorsource of revenue of the Federal Government and should
not be diverted to the States; and [3] harmony amongthe States might be disturbed unless seaboard States,
with their crucial ports of entry, were prohibited fromlevying taxes on citizens of other States by taxing goods
merely flowing through their ports to the other Statesnot situated as favorably geographically."

77Cite as: 507 U. S. 60 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
The first and third components in this formulation mirrorinquiries we have already undertaken as part of our Foreign

Commerce Clause analysis. That is, the one voice componentof the

Michelin test is the same as the one voice component
of our Japan Line test. Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 449-450,
n. 14. And the state harmony component parallels the four
Complete Auto requirements of the Foreign and Domestic
Commerce Clause. Department of Revenue of Wash. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734, 754-755
(1978) ("The third Import-Export Clause policy . . . is vindi-cated if the tax falls upon a taxpayer with a reasonable nexus

to the State, is properly apportioned, does not discriminate,
and relates reasonably to services provided by the State").
Having concluded that the Tennessee tax survives Commerce Clause scrutiny, we must conclude the tax is consistent with the first and third component of our Michelin test.

This leaves only Michelin's second component: ensuring
that import revenues are not being diverted from the Federal Government. We need not provide a detailed explanation of what, if any, substantive limits this aspect of Michelin
places on state taxation of goods flowing through international channels, for the tax here is not a tax on importation
or imported goods, but a tax on a business transaction occurring within the taxing State. The tax does not draw revenue from the importation process and so does not divert import revenue from the Federal Government. For similar
reasons, we reject the argument that the tax violates the
prohibition on the direct taxation of imports and exports "in
transit," the rule we followed in Richfield Oil, 329 U. S., at
78-79, 84. Even assuming that rule has not been altered by
the approach we adopted in Michelin, it is inapplicable here.
Tennessee's sales tax is levied on leases transferring temporary possession of containers to third parties in Tennessee;
it is not levied on the containers themselves or on the goods
being imported in those containers. The tax thus does not
divert import revenue from the Federal Government because

at 757. See also Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511, 513-514 (1951).

VI
For the reasons we have stated, we hold that Tennessee'ssales tax, as applied to Itel's international container leases,

does not violate the Commerce, Import-Export or Suprem-acy Clause. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is affirmed. It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.
I join all of the Court's opinion except those sections dis-posing of the petitioner's "negative" Foreign Commerce
Clause and Import-Export Clause arguments (Parts IV andV, respectively). As to those sections, I concur only in the
judgment of the Court.I have previously recorded my view that the Commerce
Clause contains no "negative" component, no self-operativeprohibition upon the States' regulation of commerce. "The
historical record provides no grounds for reading the Com-merce Clause to be other than what it says--an authorization
for Congress to regulate commerce." Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S.232, 263 (1987) (

Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissentingin part); see also

American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,496 U. S. 167, 202-203 (1990) (

Scalia, J., concurring in judg-ment). On stare decisis grounds, however, I will enforce a

self-executing, "negative" Commerce Clause in two circum-stances: (1) against a state law that facially discriminates
against interstate commerce,1 and (2) against a state law that

is indistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by this Court.2 These acknowledgments of precedent serve the principal purposes of stare decisis, which are
to protect reliance interests and to foster stability in the law.
I do not believe, however, that either of those purposes is
significantly furthered by continuing to apply the vague and
open-ended tests that are the current content of our negative
Commerce Clause jurisprudence, such as the four-factor test
set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S.

274, 279 (1977), or the "balancing" approach of Pike v. Bruce
Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137 (1970). Unlike the prohibition on
rank discrimination against interstate commerce, which has
long and consistently appeared in the precedents of this
Court, see New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269,
273 (1988), those tests are merely the latest in a series of
doctrines that we have successively applied, and successively
discarded, over the years, to invalidate nondiscriminatory
state taxation and regulation--including, for example, the
"original package" doctrine, see Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S.
100 (1890), the "uniformity" test, see Case of the State
Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 279-280 (1873); cf. Cooley v. Board
of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Society for Relief
of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299, 319 (1852), the "directness"
test, see Hall v. DeCuir, 95 U. S. 485, 488-489 (1878), and
the "privilege of doing interstate business" rule, see Spector
Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602, 609 (1951).
Like almost all their predecessors, these latest tests are so
uncertain in their application (and in their anticipated lifeury, 498 U. S. 358, 387 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Amerada Hess Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, N. J. Dept. of Treasury,
490 U. S. 66, 80 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); American

J., dissenting).

span) that they can hardly be said to foster stability or toengender reliance deserving of

stare decisis protection.
I have not hitherto had occasion to consider an assertedapplication of the negative Commerce Clause to commerce

"with foreign Nations"--as opposed to commerce "among the
several States"--but the basic point that the CommerceClause is a power conferred upon Congress (and not a power

denied to the States) obviously applies to all portions of theClause. I assume that, for reasons of

stare decisis, I must
apply the same categorical prohibition against laws that fa-cially discriminate against foreign commerce as I do against

laws that facially discriminate against interstate commerce--though it may be that the rule is not as deeply
rooted in our precedents for the former field. I need not
reach that issue in the present case, since the Tennessee tax
is nothing more than a garden-variety state sales tax that
clearly does not discriminate against foreign commerce. As
with the Interstate Commerce Clause, however, stare decisis
cannot bind me to a completely indeterminate test such as
the "four-factored test plus two" found in Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 446-451 (1979), which
combines Complete Auto with two additional tests.

Japan Line, like Complete Auto and Pike, ultimately asks
courts to make policy judgments--essentially, whether nondiscriminatory state regulations of various sorts are "worth"
their effects upon interstate or foreign commerce. One element of Japan Line, however, the so-called "speak with one
voice" test, has a peculiar effect that underscores the inappropriateness of our engagement in this enterprise of applying a negative Commerce Clause. Applied literally, this test
would always be satisfied, since no state law can ever actually "prevent this Nation from `speaking with one voice' in
regulating foreign commerce," Japan Line, supra, at 451
(emphasis added), or "interfere with [the United States']
ability `to speak with one voice,' " Brief for United States as

ment can always explictly pre-empt the offending state law.What, then, does the "one voice" test mean? Today, the

Court relies on two considerations in determining that Ten-nessee's tax passes it: (1) that federal treaties, statutes and
regulations restrict a State's ability to tax containers in cer-tain defined circumstances, and the state tax here does not
fall within those proscriptions; and (2) that the Governmenthas filed an

amicus brief in support of the State. Ante, at75-76. The first of these considerations, however, does not

distinguish the ad valorem property tax invalidated in JapanLine, which would also not violate the Container Conventions or the relevant federal statutes and regulations as con-strued in today's opinion,

ante, at 65-66, 71. The secondconsideration does distinguish Japan Line, and it thus appears that a ruling on the constitutionality of a state lawultimately turns on the position of the Executive Branch.
Having appropriated a power of Congress for its own use,the Court now finds itself, at least in the area of foreign
commerce, incompetent to wield that power, and passes it off(out of "due regard" for foreign-policy expertise) to the President. Ante, at 76. I certainly agree that he is better ableto decide than we are which state regulatory interests should
currently be subordinated to our national interest in foreigncommerce. Under the Constitution, however, neither he nor
we were to make that decision, but only Congress.Petitioner's Import-Export Clause challenge is, for me, a
more difficult matter. It has firm basis in a constitutionaltext that cannot be avoided by showing that the tax on imports and exports is nondiscriminatory.3 See Richfield OilCorp. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 329 U. S. 69, 76 (1946).
To come within this constitutional exemption, however, thetaxed good must be either an import or an export "at the

time the tax accrued." Id., at 78. I do not think a good canbe an export when it will be used in this country, for its

designed purpose, before being shipped abroad. In Richfield, the Court held that California could not impose its nondiscriminatory sales tax on a shipment of oil that was being
exported to New Zealand. The tax accrued upon the deliv-ery of the oil to the purchaser, which was accomplished by

pumping the oil into the hold of the vessel that would trans-port it overseas. The

Richfield Court noted not only that
no portion of the oil was "used or consumed in the UnitedStates,"

id., at 71, but also that "there was nothing equivocal
in the transaction which created even a probability that theoil would be diverted to domestic use,"

id., at 83. With respect to the containers at issue in the present case, by contrast, it was entirely certain that after the time at which the
tax accrued (viz., upon delivery of the empty containers to
the lessee) they would be used in this country, to be loaded
with goods for export. See Brief for Petitioner 7 ("[E]ach
[leased] container initially was used to export American
goods to foreign ports"). It could not be said, when the
tax attached, that "the process of [their] exportation ha[d]
started." Richfield, supra, at 82. Because I find that the
containers at issue were not protected by the Import-Export
Clause, I need not consider whether the Tennessee tax would
satisfy the test set forth in Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages,
423 U. S. 276 (1976).

For the reasons stated, I concur in the Court's conclusion
that Tennessee's tax is not unconstitutional under the Foreign Commerce Clause or the Import-Export Clause.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
It is established "that a treaty should generally be `construe[d] . . . liberally to give effect to the purpose which
animates it' and that `[e]ven where a provision of a treaty

enlarging, rights which may be claimed under it, the more

liberal interpretation is to be preferred.' " United States v.
Stuart, 489 U. S. 353, 368 (1989), quoting Bacardi Corp. of
America v. Domenech, 311 U. S. 150, 163 (1940); see also
Nielsen v. Johnson, 279 U. S. 47, 51-52 (1929). This Court
recognized in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles,
441 U. S. 434 (1979), that the Container Conventions reflecta "national policy to remove impediments to the use of containers as `instruments of international traffic.' " Id., at 453,quoting 19 U. S. C. $ 1322(a); see Customs Convention on
Containers, Dec. 2, 1972, [1975] 988 U. N. T. S. 43 (hereinafter1972 Convention); Customs Convention on Containers, May
18, 1956, [1969] 20 U. S. T. 301, T. I. A. S. No. 6634 (hereinafter 1956 Convention). Tennessee's tax clearly frustrates
that policy.

In concluding that Tennessee's tax is not prohibited, the
majority studiously ignores the realities of container leasing.
All petitioner's containers are dedicated to international
commerce, which means that they spend no more than three
months at a time in any one jurisdiction. See 1972 Convention, Art. 4; 1956 Convention, Art. 3. Furthermore, transferring containers to new lessees is an integral part of any
container-leasing operation. A major advantage of leasing
rather than owning a container is that a shipper may return
the container to the lessor at or near the shipment destination without having to provide for the return transport of
the container. J. Tan, Containers: The Lease-Buy Decision
13 (London, International Cargo Handling Co-ordination Association, 1983). The lessor then transfers the container to
another shipper who needs to carry goods from that location
or transports the container to another location where it is
needed. Leased containers like those of petitioner are constantly crossing national boundaries and are constantly being
transferred to new lessees at the ends of their journeys.
Whether Tennessee taxes the act of importation or the act
of transfer makes little difference with respect to leased containers. Each kind of tax imposes substantial "impediments

to . . . the practical construction adopted by the parties' ").
Neither Tennessee nor the United States as amicus curiae
can point to any other jurisdiction that directly taxes the
lease of containers used in international commerce. Under
the European Value Added Tax (VAT) system, as the majority acknowledges, ante, at 66, no direct tax is imposed on the
value of international container leases.

In an attempt to make international practice fit its reading
of the Conventions, the majority mistakenly equates the European VAT on goods with Tennessee's tax on containers.
See ante, at 66-67. The European VAT is analogous to an
American sales tax but is imposed on the value added to
goods at each stage of production or distribution rather than
on their sale price. See Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept.
of Treasury, 498 U. S. 358, 365-366, n. 3 (1991). The act of
transporting goods to their place of sale adds to their value
and the cost of transportation is reflected in their price. An
American sales tax reaches the cost of transportation as part
of the sale price of goods. The European VAT taxes the cost
of transportation as part of the value added to goods during
their distribution. Tennessee's analogue to the European
VAT is its sales tax on goods imported by container, not its
direct tax on the proceeds of container leases. Petitioner
does not argue that Tennessee must refrain from imposing a
sales tax on goods imported by container. It argues, in507us1$31L 11-26-96 16:44:35 PAGES OPINPGT

stead, that like every other party to the Conventions, Ten-nessee may not impose a direct tax on containers themselves.

Even if Tennessee's tax did not violate the Container Con-ventions, it would violate the Foreign Commerce Clause by
preventing the United States from "speaking with one voice"
with respect to the taxation of containers used in interna-tional commerce. See

Japan Line, 441 U. S, at 452; Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159,193 (1983). This Court noted in

Japan Line that the Conventions show "[t]he desirability of uniform treatment of con-tainers used exclusively in foreign commerce." 441 U. S., at

452. Tennessee's tax frustrates that uniformity.

The Court correctly notes that the Solicitor General's decision to file an amicus brief defending the tax " `is by no
means dispositive.' " Ante, at 75, quoting Container Corp.,
463 U. S., at 195-196. Indeed, such a submission, consistent
with the separation of powers, may not be given any weight
beyond its power to persuade. The constitutional power
over foreign affairs is shared by Congress and the President,
see, e. g., U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 11 (Congress shall have
the power to declare war); Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2 (President shall
have the power, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, to make treaties); and Art. II, $ 3 (President shall
receive ambassadors), but the power to regulate commerce
with foreign nations is textually delegated to Congress alone,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. "It is well established that Congress may
authorize States to engage in regulation that the Commerce
Clause would otherwise forbid," Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S.
131, 138 (1986) (emphasis added), but the President may not
authorize such regulation by the filing of an amicus brief.

While the majority properly looks to see whether Congress intended to permit a tax like Tennessee's, it mistakenly
infers permission for the tax from Congress' supposed failure
to prohibit it. Ante, at 75-76. "[T]his Court has exempted
state statutes from the implied limitations of the [Commerce]
Clause only when the congressional direction to do so has

ramifications beyond the Nation's borders." Id., at 92, n. 7.Not only does the majority invert this analysis by finding
congressional authorization for the tax in congressional si-lence, but it finds silence only by imposing its own narrow
reading on the Conventions.The majority invites States that are constantly in need of
new revenue to impose new taxes on containers. The result,I fear, will be a patchwork of state taxes that will burden
international commerce and frustrate the purposes of theContainer Conventions. I respectfully dissent.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 91-1300. Argued December 2, 1992--Decided February 23, 1993
At respondent's federal trial for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the Government's case in chief consisted of five witnesses who took part in, or
observed, her cocaine trafficking. As the sole witness in her own defense, respondent denied the witnesses' inculpatory statements and
claimed she had never possessed or distributed cocaine. In rebuttal,
the Government called an additional witness and recalled one of its earlier witnesses, both of whom testified that respondent sold crack cocaine
to them. Respondent was convicted and sentenced pursuant to the
United States Sentencing Guidelines. Finding that she had committed
perjury, the District Court enhanced her sentence, which is required
under $ 3C1.1 of the Guidelines when a "defendant willfully impeded or
obstructed, or attempted to impede or obstruct the administration of
justice during the investigation or prosecution of the instant offense."
In reversing the sentence, the Court of Appeals found that a $ 3C1.1
enhancement based on a defendant's alleged perjury would be unconstitutional. It also distinguished the precedent of United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41--in which this Court upheld a sentence increase stemming from an accused's false testimony at trial--on the grounds that

$ 3C1.1's goal is punishment for obstruction of justice rather than rehabilitation, and that, in contravention of the admonition in Grayson,

$ 3C1.1 is applied in a wooden or reflex fashion to enhance the sentences
of all defendants whose testimony is deemed false.

Held: Upon a proper determination that the accused has committed perjury at trial, a court may enhance the accused's sentence under

$ 3C1.1. Pp. 92-98.

(a) The parties agree, and the commentary to $ 3C1.1 is explicit, that
the phrase "impede or obstruct the administration of justice" includes
perjury. Perjury is committed when a witness testifying under oath or
affirmation gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the
willful intent to provide false testimony. Because a defendant can testify at trial and be convicted, yet not have committed perjury--for example, the accused may give inaccurate testimony as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory or give truthful testimony that a jury
finds insufficient to excuse criminal liability or prove lack of intent--
not every testifying defendant who is convicted qualifies for a $ 3C1.1

507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT
88 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGAN

Opinion of the Court
enhancement. If a defendant objects to such an enhancement resulting
from her trial testimony, a district court must review the evidence and
make independent findings necessary to establish that the defendant
committed perjury. While a court should address each element of the
alleged perjury in a clear and distinct finding, its enhancement decision
is sufficient where, as here, it makes a determination of an obstruction
or impediment of justice that encompasses all of the factual predicates
for a perjury finding. Pp. 92-96.

(b) An enhanced sentence for the willful presentation of false testimony does not undermine the right to testify. The concern that a court
will enhance a sentence as a matter of course whenever the accused
takes the stand and is found guilty is dispelled by the requirement that
a district court make findings to support all the elements of a perjury
violation in a specific case. Any risk from a district court's incorrect
perjury findings is inherent in a system which insists on the value of
testimony under oath. A $ 3C1.1 enhancement is also more than a mere
surrogate for a separate and subsequent perjury prosecution. It furthers legitimate sentencing goals relating to the principal crime, including retribution and incapacitation. The enhancement may not serve the
additional goal of rehabilitation, which was the justification for enhancement in Grayson, but rehabilitation is not the only permissible justification for increasing a sentence based on perjury. Finally, the enhancement under $ 3C1.1 is far from automatic--when contested, the elements
of perjury must be found by the district court with specificity--and the
fact that the enhancement stems from a congressional mandate rather
than from a court's discretionary judgment cannot be grounds for its
invalidation. Pp. 96-98.

(Nov. 1989), if the court finds the defendant committed perjury at trial. We answer in the affirmative.

I
Respondent, Sharon Dunnigan, was charged in a single
count indictment with conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846. After entering a plea of not
guilty, she stood trial.

The case in chief for the United States consisted of five
witnesses who took part in, or observed, respondent's cocaine trafficking during the summer of 1988. The first witness was Freddie Harris, a cocaine dealer in Charleston,
West Virginia. Harris testified that respondent traveled between Charleston and Cleveland, Ohio, numerous times during the summer in question to purchase cocaine for him. He
further stated that either he or his associate John Dean accompanied respondent on several of these trips. Dean was
the second witness, and he recounted his trips to Cleveland
with respondent during the same period to purchase cocaine.
He also described meetings with both respondent and Harris
for the purpose of delivering cocaine.

Three more Government witnesses followed. Andre
Charlton testified that respondent, at her own apartment,
delivered several ounces of cocaine to Charlton and Harris.
Charlton also attested to receiving cocaine from Dean which
Dean said he and respondent had bought in Cleveland.
Tammy Moore testified next. She described conversations
during which respondent vouched for the high quality of the
cocaine in Cleveland and suggested Moore accompany her on
a trip to Cleveland. Then came the testimony of Wynema
Brown, who repeated respondent's admissions of trips to
Cleveland to purchase cocaine for Harris. Brown also
stated she saw cocaine powder at respondent's apartment
and witnessed respondent and her daughter convert the

Opinion of the Court
powder into crack cocaine for the daughter to sell. Thisended the Government's case in chief.

Respondent elected to take the stand and was the solewitness in her own defense. She denied all criminal acts
attributed to her. She admitted going to Cleveland with
Harris once but claimed it was for an innocent purpose, notto buy or sell cocaine. She admitted knowing John Dean but

denied traveling with him to Cleveland. Last, she deniedknowing that cocaine was brought into or sold from her
apartment. On cross-examination, the Government ques-tioned respondent regarding the testimony of the five prosecution witnesses. Respondent denied their inculpatory
statements and said she had not possessed or distributed cocaine during the summer in question or at any other time.
The Government also asked whether Edward Dickerson had
been in her apartment or bought crack cocaine from her.
Respondent answered no.

The defense rested, and the Government began its rebuttal with the testimony of Dickerson. He testified to purchasing crack cocaine from respondent on July 12, 1988, in a
transaction monitored by law enforcement authorities. The
Government also recalled Moore, who claimed respondent
sold her crack cocaine about five times and provided cocaine
powder to her and respondent's daughter to convert into
crack cocaine for resale. According to Moore, the money
from the resale was paid over to respondent. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.

Respondent was sentenced pursuant to the United States
Sentencing Guidelines. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1989). Her base offense
level was set at 22, and the Government requested that the
base be increased by two offense levels under USSG $ 3C1.1,
entitled "willfully obstructing or impeding proceedings," because respondent perjured herself at trial. After arguments from both sides, the District Court ruled on the
request:

91Cite as: 507 U. S. 87 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
"The court finds that the defendant was untruthful attrial with respect to material matters in this case. The

defendant denied her involvement when it is clear fromthe evidence in the case as the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that she was involved in the conspiracyalleged in the indictment, and by virtue of her failure to
give truthful testimony on material matters that weredesigned to substantially affect the outcome of the case,
the court concludes that the false testimony at trial war-rants an upward adjustment by two levels." App. 29.

Based upon the enhanced offense level 24 and a criminal his-tory category I, the District Court sentenced respondent to
51 months' incarceration, which was at the low end of theGuidelines range.

Respondent appealed her sentence, and the Court of Ap-peals reversed the District Court's decision to increase respondent's offense level under USSG $ 3C1.1. 944 F. 2d 178(CA4 1991). The Court of Appeals did not take issue with
the District Court's factual findings or rule that further find-ings were necessary to support a $ 3C1.1 enhancement. Instead, the court held that a $ 3C1.1 enhancement based on adefendant's alleged perjury at trial would be unconstitutional. The court reasoned that "every defendant who takesthe stand and is convicted [would] be given the obstruction
of justice enhancement." Id., at 183. Citing some of theincentives for an accused to elect not to testify, including the
risk of impeachment by prior convictions, the court ruledthat a mechanical sentencing enhancement for testifying was
unconstitutional: "With an automatic $ 3C1.1 enhancementadded to the ante, the defendant may not think testifying
worth the risk." Id., at 184.Referring to United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41 (1978),
where we upheld a sentence increase based on an accused'sfalse testimony at trial, the Court of Appeals found that
precedent distinguishable on two grounds. First, in Gray-son we justified the sentence increase as based on the

92 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGAN

Opinion of the Court
District Court's assessment of the defendant's greater needfor rehabilitation.

Id., at 51-53. The Court of Appeals
thought this justification was inapplicable, viewing the$ 3C1.1 enhancement as a punishment for obstructing justice

without the time and expense of a separate perjury prosecution. 944 F. 2d, at 184. Second, the Grayson Court cau-tioned that "[n]othing we say today requires a sentencing

judge to enhance, in some wooden or reflex fashion, the sen-tences of all defendants whose testimony is deemed false."
438 U. S., at 55. According to the Court of Appeals, "[t]heguidelines supply precisely the `wooden or reflex' enhancement disclaimed by the Court," 944 F. 2d, at 184, and thisrigidity "makes the $ 3C1.1 enhancement for a disbelieved
denial of guilt under oath an intolerable burden upon the
defendant's right to testify in his own behalf," id., at 185.Over a dissent by four of its judges, the Court of Appeals

declined to rehear the case en banc. 950 F. 2d 149 (CA41991). We granted certiorari. 504 U. S. 940 (1992).

Sentencing Guideline $ 3C1.1 states in full: "If the defendant willfully impeded or obstructed, or attempted to impedeor obstruct the administration of justice during the investigation or prosecution of the instant offense, increase the[defendant's] offense level by 2 levels." USSG $ 3C1.1 (Nov.
1989). See also USSG $ 3C1.1 (Nov. 1992). Both partiesassume the phrase "impede or obstruct the administration
of justice" includes perjury, and the commentary to $ 3C1.1
is explicit in so providing. In pertinent part, the commen-tary states:

"This section provides a sentence enhancement for a

or deceive authorities or those involved in a judicial proceeding, or otherwise to willfully interfere with the dis507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT

position of criminal charges, in respect to the instantoffense.

. . . . .
"1. The following conduct, while not exclusive, may pro-vide a basis for applying this adjustment:

. . . . .
"(c) testifying untruthfully or suborning untruthful tes-timony concerning a material fact, . . . during a preliminary or grand jury proceeding, trial, sentencing proceed-ing, or any other judicial proceeding." USSG $ 3C1.1,
comment., n. 1(c) (Nov. 1989).
See also USSG $ 3C1.1, comment., n. 3(b) (Nov. 1992) ("Thefollowing is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of

conduct to which this enhancement applies: . . . (b) commit-ting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury").

Were we to have the question before us without referenceto this commentary, we would have to acknowledge that
some of our precedents do not interpret perjury to constitutean obstruction of justice unless the perjury is part of some
greater design to interfere with judicial proceedings. In re
Michael, 326 U. S. 224, 228 (1945); Ex parte Hudgings, 249U. S. 378, 383 (1919). Those cases arose in the context of

interpreting early versions of the federal criminal contemptstatute, which defined contempt, in part, as "misbehavior of
any person . . . as to obstruct the administration of justice."28 U. S. C. $ 385 (1940 ed.) (Judicial Code $ 268), derived from
the Act of Mar. 2, 1831, Rev. Stat. $ 725. See also 18 U. S. C.$ 401(1) (same).

In Hudgings and Michael, we indicated that the ordinarytask of trial courts is to sift true from false testimony, so
the problem caused by simple perjury was not so much anobstruction of justice as an expected part of its administration. See Michael, 326 U. S., at 227-228. Those cases,however, were decided against the background rule that the
contempt power was to be confined to " `the least possiblepower adequate' " to protect "the administration of justice

Opinion of the Court
against immediate interruption of its business." Id., at 227(quoting

Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231 (1821)). In
the present context, on the other hand, the enhancement pro-vision is part of a sentencing scheme designed to determine

the appropriate type and extent of punishment after the
issue of guilt has been resolved. The commission of perjuryis of obvious relevance in this regard, because it reflects on

a defendant's criminal history, on her willingness to acceptthe commands of the law and the authority of the court, and
on her character in general. Even on the assumption thatwe could construe a sentencing guideline in a manner inconsistent with its accompanying commentary, the fact that the
meaning ascribed to the phrase "obstruction of justice" differs in the contempt and sentencing contexts would not be a
reason for rejecting the Sentencing Commission's interpretation of that phrase. In all events, the Commission's interpretation is contested by neither party to this case.

In determining what constitutes perjury, we rely upon the
definition that has gained general acceptance and common
understanding under the federal criminal perjury statute, 18
U. S. C. $ 1621. A witness testifying under oath or affirmation violates this statute if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false
testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or
faulty memory. See $ 1621(1); United States v. Debrow, 346
U. S. 374, 376 (1953); United States v. Norris, 300 U. S. 564,
574, 576 (1937). This federal definition of perjury by a witness has remained unchanged in its material respects for
over a century. See United States v. Smull, 236 U. S. 405,
408, and n. 1 (1915) (tracing history of $ 1621's predecessor,
Act of Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, $ 125, 35 Stat. 1111). It parallels
typical state-law definitions of perjury, see American Law
Institute, Model Penal Code $ 241.1 (1985); 4 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law $ 601 (14th ed. 1981), and has roots in the
law dating back to at least the Perjury Statute of 1563, 5
Eliz. I, ch. 9, see Gordon, The Invention of a Common Law

Crime: Perjury and the Elizabethan Courts, 24 Am. J. Legal
Hist. 145 (1980). See also 1 Colonial Laws of New York,
1664-1719, ch. 8, pp. 129-130 (reprinting "An Act to prevent
wilfull Perjury," enacted Nov. 1, 1683).

Of course, not every accused who testifies at trial and is
convicted will incur an enhanced sentence under $ 3C1.1 for
committing perjury. As we have just observed, an accused
may give inaccurate testimony due to confusion, mistake, or
faulty memory. In other instances, an accused may testify
to matters such as lack of capacity, insanity, duress, or selfdefense. Her testimony may be truthful, but the jury may
nonetheless find the testimony insufficient to excuse criminal
liability or prove lack of intent. For these reasons, if a defendant objects to a sentence enhancement resulting from
her trial testimony, a district court must review the evidence
and make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to, or obstruction of, justice, or an attempt
to do the same, under the perjury definition we have set
out. See USSG $ 6A1.3 (Nov. 1989); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
32(c)(3)(D). See also Burns v. United States, 501 U. S. 129,
134 (1991). When doing so, it is preferable for a district
court to address each element of the alleged perjury in a
separate and clear finding. The district court's determination that enhancement is required is sufficient, however, if,
as was the case here, the court makes a finding of an obstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all of the
factual predicates for a finding of perjury. See App. 29
("The court finds that the defendant was untruthful at trial
with respect to material matters in this case. [B]y virtue
of her failure to give truthful testimony on material matters
that were designed to substantially affect the outcome of the
case, the court concludes that the false testimony at trial
warrants an upward adjustment by two levels" (emphasis
added)). Given the numerous witnesses who contradicted

Opinion of the Court
have been mistaken, there is ample support for the DistrictCourt's finding.

B
We turn next to the contention that an enhanced sentencefor the willful presentation of false testimony undermines

the right to testify. The right to testify on one's own behalfin a criminal proceeding is made explicit by federal statute,
18 U. S. C. $ 3481, and, we have said, it is also a right implicitin the Constitution, see

Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 51-53(1987);
Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 164 (1986).Respondent cannot contend that increasing her sentence

because of her perjury interferes with her right to testify,for we have held on a number of occasions that a defendant's
right to testify does not include a right to commit perjury.Id., at 173; United States v. Havens, 446 U. S. 620, 626 (1980);
Grayson, 438 U. S., at 54. Nor can respondent contend$ 3C1.1 is unconstitutional on the simple basis that it distorts
her decision whether to testify or remain silent. Our au-thorities do not impose a categorical ban on every governmental action affecting the strategic decisions of an accused,including decisions whether or not to exercise constitutional
rights. See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 365(1978);

McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183, 216-217(1971);
United States v. Knox, 396 U. S. 77, 82-83 (1969).No doubt to avoid these difficulties, respondent's argument

comes to us in a different form. It is that $ 3C1.1 carries arisk that a district court will order enhancement even when
a defendant's testimony is truthful, either because the courtacts without regard to the truth or makes an erroneous finding of falsity. That $ 3C1.1 creates such a risk, respondentclaims, makes the enhancement unconstitutional. This argument does not survive scrutiny.The concern that courts will enhance sentences as a matter
of course whenever the accused takes the stand and is foundguilty is dispelled by our earlier explanation that if an accused challenges a sentence increase based on perjured testi507US1$32z 11-18-96 18:45:39 PAGES OPINPGT

97Cite as: 507 U. S. 87 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
mony, the trial court must make findings to support all theelements of a perjury violation in the specific case. And as

to the risk of incorrect findings of perjury by district courts,that risk is inherent in a system which insists on the value
of testimony under oath. To uphold the integrity of our trial
system, we have said that the constitutionality of perjurystatutes is unquestioned.

Grayson, supra, at 54. See also
Nix, supra, at 173-174; Havens, supra, at 626-627. Therequirement of sworn testimony, backed by punishment

for perjury, is as much a protection for the accused asit is a threat. All testimony, from third-party witnesses and
the accused, has greater value because of the witness' oath
and the obligations or penalties attendant to it. Cf. G. Neilson, Trial By Combat 5 (1891) ("A means of ensuring the
truth in human testimony has been a thing desired in every
age").

Neither can we accept respondent's argument that the

$ 3C1.1 sentence enhancement advances only "the impermissible sentencing practice of incarcerating for the purpose of
saving the Government the burden of bringing a separate
and subsequent perjury prosecution." Grayson, supra, at
53. A sentence enhancement based on perjury does deter
false testimony in much the same way as a separate prosecution for perjury. But the enhancement is more than a mere
surrogate for a perjury prosecution. It furthers legitimate
sentencing goals relating to the principal crime, including
the goals of retribution and incapacitation. See 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(a)(2); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367
(1989). It is rational for a sentencing authority to conclude
that a defendant who commits a crime and then perjures
herself in an unlawful attempt to avoid responsibility is more
threatening to society and less deserving of leniency than a
defendant who does not so defy the trial process. The perjuring defendant's willingness to frustrate judicial proceedings to avoid criminal liability suggests that the need for
incapacitation and retribution is heightened as compared

98 UNITED STATES v. DUNNIGAN

Opinion of the Court
with the defendant charged with the same crime who allowsjudicial proceedings to progress without resorting to perjury.

Weighed against these considerations, the argumentsmade by the Court of Appeals to distinguish Grayson are
wide of the mark. The court is correct that rehabilitation isno longer a goal of sentencing under the Guidelines. 28
U. S. C. $ 994(k); Mistretta, supra, at 367. Our lengthy dis-cussion in

Grayson of how a defendant's perjury was rele-vant to the potential for rehabilitation, however, was not

meant to imply that rehabilitation was the only permissiblejustification for an increased sentence based on perjury. As
we have said, the $ 3C1.1 enhancement serves other legiti-mate sentencing goals. Neither does our cautionary remark
that the enhancement in Grayson need not be imposed "insome wooden or reflex fashion" compel invalidation of

$ 3C1.1, as the Court of Appeals believed. When contested,the elements of perjury must be found by the district court
with the specificity we have stated, so the enhancement isfar from automatic. And that the enhancement stems from
a congressional mandate rather than from a court's discre-tionary judgment cannot be grounds, in these circumstances,
for its invalidation. See Chapman v. United States, 500U. S. 453, 467 (1991); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.
79, 92 (1986).Upon a proper determination that the accused has committed perjury at trial, an enhancement of sentence is re-quired by the Sentencing Guidelines. That requirement is
consistent with our precedents and is not in contravention ofthe privilege of an accused to testify in her own behalf. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

NEGONSOTT v. SAMUELS, WARDEN, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 91-5397. Argued January 11, 1993--Decided February 24, 1993
Petitioner Negonsott, a member of the Kickapoo Tribe and a resident of the

Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas, was convicted by a County District
Court jury of aggravated battery for shooting another Indian on the
reservation. The court set aside the conviction on the ground that the
Federal Government had exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute Negonsott
for the shooting under the Indian Major Crimes Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1153,
which encompasses 13 enumerated felonies committed by "[a]ny Indian . . .
against the person or property of another Indian or other person . . . within
the Indian country." However, the State Supreme Court reinstated the
conviction, holding that the Kansas Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 3243, conferred on
Kansas jurisdiction to prosecute all crimes committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations in the State. Subsequently, the Federal
District Court dismissed Negonsott's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The Kansas Act explicitly confers jurisdiction on Kansas over all

offenses involving Indians on Indian reservations. Congress has plenary authority to alter the otherwise exclusive nature of federal jurisdiction under $ 1153. Standing alone, the Kansas Act's first sentence--
which confers jurisdiction on Kansas over "offenses committed by or
against Indians on Indian reservations . . . to the same extent as its
courts have jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the
State in accordance with the laws of the State"--is an unambiguous
grant of jurisdiction over both major and minor offenses. And the most
logical meaning of the Act's second sentence--which provides that nothing in the Act shall "deprive" federal courts of their "jurisdiction over
offenses defined by the laws of the United States"--is that federal
courts shall retain their jurisdiction to try all offenses subject to federal
jurisdiction, while Kansas courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons
for the same conduct when it violates state law. This is the only reading of the Kansas Act that gives effect to every clause and word of the
statute, and it is supported by the Act's legislative history. In contrast,
if this Court were to accept Negonsott's argument that the second sentence renders federal jurisdiction exclusive whenever the underlying
conduct is punishable under federal law, Kansas would be left with jurisdiction over only those minor offenses committed by one Indian against

the person or property of another, a result that can hardly be reconciled
with the first sentence's unqualified grant of jurisdiction. There is no
need to resort to the canon of statutory construction that ambiguities
should be resolved in favor of Indians, since the Kansas Act quite unambiguously confers jurisdiction on the State. Pp. 102-110.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.#
The question presented in this case is whether the KansasAct, 18 U. S. C. $ 3243, confers jurisdiction on the State of
Kansas to prosecute petitioner, a Kickapoo Indian, for thestate-law offense of aggravated battery committed against
another Indian on an Indian reservation. We hold that itdoes.

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioner, Emery L. Negonsott, is a member of the Kick-apoo Tribe and a resident of the Kickapoo Reservation in

Brown County, Kansas. In March 1985, he was arrested bythe county sheriff in connection with the shooting of another
Indian on the Kickapoo Reservation. After a jury trial inthe Brown County District Court, petitioner was found
guilty of aggravated battery. Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 21-3414(1988). The District Court set the conviction aside, however, on the ground that the Federal Government had exclu-sive jurisdiction to prosecute petitioner for the shooting
under the Indian Major Crimes Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1153. TheKansas Supreme Court reinstated petitioner's conviction,
holding that the Kansas Act conferred jurisdiction on Kansasto prosecute "all crimes committed by or against Indians on
Indian reservations located in Kansas." State v. Nioce, 239Kan. 127, 131, 716 P. 2d 585, 588 (1986). On remand, the
Brown County District Court sentenced petitioner to impris-onment for a term of 3 to 10 years.

Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpusunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, reasserting his claim that Kansas
lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him for aggravated battery.The District Court dismissed his petition, 696 F. Supp. 561
(Kan. 1988), and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuitaffirmed, 933 F. 2d 818 (1991). The Court of Appeals found
the language of the Kansas Act ambiguous as to "whetherCongress intended to grant Kansas courts concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts over the crimes enumerated inthe [Indian] Major Crimes Act, or whether by the second
sentence of the Kansas Act Congress intended to retain exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts over those specificcrimes."

Id., at 820-821. After examining the Act's legislative history, however, the Court of Appeals resolved thisambiguity in favor of the first construction, and held that

Kansas had jurisdiction to prosecute petitioner for aggra507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT

Criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed in "Indian
country," 18 U. S. C. $ 1151, "is governed by a complex patchwork of federal, state, and tribal law." Duro v. Reina, 495
U. S. 676, 680, n. 1 (1990). The Indian Country Crimes Act,
18 U. S. C. $ 1152, extends the general criminal laws of federal maritime and enclave jurisdiction to Indian country, except for those "offenses committed by one Indian against the
person or property of another Indian." See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 288 (1982 ed.). These latter
offenses typically are subject to the jurisdiction of the concerned Indian tribe, unless they are among those enumerated in the Indian Major Crimes Act. Originally enacted in
1885, the Indian Major Crimes Act establishes federal jurisdiction over 13 enumerated felonies committed by "[a]ny Indian . . . against the person or property of another Indian or
other person . . . within the Indian country." $ 1153(a).2 As

F. 2d 74 (CA8 1977). In Youngbear, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that the State of Iowa lacked jurisdiction to prosecute the Indian defendant under a similarly worded statute
conferring jurisdiction on Iowa over offenses committed by or against Indians on certain Indian reservations within the State, see Act of June 30,
1948, ch. 759, 62 Stat. 1161, for conduct punishable as an offense enumerated in the Indian Major Crimes Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1153.

2 The Indian Major Crimes Act provides in full:

"(a) Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another
Indian or other person any of the following offenses, namely, murder, manslaughter, kidnaping, maiming, a felony under chapter 109A, incest, assault
with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault
resulting in serious bodily injury, arson, burglary, robbery, and a felony
under section 661 of this title within the Indian country, shall be subject

the text of $ 1153, see n. 2, supra, and our prior cases makeclear, federal jurisdiction over the offenses covered by the

Indian Major Crimes Act is "exclusive" of state jurisdiction.See United States v. John, 437 U. S. 634, 651 (1978); Seymour
v. Superintendent of Washington State Penitentiary, 368U. S. 351, 359 (1962);

United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375,384 (1886).

Congress has plenary authority to alter these jurisdic-tional guideposts, see Washington v. Confederated Bands
and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 470-471 (1979),which it has exercised from time to time. This case concerns the first major grant of jurisdiction to a State overoffenses involving Indians committed in Indian country, the
Kansas Act, which provides in full:

"Jurisdiction is conferred on the State of Kansas overoffenses committed by or against Indians on Indian

reservations, including trust or restricted allotments,within the State of Kansas, to the same extent as its
courts have jurisdiction over offenses committed else-where within the State in accordance with the laws of
the State."This section shall not deprive the courts of the
United States of jurisdiction over offenses defined bythe laws of the United States committed by or against
Indians on Indian reservations." Act of June 8, 1940,ch. 276, 54 Stat. 249 (codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 3243).

Passed in 1940, the Kansas Act was followed in short orderby virtually identical statutes granting to North Dakota and
Iowa, respectively, jurisdiction to prosecute offenses comto the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the
above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.

"(b) Any offense referred to in subsection (a) of this section that is not
defined and punished by Federal law in force within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States shall be defined and punished in accordance with
the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force
at the time of such offense." 18 U. S. C. $ 1153.

Stat. 229; Act of June 30, 1948, ch. 759, 62 Stat. 1161.Kansas asserted jurisdiction to prosecute petitioner for aggravated battery under the Kansas Act. Petitioner chal-lenges the State's jurisdiction in this regard. He contends
that Congress added the second sentence of the Kansas Actto preserve the "exclusive" character of federal jurisdiction
over the offenses enumerated in the Indian Major CrimesAct, and since the conduct resulting in his conviction for aggravated battery is punishable as at least two offenses listedin the Indian Major Crimes Act,

3 Kansas lacked jurisdiction

to prosecute him in connection with the shooting incident.According to petitioner, the Kansas Act was intended to confer jurisdiction on Kansas only over misdemeanor offensesinvolving Indians on Indian reservations. To construe the
statute otherwise, petitioner asserts, would effect an "im-plied repeal" of the Indian Major Crimes Act. Moreover,
petitioner continues, the construction adopted by the Courtof Appeals below is at odds with the legislative history of
the Kansas Act as well as the canon that statutes are to beliberally construed in favor of Indians.

A
"Our task is to give effect to the will of Congress, andwhere its will has been expressed in reasonably plain terms,

that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive."

3 The Indian Major Crimes Act does not explicitly refer to the offense
of aggravated battery, but it lists "assault with a dangerous weapon" and
"assault resulting in serious bodily injury." 18 U. S. C. $ 1153(a). These
offenses are defined at 18 U. S. C. $$ 113(c) and (f). We assume, for the
sake of deciding this case, that the state-law offense for which petitioner
was convicted, Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 21-3414 (1988), is comparable to one or
both of these federal offenses.

Opinion of the Court
Act itself. The first sentence confers jurisdiction on "Kan-sas over offenses committed by or against Indians on Indian

reservations . . . to the same extent as its courts have juris-diction over offenses committed elsewhere within the State
in accordance with the laws of the State." $ 3243. Standing alone, this sentence unambiguously confers jurisdictionon Kansas to prosecute all offenses--major and minor--committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations in ac-cordance with state law. Petitioner does not assert otherwise. Instead, he rests his case on the second sentence ofthe Kansas Act, which states that nothing in the Act shall
"deprive" federal courts of their "jurisdiction over offenses
defined by the laws of the United States." Ibid. But the
most logical meaning of this proviso, we believe, is that federal courts shall retain their jurisdiction to try all offenses
subject to federal jurisdiction under 18 U. S. C. $$ 1152 and
1153, while Kansas courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons for the same conduct when it violates state law.

This interpretation is quite consistent with the first sentence's conferral of jurisdiction on Kansas over all offenses
committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations in
accordance with state law. The Court of Appeals referred
to this state of affairs in terms of Kansas courts having "concurrent jurisdiction" with federal courts over the offenses
enumerated in the Indian Major Crimes Act. See 933 F. 2d,
at 820-821. But the Kansas Act does not confer jurisdiction
on Kansas to prosecute individuals for the federal offenses
listed in the Indian Major Crimes Act; it confers jurisdiction
to prosecute individuals in accordance with state law for conduct that is also punishable under federal law pursuant to the
Indian Major Crimes Act. Strictly speaking, then, federal
courts retain their exclusive jurisdiction to try individuals
for offenses covered by the Indian Major Crimes Act, and in
this sense, the Kansas Act in fact confers only concurrent
"legislative" jurisdiction on the State to define and prosecute
similar offenses.

106 NEGONSOTT v. SAMUELS

Opinion of the Court
Our reading of the Kansas Act is the only one that giveseffect "to every clause and word of [the] statute." Moskal

v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 109-110 (1990) (internal quo-tation marks omitted). Petitioner's construction of the Act's
second sentence renders federal jurisdiction exclusive when-ever the underlying conduct is punishable under federal law
pursuant to either 18 U. S. C. $$ 1152 or 1153. Kansas is left,then, with jurisdiction over only those minor offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of an-other. This result can hardly be reconciled with the first
sentence's unqualified grant of jurisdiction to Kansas to pros-ecute all state-law offenses committed by or against Indians
on Indian reservations. Moreover, contrary to the assertionof petitioner, our construction of the Kansas Act does not
work an "implied repeal" of the Indian Major Crimes Act.As we have noted, federal courts retain their exclusive jurisdiction to try individuals for major federal crimes committedby or against Indians in Indian country. In any event, to
the extent that the Kansas Act altered the jurisdictionallandscape, the alteration is not merely by implication: The
Act explicitly conferred jurisdiction on Kansas over all of-fenses involving Indians on Indian reservations.

B
Although we think resort to secondary materials is unnec-essary to decide this case, the legislative history of the Kansas Act supports our construction. Both the House and Sen-ate Reports accompanying the Act consist almost entirely of
a letter and memorandum from Acting Secretary of the Inte-rior, E. K. Burlew, to the Chairmen of the House and Senate
Indian Affairs Committees, which provide a background ac-count of the forces leading to the enactment of the Kansas
Act. See H. R. Rep. No. 1999, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. (1940)(hereinafter H. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 1523, 76th Cong., 3d
Sess. (1940) (hereinafter S. Rep.). According to Acting Sec-retary Burlew, in practice, Kansas had exercised jurisdiction
over all offenses committed on Indian reservations involving

Opinion of the Court
Indians, "even where the criminal act charged constitutedone of the major offenses listed in [the Indian Major Crimes

Act]," because such offenses were otherwise left unenforcedby the concerned tribes (who were without tribal courts).
H. R. Rep., at 4; S. Rep., at 3. The Indian tribes of Kansasdid not object to this scheme, but welcomed it. When the
authority of the Kansas courts to entertain such prosecutionswas called into question, the tribes "expressed a wish that
the jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the State courts becontinued." H. R. Rep., at 4; S. Rep., at 4. Thus, the Kansas Act was designed to "merely confirm a relationship whichthe State has willingly assumed, which the Indians have
willingly accepted, and which has produced successful re-sults, over a considerable period of years." H. R. Rep., at
5; S. Rep., at 5.4Since Kansas had exercised jurisdiction over offenses covered by the Indian Major Crimes Act, and the Kansas Actwas enacted to ratify the existing scheme of

de facto statejurisdiction over all offenses committed on Indian reservations, it follows that Congress did not intend to retain exclu-sive federal jurisdiction over the prosecution of major
crimes. In view of the experimental nature of the KansasAct, Congress simply intended to retain jurisdiction over

4 Amici Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska et al. allege that at least
one tribe, the Potawatomi Indian Tribe, opposed the Kansas Act. Brief
for Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska et al. as Amici Curiae 17. According to amici, the Tribe sent a telegram to the Chairman of the House
Committee on Indian Affairs, Representative W. Rogers, voicing its opposition to the Act, which was followed by an exchange of several letters.
See id., at 17-18. This correspondence is not contained in the reprinted
legislative history of the Act, but instead rests in the National Archives.
Although one of Chairman Rogers' letters to the Tribe states: " `Your letters are being filed with the House Committee on Indian Affairs,' " id., at
17 (quoting letter of May 10, 1939), we have no way of knowing to what
extent, if at all, the Tribe's opposition to the Kansas Act was brought to
the attention of other Members of Congress. Therefore, we regard the
background account set forth in the House and Senate Reports as conclusive for purposes of discerning Congress' understanding of the forces leading to the introduction of the bill which became the Kansas Act.

Opinion of the Court
offenses already subject to federal jurisdiction under 18
U. S. C. $$ 1152 and 1153 in the event that the Kansas Act
did not solve the identified enforcement problem (i. e., in case
the State declined to exercise its jurisdiction). This explanation squares with Acting Secretary Burlew's conclusion
that, although the Kansas Act's "proposed relinquishment of
jurisdiction to the State of Kansas appropriately extends to
those offenses which are provided for in existing Federal
statutes as well as those which are not," "[t]he prosecution
in the Federal courts of those offenses which are now open
to such prosecution will not be precluded under the bill in
any particular instance where this course may be deemed
advisable." H. R. Rep., at 5; S. Rep., at 4.

Petitioner argues that Congress' amendments to the original version of the bill which became the Kansas Act confirm
that it did not intend to confer jurisdiction on Kansas over
conduct covered by the Indian Major Crimes Act. As originally drafted, the bill provided "[t]hat concurrent jurisdiction is hereby relinquished to the State of Kansas to prosecute Indians and others for offenses by or against Indians
or others, committed on Indian reservations in Kansas," and
explicitly stated that the Indian Major Crimes Act as well
as other statutes granting federal jurisdiction over offenses
committed in Indian country "are modified accordingly." 86
Cong. Rec. 5596 (1940). Congress eventually deleted the
original bill's reference to "concurrent jurisdiction" as well
as its reference to the effect of the bill on the Indian Major
Crimes Act. Rather than supporting petitioner's construction of the Kansas Act, however, we think these amendments
are in accord with our reading of the statute.

The amendments to the original bill were proposed by Acting Secretary Burlew in his letter and memorandum to the
committee chairmen in order to reflect more accurately the
"legal situation as it now exists or as intended to be created."
H. R. Rep., at 3; S. Rep., at 2. He explained:

507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT

109Cite as: 507 U. S. 99 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
"The bill proposes to relinquish concurrent jurisdiction
to the State of Kansas, intending thereby to give the
State jurisdiction of all types of crimes, whether major
or minor, defined by State law. However, the Federal
Government has exercised jurisdiction only over major
crimes. Therefore, strictly speaking, this is not a case
of relinquishing to a State a jurisdiction concurrent with
that of the United States, but a case of conferring upon
the State complete criminal jurisdiction, retaining, however, jurisdiction in the Federal courts to prosecute
crimes by or against Indians defined by Federal law."
Ibid.

Thus, the original bill was amended to make clear that the
statute conferred jurisdiction on Kansas over more offenses
than were subject to federal jurisdiction under existing
federal law, and not, as petitioner suggests, to narrow the
category of offenses subject to prosecution in state court
to minor offenses excluded from federal jurisdiction under
18 U. S. C. $ 1152.

There is no explanation in the legislative history why Congress deleted the original bill's reference to the effect of the
statute on the Indian Major Crimes Act and adopted the general language of the second sentence of $ 3243 in its place.
But we think it is likely that Congress simply thought it
preferable to refer generally to the fact that the Act did not
"deprive" federal courts of their jurisdiction over offenses
defined by federal law, rather than to list the specific statutes
pursuant to which the Federal Government had exercised
jurisdiction to prosecute offenses committed by or against
Indians in Indian country. In any event, to the extent one
may draw a negative inference from Congress' decision to
delete the specific reference to the effect of the Kansas Act
on the Indian Major Crimes Act, we think this is too slender
a reed upon which to rest departure from the clear import
of the text of the Kansas Act.

110 NEGONSOTT v. SAMUELS

Opinion of the Court

C
Finally, we find petitioner's resort to general principles ofIndian law unavailing. Petitioner cites our opinion in

Bryanv. Itasca County, 426 U. S. 373 (1976), for the proposition that

"laws must be liberally construed to favor Indians." Brieffor Petitioner 11. What we actually said in Bryan, was that
" `statutes passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes. . . are to be liberally construed, doubtful expressions being
resolved in favor of the Indians.' " 426 U. S., at 392 (quoting
Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U. S. 78, 89(1918)). Petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals' construction of the Kansas Act harms Indians by eliminatingthe historically exclusive stewardship of the Federal Government over major crimes committed by Indians in Indiancountry, and subjecting Indians to the possibility of dual
prosecution by state and federal authorities.It is not entirely clear to us that the Kansas Act is a statute "passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes." Butif it does fall into that category, it seems likely that Congress
thought that the Act's conferral of criminal jurisdiction onthe State would be a "benefit" to the tribes in question. We
see no reason to equate "benefit of dependent Indian tribes,"as that language is used in Bryan, with "benefit of accused
Indian criminals," without regard to the interests of the vic-tims of these crimes or of the tribe itself. But in any event,
for the reasons previously discussed, we think that the Kan-sas Act quite unambiguously confers jurisdiction on the
State over major offenses committed by or against Indianson Indian reservations, and we therefore have no occasion to
resort to this canon of statutory construction. See South
Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe, Inc., 476 U. S. 498, 506(1986).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. A PARCEL OF LAND, BUILDINGS, APPURTENANCES, AND IMPROVEMENTS,KNOWN AS 92 BUENA VISTA AVENUE,

RUMSON, NEW JERSEY, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 91-781. Argued October 13, 1992--Decided February 24, 1993
The Government filed an in rem action against the parcel of land on which

respondent's home is located, alleging that she had purchased the property with funds given her by Joseph Brenna that were "the proceeds
traceable" to illegal drug trafficking, and that the property was therefore subject to seizure and forfeiture under the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6). The
District Court ruled, among other things, that respondent, who claims
that she had no knowledge of the origins of the funds used to buy her
house, could not invoke the "innocent owner" defense in $ 881(a)(6),
which provides that "no property shall be forfeited . . . , to the extent
of the interest of an owner, by reason of any act . . . established by that
owner to have been committed . . . without the knowledge or consent of
that owner." The Court of Appeals remanded on interlocutory appeal,
rejecting the District Court's reasoning that the innocent owner defense
may be invoked only by persons who are bona fide purchasers for value
and by those who acquired their property interests before the acts giving rise to the forfeiture took place.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
937 F. 2d 98, affirmed.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Blackmun, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Souter, concluded that an owner's lack of knowledge
of the fact that her home had been purchased with the proceeds of illegal
drug transactions constitutes a defense to a forfeiture proceeding under
the statute. Pp. 118-131.

(a) The task of construing the statute must be approached with caution. Although customs, piracy, and revenue laws have long provided
for the official seizure and forfeiture of tangible property used in the
commission of criminal activity, the statute marked an important expansion of governmental power by authorizing the forfeiture of proceeds
from the sale of illegal goods and by creating an express and novel
protection for innocent owners. Pp. 118-123.

Syllabus
(b) The statute's use of the unqualified term "owner" in three places
is sufficiently unambiguous to foreclose any contention that the protection afforded to innocent owners is limited to bona fide purchasers.
That the funds respondent used to purchase her home were a gift does
not, therefore, disqualify her from claiming that she is such an owner.
P. 123.

(c) Contrary to the Government's contention, the statute did not vest
ownership in the United States at the moment when the proceeds of the
illegal drug transaction were used to pay the purchase price of the property at issue, thereby preventing respondent from ever becoming an
"owner." Neither of the "relation back" doctrines relied on by the Government--the doctrine embodied in $ 881(h), which provides that "[a]ll
right, title and interest in property described in subsection (a) . . . shall
vest in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise to
forfeiture under this section," or the common-law doctrine, under which
a forfeiture decree effectively vests title to the offending res in the Government as of the date of the offending conduct--makes the Government an owner of property before forfeiture has been decreed. Assuming that the common-law doctrine applies, it is clear that the fictional
and retroactive vesting of title thereunder is not self-executing, but occurs only when the Government wins a judgment of forfeiture. Until
then, someone else owns the property and may invoke any available
defense, including the assertion that she is an innocent owner. A reading of $ 881(h) demonstrates that it did not dispense with, but merely
codified, the common-law doctrine and leads to the same result. The
legislative history reveals that $ 881(h) applies only to property that is
subject to civil forfeiture under $ 881(a). Although proceeds traceable
to illegal drug transactions are, in $ 881(h)'s words, "property described
in subsection" (a)(6), the latter subsection exempts from civil forfeiture
proceeds owned by one unaware of their criminal source and therefore
must allow an assertion of the innocent owner defense before $ 881(h)
applies. Pp. 123-129.

(d) This Court need not resolve, inter alia, the parties' dispute as to
the point at which guilty knowledge of the tainted character of property
will deprive a party of an innocent owner defense, because respondent
has assumed the burden of convincing the trier of fact that she had
no knowledge of the alleged source of Brenna's gift when she received
it. Pp. 129-131.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded:
1. While it is true that $ 881(a)(6)'s "innocent owner" exception produces the same result as would an "innocent owner" exception to traditional common-law forfeiture (with its relation-back principle), that conclusion cannot be based upon the plurality's implausible reading of the

Syllabus
phrase "property described in subsection (a)." Rather, the result
reached in this case is correct because $ 881(h) is best read as an expression of the traditional relation-back doctrine, which is a doctrine of retroactive vesting of title that takes effect only upon entry of the judicial
order of forfeiture or condemnation. Under the alternative reading--
that $ 881(h) provides for immediate, undecreed, secret vesting of title
in the United States at the time of the illegal transaction--either the
plain language of $ 881(a)(6)'s innocent-owner provision must be slighted
or the provision must be deprived of all effect. Additionally, the traditional relation-back principle is the only interpretation of $ 881(h) that
makes sense within the structure of the applicable customs forfeiture
procedures, under which the Government does not gain title until there
is a forfeiture decree, and provides the only explanation for the textual
distinction between $ 881(a)(6)'s innocent "owner" and $ 853's innocent
"transferee" provisions. Pp. 131-138.

2. There is no proper basis for the plurality's conclusion that respondent has assumed the burden of proving that she had no knowledge of
the alleged source of Brenna's gift when she received it, as opposed to
when the illegal acts giving rise to forfeiture occurred. The issue of
what is the relevant time for purposes of determining lack of knowledge
is not fairly included in the question on which the Court granted certiorari, and the Court need not resolve it. Pp. 138-139.

114 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LAND

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Justice Stevens announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion, in which Justice Blackmun,
Justice O'Connor, and Justice Souter join.

The question presented is whether an owner's lack of
knowledge of the fact that her home had been purchased
with the proceeds of illegal drug transactions constitutes a
defense to a forfeiture proceeding under the Comprehensive
Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, $ 511(a), 84
Stat. 1276, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6).1

I
On April 3, 1989, the Government filed an in rem action
against the parcel of land in Rumson, New Jersey, on which
respondent's home is located. The verified complaint alleged that the property had been purchased in 1982 by respondent with funds provided by Joseph Brenna that were
"the proceeds traceable to an [unlawful] exchange for a
controlled substance," App. 13, and that the property was
therefore subject to seizure and forfeiture under $ 881(a)(6),
id., at 15.2

1 The statute provides:
"The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and
no property right shall exist in them:. . . . .

"(6) All moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of
value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for
a controlled substance in violation of [21 U. S. C. $$ 801-904], all proceeds
traceable to such an exchange, and all moneys, negotiable instruments,
and securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation of
this subchapter, except that no property shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of any act or
omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted
without the knowledge or consent of that owner."

2 See n. 1, supra. The complaint also alleged that the property had

been used in 1986 to facilitate the distribution of proceeds of an illegal

115Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
On April 12, 1989, in an ex parte proceeding, the DistrictCourt determined that there was probable cause to believe

the premises were subject to forfeiture, and issued a sum-mons and warrant for arrest authorizing the United States
marshal to take possession of the premises. Respondent
thereafter asserted a claim to the property, was granted the
right to defend the action,3 and filed a motion for summary
judgment.

During pretrial proceedings, the following facts were established. In 1982, Joseph Brenna gave respondent approximately $240,000 to purchase the home that she and her three
children have occupied ever since. Respondent is the sole
owner of the property. From 1981 until their separation in
1987, she maintained an intimate personal relationship with
Brenna. There is probable cause to believe that the funds
used to buy the house were proceeds of illegal drug trafficking, but respondent swears that she had no knowledge of
its origins.

drug transaction, and was therefore subject to forfeiture pursuant to

$ 881(a)(7), which provides:

"The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and
no property right shall exist in them:. . . . .

"(7) All real property, including any right, title, and interest (including
any leasehold interest) in the whole of any lot or tract of land and any
appurtenances or improvements, which is used, or intended to be used, in
any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year's imprisonment,
except that no property shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to the
extent of an interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without the
knowledge or consent of that owner."

No issue concerning the Government's claim under subparagraph (7) is
presented before us.

3 The United States Marshals Service entered into an agreement with

respondent that allows her to remain in possession of the property pending the outcome of the litigation.

116 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LAND

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Among the grounds advanced in support of her motion forsummary judgment was the claim that she was an innocent

owner under $ 881(a)(6). The District Court rejected thisdefense for two reasons: First, it ruled that "the innocent
owner defense may only be invoked by those who can demon-strate that they are bona fide

purchasers for value" (empha-sis in original);
4 second, the court read the statute to offer

the innocent owner defense only to persons who acquired aninterest in the property before the acts giving rise to the

forfeiture took place.5Respondent was allowed to take an interlocutory appeal
pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b). One of the controllingquestions of law presented to the Court of Appeals was:

"Whether an innocent owner defense may be assertedby a person who is not a bona fide purchaser for value
concerning a parcel of land where the government hasestablished probable cause to believe that the parcel of
land was purchased with monies traceable to drug pro-ceeds." 742 F. Supp. 189, 192 (NJ 1990).

Answering that question in the affirmative, the Court ofAppeals remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether respondent was, in fact, an innocent owner.

4 "I find that the claimant cannot successfully invoke the `innocent
owner' defense here, because she admits that she received the proceeds to
purchase the premises as a gift from Mr. Brenna. More particularly, I
find that where, as here, the government has demonstrated probable cause
to believe that property is traceable to proceeds from drug transactions,
the innocent owner defense may only be invoked by those who can demonstrate that they are bona fide purchasers for value." 738 F. Supp. 854,
860 (NJ 1990).

5 "In particular, the `innocent owner defense' at issue provides that `no

property shall be forfeited . . . to the extent of the interest of an owner,
by reason of any act or omission . . . committed or omitted without the
knowledge or consent of that owner.' 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6) (emphasis
supplied). This language implies that the acts or omissions giving rise to
forfeiture must be committed after the third party acquires a legitimate
ownership interest in the property." Ibid. (emphasis in original).

117Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
The Court of Appeals refused to limit the innocent owner
defense to bona fide purchasers for value because the plain
language of the statute contains no such limitation,6 because
it read the legislative history as indicating that the term
"owner" should be broadly construed,7 and because the difference between the text of $ 881(a)(6) and the text of the
criminal forfeiture statute evidenced congressional intent
not to restrict the civil section in the same way.8

The Court of Appeals also rejected the argument that respondent could not be an innocent owner unless she acquired
the property before the drug transaction occurred. In advancing that argument the Government had relied on the
"relation back" doctrine embodied in $ 881(h), which provides
that "[a]ll right, title, and interest in property described in
subsection (a) of this section shall vest in the United States
upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under
this section." The court held that the relation back doctrine
applied only to "property described in subsection (a)" and
that the property at issue would not fit that description if
respondent could establish her innocent owner defense.
The court concluded that the Government's interpretation of

$ 881(h) "would essentially serve to emasculate the innocent
owner defense provided for in section 881(a)(6). No one ob6 "Despite the appeal of this analysis, the plain language of the innocent
owner provision speaks only in terms of an `owner' and in no way limits
the term `owner' to a bona fide purchaser for value." 937 F. 2d 98, 101
(CA3 1991).

7 "Furthermore, in United States v. Parcel of Real Property Known as

6109 Grubb Road, 886 F. 2d 618 (3d Cir. 1989), we determined, after reviewing the legislative history of section 881(a)(6), that `the term "owner"
should be broadly interpreted to include any person with a recognizable
legal or equitable interest in the property seized.' Id. at 625 n. 4 (quoting
1978 U. S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 9522-23)." Id., at 101-102.

8 "Moreover, as the district court pointed out, the criminal forfeiture

statute, section 853, is explicitly limited to bona fide purchasers for value,
while in section 881 Congress omitted such limiting language. We believe
that such a difference was intended by Congress." Ibid.

taining property after the occurrence of the drug transaction--including a bona fide purchase for value--would be
eligible to offer an innocent owner defense on his behalf."
937 F. 2d 98, 102 (CA3 1991).

The conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeals
and decisions of the Fourth and Tenth Circuits, see In re One
1985 Nissan, 889 F. 2d 1317 (CA4 1989); Eggleston v. Colorado, 873 F. 2d 242, 245-248 (CA10 1989), led us to grant

Laws providing for the official seizure and forfeiture of
tangible property used in criminal activity have played an
important role in the history of our country. Colonial courts
regularly exercised jurisdiction to enforce English and local
statutes authorizing the seizure of ships and goods used in
violation of customs and revenue laws.9 Indeed, the misuse

9 "Long before the adoption of the Constitution the common law courts
in the Colonies--and later in the states during the period of Confederation--were exercising jurisdiction in rem in the enforcement of forfeiture
statutes. Like the Exchequer, in cases of seizure on navigable waters
they exercised a jurisdiction concurrently with the courts of admiralty.
But the vice-admiralty courts in the Colonies did not begin to function
with any real continuity until about 1700 or shortly afterward. See Andrews, Vice-Admiralty Courts in the Colonies, in Records of the ViceAdmiralty Court of Rhode Island, 1617-1752 (ed. Towle, 1936), p. 1; Andrews, The Colonial Period of American History, vol. 4, ch. 8; Harper, The
English Navigation Laws, ch. 15; Osgood, the American Colonies in the
18th Century, vol. 1, pp. 185-222, 299-303. By that time, the jurisdiction
of common law courts to condemn ships and cargoes for violation of the
Navigation Acts had been firmly established, apparently without question,
and was regularly exercised throughout the colonies. In general the suits
were brought against the vessel or article to be condemned, were tried by
jury, closely followed the procedure in Exchequer, and if successful resulted in judgments of forfeiture or condemnation with a provision for

The First Congress enacted legislation authorizing theseizure and forfeiture of ships and cargos involved in customs offenses.11 Other statutes authorized the seizure of

10 Writing for the Court in Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S. 476, 481-482

(1965), Justice Stewart explained: "Vivid in the memory of the newly independent Americans were those general warrants known as writs of assistance under which officers of the Crown had so bedeviled the colonists.
The hated writs of assistance had given customs officials blanket authority
to search where they pleased for goods imported in violation of the British
tax laws. They were denounced by James Otis as `the worst instrument
of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English law book,'
because they placed `the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty
officer.' The historic occasion of that denunciation, in 1761 at Boston, has
been characterized as `perhaps the most prominent event which inaugurated the resistance of the colonies to the oppressions of the mother country. "Then and there," said John Adams, "then and there was the first
scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain.
Then and there the child Independence was born." ' Boyd v. United
States, 116 U. S. 616, 625."

13 "The next question is, whether the innocence of the owners can withdraw the ship from the penalty of confiscation under the act of Congress.
Here, again, it may be remarked that the act makes no exception whatsoever, whether the aggression be with or without the co-operation of the
owners. The vessel which commits the aggression is treated as the offender, as the guilty instrument or thing to which the forfeiture attaches,
without any reference whatsoever to the character or conduct of the
owner. The vessel or boat (says the act of Congress) from which such
piratical aggression, &c., shall have been first attempted or made shall be

Later statutes involved the seizure and forfeiture of dis-tilleries and other property used to defraud the United

States of tax revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages.See,

e. g., United States v. Stowell, 133 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1890).
In these cases, as in the piracy cases, the innocence of the
owner of premises leased to a distiller would not defeat a
decree of condemnation based on the fraudulent conduct of
the lessee.14

condemned. Nor is there any thing new in a provision of this sort. It is
not an uncommon course in the admiralty, acting under the law of nations,
to treat the vessel in which or by which, or by the master or crew thereof,
a wrong or offense has been done as the offender, without any regard
whatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the owner
thereof. And this is done from the necessity of the case, as the only adequate means of suppressing the offence or wrong, or insuring an indemnity
to the injured party. The doctrine also is familiarly applied to cases of
smuggling and other misconduct under our revenue laws; and has been
applied to other kindred cases, such as cases arising on embargo and nonintercourse acts. In short, the acts of the master and crew, in cases of
this sort, bind the interest of the owner of the ship, whether he be innocent
or guilty; and he impliedly submits to whatever the law denounces as a
forfeiture attached to the ship by reason of their unlawful or wanton
wrongs." Harmony v. United States, 2 How. 210, 233-234 (1844).

14 "Beyond controversy, the title of the premises and property was in

the claimant; and it is equally certain that he leased the same to the lessee
for the purposes of a distillery, and with the knowledge that the lessee
intended to use the premises to carry on that business, and that he did
use the same for that purpose.

"Fraud is not imputed to the owner of the premises; but the evidence
and the verdict of the jury warrant the conclusion that the frauds charged
in the information were satisfactorily proved, from which it follows that
the decree of condemnation is correct, if it be true, as heretofore explained,
that it was the property and not the claimant that was put to trial under
the pleadings; and we are also of the opinion that the theory adopted by
the court below, that, if the lessee of the premises and the operator of the
distillery committed the alleged frauds, the government was entitled to a
verdict, even though the jury were of the opinion that the claimant was
ignorant of the fraudulent acts or omissions of the distiller." Dobbins's
Distillery v. United States, 96 U. S. 395, 403-404 (1878).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In all of these early cases the Government's right to takepossession of property stemmed from the misuse of the property itself. Indeed, until our decision in Warden, Md. Peni-tentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 (1967), the Government had
power to seize only property that " `the private citizen wasnot permitted to possess.' "

15 The holding in that case that

the Fourth Amendment did not prohibit the seizure of "mereevidence" marked an important expansion of governmental

power. See Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U. S. 547, 577-580 (1978) (

Stevens, J., dissenting).The decision by Congress in 1978 to amend the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84Stat. 1236, to authorize the seizure and forfeiture of proceeds
of illegal drug transactions, see 92 Stat. 3777, also marked animportant expansion of governmental power.

16 Before that

amendment, the statute had authorized forfeiture of only the

15 "Thus stolen property--the fruits of crime--was always subject to
seizure. And the power to search for stolen property was gradually extended to cover `any property which the private citizen was not permitted
to possess,' which included instrumentalities of crime (because of the early
notion that items used in crime were forfeited to the State) and contraband. Kaplan, Search and Seizure: A No-Man's Land in the Criminal
Law, 49 Calif. L. Rev. 474, 475. No separate governmental interest in
seizing evidence to apprehend and convict criminals was recognized; it
was required that some property interest be asserted. The remedial
structure also reflected these dual premises. Trespass, replevin, and the
other means of redress for persons aggrieved by searches and seizures,
depended upon proof of a superior property interest. And since a lawful
seizure presupposed a superior claim, it was inconceivable that a person
could recover property lawfully seized." Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S.,
at 303-304.

16 A precedent for this expansion had been established in 1970 by the

Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), see 18
U. S. C. $ 1963(a). Even RICO, however, did not specifically provide for
the forfeiture of "proceeds" until 1984, when Congress added $ 1963(a)(3)
to resolve any doubt whether it intended the statute to reach so far. See
S. Rep. No. 98-225, pp. 191-200 (1983); Russello v. United States, 464 U. S.

illegal substances themselves and the instruments by whichthey were manufactured and distributed.

17 The original forfeiture provisions of the 1970 statute had closely paralleledthe early statutes used to enforce the customs laws, the piracy laws, and the revenue laws: They generally authorizedthe forfeiture of property used in the commission of criminal
activity, and they contained no innocent owner defense.They applied to stolen goods, but they did not apply to proceeds from the sale of stolen goods. Because the statute,after its 1978 amendment, does authorize the forfeiture of
such proceeds and also contains an express and novel protec17 Section 511(a) of the 1970 Act, 84 Stat. 1276, provided:

tion for innocent owners, we approach the task of construingit with caution.

III
The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the protec-tion afforded to innocent owners is not limited to bona fide

purchasers. The text of the statute is the strongest supportfor this conclusion. The statute authorizes the forfeiture of
moneys exchanged for a controlled substance, and "all pro-ceeds traceable to such an exchange," with one unequivocal
exception:

"[N]o property shall be forfeited under this paragraph,to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of

any act or omission established by that owner to havebeen committed or omitted without the knowledge or
consent of that owner." 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6).
The term "owner" is used three times and each time it isunqualified. Such language is sufficiently unambiguous to

foreclose any contention that it applies only to bona fide pur-chasers. Presumably that explains why the Government
does not now challenge this aspect of the Court of Appeals'ruling.

That the funds respondent used to purchase her homewere a gift does not, therefore, disqualify respondent from
claiming that she is an owner who had no knowledge of thealleged fact that those funds were "proceeds traceable" to
illegal sales of controlled substances. Under the terms ofthe statute, her status would be precisely the same if, instead
of having received a gift of $240,000 from Brenna, she hadsold him a house for that price and used the proceeds to buy
the property at issue. IV

Although the Government does not challenge our interpre-tation of the statutory term "owner," it insists that respondent is not the "owner" of a house she bought in 1982 and haslived in ever since. Indeed, it contends that she never has

Opinion of Stevens, J.
been the owner of this parcel of land because the statute
vested ownership in the United States at the moment when
the proceeds of an illegal drug transaction were used to pay
the purchase price. In support of its position, the Government relies on both the text of the 1984 amendment to the
statute and the common-law relation back doctrine. We
conclude, however, that neither the amendment nor the
common-law rule makes the Government an owner of property before forfeiture has been decreed.

In analyzing the Government's relation back argument, it
is important to remember that respondent invokes the innocent owner defense against a claim that proceeds traceable
to an illegal transaction are forfeitable. The Government
contends that the money that Brenna received in exchange
for narcotics became Government property at the moment
Brenna received it and that respondent's house became Government property when that tainted money was used in its
purchase. Because neither the money nor the house could
have constituted forfeitable proceeds until after an illegal
transaction occurred, the Government's submission would
effectively eliminate the innocent owner defense in almost
every imaginable case in which proceeds could be forfeited.
It seems unlikely that Congress would create a meaningless
defense. Moreover, considering that a logical application of
the Government's submission would result in the forfeiture
of property innocently acquired by persons who had been
paid with illegal proceeds for providing goods or services to
drug traffickers,18 the burden of persuading us that Congress
intended such an inequitable result is especially heavy.

18 At oral argument the Government suggested that a narrow interpretation of the word "proceeds" would "probably" prevent this absurdity.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. The Government's brief, however, took the unequivocal position that the statute withholds the innocent owner defense
from anyone who acquires proceeds after the illegal transaction took place.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The Government recognizes that the 1984 amendment didnot go into effect until two years after respondent acquired

the property at issue in this case. It therefore relies heavilyon the common-law relation back doctrine applied to in rem
forfeitures. That doctrine applied the fiction that propertyused in violation of law was itself the wrongdoer that must
be held to account for the harms it had caused.19 Becausethe property, or "res," was treated as the wrongdoer, it was
appropriate to regard it as the actual party to the in remforfeiture proceeding. Under the relation back doctrine, a
decree of forfeiture had the effect of vesting title to the of-fending res in the Government as of the date of its offending
conduct. Because we are not aware of any common-lawprecedent for treating proceeds traceable to an unlawful exchange as a fictional wrongdoer subject to forfeiture, it is notentirely clear that the common-law relation back doctrine is
applicable. Assuming that the doctrine does apply, how-ever, it is nevertheless clear that under the common-law rule
the fictional and retroactive vesting was not self-executing.Chief Justice Marshall explained that forfeiture does not
automatically vest title to property in the Government:

"It has been proved, that in all forfeitures accruing atcommon law, nothing vests in the government until some

legal step shall be taken for the assertion of its right,after which, for many purposes, the doctrine of relation
carries back the title to the commission of the offence."United States v. Grundy, 3 Cranch 337, 350-351 (1806).

20 In his dissent, Justice Kennedy advocates the adoption of a new

common-law rule that would avoid the need to construe the terms of the
statute that created the Government's right to forfeit proceeds of drug
transactions. Under his suggested self-executing rule, patterned after an
amalgam of the law of trusts and the law of secured transactions, the
Government would be treated as the owner of a secured or beneficial interest in forfeitable proceeds even before a decree of forfeiture is entered.
The various authorities that he cites support the proposition that if such

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The same rule applied when a statute (a statute that con-tained no specific relation back provision) authorized the

forfeiture. In a passage to which the Government has re-ferred us,

21 we stated our understanding of how the Government's title to forfeited property relates back to the momentof forfeitability:

"By the settled doctrine of this court, whenever astatute enacts that upon the commission of a certain act
specific property used in or connected with that act shallbe forfeited, the forfeiture takes effect immediately
upon the commission of the act; the right to the propertythen vests in the United States,

although their title isnot perfected until judicial condemnation; the forfeiture constitutes a statutory transfer of the right to theUnited States at the time the offence is committed; and

an interest exists, it may be extinguished by a sale to a bona fide purchaser; they provide no support for the assumption that such an interest
springs into existence independently. As a matter of common law, his
proposal is inconsistent with Chief Justice Marshall's statement that
"nothing vests in the government until some legal step shall be taken,"
and with the cases cited by Justice Scalia, post, at 132. As a matter of
statutory law, it is improper to rely on $ 881(a) as the source of the Government's interest in proceeds without also giving effect to the statutory
language defining the scope of that interest. That a statutory provision
contains "puzzling" language, or seems unwise, is not an appropriate reason for simply ignoring its text.

Justice Kennedy's dramatic suggestion that our construction of the
1984 amendment "rips out," post, at 145, the "centerpiece of the Nation's
drug enforcement laws," post, at 144, rests on what he characterizes as
the "safe" assumption that the innocent owner defense would be available
to "an associate" of a criminal who could "shelter the proceeds from forfeiture, to be reacquired once he is clear from law enforcement authorities,"
ibid. As a matter of fact, forfeitable proceeds are much more likely to be
possessed by drug dealers themselves than by transferees sufficiently remote to qualify as innocent owners; as a matter of law, it is quite clear
that neither an "associate" in the criminal enterprise nor a temporary
custodian of drug proceeds would qualify as an innocent owner; indeed,
neither would a sham bona fide purchaser.

the condemnation, when obtained, relates back to that
time, and avoids all intermediate sales and alienations,
even to purchasers in good faith." United States v.
Stowell, 133 U. S., at 16-17 (emphases added).

If the Government wins a judgment of forfeiture under the
common-law rule--which applied to common-law forfeitures
and to forfeitures under statutes without specific relation
back provisions--the vesting of its title in the property relates back to the moment when the property became forfeitable. Until the Government does win such a judgment,
however, someone else owns the property. That person may
therefore invoke any defense available to the owner of the
property before the forfeiture is decreed.

In this case a statute allows respondent to prove that she
is an innocent owner. And, as the Chief Justice further explained in Grundy, if a forfeiture is authorized by statute,
"the rules of the common law may be dispensed with," 3
Cranch, at 351. Congress had the opportunity to dispense
with the common-law doctrine when it enacted $ 881(h); as
we read that subsection, however, Congress merely codified
the common-law rule. Because that rule was never applied
to the forfeiture of proceeds, and because the statute now
contains an innocent owner defense, it may not be immediately clear that they lead to the same result.

The 1984 amendment provides:

"All right, title, and interest in property described in
subsection (a) of this section shall vest in the United
States upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section." 21 U. S. C. $ 881(h).

Because proceeds traceable to illegal drug transactions are
a species of "property described in subsection (a)," the Government argues that this provision has the effect of preventing such proceeds from becoming the property of anyone
other than the United States. The argument fails.

507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT
128 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LAND

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Although proceeds subject to $ 881(h) are "described" inthe first part of subsection (a)(6), the last clause of that subsection exempts certain proceeds--proceeds owned by one
unaware of their criminal source--from forfeiture. As the
Senate Report on the 1984 amendment correctly observed,
the amendment applies only to "property which is subject to
civil forfeiture under section 881(a)." 22 Under $ 881(a)(6),
the property of one who can satisfy the innocent owner defense is not subject to civil forfeiture. Because the success
of any defense available under $ 881(a) will necessarily determine whether $ 881(h) applies, $ 881(a)(6) must allow an assertion of the defense before $ 881(h) applies.23

22 The Report provides:
"Section 306 also adds two new subsections at the end of section 881.
The first provides that all right, title, and interest in property which is
subject to civil forfeiture under section 881(a) vests in the United States
upon the commission of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture." S. Rep.
No. 98-225, p. 215 (1983) (emphasis added).

23 The logic of the Government's argument would apparently apply as

well to the innocent owner defense added to the statute in 1988. That
amendment provides, in part:

"[N]o conveyance shall be forfeited under this paragraph to the extent
of an interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by
that owner to have been committed or omitted without the knowledge,
consent, or willful blindness of the owner." $ 6075(3)(C), 102 Stat. 4324.
That amendment presumably was enacted to protect lessors like the owner
whose yacht was forfeited in a proceeding that led this Court to observe:

"It therefore has been implied that it would be difficult to reject the constitutional claim of an owner whose property subjected to forfeiture had been
taken from him without his privity or consent. See, [Peisch v. Ware, 4
Cranch 347, 364 (1808)]; Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U. S.,
at 512; United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile, 272 U. S., at 333;
Van Oster v. Kansas, 272 U. S., at 467. Similarly, the same might be said
of an owner who proved not only that he was uninvolved in and unaware
of the wrongful activity, but also that he had done all that reasonably
could be expected to prevent the proscribed use of his property; for, in
that circumstance, it would be difficult to conclude that forfeiture served
legitimate purposes and was not unduly oppressive. Cf. Armstrong v.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Therefore, when Congress enacted this innocent owner de-fense, and then specifically inserted this relation back provision into the statute, it did not disturb the common-lawrights of either owners of forfeitable property or the Government. The common-law rule had always allowed owners toinvoke defenses made available to them

before the Govern-ment's title vested, and after title did vest, the common-law

rule had always related that title back to the date of thecommission of the act that made the specific property forfeitable. Our decision denies the Government no benefits of therelation back doctrine. The Government cannot profit from
the common-law doctrine of relation back until it has ob-tained a judgment of forfeiture. And it cannot profit from
the statutory version of that doctrine in $ 881(h) until re-spondent has had the chance to invoke and offer evidence to
support the innocent owner defense under $ 881(a)(6).

V
As a postscript we identify two issues that the partieshave addressed, but that need not be decided.

The Government has argued that the Court of Appeals'construction of the statute is highly implausible because it
would enable a transferee of the proceeds of an illegal ex-change to qualify as an innocent owner if she was unaware
of the illegal transaction when it occurred but learned aboutit before she accepted the forfeitable proceeds. Respondent
disputes this reading of the statute and argues that both leg-islative history and common sense suggest that the transferee's lack of knowledge must be established as of the timethe proceeds at issue are transferred.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
or not the text of the statute is sufficiently ambiguous tojustify resort to the legislative history, equitable doctrines

may foreclose the assertion of an innocent owner defense bya party with guilty knowledge of the tainted character of the
property. In all events, we need not resolve this issue inthis case; respondent has assumed the burden of convincing
the trier of fact that she had no knowledge of the allegedsource of Brenna's gift in 1982, when she received it.

25 In

its order denying respondent's motion for summary judg-ment, the District Court assumed that respondent could

prove what she had alleged, as did the Court of Appeals inallowing the interlocutory appeal from that order. We
merely decide, as did both of those courts, whether her as-serted defense was insufficient as a matter of law.

26

At oral argument, the Government also suggested that the
statutory reference to "all proceeds traceable to such an ex-change" is subject to a narrowing construction that might

avoid some of the harsh consequences suggested in the various amici briefs expressing concerns about the impact of thestatute on real estate titles. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-10, 19-

25. If a house were received in exchange for a quantity ofillegal substances and that house were in turn exchanged for
another house, would the traceable proceeds consist of thefirst house, the second house, or both, with the Government
having an election between the two? Questions of this charration as Amicus Curiae 11-12; Brief for American Land Title Association
et al. as Amici Curiae 11-12; Brief for Dade County Tax Collector et al.
as Amici Curiae 16-17.

25 "The statute should be read to require that the owner assert his lack

of knowledge of the criminal transaction at the time of the transfer. Since
Goodwin did not have any knowledge of the alleged criminal transaction
until long after the transfer, she should be protected by the innocent
owner clause." Brief for Respondent 37-38.

26 If she can show that she was unaware of the illegal source of the funds

at the time Brenna transferred them to her, then she was necessarily
unaware that they were the profits of an illegal transaction at the time of
the transaction itself.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.

I am in accord with much of the plurality's reasoning, butcannot join its opinion for two reasons. First, while I agree
that the "innocent owner" exception in this case producesthe same result as would an "innocent owner" exception to
traditional common-law forfeiture (with its relation-backprinciple), I do not reach that conclusion through the plurality's reading of the phrase "property described in subsection(a)," see

ante, at 127-129, which seems to me implausible.Second, I see no proper basis for the plurality's concluding

that "respondent has assumed the burden of convincing thetrier of fact that she had no knowledge of the alleged source
of Brenna's gift in 1982, when she received it," ante, at 130.

I
The Government's argument in this case has rested on thefundamental misconception that, under the common-law

relation-back doctrine, all rights and legal title to the prop-erty pass to the United States "at the moment of illegal use."
Brief for United States 16. Because the Government be-lieves that the doctrine operates at the time of the illegal
act, it finds the term "relation back" to be "something of amisnomer."

Ibid. But the name of the doctrine is notwrong; the Government's understanding of it is. It is a doctrine of retroactive vesting of title that operates only uponentry of the judicial order of forfeiture or condemnation:
"[T]he decree of condemnation when entered relates back to

the time of the commission of the wrongful acts, and takesdate from the wrongful acts and not from the date of the

sentence or decree." Henderson's Distilled Spirits, 14Wall. 44, 56 (1872). "While, under the statute in question, a
judgment of forfeiture relates back to the date of the offense
as proved, that result follows only from an effective judg-ment of condemnation."

Motlow v. State ex rel. Koeln, 295
U. S. 97, 99 (1935). The relation-back rule applies only "incases where the [Government's] title ha[s] been consummated

by seizure, suit, and judgment, or decree of condemnation,"
Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454, 460 (1869), whereupon "the
doctrine of relation carries back the title to the commission
of the offense," United States v. Grundy, 3 Cranch 337, 350-
351 (1806) (Marshall, C. J.) (emphasis added). See also
United States v. Stowell, 133 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1890), quoted
ante, at 126-127.

Though I disagree with the Government as to the meaning
of the common-law doctrine, I agree with the Government
that the doctrine is embodied in the statute at issue here.
The plurality, if I understand it correctly, does not say that,
but merely asserts that in the present case the consequence
of applying the statutory language is to produce the same
result that an "innocent owner" exception under the
common-law rule would produce. Title 21 U. S. C. $ 881(h)
provides: "All right, title, and interest in property described
in subsection (a) of this section shall vest in the United
States upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture
under this section." The plurality would read the phrase
"property described in subsection (a)" as not encompassing
any property that is protected from forfeiture by the "innocent owner" provision of $ 881(a)(6). It proceeds to reason
that since, therefore, the application of subsection (a)(6) must
be determined before subsection (h) can be fully applied, respondent must be considered an "owner" under that provision--just as she would have been considered an "owner"
(prior to decree of forfeiture) at common law.

133Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
I would not agree with the plurality's conclusion, even if Iagreed with the premises upon which it is based. The fact

that application of subsection (a)(6) must be determined be-fore subsection (h) can be fully applied simply does not establish that the word "owner" in subsection (a)(6) must be
deemed to include (as it would at common law) anyone whoheld title prior to the actual decree of forfeiture. To assume

that is simply to beg the question. Besides the fact thatits conclusion is a non sequitur, the plurality's premises are
mistaken. To begin with, the innocent-owner provision insubsection (a)(6) does

not insulate any "property described"
in subsection (a)(6) from forfeiture; it protects only the "interest" of certain owners in any of the described property.
But even if it could be regarded as insulating some "property
described" from forfeiture, that property would still be covered by subsection (h), which refers to "property described,"
not "property forfeited." In sum, I do not see how the plurality can, solely by focusing on the phrase "property described in subsection (a)," establish that the word "owner"
in subsection (a) includes persons holding title after the
forfeiture-producing offense.

The Government agrees with me that $ 881(h) "covers all
`property described in subsection (a),' including property so
described that is nonetheless exempted from forfeiture because of the innocent owner defense." Brief for United
States 29. That position is quite incompatible, however,
with the Government's contention that $ 881(h) operates at
the time of the wrongful act, since if both were true no one
would be protected under the plain language of the innocentowner provision. In the Government's view, the term
"owner" in $ 881(a)(6) refers to individuals "who owned the
seized assets before those assets were ever tainted by
involvement in drug transactions." Id., at 21. But if

$ 881(h) operates immediately to vest in the Government
legal title to all property described in $ 881(a), even that class
of "owners" would be immediately divested of their property

interests and would be at most "former owners" at the timeof forfeiture proceedings. Because of this difficulty, the

Government is forced to argue that the word "owner" in$ 881(a)(6) should be interpreted to mean "former owner."
Reply Brief for United States 5. Thus, if $ 881(h) operates
at the time of the illegal transaction as the Government con-tends, either the plain language of the innocent-owner provision must be slighted or the provision must be deprived ofall effect. This problem does not exist if $ 881(h) is read to
be, not an unheard-of provision for immediate, undecreed,secret vesting of title in the United States, but rather an
expression of the traditional relation-back doctrine--stating
when title shall vest if forfeiture is decreed. On that hypothesis, the person holding legal title is genuinely the
"owner" at the time (prior to the decree of forfeiture) that
the court applies $ 881(a)(6)'s innocent-owner provision.

I acknowledge that there is some textual difficulty with
the interpretation I propose as well: $ 881(h) says that title
"shall vest in the United States upon commission of the act
giving rise to forfeiture," and I am reading it to say that title
"shall vest in the United States upon forfeiture, effective as
of commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture." The former is certainly an imprecise way of saying the latter. But
it is, I think, an imprecision one might expect in a legal culture familiar with retroactive forfeiture, and less of an imprecision than any of the other suggested interpretations require. Moreover, this interpretation locates the imprecision
within a phrase where clear evidence of imprecision exists,
since $ 881(h)'s statement that "all right . . . shall vest in the
United States" flatly contradicts the statement in $ 881(a)
that "[t]he following shall be subject to forfeiture to the
United States." What the United States already owns cannot be forfeited to it.

This interpretation of $ 881(h) is the only one that makes
sense within the structure of the statutory forfeiture procedures. Subsection 881(d) provides that forfeitures under

$ 881 are governed by the procedures applicable to "summary
and judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws," set forth in 19 U. S. C. $ 1602 et
seq. It is clear from these procedures that the Government
does not gain title to the property until there is a decree of
forfeiture. Section 1604, for example, requires the Attorney
General to commence proceedings in district court where
such proceedings are "necessary" "for the recovery" of a forfeiture. See United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555, 557-558,
and n. 2 (1983) (detailing circumstances requiring judicial forfeiture proceedings). If, however, legal title to the property
actually vested in the United States at the time of the illegal
act, judicial forfeiture proceedings would never be "necessary." Under the customs forfeiture procedures the United
States can, in certain limited circumstances, obtain title to
property by an Executive declaration of forfeiture. The
statute provides that such an Executive "declaration of forfeiture . . . shall have the same force and effect as a final
decree and order of forfeiture in a judicial forfeiture proceeding in a district court of the United States," and then specifies what that effect is: "Title shall be deemed to vest in the
United States . . . from the date of the act for which the
forfeiture was incurred." 19 U. S. C. $ 1609(b) (emphasis
added). Finally, if the Government's construction of $ 881(h)
were correct, the statute-of-limitations provision, 19 U. S. C.

$ 1621,1 would need to state that title reverts to the former
owners of the property, rather than (as it does) simply limit

1 In the proceedings below, the Government argued that $ 1621 was the
relevant statute of limitations for $ 881 and the Court of Appeals agreed.
See Brief for United States, Plaintiff-Appellee in No. 90-5823 (CA3),
pp. 19-23; App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a-15a. That ruling was not appealed
and is consistent with other authority. See United States v. One Parcel
of Real Property, 2401 S. Claremont, Independence, Mo., 724 F. Supp. 670,
673 (WD Mo. 1989). See also United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555, 563,

to incorporate statute of limitations in $ 1621).

the right of the United States to institute an "action to re-cover" a forfeiture.

2

The traditional operation of the relation-back doctrinealso explains the textual difference between $ 881(a)(6)'s

innocent-"owner" and $ 853's innocent-"transferee" provi-sions--a difference on which the Government relies heavily.
See Brief for United States 31-35; Reply Brief for UnitedStates 10-11. Section 853, which provides for forfeiture of
drug-related assets in connection with criminal convictions,uses the term "transferee"--not "owner"--to protect the interests of persons who acquire property after the illegal acthas occurred.

3 The Government contends that the reason

for this variance is that the term "owner" simply does notcover persons acquiring interests after the illegal act. That

explanation arrives under a cloud of suspicion, since it is im-possible to imagine (and the Government was unable to suggest) why Congress would provide greater protection forpostoffense owners (or "transferees") in the context of criminal forfeitures. The real explanation, I think, is that theterm "owner" could not accurately be used in the context of

2 Section 881(d) provides that the customs procedures are applicable only
to the extent "not inconsistent with the provisions [of $ 881]"--so one
might argue that the provisions I have discussed in this paragraph, to the
extent contrary to the Government's interpretation of $ 881(h), are simply
inapplicable. That disposition is theoretically possible but not likely, since
it produces massive displacement of not merely the details but the fundamental structure of the referenced forfeiture procedures.

3 Title 21 U. S. C. $ 853(c) provides:

"All right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a) of
this section vests in the United States upon the commission of the act
giving rise to forfeiture under this section. Any such property that is
subsequently transferred to a person other than the defendant may be the
subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered
forfeited to the United States, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing pursuant to subsection (n) of this section that he is a bona fide purchaser for value of such property who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture
under this section."

$ 853 because third parties can assert their property rightsunder that section only "[f]ollowing the entry of an order of

forfeiture." 21 U. S. C. $ 853(n). See also $ 853(k) (prohibit-ing third parties from intervening to vindicate their property
interests except as provided in subsection (n)). Thus, at thetime the third-party interests are being adjudicated, the
relation-back doctrine has already operated to carry back thetitle of the United States to the time of the act giving rise
to the forfeiture, and the third parties have been divestedof their property interests. See $ 853(c) (codifying the
relation-back principle for criminal forfeiture). Indeed, ifthe court finds that the transferee has a valid claim under the
statute, it must "amend the order of forfeiture." $ 853(n)(6).The owner/transferee distinction is found in other provisions throughout the United States Code, and the traditionalrelation-back doctrine provides the only explanation for it.
While Congress has provided for the protection of "owners"in many other forfeiture statutes, see, e. g., 15 U. S. C.

$ 715f(a) (allowing court to order the return of oil subject toforfeiture "to the owner thereof "); 16 U. S. C. $ 2409(c) (permitting the "owner" of property seized for forfeiture to re-cover it,

pendente lite, by posting bond); $ 2439(c) (same); 18U. S. C. $ 512(a) (permitting the "owner" of motor vehicle

with altered identification number to avoid forfeiture byproving lack of knowledge), it consistently protects "transferees" in criminal forfeiture statutes that follow the proce-dure set forth in $ 853: forfeiture first, claims of third parties
second. See 18 U. S. C. $ 1467 (criminal forfeitures for ob-scenity); 18 U. S. C. $ 1963 (1988 ed. and Supp. III) (criminal
RICO forfeitures); 18 U. S. C. $ 2253 (1988 ed. and Supp. III)(criminal forfeitures for sexual exploitation of children).

4 It is worth observing that, if the Government's view of the relationback principle were correct, the protection provided for transferees in the
last-mentioned statute would be utterly illusory. The property subject to
forfeiture under 18 U. S. C. $ 2253 (1988 ed. and Supp. III) is also covered
by a parallel civil forfeiture statute that follows the pattern of $ 881: It

I think the result reached today is correct because therelation-back principle recited in $ 881(h) is the familiar, traditional one, and the term "owner" in $ 881(a)(6) bears itsordinary meaning.

I cannot join the plurality's conclusion that respondent hasassumed the burden of proving that "she had no knowledge

of the alleged source of Brenna's gift in 1982, when she re-ceived it." Ante, at 130. To support this, the plurality cites
a passage from respondent's brief taking the position thatthe owner's lack of knowledge of the criminal activity should
be tested "at the time of the transfer," Brief for Respondent37-38. The fact of the matter is that

both parties took posi-tions before this Court that may be against their interests

on remand. The Government may find inconvenient its con-tention that "the statutory test for innocence . . . looks to
the claimant's awareness of the illegal acts giving rise toforfeiture at the time they occur." Reply Brief for United
States 8. Which, if either, party will be estopped fromchanging position is an issue that we should not address for
two simple reasons: (1) Neither party has yet attempted tochange position. (2) The issue is not fairly included within the
question on which the Court granted certiorari. (That ques-tion was, "Whether a person who receives a gift of money
derived from drug trafficking and uses that money to pur-chase real property is entitled to assert an `innocent owner'
defense in an action seeking civil forfeiture of the real propprotects only the rights of "owners," and has an express relation-back
provision. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 2254(a), 2254(g) (1988 ed. and Supp. III).
Under the Government's view, whenever the United States would be unable to obtain property through the criminal forfeiture mechanism because
of the innocent-"transferee" defense, it could simply move against the
same property in a civil forfeiture proceeding, which gives a defense only
to "owners." See also 18 U. S. C. $ 981 (1988 ed. and Supp. III) (civil
forfeiture provision); 18 U. S. C. $ 982 (1988 ed., Supp. III) (parallel criminal forfeiture statute incorporating by reference the procedures in 21
U. S. C. $ 853).

erty." Pet. for Cert. i. The plurality's reformulation of thequestion in the first sentence of the opinion is inexplicable.)

This question of the relevant time for purposes of deter-mining knowledge was not a separate issue in the case, but
arose indirectly, by way of argumentation on the relationback point. The Government argued that since (as it be-lieved) knowledge had to be measured at the time of the

illegal act, $ 881(h) must be interpreted to vest title in theUnited States immediately, because otherwise the statute
would produce the following "untenable result": A subse-quent owner who knew of the illegal act at the time he acquired the property, but did not know of it at the time theact was committed, would be entitled to the innocent-owner
defense. Brief for United States 25. That argument can be
rejected by deciding either that the Government's view of
the timing of knowledge is wrong, or that, even if it may be
right, the problem it creates is not so severe as to compel a
ruling for the Government on the relation-back issue. (I
take the latter course: I do not find inconceivable the possibility that post-illegal-act transferees with post-illegal-act
knowledge of the earlier illegality are provided a defense
against forfeiture. The Government would still be entitled
to the property held by the drug dealer and by close friends
and relatives who are unable to meet their burden of proof
as to ignorance of the illegal act when it occurred.) But it
entirely escapes me how the Government's argument, an argument in principle, can be answered by simply saying that,
in the present case, respondent has committed herself to
prove that she had no knowledge of the source of the funds
at the time she received them.

For the reasons stated, I concur in the judgment.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice White join, dissenting.

that need not be addressed. The right question, I submit,is not whether the donee's ownership meets the statutory

test of innocence. 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6). Instead, thethreshold and dispositive inquiry is whether the donee had
any ownership rights that required a separate forfeiture,given that her title was defective and subject to the Government's claim from the outset. We must ask whether awrongdoer holding a forfeitable asset, property in which the
United States has an undoubted superior claim, can defeatthat claim by a transfer for no value. Under settled principles of property transfers, trusts, and commercial transac-tions, the answer is no. We need not address the donee's
position except to acknowledge that she has whatever rightthe donor had, a right which falls before the Government's
superior claim. In this case, forfeiture is determined by thetitle and ownership of the asset in the hands of the donor,
not the donee. The position of respondent as the presentholder of the asset and her knowledge, or lack of knowledge,
regarding any drug offenses are, under these facts, but ab-stract inquiries, unnecessary to the resolution of the case.

I
We can begin with the state of affairs when the allegeddrug dealer held the funds he was later to transfer to respondent. Those moneys were proceeds of unlawful drugtransactions and in the dealer's hands were, without question, subject to forfeiture under $ 881(a)(6). The dealer didnot just know of the illegal acts; he performed them. As
the case is presented to us, any defense of his based on lackof knowledge is not a possibility. As long as the dealer held
the illegal asset, it was subject to forfeiture and to the claimof the United States, which had a superior interest in the
property.Suppose the drug dealer with unlawful proceeds had encountered a swindler who, knowing nothing of the dealer's

Kennedy, J., dissenting
drug offenses, defrauded him of the forfeitable property. In
an action by the Government against the property, it need
not seek to forfeit any ownership interest of the swindler.
In the in rem proceeding the Government would need to
establish only the forfeitable character of the property in the
hands of the dealer and then trace the property to the swindler who, having no higher or better title to interpose, must
yield to the Government's interest. In this context we
would not entertain an argument that the swindler could
keep the property because he had no knowledge of the illegal
drug transaction. The defect in title arose in the hands of
the first holder and was not eliminated by the transfer procured through fraud. Thus the only possible "interest of
an owner," $ 881(a)(6), that the swindler could hold was one
inferior to the interest of the United States.

Here, of course, the holder is a donee, not a swindler, but
the result is the same. As against a claimant with a superior right enforceable against the donor, a donee has no defense save as might exist, say, under a statute of limitations.
The case would be different, of course, if the donee had in
turn transferred the property to a bona fide purchaser for
full consideration. The voidable title in the asset at that
point would become unassailable in the purchaser, subject
to any heightened rules of innocence the Government might
lawfully impose under the forfeiture laws. But there is no
bona fide purchaser here.

The matter not having been argued before us in these
terms, perhaps it is premature to say whether the controlling
law for transferring and tracing property rights of the
United States under $ 881 is federal common law, see Boyle
v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500 (1988); Clearfield
Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363 (1943), or the law of
the State governing the transfer under normal conflict-oflaw rules, which here appears to be New Jersey. That matter could be explored on remand if the parties thought any507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
thing turned upon it, though the result likely would be thesame under either source of law because the controlling principles are so well settled.The controlling principles are established by the law of
voidable title, a centuries-old concept now codified in 49
States as part of their adoption of the Uniform CommercialCode. 1 J. White & R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code

1, 186-191 (3d ed. 1988). These principles should control theinquiry into whether property once "subject to forfeiture
to the United States," $ 881(a), remains so after subse-quent transactions. Cf. R. Brown, Personal Property $ 70,
pp. 237-238 (2d ed. 1955); Restatement (Second) of Trusts

$$ 284, 287, 289, pp. 47-48, 54-56 (1959); Restatement (Second) of Property $ 34.9, p. 338 (1992). The primary rules of
voidable title are manageable and few in number. The first
is that one who purchases property in good faith and for
value from the holder of voidable title obtains good title.
The second rule, reciprocal to the first, is that one who
acquires property from a holder of voidable title other than
by a good-faith purchase for value obtains nothing beyond
what the transferor held. The third rule is that a transferee who acquires property from a good-faith purchaser

for value or one of his lawful successors obtains good title,
even if the transferee did not pay value or act in good faith.
See Ames, Purchase for Value Without Notice, 1 Harv. L.
Rev. 1 (1887); Uniform Commercial Code $ 2-403(1) (Official
Draft 1978); Uniform Commercial Code $ 2-403(1) (Official Draft 1957); Uniform Commercial Code $ 2-403(1)
(Official Draft 1952). See also 4 A. Scott & W. Fratcher,
Law of Trusts $$ 284-289, pp. 35-70 (4th ed. 1989); Searey,
Purchase for Value Without Notice, 23 Yale L. J. 447 (1914).

Applying these rules to a transferee of proceeds from a
drug sale, it follows that the transferee must be, or take
from, a bona fide purchaser for value to assert an innocent
owner defense under $ 881(a)(6). Bona fide purchasers for
value or their lawful successors, having engaged in or bene507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT

fited from a transaction that the law accepts as capable ofcreating property rights instead of merely transferring possession, are entitled to test their claim of ownership under$ 881(a)(6) against what the Government alleges to be its own
superior right. The outcome, that one who had defective
title can create good title in the new holder by transfer forvalue, is not to be condemned as some bizarre surprise.

This is not alchemy. It is the common law. See Independent Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, 274 U. S. 640, 647
(1927); United States v. Chase Nat. Bank, 252 U. S. 485, 494(1920);

Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, 236 U. S. 397,
403 (1915). By contrast, the donee of drug trafficking proceeds has no valid claim to the proceeds, not because she has
done anything wrong but because she stands in the shoes of
one who has. It is the nature of the donor's interest, which
the donee has assumed, that renders the property subject to
forfeiture. Cf. Otis v. Otis, 167 Mass. 245, 246, 45 N. E. 737
(1897) (Holmes, J.) ("A person to whose hands a trust fund
comes by conveyance from the original trustee is chargeable
as a trustee in his turn, if he takes it without consideration,
whether he has notice of the trust or not. This has been
settled for three hundred years, since the time of uses").

When the Government seeks forfeiture of an asset in the
hands of a donee, its forfeiture claim rests on defects in the
title of the asset in the hands of the donor. The transferee
has no ownership superior to the transferor's which must be
forfeited, so her knowledge of the drug transaction, or lack
thereof, is quite irrelevant, as are the arcane questions concerning the textual application of $ 881(a) to someone in a
donee's position. The so-called innocent owner provisions of

$ 881(a)(6) have ample scope in other instances, say where a
holder who once had valid ownership in property is alleged
to have consented to its use to facilitate a drug transaction.
Furthermore, whether respondent's marital rights were
present value or an antecedent debt and whether either
could provide the necessary consideration for a bona fide pur507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT

chase are questions that could be explored on remand, weremy theory of the case to control.

II
As my opening premise is so different from the one theplurality adopts, I do not address the difficult, and quite unnecessary, puzzles encountered in its opinion and in the opin-ion of

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment. It ismy obligation to say, however, that the plurality's opinion

leaves the forfeiture scheme that is the centerpiece of theNation's drug enforcement laws in quite a mess.

The practical difficulties created by the plurality's inter-pretation of $ 881 are immense, and we should not assume
Congress intended such results when it enacted $ 881(a)(6).To start, the plurality's interpretation of $ 881(a)(6) conflicts
with the principal purpose we have identified for forfeitureunder the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Act, which is "the
desire to lessen the economic power of . . . drug enterprises."
Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U. S.617, 630 (1989). When a criminal transfers drug transaction

proceeds to a good-faith purchaser for value, one would pre-sume he does so because he considers what he receives from
the purchaser to be of equal or greater value than what hegives to the purchaser, or because he is attempting to launder the proceeds by exchanging them for other property ofnear equal value. In either case, the criminal's economic
power is diminished by seizing from him whatever he re-ceived in the exchange with the good-faith purchaser. On
the other hand, when a criminal transfers drug transactionproceeds to another without receiving value in return, he
does so, it is safe to assume, either to use his new-found,albeit illegal, wealth to benefit an associate or to shelter the
proceeds from forfeiture, to be reacquired once he is clearfrom law enforcement authorities. In these cases, the criminal's economic power cannot be diminished by seizing whathe received in the donative exchange, for he received no tan507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT

145Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
gible value. If the Government is to drain the criminal'seconomic power, it must be able to pierce donative transfers

and recapture the property given in the exchange. It isserious and surprising that the plurality today denies the
Government the right to pursue the same ownership claimsthat under traditional and well-settled principles any other
claimant or trust beneficiary or rightful owner could assertagainst a possessor who took for no value and who has no
title or interest greater than that of the transferor.Another oddity now given to us by the plurality's interpretation is that a gratuitous transferee must forfeit the pro-ceeds of a drug deal if she knew of the drug deal before she
received the proceeds but not if she discovered it a momentafter. Yet in the latter instance, the donee, having given no
value, is in no different position from the donee who hadknowledge all along, save perhaps that she might have had
a brief expectation the gift was clean. By contrast, the good-faith purchaser for value who, after an exchange of assets,
finds out about his trading partner's illegal conduct has un-dergone a significant change in circumstances: He has paid
fair value for those proceeds in a transaction which, as apractical matter in most cases, he cannot reverse.

III
The statutory puzzle the plurality and concurrence find soengaging is created because of a false premise, the premise

that the possessor of an asset subject to forfeiture does notstand in the position of the transferor but must be charged
with some guilty knowledge of her own. Forfeiture pro-ceedings, though, are directed at an asset, and a donee in
general has no more than the ownership rights of the donor.By denying this simple principle, the plurality rips out the
most effective enforcement provisions in all of the drugforfeiture laws. I would reverse the judgment of the Court
of Appeals, and with all due respect, I dissent from thejudgment of the Court.

appeal from the united states district court for thenorthern district of ohio

No. 91-1618. Argued December 8, 1992--Decided March 2, 1993
Pursuant to the Ohio Constitution's requirement that electoral districts

for the state legislature be reapportioned every 10 years, appellant
James Tilling drafted and the state apportionment board adopted in
1991 an apportionment plan that created several districts in which a
majority of the population is a member of a specific minority group.
Appellees, Democratic board members who voted against the plan and
others, filed suit in the District Court, asking that the plan be invalidated on the grounds that it violated $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of
1965 and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. A three-judge
District Court ordered the board to reconsider the plan, holding that $ 2
of the Voting Rights Act prohibits the wholesale creation of majorityminority districts unless necessary to remedy a $ 2 violation; the board,
it held, had failed to show such a violation. The District Court reaffirmed that holding when it reviewed the board's revised 1992 plan, rejecting appellants' argument that it should not have invalidated the 1991
plan without finding that, under the totality of the circumstances, the
plan diluted minority voting strength. In addition, the court held that
the board had violated the Fifteenth Amendment by applying the remedy of creating majority-minority districts intentionally and for the purpose of political advantage. It further held that the plan violated the
Fourteenth Amendment by departing from the requirement that all districts be of nearly equal population.

Held:

1. The plan does not violate $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Pp. 152-158.

(a) Appellees raise an "influence-dilution" claim. They contend
that, by packing black voters in a few districts with a disproportionately
large black voter population, the plan deprived them of a larger number
of districts in which they would have been an influential minority capable of electing their candidates of choice with the help of cross-over
votes from white voters. While this Court has not decided whether
such a claim is viable under $ 2, the Court assumes for the purpose of

Syllabus
resolving this case that appellees have stated a cognizable $ 2 claim.
Pp. 152-154.

(b) Plaintiffs can prevail on a $ 2 dilution claim only if they show
that, under the totality of the circumstances, the State's apportionment
scheme has the effect of diminishing or abridging the voting strength
of the protected class. The District Court erred in holding that $ 2
prohibits the creation of majority-minority districts unless such districts are necessary to remedy a statutory violation, since $ 2 contains
no per se prohibitions against any particular type of district. Instead,
it focuses exclusively on the consequences of apportionment. The court
also mistakenly placed the burden of justifying apportionment on Ohio
by requiring appellants to justify the creation of majority-minority districts. Section 2(b) places at least the initial burden of proving an
apportionment's invalidity on the plaintiff's shoulders. Although the
federal courts may not order the creation of majority-minority districts
unless necessary to remedy a violation of federal law, that prohibition
does not extend to the States. The federal courts are barred from intervening in state apportionment in the absence of such a violation precisely because it is the domain of the States and not the federal courts
to conduct apportionment in the first place. Pp. 154-157.

(c) The District Court, had it applied the three-part vote-dilution
test of Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50-51, would have rejected
appellees' $ 2 claim on the ground that appellees failed to demonstrate
Gingles' third precondition--sufficient white majority bloc voting to
frustrate the election of the minority group's candidate of choice. The
court specifically found, and appellees agree, that Ohio does not suffer
from racially polarized voting. Pp. 157-158.

2. The District Court's holding that the board violated the Fifteenth
Amendment by intentionally diluting minority voting strength for political reasons is clearly erroneous. Tilling's preference for federal over
state law when he believed the two in conflict does not raise an inference
of intentional discrimination; it demonstrates obedience to the Supremacy Clause. Nor does the fact that Tilling, a Republican, possessed
Democratic documents speculating about possible discriminatory strategies Tilling might use demonstrate that Tilling in fact had such a discriminatory strategy. Nothing in the record indicates that Tilling relied on those documents in preparing the plan. Indeed, the record
indicates that Tilling and the board relied on sources, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Ohio Conference of Branches, that were wholly unlikely to engage in or tolerate
intentional discrimination against black voters. This Court expresses
no view on the relationship between the Fifteenth Amendment and

507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT
148 VOINOVICH v. QUILTER

Syllabus
race-conscious redistricting; it concludes only that the finding of intentional discrimination was clear error. Pp. 158-160.

3. The District Court erred in holding that the plan violated the Fourteenth Amendment requirement that electoral districts be of nearly
equal population. When the court found that the maximum total deviation from ideal district size exceeded 10%, appellees established a prima
facie case of discrimination and appellants were required to justify the
deviation. They attempted to do so, arguing that the deviation resulted
from Ohio's constitutional policy in favor of preserving county boundaries. However, the District Court mistakenly held that total deviations in excess of 10% cannot be justified by a policy of preserving political subdivision boundaries. On remand, the court should consider
whether the deviations from ideal district size are justified using the
analysis employed in Brown v. Thomson, 462 U. S. 835, 843-846, and
Mahan v. Howell, 410 U. S. 315, 325-330, which requires the court to
determine whether the plan could reasonably be said to advance the
State's policy, and, if it could, whether the resulting population disparities exceed constitutional limits. Pp. 160-162.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is yet another dispute arising out of legislative redis-tricting and reapportionment. See,

e. g., Growe v. Emison,ante, p. 25. Today we consider whether Ohio's creation of

several legislative districts dominated by minority votersviolated $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437,
as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973.

I
Under the Ohio Constitution, the state apportionmentboard must reapportion electoral districts for the state legislature every 10 years. Ohio Const., Art. XI, $ 1. In 1991,the board selected James Tilling to draft a proposed apportionment plan. After conducting public hearings and meet-ing with members of historically underrepresented groups,
Tilling drafted a plan that included eight so-called majority-minority districts--districts in which a majority of the population is a member of a specific minority group. The boardadopted the plan with minor amendments by a 3-to-2 vote
along party lines. The board's three Republican membersvoted for the plan; the two Democrats voted against it. 794
F. Supp. 695, 698, 716-717 (ND Ohio 1992); App. to Juris.Statement 160a-167a, 183a.

Appellees Barney Quilter and Thomas Ferguson, the twoDemocratic members of the board who voted against the
plan, and various Democratic electors and legislators filedthis lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Ohio seeking the plan's invalidation.They alleged that the plan violated $ 2 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, and the Four-teenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 794 F. Supp., at 695-696. According to appellees,the plan "packed" black voters by creating districts in which
they would constitute a disproportionately large majority.This, appellees contended, minimized the total number of districts in which black voters could select their candidate of

Opinion of the Court
choice. In appellees' view, the plan should have created a
larger number of "influence" districts--districts in which
black voters would not constitute a majority but in which
they could, with the help of a predictable number of crossover votes from white voters, elect their candidates of choice.
See App. to Juris. Statement 141a-142a. Appellants, by
contrast, argued that the plan actually enhanced the
strength of black voters by providing "safe" minoritydominated districts. The plan, they pointed out, compared
favorably with the 1981 apportionment and had the backing
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, Ohio Conference of Branches (Ohio NAACP). 794
F. Supp., at 706.

A three-judge District Court heard the case and held for
appellees. Relying on various statements Tilling had made
in the course of the reapportionment hearings, the court
found that the board had created minority-dominated districts "whenever possible." Id., at 698. The District Court
rejected appellants' contention that $ 2 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, requires that such
districts be created wherever possible. 794 F. Supp., at 699.
It further held that $ 2 actually prohibits the "wholesale
creation of majority-minority districts" unless necessary to
" `remedy' " a $ 2 violation. Id., at 701. The District Court
therefore ordered the board to draft a new plan or demonstrate that it was remedying a $ 2 violation. Id., at 702.

Judge Dowd dissented, arguing that the majority's analysis "place[d] the cart before the horse." Id., at 709. In his
view, $ 2 does not require the State to show a violation before
creating a majority-minority district. Rather, the State
may create any district it might desire, so long as minority
voting strength is not diluted as a result. Because appellees
failed to demonstrate that the 1991 plan diluted the balloting
strength of black voters, Judge Dowd thought their challenge should fail. Id., at 710.

Opinion of the Court
The apportionment board responded by creating a recordthat, in its view, justified the creation of majority-minority

districts. The board also adjusted the plan to correct "tech-nical" errors that the Ohio Supreme Court had identified in
its independent review of the plan. This revised 1992 plancreated only five majority-black districts. App. to Juris.
Statement 258a-263a. The District Court, however, wasnot satisfied with the board's proof. In an order issued on
March 10, 1992, it held that "the [b]oard fail[ed] once againto justify its wholesale creation of majority-minority districts, thus rendering the plan, as submitted, violative of theVoting Rights Act of 1965." 794 F. Supp. 756, 757 (ND
Ohio). The court then appointed a special master to preparea redistricting plan. Ibid. Once again, Judge Dowd dissented. Id., at 758.Nine days later, on March 19, 1992, the District Court
issued an order reaffirming its view that the creation ofmajority-minority districts is impermissible under $ 2 unless
necessary to remedy a statutory violation. App. to Juris.Statement 128a-141a. The order also restated the court's
conclusion that the board had failed to prove a violation.Specifically, it noted "the absence of racial bloc voting, the
[ability of black voters] to elect both black and white candi-dates of their choice, and the fact that such candidates ha[d]
been elected over a sustained period of time." Id., at 130a.In addition, the order rejected as "clever sophistry" appellants' argument that the District Court should not have in-validated the 1991 plan without finding that, under the totality of the circumstances, it diluted minority voting strength:

"Having implemented the Voting Rights Act remedy inthe absence of a violation, [appellants] suggest that we

are now required to establish a violation as a prerequi-site to removing the remedy. Actually, however, this
task is not as difficult as it seems. The totality of cir-cumstances reveals coalitional voting between whites
and blacks. As a result, black candidates have been re507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT

142a (footnotes omitted).
The District Court further concluded that, because the boardhad applied the " `remedy' intentionally" and for the purpose

of political advantage, it had violated not only $ 2 but theFifteenth Amendment as well.

Id., at 142a-143a. Finally,the court held that the plan violated the Fourteenth Amendment because it departed from the requirement that all dis-tricts be of nearly equal population.

Id., at 146a-148a.On March 31, 1992, the District Court ordered that the

primary elections for Ohio's General Assembly be resched-uled. 794 F. Supp. 760 (ND Ohio). On April 20, 1992, this
Court granted appellants' application for a stay of the Dis-trict Court's orders, 503 U. S. 979; and on June 1, 1992, we
noted probable jurisdiction, 504 U. S. 954. We now reversethe judgment of the District Court and remand only for
further proceedings on whether the plan's deviation fromequal population among districts violates the Fourteenth
Amendment. II

Congress enacted $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42U. S. C. $ 1973, to help effectuate the Fifteenth Amendment's
guarantee that no citizen's right to vote shall "be denied orabridged . . . on account of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude," U. S. Const., Amdt. 15. See NAACP v. NewYork, 413 U. S. 345, 350 (1973). Section 2(a) of the Act prohibits the imposition of any electoral practice or procedurethat "results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any
citizen . . . to vote on account of race or color." Section 2(b),in relevant part, specifies that $ 2(a) is violated if:

"[B]ased on the totality of circumstances, it is shownthat the political processes leading to nomination or elec507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion in the State or political subdivision are not equallyopen to participation by members of a class of citizens

protected by subsection (a) of this section in that itsmembers have less opportunity than other members of
the electorate to participate in the political process and
to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C.$ 1973(b).

Section 2 thus prohibits any practice or procedure that, "interact[ing] with social and historical conditions," impairs theability of a protected class to elect its candidate of choice on

an equal basis with other voters. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478
U. S. 30, 47 (1986). A

In the context of single-member districts, the usual device
for diluting minority voting power is the manipulation of district lines. A politically cohesive minority group that islarge enough to constitute the majority in a single-member

district has a good chance of electing its candidate of choice,if the group is placed in a district where it constitutes a majority. Dividing the minority group among various districtsso that it is a majority in none may prevent the group from
electing its candidate of choice: If the majority in each dis-trict votes as a bloc against the minority candidate, the fragmented minority group will be unable to muster sufficient
votes in any district to carry its candidate to victory.This case focuses not on the fragmentation of a minority

group among various districts but on the concentration ofminority voters within a district. How such concentration
or "packing" may dilute minority voting strength is not
difficult to conceptualize. A minority group, for example,
might have sufficient numbers to constitute a majority in
three districts. So apportioned, the group inevitably will
elect three candidates of its choice, assuming the group is
sufficiently cohesive. But if the group is packed into two
districts in which it constitutes a super-majority, it will be

Opinion of the Court
assured only two candidates. As a result, we have recog-nized that "[d]ilution of racial minority group voting

strength may be caused" either "by the dispersal of blacksinto districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority
of voters or from the concentration of blacks into districtswhere they constitute an excessive majority."

Id., at 46,n. 11.

Appellees in this case, however, do not allege that Ohio'screation of majority-black districts prevented black voters
from constituting a majority in additional districts. In-stead, they claim that Ohio's plan deprived them of "influence
districts" in which they would have constituted an influential
minority. Black voters in such influence districts, of course,could not dictate electoral outcomes independently. But

they could elect their candidate of choice nonetheless if theyare numerous enough and their candidate attracts sufficient
cross-over votes from white voters. We have not yet de-cided whether influence-dilution claims such as appellees' are
viable under $ 2, Growe, ante, at 41, n. 5; see Gingles, supra,at 46-47, nn. 11-12 (leaving open the possibility of influencedilution claims); nor do we decide that question today. In-stead, we assume for the purpose of resolving this case that
appellees in fact have stated a cognizable $ 2 claim.

B
The practice challenged here, the creation of majority-minority districts, does not invariably minimize or maximize

minority voting strength. Instead, it can have either effector neither. On the one hand, creating majority-black districts necessarily leaves fewer black voters and thereforediminishes black-voter influence in predominantly white districts. On the other hand, the creation of majority-blackdistricts can enhance the influence of black voters. Placing
black voters in a district in which they constitute a sizeableand therefore "safe" majority ensures that they are able to
elect their candidate of choice. Which effect the practice

Opinion of the Court
has, if any at all, depends entirely on the facts and circum-stances of each case.

The District Court, however, initially thought it unneces-sary to determine the effect of creating majority-black districts under the totality of the circumstances. In fact, the
court did not believe it necessary to find vote dilution at all.It instead held that $ 2 prohibits the creation of majorityminority districts unless such districts are necessary toremedy a statutory violation. 794 F. Supp., at 701. We
disagree. Section 2 contains no per se prohibitions againstparticular types of districts: It says nothing about majorityminority districts, districts dominated by certain political
parties, or even districts based entirely on partisan political concerns. Instead, $ 2 focuses exclusively on the consequences of apportionment. Only if the apportionment
scheme has the effect of denying a protected class the equal
opportunity to elect its candidate of choice does it violate $ 2;
where such an effect has not been demonstrated, $ 2 simply
does not speak to the matter. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). Indeed, in Gingles we expressly so held: "[E]lectoral devices
. . . may not be considered per se violative of $ 2. Plaintiffs
must demonstrate that, under the totality of the circumstances, the devices result in unequal access to the electoral
process." 478 U. S., at 46. As a result, the District Court
was required to determine the consequences of Ohio's apportionment plan before ruling on its validity; the failure to do
so was error.

The District Court's decision was flawed for another
reason as well. By requiring appellants to justify the
creation of majority-minority districts, the District Court
placed the burden of justifying apportionment on the State.
Section 2, however, places at least the initial burden of
proving an apportionment's invalidity squarely on the plaintiff 's shoulders. Section 2(b) specifies that $ 2(a) is violated
if "it is shown" that a state practice has the effect of
denying a protected group equal access to the electoral proc507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT
156 VOINOVICH v. QUILTER

Opinion of the Court
ess. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b) (emphasis added). The burden of"show[ing]" the prohibited effect, of course, is on the plaintiff; surely Congress could not have intended the State toprove the invalidity of its own apportionment scheme. See
Gingles, 478 U. S., at 46 (plaintiffs must demonstrate that the
device results in unequal access to the electoral process); id.,at 49, n. 15 (plaintiffs must "prove their claim before they

may be awarded relief "). The District Court relieved appel-lees of that burden in this case solely because the State had
created majority-minority districts. Because that depar-ture from the statutorily required allocation of burdens finds
no support in the statute, it was error for the District Court
to impose it.

Of course, the federal courts may not order the creation of
majority-minority districts unless necessary to remedy a violation of federal law. See Growe, ante, at 40-41. But that
does not mean that the State's powers are similarly limited.
Quite the opposite is true: Federal courts are barred from
intervening in state apportionment in the absence of a violation of federal law precisely because it is the domain of the
States, and not the federal courts, to conduct apportionment
in the first place. Time and again we have emphasized that
" `reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility
of the State through its legislature or other body, rather than
of a federal court.' " Growe, ante, at 34 (quoting Chapman
v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975)). Accord, Connor v. Finch,
431 U. S. 407, 414 (1977) ("We have repeatedly emphasized
that `legislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for
legislative consideration and determination' " (quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 586 (1964))). Because the
"States do not derive their reapportionment authority from
the Voting Rights Act, but rather from independent provisions of state and federal law," Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 12, the federal courts are bound to respect
the States' apportionment choices unless those choices contravene federal requirements. Cf. Katzenbach v. Morgan,

Opinion of the Court
384 U. S. 641, 647-648 (1966) ("Under the distribution ofpowers effected by the Constitution, the States establish

qualifications for voting for state officers" and such qualifi-cations are valid unless they violate the Constitution or a
federal statute).Appellees' complaint does not allege that the State's conscious use of race in redistricting violates the Equal Protec-tion Clause; the District Court below did not address the
issue; and neither party raises it here. Accordingly, we ex-press no view on how such a claim might be evaluated. We
hold only that, under $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, plaintiffs can prevail on a dilution claim only if they show that, under the totality of thecircumstances, the State's apportionment scheme has the effect of diminishing or abridging the voting strength of theprotected class.

C
In its order of March 19, 1992, the District Court foundthat the 1992 plan's creation of majority-minority districts

"ha[d] a dilutive effect on black votes." App. to Juris. State-ment 141a. Again we disagree.

In Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, this Court held that plain-tiffs claiming vote dilution through the use of multimember
districts must prove three threshold conditions. First, theymust show that the minority group " `is sufficiently large and
geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.' " Second, they must prove that the minority group " `is politically cohesive.' " Third, the plaintiffsmust establish " `that the white majority votes sufficiently as
a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's pre-ferred candidate.' "

Growe, ante, at 40 (quoting Gingles,supra, at 50-51). The District Court apparently thought

the three Gingles factors inapplicable because Ohio hassingle-member rather than multimember districts. 794 F.
Supp., at 699 ("Gingles' preconditions are not applicable tothe apportionment of single-member districts"). In Growe,

507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT
158 VOINOVICH v. QUILTER

Opinion of the Court
however, we held that the Gingles preconditions apply inchallenges to single-member as well as multimember districts. Ante, at 40-41.Had the District Court employed the Gingles test in this
case, it would have rejected appellees' $ 2 claim. Of course,the

Gingles factors cannot be applied mechanically and with-out regard to the nature of the claim. For example, the first

Gingles precondition, the requirement that the group be suf-ficiently large to constitute a majority in a single district,
would have to be modified or eliminated when analyzing theinfluence-dilution claim we assume, arguendo, to be actionable today. Supra, at 154. The complaint in such a case isnot that black voters have been deprived of the ability to
constitute a majority, but of the possibility of being a suffi-ciently large

minority to elect their candidate of choice withthe assistance of cross-over votes from the white majority.

See ibid. We need not decide how Gingles' first factormight apply here, however, because appellees have failed
to demonstrate Gingles' third precondition--sufficient whitemajority bloc voting to frustrate the election of the minority
group's candidate of choice. The District Court specificallyfound that Ohio does not suffer from "racially polarized
voting." 794 F. Supp., at 700-701. Accord, App. to Juris.Statement 132a-134a, and n. 2, 139a-140a. Even appellees
agree. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. Here, as in Gingles, "in theabsence of significant white bloc voting it cannot be said that
the ability of minority voters to elect their chosen repre-sentatives is inferior to that of white voters." Gingles, 478
U. S., at 49, n. 15. The District Court's finding of a $ 2 viola-tion, therefore, must be reversed.

III
The District Court also held that the redistricting planviolated the Fifteenth Amendment because the apportionment board intentionally diluted minority voting strengthfor political reasons. App. to Juris. Statement 142a-143a.

507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT

159Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
This Court has not decided whether the Fifteenth Amend-ment applies to vote-dilution claims; in fact, we never have

held any legislative apportionment inconsistent with the Fif-teenth Amendment.

Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130,
142-143, n. 14 (1976). Nonetheless, we need not decide the
precise scope of the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition inthis case. Even if we assume that the Fifteenth Amendment speaks to claims like appellees', the District Court'sdecision still must be reversed: Its finding of intentional discrimination was clearly erroneous. See Mobile v. Bolden,446 U. S. 55, 62 (1980) (plurality opinion);

id., at 101-103
(White, J., dissenting); id., at 90-92 (Stevens, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at 80 (Blackmun, J., concurring in result).

The District Court cited only two pieces of evidence to
support its finding. First, the District Court thought it significant that the plan's drafter, Tilling, disregarded the requirements of the Ohio Constitution where he believed that
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required a contrary result.
App. to Juris. Statement 142a-143a, n. 8. But Tilling's preference for federal over state law when he believed the two
in conflict does not raise an inference of intentional discrimination; it demonstrates obedience to the Supremacy Clause
of the United States Constitution. Second, the District
Court cited Tilling's possession of certain documents that,
according to the court, were tantamount to "a road-map detailing how [one could] create a racial gerrymander." Id.,
at 143a, n. 9. Apparently, the District Court believed that
Tilling, a Republican, sought to minimize the Democratic
Party's power by diluting minority voting strength. See
ibid. The District Court, however, failed to explain the nature of the documents. Contrary to the implication of the
District Court opinion, the documents were not a set of
Republican plans for diluting minority voting strength. In
fact, they were not even created by Tilling or the Republicans. They were created by a Democrat who, concerned
about possible Republican manipulation of apportionment,

507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT
160 VOINOVICH v. QUILTER

Opinion of the Court
set out the various types of political gerrymandering inwhich he thought the Republicans might engage. App. 99-

100. That Tilling possessed documents in which the oppos-ing party speculated that he might have a discriminatory
strategy does not indicate that Tilling actually had such astrategy. And nothing in the record indicates that Tilling
relied on the documents in preparing the plan.Indeed, the record demonstrates that Tilling and the board
relied on sources that were wholly unlikely to engage in ortolerate intentional discrimination against black voters,
including the Ohio NAACP, the Black Elected Democratsof Ohio, and the Black Elected Democrats of Cleveland,
Ohio. Tilling's plan actually incorporated much of the OhioNAACP's proposed plan; the Ohio NAACP, for its part, fully
supported the 1991 apportionment plan. 794 F. Supp., at726-729; App. to Juris. Statement 164a-167a, 269a-270a.
Because the evidence not only fails to support but also di-rectly contradicts the District Court's finding of discriminatory intent, we reverse that finding as clearly erroneous. Inso doing, we express no view on the relationship between
the Fifteenth Amendment and race-conscious redistricting.Cf.

United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v.Carey, 430 U. S. 144, 155-165 (1977) (plurality opinion). Neither party asserts that the State's conscious use of race byitself violates the Fifteenth Amendment. Instead, they dispute whether the District Court properly found that theState intentionally discriminated against black voters. On
that question, we hold only that the District Court's findingof discriminatory intent was clear error.

IV
Finally, the District Court held that the plan violatedthe Fourteenth Amendment because it created legislative

districts of unequal size. App. to Juris. Statement 146a-148a. The Equal Protection Clause does require that electoral districts be "of nearly equal population, so that each

161Cite as: 507 U. S. 146 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
person's vote may be given equal weight in the election ofrepresentatives."

Connor, 431 U. S., at 416. But the requirement is not an inflexible one.

"[M]inor deviations from mathematical equality among
state legislative districts are insufficient to make out aprima facie case of invidious discrimination under the

Fourteenth Amendment so as to require justification bythe State. Our decisions have established, as a general
matter, that an apportionment plan with a maximumpopulation deviation under 10% falls within this category of minor deviations. A plan with larger disparities
in population, however, creates a prima facie case ofdiscrimination and therefore must be justified by

the State." Brown v. Thomson, 462 U. S. 835, 842-843(1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

Here, the District Court found that the maximum total devi-ation from ideal district size exceeded 10%. App. to Juris.
Statement 148a. As a result, appellees established a primafacie case of discrimination, and appellants were required to
justify the deviation. Appellants attempted to do just that,arguing that the deviation resulted from the State's constitutional policy in favor of preserving county boundaries. SeeOhio Const., Arts. VII-XI. The District Court therefore
was required to decide whether the "plan `may reasonably
be said to advance [the] rational state policy' " of preservingcounty boundaries "and, if so, `whether the population disparities among the districts that have resulted from thepursuit of th[e] plan exceed constitutional limits.' "

Brown,
supra, at 843 (quoting Mahan v. Howell, 410 U. S. 315, 328
(1973)). Rather than undertaking that inquiry, the District
Court simply held that total deviations in excess of 10% cannot be justified by a policy of preserving the boundaries of
political subdivisions. Our case law is directly to the contrary. See Mahan v. Howell, supra (upholding total deviation of over 16% where justified by the rational objective of

507US1$35J 11-18-96 19:18:29 PAGES OPINPGT
162 VOINOVICH v. QUILTER

Opinion of the Court
preserving the integrity of political subdivision lines); seealso Brown v. Thomson, supra. On remand, the District

Court should consider whether the deviations from the idealdistrict size are justified using the analysis employed in
Brown, supra, at 843-846, and Mahan, supra, at 325-330.The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings in conformity withthis opinion.

So ordered.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-1657. Argued January 12, 1993--Decided March 3, 1993
Petitioner homeowners filed suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against respondents--local officials acting in their official capacity, a county, and two
municipal corporations--alleging that the conduct of local police officers
in searching their homes for narcotics violated the Fourth Amendment,
and asserting that the basis for municipal liability was the failure adequately to train the police officers involved. The Federal District Court
dismissed the complaints because they failed to meet the "heightened
pleading standard" adopted by the Court of Appeals, which requires
that complaints against municipal corporations in $ 1983 cases state with
factual detail and particularity the basis for the claim. The Court of
Appeals affirmed.

Held: A federal court may not apply a "heightened pleading standard"--

more stringent than the usual pleading requirements of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 8(a)--in civil rights cases alleging municipal liability
under $ 1983. First, the heightened standard cannot be justified on the
ground that a more relaxed pleading standard would eviscerate municipalities' immunity from suit by subjecting them to expensive and timeconsuming discovery in every $ 1983 case. Municipalities, although free
from respondeat superior liability under $ 1983, see Monell v. New York
City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, do not enjoy absolute or
qualified immunity from $ 1983 suits, id., at 701; Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 650. Second, it is not possible to square the
heightened standard applied in this case with the liberal system of "notice pleading" set up by the Federal Rules. Rule 8(a)(2) requires that
a complaint include only "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." And while Rule 9(b) requires
greater particularity in pleading certain actions, it does not include
among the enumerated actions any reference to complaints alleging
municipal liability under $ 1983. Pp. 165-169.

954 F. 2d 1054, reversed and remanded.

enforcement officers. Each involved the forcible entry intoa home based on the detection of odors associated with the

manufacture of narcotics. One homeowner claimed that hewas assaulted by the officers after they had entered; another
claimed that the police had entered her home in her absenceand killed her two dogs. Plaintiffs sued several local officials in their official capacity and the county and two munici-pal corporations that employed the police officers involved in
the incidents, asserting that the police conduct had violatedthe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The stated basis for municipal liability under Monell v. New
York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658 (1978), wasthe failure of these bodies to adequately train the police officers involved. See Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989).The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas ordered the complaints dismissed because theyfailed to meet the "heightened pleading standard" required
by the decisional law of the Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit. 755 F. Supp. 726 (1991). The Fifth Circuit, in turn,
affirmed the judgment of dismissal, 954 F. 2d 1054 (1992),and we granted certiorari, 505 U. S. 1203 (1992), to resolve a
conflict among the Courts of Appeals concerning the applica-bility of a heightened pleading standard to $ 1983 actions alleging municipal liability. Cf., e. g., Karim-Panahi v. LosAngeles Police Dept., 839 F. 2d 621, 624 (CA9 1988) ("[A]
claim of municipal liability under section 1983 is sufficient towithstand a motion to dismiss even if the claim is based on
nothing more than a bare allegation that the individual offi-cers' conduct conformed to official policy, custom, or practice") (internal quotation marks omitted). We now reverse.Respondents seek to defend the Fifth Circuit's application
of a more rigorous pleading standard on two grounds.*

estoppel. According to respondents, petitioners brought an unsuccessful

involved in one of the incidents. Petitioners respond that the adverse

INTELLIGENCE AND COORDINATION UNIT

Opinion of the Court

First, respondents claim that municipalities' freedom fromrespondeat superior liability, see Monell, supra, necessarily

includes immunity from suit. In this sense, respondents as-sert, municipalities are no different from state or local officials sued in their individual capacity. Respondents reasonthat a more relaxed pleading requirement would subject municipalities to expensive and time-consuming discovery inevery $ 1983 case, eviscerating their immunity from suit and
disrupting municipal functions.This argument wrongly equates freedom from liability
with immunity from suit. To be sure, we reaffirmed in
Monell that "a municipality cannot be held liable under$ 1983 on a

respondeat superior theory." 436 U. S., at 691.But, contrary to respondents' assertions, this protection

against liability does not encompass immunity from suit. In-deed, this argument is flatly contradicted by Monell and our
later decisions involving municipal liability under $ 1983. InMonell, we overruled Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961),
insofar as it held that local governments were wholly im-mune from suit under $ 1983, though we did reserve decision
on whether municipalities are entitled to some form of lim-ited immunity. 436 U. S., at 701. Yet, when we took that
issue up again in Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S.622, 650 (1980), we rejected a claim that municipalities
should be afforded qualified immunity, much like that af-forded individual officials, based on the good faith of their
agents. These decisions make it quite clear that, unlike var-ious government officials, municipalities do not enjoy immunity from suit--either absolute or qualified--under $ 1983.In short, a municipality can be sued under $ 1983, but it cannot be held liable unless a municipal policy or custom causedthe constitutional injury. We thus have no occasion to conruling in this other litigation is currently on appeal and thus is not final for
collateral estoppel purposes. Because this issue was neither addressed
by the Fifth Circuit nor included in the questions presented, we will not
consider it.

sider whether our qualified immunity jurisprudence wouldrequire a heightened pleading in cases involving individual

government officials.Second, respondents contend that the Fifth Circuit's
heightened pleading standard is not really that at all. See
Brief for Respondents Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligenceand Coordination Unit et al. 9-10 ("[T]he Fifth Circuit's

so-called `heightened' pleading requirement is a misnomer").According to respondents, the degree of factual specificity
required of a complaint by the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-cedure varies according to the complexity of the underlying substantive law. To establish municipal liability under$ 1983, respondents argue, a plaintiff must do more than
plead a single instance of misconduct. This requirement,
respondents insist, is consistent with a plaintiff 's Rule 11obligation to make a reasonable prefiling inquiry into the

facts.But examination of the Fifth Circuit's decision in this case
makes it quite evident that the "heightened pleading stand-ard" is just what it purports to be: a more demanding rule
for pleading a complaint under $ 1983 than for pleading otherkinds of claims for relief. See 954 F. 2d, at 1057-1058. This
rule was adopted by the Fifth Circuit in Elliott v. Perez, 751
F. 2d 1472 (1985), and described in this language:

"In cases against governmental officials involving thelikely defense of immunity we require of trial judges

that they demand that the plaintiff 's complaints state
with factual detail and particularity the basis for theclaim which necessarily includes why the defendantofficial cannot successfully maintain the defense of immunity." Id., at 1473.

In later cases, the Fifth Circuit extended this rule to complaints against municipal corporations asserting liability
under $ 1983. See, e. g., Palmer v. San Antonio, 810 F. 2d
514 (1987).

168 LEATHERMAN v. TARRANT COUNTY NARCOTICS

INTELLIGENCE AND COORDINATION UNIT

Opinion of the Court

We think that it is impossible to square the "heightenedpleading standard" applied by the Fifth Circuit in this case

with the liberal system of "notice pleading" set up by theFederal Rules. Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint include only "a short and plain statement of the claim showing
that the pleader is entitled to relief." In Conley v. Gibson,355 U. S. 41 (1957), we said in effect that the Rule meant

what it said:

"[T]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not requirea claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he

bases his claim. To the contrary, all the Rules require
is `a short and plain statement of the claim' that will givethe defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff 's claim is

and the grounds upon which it rests." Id., at 47 (foot-note omitted).

Rule 9(b) does impose a particularity requirement in twospecific instances. It provides that "[i]n all averments of
fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud ormistake shall be stated with particularity." Thus, the Federal Rules do address in Rule 9(b) the question of the needfor greater particularity in pleading certain actions, but do
not include among the enumerated actions any reference tocomplaints alleging municipal liability under $ 1983.

Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.

The phenomenon of litigation against municipal corpora-tions based on claimed constitutional violations by their employees dates from our decision in Monell, supra, where wefor the first time construed $ 1983 to allow such municipal
liability. Perhaps if Rules 8 and 9 were rewritten today,
claims against municipalities under $ 1983 might be subjected
to the added specificity requirement of Rule 9(b). But that
is a result which must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation. In
the absence of such an amendment, federal courts and litigants must rely on summary judgment and control of discov507US1$36z 11-18-96 19:26:18 PAGES OPINPGT

REVES et al. v. ERNST & YOUNG
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 91-886. Argued October 13, 1992--Decided March 3, 1993
A provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act

(RICO), 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(c), makes it unlawful "for any person employed by or associated with [an interstate] enterprise . . . to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity . . . ." After respondent's predecessor, the accounting firm of Arthur Young and Company,
engaged in certain activities relating to valuation of a gasohol plant on
the yearly audits and financial statements of a farming cooperative, the
cooperative filed for bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy trustee brought
suit, alleging, inter alia, that the activities in question rendered Arthur
Young civilly liable under $ 1962(c) to petitioner holders of certain of the
cooperative's notes. Among other things, the District Court applied
Circuit precedent requiring, in order for such liability to attach, "some
participation in the operation or management of the enterprise itself";
ruled that Arthur Young's activities failed to satisfy this test; and
granted summary judgment in its favor on the RICO claim. Agreeing
with the lower court's analysis, the Court of Appeals affirmed in this
regard.

Held: One must participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself in order to be subject to $ 1962(c) liability. Pp. 177-186.

(a) Examination of the statutory language in the light of pertinent
dictionary definitions and the context of $ 1962(c) brings the section's
meaning unambiguously into focus. Once it is understood that the word
"conduct" requires some degree of direction, and that the word "participate" requires some part in that direction, it is clear that one must have
some part in directing an enterprise's affairs in order to "participate,
directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such . . . affairs." The "operation or management" test expresses this requirement in a formulation
that is easy to apply. Pp. 177-179.

(b) The "operation or management" test finds further support in

$ 1962's legislative history. Pp. 179-183.

(c) RICO's "liberal construction" clause--which specifies that the
"provisions of this title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes"--does not require rejection of the "operation or management" test. The clause obviously seeks to ensure that Congress'

Syllabus
intent is not frustrated by an overly narrow reading of the statute, but
it is not an invitation to apply RICO to new purposes that Congress
never intended. It is clear from the statute's language and legislative
history that Congress did not intend to extend $ 1962(c) liability beyond
those who participate in the operation or management of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. Pp. 183-184.

(d) The "operation or management" test is consistent with the proposition that liability under $ 1962(c) is not limited to upper management.
"Outsiders" having no official position with the enterprise may be liable
under $ 1962(c) if they are "associated with" the enterprise and participate in the operation or management of the enterprise. Pp. 184-185.

(e) This Court will not overturn the lower courts' findings that respondent was entitled to summary judgment upon application of the
"operation or management" test to the facts of this case. The failure
to tell the cooperative's board that the gasohol plant should have been
valued in a particular way is an insufficient basis for concluding that
Arthur Young participated in the operation or management of the cooperative itself. Pp. 185-186.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.1
This case requires us once again to interpret the provi-sions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations

(RICO) chapter of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970,Pub. L. 91-452, Title IX, 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18 U. S. C.

$$ 1961-1968 (1988 ed. and Supp. II). Section 1962(c) makesit unlawful "for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairsthrough a pattern of racketeering activity . . . ." The question presented is whether one must participate in the opera-tion or management of the enterprise itself to be subject to
liability under this provision.

The Farmer's Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma, Inc.(Co-Op), began operating in western Arkansas and eastern

Oklahoma in 1946. To raise money for operating expenses,the Co-Op sold promissory notes payable to the holder on
demand. Each year, Co-Op members were elected to serveon its board. The board met monthly but delegated actual
management of the Co-Op to a general manager. In 1952,the board appointed Jack White as general manager.

In January 1980, White began taking loans from the Co-Opto finance the construction of a gasohol plant by his company,

Opinion of the Court
White Flame Fuels, Inc. By the end of 1980, White's debtsto the Co-Op totaled approximately $4 million. In September of that year, White and Gene Kuykendall, who served asthe accountant for both the Co-Op and White Flame, were
indicted for federal tax fraud. At a board meeting on No-vember 12, 1980, White proposed that the Co-Op purchase
White Flame. The board agreed. One month later, how-ever, the Co-Op filed a declaratory action against White and
White Flame in Arkansas state court alleging that Whiteactually had sold White Flame to the Co-Op in February
1980. The complaint was drafted by White's attorneys andled to a consent decree relieving White of his debts and providing that the Co-Op had owned White Flame since Febru-ary 15, 1980.

White and Kuykendall were convicted of tax fraud in Janu-ary 1981. See United States v. White, 671 F. 2d 1126 (CA8
1982) (affirming their convictions). Harry Erwin, the man-aging partner of Russell Brown and Company, an Arkansas
accounting firm, testified for White, and shortly thereafterthe Co-Op retained Russell Brown to perform its 1981 financial audit. Joe Drozal, a partner in the Brown firm, was putin charge of the audit and Joe Cabaniss was selected to assist
him. On January 2, 1982, Russell Brown and Companymerged with Arthur Young and Company, which later became respondent Ernst & Young.2One of Drozal's first tasks in the audit was to determine
White Flame's fixed-asset value. After consulting withWhite and reviewing White Flame's books (which Kuykendall had prepared), Drozal concluded that the plant's valueat the end of 1980 was $4,393,242.66, the figure Kuykendall
had employed. Using this figure as a base, Drozal factoredin the 1981 construction costs and capitalized expenses and
concluded that White Flame's 1981 fixed-asset value was ap2 In order to be consistent with the terminology employed in earlier
judicial writings in this case, we hereinafter refer to the respondent firm
as "Arthur Young."

Opinion of the Court
proximately $4.5 million. Drozal then had to determine howthat value should be treated for accounting purposes. If the

Co-Op had owned White Flame from the beginning of con-struction in 1979, White Flame's value for accounting purposes would be its fixed-asset value of $4.5 million. If, however, the Co-Op had purchased White Flame from White,White Flame would have to be given its fair market value

at the time of purchase, which was somewhere between$444,000 and $1.5 million. If White Flame were valued at
less than $1.5 million, the Co-Op was insolvent. Drozal con-cluded that the Co-Op had owned White Flame from the
start and that the plant should be valued at $4.5 million on
its books.

On April 22, 1982, Arthur Young presented its 1981 audit
report to the Co-Op's board. In that audit's Note 9, Arthur
Young expressed doubt whether the investment in White
Flame could ever be recovered. Note 9 also observed that
White Flame was sustaining operating losses averaging
$100,000 per month. See Arthur Young & Co. v. Reves, 937
F. 2d 1310, 1318 (CA8 1991). Arthur Young did not tell the
board of its conclusion that the Co-Op always had owned
White Flame or that without that conclusion the Co-Op
was insolvent.

On May 27, the Co-Op held its 1982 annual meeting. At
that meeting, the Co-Op, through Harry C. Erwin, a partner
in Arthur Young, distributed to the members condensed financial statements. These included White Flame's $4.5 million asset value among its total assets but omitted the information contained in the audit's Note 9. See 937 F. 2d, at
1318-1319. Cabaniss was also present. Erwin saw the
condensed financial statement for the first time when he arrived at the meeting. In a 5-minute presentation, he told
his audience that the statements were condensed and that
copies of the full audit were available at the Co-Op's office.
In response to questions, Erwin explained that the Co-Op
owned White Flame and that the plant had incurred approxi507US1$37F 11-18-96 19:38:39 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
mately $1.2 million in losses but he revealed no other infor-mation relevant to the Co-Op's true financial health.

The Co-Op hired Arthur Young also to perform its 1982audit. The 1982 report, presented to the board on March 7,
1983, was similar to the 1981 report and restated (this timein its Note 8) Arthur Young's doubt whether the investment
in White Flame was recoverable. See 937 F. 2d, at 1320.The gasohol plant again was valued at approximately $4.5
million and was responsible for the Co-Op's showing a posi-tive net worth. The condensed financial statement distributed at the annual meeting on March 24, 1983, omitted theinformation in Note 8. This time, Arthur Young reviewed
the condensed statement in advance but did not act to re-move its name from the statement. Cabaniss, in a 3-minute
presentation at the meeting, gave the financial report. Heinformed the members that the full audit was available at
the Co-Op's office but did not tell them about Note 8 or thatthe Co-Op was in financial difficulty if White Flame were
written down to its fair market value. Ibid.In February 1984, the Co-Op experienced a slight run on
its demand notes. On February 23, when it was unable tosecure further financing, the Co-Op filed for bankruptcy. As
a result, the demand notes were frozen in the bankruptcyestate and were no longer redeemable at will by the
noteholders. II

On February 14, 1985, the trustee in bankruptcy filed suitagainst 40 individuals and entities, including Arthur Young,
on behalf of the Co-Op and certain noteholders. The Dis-trict Court certified a class of noteholders, petitioners here,
consisting of persons who had purchased demand notes be-tween February 15, 1980, and February 23, 1984. Petitioners settled with all defendants except Arthur Young. TheDistrict Court determined before trial that the demand
notes were securities under both federal and state law. SeeRobertson v. White, 635 F. Supp. 851, 865 (WD Ark. 1986).

Opinion of the Court
The court then granted summary judgment in favor of Ar-thur Young on the RICO claim. See

Robertson v. White,
Nos. 85-2044, 85-2096, 85-2155, and 85-2259 (WD Ark., Oct.15, 1986), App. 198-200. The District Court applied the test

established by the Eighth Circuit in Bennett v. Berg, 710
F. 2d 1361, 1364 (en banc), cert. denied sub nom. Prudential
Ins. Co. of America v. Bennett, 464 U. S. 1008 (1983), that

$ 1962(c) requires "some participation in the operation ormanagement of the enterprise itself." App. 198. The court

ruled: "Plaintiffs have failed to show anything more thanthat the accountants reviewed a series of completed transactions, and certified the Co-Op's records as fairly portraying
its financial status as of a date three or four months preceding the meetings of the directors and the shareholders at
which they presented their reports. We do not hesitate to
declare that such activities fail to satisfy the degree of management required by Bennett v. Berg." Id., at 199-200.

The case went to trial on the state and federal securities
fraud claims. The jury found that Arthur Young had committed both state and federal securities fraud and awarded
approximately $6.1 million in damages. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the demand notes were not
securities under federal or state law. See Arthur Young &
Co. v. Reves, 856 F. 2d 52, 55 (CA8 1988). On writ of certiorari, this Court ruled that the notes were securities within
the meaning of $ 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, 48 Stat. 882, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 78c(a)(10).

On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment
of the District Court in all major respects except the damages award, which it reversed and remanded for a new trial.
See 937 F. 2d, at 1339-1340. The only part of the Court of
Appeals' decision that is at issue here is its affirmance of
summary judgment in favor of Arthur Young on the RICO
claim. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals applied the "operation or management" test articulated in Ben507US1$37F 11-18-96 19:38:39 PAGES OPINPGT

nett v. Berg and held that Arthur Young's conduct did not"rise to the level of participation in the management or operation of the Co-op." See 937 F. 2d, at 1324. The Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also has adopted
an "operation or management" test. See Yellow Bus Lines,
Inc. v. Drivers, Chauffeurs & Helpers Local Union 639, 286U. S. App. D. C. 182, 188, 913 F. 2d 948, 954 (1990) (en banc),

cases and Bank of America National Trust & Savings Assn.v. Touche Ross & Co., 782 F. 2d 966, 970 (CA11 1986) (rejecting requirement that a defendant participate in the operationor management of an enterprise).

"In determining the scope of a statute, we look first to itslanguage. If the statutory language is unambiguous, in the

United States, 464 U. S. 16, 20 (1983). Section 1962(c) makesit unlawful "for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise . . . to conduct or participate, directly or indi-rectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity . . . ."The narrow question in this case is the meaning of the
phrase "to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, inthe conduct of such enterprise's affairs." The word "conduct" is used twice, and it seems reasonable to give each usea similar construction. See Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986). As a verb, "conduct" meansto lead, run, manage, or direct. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 474 (1976). Petitioners urge us to read"conduct" as "carry on," Brief for Petitioners 23, so that al507US1$37F 11-18-96 19:38:39 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
most any involvement in the affairs of an enterprise wouldsatisfy the "conduct or participate" requirement. But context is important, and in the context of the phrase "to con-duct . . . [an] enterprise's affairs," the word indicates some
degree of direction.3The dissent agrees that, when "conduct" is used as a verb,
"it is plausible to find in it a suggestion of control." Post,at 187. The dissent prefers to focus on "conduct" as a noun,
as in the phrase "participate, directly or indirectly, in theconduct of [an] enterprise's affairs." But unless one reads
"conduct" to include an element of direction when used as anoun in this phrase, the word becomes superfluous. Congress could easily have written "participate, directly or indi-rectly, in [an] enterprise's affairs," but it chose to repeat the
word "conduct." We conclude, therefore, that as both anoun and a verb in this subsection "conduct" requires an element of direction.The more difficult question is what to make of the word
"participate." This Court previously has characterized thisword as a "ter[m] . . . of breadth." Russello, 464 U. S., at
21-22. Petitioners argue that Congress used "participate"as a synonym for "aid and abet." Brief for Petitioners 26.
That would be a term of breadth indeed, for "aid and abet""comprehends all assistance rendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, or presence." Black's Law Dictionary 68(6th ed. 1990). But within the context of $ 1962(c), "participate" appears to have a narrower meaning. We may mark

3 The United States calls our attention to the use of the word "conduct"
in 18 U. S. C. $ 1955(a), which penalizes anyone who "conducts, finances,
manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling
business." See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13, n. 11; Tr.
of Oral Arg. 24-25. This Court previously has noted that the Courts of
Appeals have interpreted this statute to proscribe "any degree of participation in an illegal gambling business, except participation as a mere bettor." Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54, 70-71, n. 26 (1978). We
may assume, however, that "conducts" has been given a broad reading in
this context to distinguish it from "manages, supervises, [or] directs."

Opinion of the Court
the limits of what the term might mean by looking again atwhat Congress did not say. On the one hand, "to participate

. . . in the conduct of . . . affairs" must be broader than "toconduct affairs" or the "participate" phrase would be superfluous. On the other hand, as we already have noted, "toparticipate . . . in the conduct of . . . affairs" must be narrower
than "to participate in affairs" or Congress' repetition of theword "conduct" would serve no purpose. It seems that Congress chose a middle ground, consistent with a common un-derstanding of the word "participate"--"to take part in."
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1646 (1976).Once we understand the word "conduct" to require some
degree of direction and the word "participate" to requiresome part in that direction, the meaning of $ 1962(c) comes
into focus. In order to "participate, directly or indirectly, inthe conduct of such enterprise's affairs," one must have some
part in directing those affairs. Of course, the word "partici-pate" makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those
with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs, justas the phrase "directly or indirectly" makes clear that RICO
liability is not limited to those with a formal position in theenterprise,

4 but some part in directing the enterprise's affairs is required. The "operation or management" test ex-presses this requirement in a formulation that is easy to

apply. IV

Opinion of the Court
RICO Civil Fraud Action in Context: Reflections on Bennettv. Berg, 58 Notre Dame L. Rev. 237, 264, n. 76 (1982). The

first line of S. 1861 reflected its expanded purpose: "to pro-hibit the infiltration

or management of legitimate organizations by racketeering activity or the proceeds of racketeering activity" (emphasis added).On June 3, Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson presented the views of the Department of Justice on a numberof bills relating to organized crime, including S. 1623 and S.
1861, to the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Proceduresof the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Wilson criticized
S. 1623 on the ground that "it is too narrow in that it merelyprohibits the investment of prohibited funds in a business,
but fails to prohibit the control or operation of such a business by means of prohibited racketeering activities." Meas-ures Related to Organized Crime: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the SenateCommittee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 387 (1969)

enough to cover most of the methods by which ownership,control

and operation of business concerns are acquired."
Ibid. (emphasis added). See Blakey, supra, at 258, n. 59.

With alterations not relevant here, S. 1861 became TitleIX of S. 30. The House and Senate Reports that accompanied S. 30 described the three-part structure of $ 1962:

"(1) making unlawful the receipt or use of income from
`racketeering activity' or its proceeds by a principal incommission of the activity to acquire an interest in or

establish an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce;(2) prohibiting the acquisition of any enterprise engaged
in interstate commerce through a `pattern' of `racketeerforeign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity."

ing activity;' and (3) proscribing the operation of anyenterprise engaged in interstate commerce through a

`pattern' of `racketeering activity.' " H. R. Rep. No. 91-1549, p. 35 (1970); S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 34 (1969) (emphasis added).
In their comments on the floor, Members of Congress consist-ently referred to subsection (c) as prohibiting the

operationof an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity

and to subsections (a) and (b) as prohibiting the acquisitionof an enterprise.

7 Representative Cellar, who was chairman

of the House Judiciary Committee that voted RICO out in1970, described $ 1962(c) as proscribing the "conduct of the

affairs of a business by a person acting in a managerial ca-pacity, through racketeering activity." 116 Cong. Rec. 35196
(1970) (emphasis added).Of course, the fact that Members of Congress understood

$ 1962(c) to prohibit the operation or management of an en-terprise through a pattern of racketeering activity does not
necessarily mean that they understood $ 1962(c) to be limitedto the operation or management of an enterprise. Cf. Turkette, 452 U. S., at 591 (references to the infiltration of legiti-mate organizations do not "requir[e] the negative inference
that [RICO] did not reach the activities of enterprises orga-nized and existing for criminal purposes"). It is clear from
other remarks, however, that Congress did not intend RICOto extend beyond the acquisition or operation of an enter7 See, e. g., 116 Cong. Rec. 607 (1970) (remarks of Sen. Byrd of West
Virginia) ("to acquire an interest in businesses . . . , or to acquire or operate such businesses by racketeering methods"); id., at 36294 (remarks of
Sen. McClellan) ("to acquire an interest in a business . . . , to use racketeering activities as a means of acquiring such a business, or to operate such
a business by racketeering methods"); id., at 36296 (remarks of Sen. Dole)
("using the proceeds of racketeering activity to acquire an interest in businesses engaged in interstate commerce, or to acquire or operate such businesses by racketeering methods"); id., at 35227 (remarks of Rep. Steiger)
("the use of specified racketeering methods to acquire or operate commercial organizations").

prise. While S. 30 was being considered, critics of the billraised concerns that racketeering activity was defined so

broadly that RICO would reach many crimes not necessarilytypical of organized crime. See 116 Cong. Rec. 18912-18914,
18939-18940 (1970) (remarks of Sen. McClellan). SenatorMcClellan reassured the bill's critics that the critical limitation was not to be found in $ 1961(1)'s list of predicate crimesbut in the statute's other requirements, including those of

$ 1962:

"The danger that commission of such offenses by otherindividuals would subject them to proceedings under

title IX [RICO] is even smaller than any such dangerunder title III of the 1968 [Safe Streets] [A]ct, since commission of a crime listed under title IX provides onlyone element of title IX's prohibitions. Unless an individual not only commits such a crime but engages in apattern of such violations, and uses that pattern to obtain or operate an interest in an interstate business, heis not made subject to proceedings under title IX." 116
Cong. Rec., at 18940.
Thus, the legislative history confirms what we have al-ready deduced from the language of $ 1962(c)--that one is not

liable under that provision unless one has participated in theoperation or management of the enterprise itself.

B
RICO's "liberal construction" clause does not require re-jection of the "operation or management" test. Congress directed, by $ 904(a) of Pub. L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 947, see notefollowing 18 U. S. C. $ 1961, p. 438, that the "provisions of this
title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedialpurposes." This clause obviously seeks to ensure that Congress' intent is not frustrated by an overly narrow readingof the statute, but it is not an invitation to apply RICO to
new purposes that Congress never intended. Nor does the

clause help us to determine what purposes Congress had inmind. Those must be gleaned from the statute through the

normal means of interpretation. The clause " `only servesas an aid for resolving an ambiguity; it is not to be used to
beget one.' " Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479,492, n. 10 (1985), quoting

Callanan v. United States, 364 U. S.587, 596 (1961). In this case it is clear that Congress did not

intend to extend RICO liability under $ 1962(c) beyond thosewho participate in the operation or management of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.8

V
Petitioners argue that the "operation or management" testis flawed because liability under $ 1962(c) is not limited to

upper management but may extend to "any person employedby or associated with [the] enterprise." Brief for Petitioners 37-40. We agree that liability under $ 1962(c) is notlimited to upper management, but we disagree that the
"operation or management" test is inconsistent with thisproposition. An enterprise is "operated" not just by upper
management but also by lower rung participants in the en-terprise who are under the direction of upper management.

An enterprise also might be "operated" or "managed" by oth-ers "associated with" the enterprise who exert control over

it as, for example, by bribery.The United States also argues that the "operation or management" test is not consistent with $ 1962(c) because it lim8 Because the meaning of the statute is clear from its language and legislative history, we have no occasion to consider the application of the rule
of lenity. We note, however, that the rule of lenity would also favor the
narrower "operation or management" test that we adopt.

9 At oral argument, there was some discussion about whether low-level

employees could be considered to have participated in the conduct of an
enterprise's affairs. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 25-27. We need not decide
in this case how far $ 1962(c) extends down the ladder of operation because
it is clear that Arthur Young was not acting under the direction of the CoOp's officers or board.

Opinion of the Court
its the liability of "outsiders" who have no official positionwithin the enterprise. Brief for United States as Amicus

Curiae 12 and 15. The United States correctly points outthat RICO's major purpose was to attack the "infiltration of
organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organiza-tions," S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 76, but its argument fails on
several counts. First, it ignores the fact that $ 1962 hasfour subsections. Infiltration of legitimate organizations by
"outsiders" is clearly addressed in subsections (a) and (b),and the "operation or management" test that applies under
subsection (c) in no way limits the application of subsections(a) and (b) to "outsiders."

10 Second, $ 1962(c) is limited to

persons "employed by or associated with" an enterprise, sug-gesting a more limited reach than subsections (a) and (b),

which do not contain such a restriction. Third, $ 1962(c) can-not be interpreted to reach complete "outsiders" because liability depends on showing that the defendants conducted orparticipated in the conduct of the "enterprise's affairs," not
just their own affairs. Of course, "outsiders" may be liableunder $ 1962(c) if they are "associated with" an enterprise
and participate in the conduct of its affairs--that is, partici-pate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself--but it would be consistent with neither the languagenor the legislative history of $ 1962(c) to interpret it as
broadly as petitioners and the United States urge.In sum, we hold that "to conduct or participate, directly
or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs,"$ 1962(c), one must participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.

ment. Neither petitioners nor the United States have argued that these courts misapplied the "operation or management" test. The dissent argues that by creating the Co-Op's
financial statements Arthur Young participated in the management of the Co-Op because " `financial statements are
management's responsibility.' " Post, at 190, quoting 1 CCH
AICPA Professional Standards, SAS No. 1, $ 110.02 (1982).
Although the professional standards adopted by the accounting profession may be relevant, they do not define what constitutes management of an enterprise for the purposes of

$ 1962(c).

In this case, it is undisputed that Arthur Young relied
upon existing Co-Op records in preparing the 1981 and 1982
audit reports. The AICPA's professional standards state
that an auditor may draft financial statements in whole or
in part based on information from management's accounting system. See ibid. It is also undisputed that Arthur
Young's audit reports revealed to the Co-Op's board that the
value of the gasohol plant had been calculated based on the
Co-Op's investment in the plant. See App. in No. 87-1726
(CA8), pp. 250-251, 272-273. Thus, we only could conclude
that Arthur Young participated in the operation or management of the Co-Op itself if Arthur Young 's failure to tell the
Co-Op's board that the plant should have been given its fair
market value constituted such participation. We think that
Arthur Young's failure in this respect is not sufficient to give
rise to liability under $ 1962(c).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

of a RICO enterprise. Ante, at 177-179. What strikes theCourt as clear, however, looks at the very least hazy to me,

and I accordingly find the statute's "liberal construction"provision not irrelevant, but dispositive. But even if I were
to assume, with the majority, that the word "conduct" clearly
imports some degree of direction or control into $ 1962(c), Iwould have to say that the majority misapplies its own

"operation or management" test to the facts presented here.I therefore respectfully dissent.

The word "conduct" occurs twice in $ 1962(c), first as averb, then as a noun.

"It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or as-sociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to con-duct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct
of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of rack-eteering activity or collection of unlawful debt." 18
U. S. C. $ 1962(c).
Although the Court is surely correct that the cognates
should receive consistent readings, see ante, at 177, and cor-rect again that "context is important" in coming to understand the sense of the terms intended by Congress, ante, at178, the majority goes astray in quoting only the verb form
of "conduct" in its statement of the context for divining a
meaning that must fit the noun usage as well. Thus, themajority reaches its pivotal conclusion that "in the context

of the phrase `to conduct . . . [an] enterprise's affairs,' theword indicates some degree of direction."

Ibid. (footnote
omitted). To be sure, if the statutory setting is so abbreviated as to limit consideration to the word as a verb, it is
plausible to find in it a suggestion of control, as in the phrase
"to conduct an orchestra." (Even so, the suggestion is less
than emphatic, since even when "conduct" is used as a verb,
"[t]he notion of direction or leadership is often obscured or
lost; e. g. an investigation is conducted by all those who take

part in it." 3 Oxford English Dictionary 691 (2d ed. 1989)(emphasis in original).)

In any event, the context is not so limited, and severalfeatures of the full subsection at issue support a more inclusive construction of "conduct." The term, when used as anoun, is defined by the majority's chosen dictionary as, for
example, "carrying forward" or "carrying out," Webster'sThird New International Dictionary 473 (1976), phrases
without any implication of direction or control. The sugges-tion of control is diminished further by the fact that $ 1962(c)
covers not just those "employed by" an enterprise, but thosemerely "associated with" it, as well. And associates (like
employees) are prohibited not merely from conducting theaffairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering,
not merely from participating directly in such unlawful con-duct, but even from indirect participation in the conduct of
an enterprise's affairs in such a manner. The very breadthof this prohibition renders the majority's reading of "conduct" rather awkward, for it is hard to imagine how the "op-eration or management" test would leave the statute with
the capacity to reach the indirect participation of someonemerely associated with an enterprise. I think, then, that
this contextual examination shows "conduct" to have a longarm, unlimited by any requirement to prove that the activity
includes an element of direction. But at the very least, thefull context is enough to defeat the majority's conviction that
the more restrictive interpretation of the word "conduct" isclearly the one intended.

1 The Court attempts to shore up its interpretation with an examination
of relevant legislative materials. See ante, at 179-183. The legislative
history demonstrates only that when Members of Congress needed a
shorthand method of referring to $ 1962(c), they spoke of prohibiting
"the operation" of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
As Arthur Young points out, "operation" is essentially interchangeable
with "conduct"; each term can include a sense of direction, but each is
also definable as "carrying on" or "carrying out." Brief for Respondent

Souter, J., dissenting
What, then, if we call it a tie on the contextual analysis?
The answer is that Congress has given courts faced with
uncertain meaning a clear tiebreaker in RICO's "liberal construction" clause, which directs that the "provisions of this
title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial
purposes." Pub. L. 91-452, $ 904(a), 84 Stat. 947, note following 18 U. S. C. $ 1961. We have relied before on this
"express admonition" to read RICO provisions broadly, see
Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 497-498 (1985),
and in this instance, the "liberal construction" clause plays
its intended part, directing us to recognize the more inclusive definition of the word "conduct," free of any restricting
element of direction or control.2 Because the Court of
Appeals employed a narrower reading, I would reverse.

Even if I were to adopt the majority's view of $ 1962(c),
however, I still could not join the judgment, which seems to
me unsupportable under the very "operation or management" test the Court announces. If Arthur Young had confined itself in this case to the role traditionally performed by
an outside auditor, I could agree with the majority that Arthur Young took no part in the management or operation of
the Farmer's Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma, Inc.
(Co-op). But the record on summary judgment, viewed

22. There is no indication that the congressional shorthand was meant to
attend to the statutory nuance at issue here. As the Court concedes,
"[T]he fact that Members of Congress understood $ 1962(c) to prohibit
the operation or management of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity does not necessarily mean that they understood $ 1962(c)
to be limited to the operation or management of an enterprise." Ante,
at 182.

2 The majority claims that without an element of direction, the word

"conduct," when it appears as a noun, becomes superfluous. Ante, at 178.
Given the redundant language Congress has chosen for $ 1962(c), however,
any consistent reading of "conduct" will tend to make one of its two appearances superfluous.

most favorably to Reves,3 shows that Arthur Young created
the very financial statements it was hired, and purported,
to audit. Most importantly, Reves adduced evidence that
Arthur Young took on management responsibilities by deciding, in the first instance, what value to assign to the Co-op's
most important fixed asset, the White Flame gasohol plant,
and Arthur Young itself conceded below that the alleged
activity went beyond traditional auditing. Because I find,
then, that even under the majority's "operation or management" test the Court of Appeals erroneously affirmed the
summary judgment for Arthur Young, I would (again)
reverse.

For our purposes, the line between managing and auditing
is fairly clear. In describing the "respective responsibilities
of management and auditor," Arthur Young points to the
Code of Professional Conduct developed by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Brief
for Respondent 31. This auditors' code points up management's ultimate responsibility for the content of financial
statements:

"The financial statements are management's responsibility. The auditor's responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements. Management is responsible for adopting sound accounting policies and for
establishing and maintaining an internal control structure that will, among other things, record, process, summarize, and report financial data that is consistent with
management's assertions embodied in the financial
statements. . . . The independent auditor may make

nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be
drawn in his favor." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 255
(1986). My description of the facts, based primarily on the District
Court's view of the evidence at summary judgment, conforms to this
standard.

suggestions about the form or content of the financialstatements or draft them, in whole or in part, based

on information from management's accounting system."1 CCH AICPA Professional Standards, SAS No. 1,

$ 110.02 (1982).
In short, management chooses the assertions to appear infinancial statements; the auditor "simply expresses an opinion on the client's financial statements." Brief for Respond-ent 30. These standards leave no doubt that an accountant
can in no sense independently audit financial records whenhe has selected their substance himself. See In re Thomas
P. Reynolds Securities, Ltd., Exchange Act Release No.29689, 1991 SEC LEXIS 1855, *6-*7 (Sept. 16, 1991) ("A
company may, of course, rely on an outside firm to prepareits books of account and financial statements. However,
once an accounting firm performs those functions, it has be-come identified with management and may not perform an
audit").The evidence on summary judgment, read favorably to
Reves, indicates that Arthur Young did indeed step out ofits auditing shoes and into those of management, in creating
the financial record on which the Co-op's solvency was erro-neously predicated. The Co-op's 1980 financial statement
gave no fixed-asset value for the White Flame gasohol plant(although the statement did say that the Co-op had advanced
the plant $4.1 million during 1980, App. in No. 87-1726 (CA8),pp. 291, 295), and there is no indication that a valuation statement occurred anywhere else in the Co-op's records at thattime. When Arthur Young accepted the job of preparing
the Co-op's financial statement for 1981, the value to be giventhe plant was a matter of obvious moment. Instead of declaring the plant's valuation to be the Co-op's responsibility,and instead even of turning to management for more reliable
information about the plant's value, Arthur Young basicallyset out to answer its own questions and to come up with its
own figure for White Flame's fixed-asset value. In doing so,

it repeatedly made choices calling for the exercise of a judgment that belonged to the Co-op's management in the first
instance.

Arthur Young realized it could not rely on White Flame's
1980 financial statement, which had been prepared by a convicted felon (who also happened to be the Co-op's former accountant),4 see Arthur Young & Co. v. Reves, 937 F. 2d 1310,
1316-1317 (CA8 1991), and an internal memo that appears in
the record shows that Arthur Young had a number of serious
questions about White Flame's cost figures for the plant.
See App. in No. 87-1726, supra, at 1189-1191. Nonetheless,
Arthur Young "essentially invented" a cost figure that
matched, to the penny, the phoney figure that Kuykendall,
White Flame's convicted accountant, had created. App.
138-140. With this "invented" cost figure in hand, Arthur
Young then proceeded to decide, again without consulting
management, when the Co-op had acquired White Flame.
Although the Co-op's 1980 financial statement indicated an
acquisition of White Flame in February 1980, as did a local
court decree, see App. in No. 87-1726, supra, at 295, 1212-
1214, Arthur Young "adopted a blatant fiction--that the
Co-op [had] owned the entire plant at its inception in May,
1979--in order to justify carrying the asset on [the Co-op's]
books at its total cost, as if the Co-op had built it from
scratch." App. 137. Apparently, the idea that the Co-op
had owned the gasohol plant since 1979 was reflected nowhere in the Co-op's books, and Arthur Young was solely

4 Gene Kuykendall, the Co-op's previous "independent auditor," was involved in keeping the Co-op's books in addition to preparing and "auditing" financial statements for White Flame. See Arthur Young & Co. v.
Reves, 937 F. 2d 1310, 1316-1317 (CA8 1991); United States v. White, 671
F. 2d 1126 (CA8 1982); Robertson v. White, 633 F. Supp. 954 (WD Ark.
1986). Thus, the Co-op had a history of relying on "outside" auditors for
such services.

5 If Arthur Young had decided otherwise, the value of White Flame on
the Co-op's books would have been its fair market value at the time of
sale--three to four million dollars less. See ante, at 174. The "blatant
fiction" created by Arthur Young maintained the Co-op's appearance of
solvency and made Jack White's management "look better." App. 137-
138. The District Court noted some plausible motives for Arthur Young's
conduct, including a desire to keep the Co-op's business and the accountants' need "to cover themselves for having testified on behalf of White
and Kuykendall in [their] 1981 criminal trial." App. 136.

The majority asserts, as an "undisputed" fact, "that Arthur Young relied
upon existing Co-Op records in preparing the 1981 and 1982 audit reports." Ante, at 186. In fact, however, the District Court found that
Reves had presented evidence sufficient to show that Arthur Young "essentially invented" a cost figure for White Flame (after examining White
Flame records created by Kuykendall). See App. 138-140. Since the Coop's 1980 financial statement indicated that the Co-op had advanced White
Flame only $4.1 million through the end of 1980, see supra, at 191, Arthur
Young could not have relied on the Co-op's records in concluding that the
plant's value was nearly $4.4 million at the end of 1980. See 937 F. 2d, at
1317. The District Court also found sufficient evidence in the record to
support the conclusion that Arthur Young had created the "blatant fiction"
that the Co-op had owned White Flame from its inception, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary in the Co-op's records. See App. 137-
138; see also 937 F. 2d, at 1317 ("In concluding that the Co-op had always
owned White Flame, [Arthur Young] ignored a great deal of information
suggesting exactly the opposite"). The evidence indicates that it was creative accounting, not reliance on the Co-op's books, that led Arthur Young
to treat the Co-op as the plant's owner from the time of its construction
in 1979 (a conclusion necessary to support Arthur Young's decision to
value the plant at total cost). Not even the decree procured in the
friendly lawsuit engineered by White and his lawyers treated the Co-op
as building the plant, or as owning it before February 1980. See ante,
at 173.

6 See 937 F. 2d, at 1318. In fact, Note 9 to the 1981 financial statement

continued to indicate that the Co-op "acquired legal ownership" of White
Flame in February 1980. App. in No. 87-1726 (CA8), p. 250.

membership, Arthur Young prepared the Co-op's 1981 financial statement and listed a fixed-asset value of more than
$4.5 million for the gasohol plant. App. in No. 87-1726
(CA8), p. 238. Arthur Young listed a similar value for White
Flame in the Co-op's financial statement for 1982. Id., at
261. By these actions, Arthur Young took on management
responsibilities, for it thereby made assertions about the
fixed-asset value of White Flame that were derived, not from
information or any figure provided by the Co-op's management, but from its own financial analysis.

Thus, the District Court, after reviewing this evidence,
concluded that petitioners could show from the record that
Arthur Young had "created the Co-op's financial statements." App. 199. The court also took note of evidence
supporting petitioners' allegation that Arthur Young had
"participated in the creation of condensed financial statements" that were handed out each year at the annual meeting of the Co-op. Ibid. Before the Court of Appeals, although Arthur Young disputed petitioners' claim that it had
been functioning as the Co-op's de facto chief financial officer,
Supplemental Reply Brief on Remand for Appellant in No.
87-1726 (CA8), p. 2, it did not dispute the District Court's
conclusion that Reves had presented evidence showing that
Arthur Young had created the Co-op's financial statements
and had participated in the creation of condensed financial
statements. Supplemental Brief on Remand for Appellant
in No. 87-1726 (CA8), p. 20. Instead, Arthur Young argued
that "[e]ven if, as here, the alleged activity goes beyond
traditional auditing, it was neither an integral part of the
management of the Co-op's affairs nor part of a dominant,
active ownership or managerial role." Id., at 21 (emphasis
added).

It was only by ignoring these crucial concessions, and the
evidence that obviously prompted them, that the Court of
Appeals could describe Arthur Young's involvement with the

195Cite as: 507 U. S. 170 (1993)
Souter, J., dissenting
Co-op as "limited to the audits, meetings with the Board of
Directors to explain the audits, and presentations at the annual meetings." 937 F. 2d, at 1324. And only then could
the court have ruled that, "as a matter of law, Arthur
Young's involvement with the Co-op did not rise to the level
required for a RICO violation," which it described (quoting
Bennett v. Berg, 710 F. 2d 1361 (CA8 1983)) as requiring only
"some participation in the operation or management of the
enterprise itself." 937 F. 2d, at 1324 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

But petitioners' evidence and respondent's concessions of
activity going beyond outside auditing can neither be ignored
nor declared irrelevant. As the Court explains today, " `outsiders' may be liable under $ 1962(c) if they are `associated
with' an enterprise and participate in the conduct of its affairs--that is, participate in the operation or management of
the enterprise itself . . . ." Ante, at 185 (emphasis in original). Thus, the question here is whether Arthur Young,
which was "associated with" the Co-op, "participated" in the
Co-op's operation or management. As the Court has noted,
"participate" should be read broadly in this context, see ante,
at 178 (citing Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 21-22
(1983)), since Congress has provided that even "indirect"
participation will suffice. Cf. Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U. S., at 497-498 ("Congress' self-consciously expansive language" supports the conclusion that "RICO is to be
read broadly").

The evidence petitioners presented in opposing the motion
for summary judgment demonstrated Arthur Young's "participation" in this broad sense. By assuming the authority
to make key decisions in stating the Co-op's own valuation
of its major fixed asset, and by creating financial statements
that were the responsibility of the Co-op's management, Arthur Young crossed the line separating "outside" auditors
from "inside" financial managers. Because the majority, like

197OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

SMITH v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1538. Argued December 7, 1992--Decided March 8, 1993
After her husband was killed in Antarctica--a sovereignless region without civil tort law of its own--while he was working for a private firm
under contract to a federal agency, petitioner filed this wrongful-death
action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act
(FTCA). The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of
subject-matter jurisdiction, holding that the claim was barred by the
FTCA's foreign-country exception, which states that the statute's
waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to "[a]ny claim arising in
a foreign country," 28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k). The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The FTCA does not apply to tortious acts or omissions occurring in

Antarctica. The ordinary meaning of "foreign country" includes Antarctica, even though it has no recognized government. If this were
not so, $ 1346(b)--which waives sovereign immunity for certain torts
committed "under circumstances where the United States, if a private
person, would be liable . . . in accordance with the law of the place
where the act or omission occurred" (emphasis added)--would have the
bizarre result of instructing courts to look to the law of a place that has
no law in order to determine the United States' liability. Similarly, if
Antarctica were included within the FTCA's coverage, $ 1402(b)--which
provides that claims may be brought "only in the judicial district where
the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred"--would have the anomalous result of limiting venue to cases in
which the claimant happened to reside in the United States, since no
federal judicial district encompasses Antarctica. This interpretation of
the FTCA accords with the canon of construction that prohibits courts
from either extending or narrowing the statute's sovereign immunity
waiver beyond what Congress intended, United States v. Kubrick, 444
U. S. 111, 117-118, and with the presumption against extraterritorial
application of United States statutes, see, e. g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248. It is unlikely that Congress, had it
expressly considered the question when it passed the FTCA, would have
included a desolate and extraordinarily dangerous land such as Antarctica within the statute's scope. Pp. 200-205.

953 F. 2d 1116, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which White,

Christopher J. Wright argued the cause for the UnitedStates. On the brief were

Solicitor General Starr, Assist-ant Attorney General Gerson, Deputy Solicitor General

Mahoney, and Mark B. Stern.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

This case presents the question whether the Federal TortClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. $$ 1346(b), 1402(b), 2401(b),
2671-2680 (1988 ed. and Supp. II), applies to tortious actsor omissions occurring in Antarctica, a sovereignless region
without civil tort law of its own.1 We hold that it does not.Petitioner Sandra Jean Smith is the widow of John Emmett Smith and the duly appointed representative of his es1 Without indigenous human population and containing roughly onetenth of the world's land mass, Antarctica is best described as "an entire
continent of disputed territory." F. Auburn, Antarctic Law and Politics
1 (1982). Seven nations--Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom--presently assert formal claims
to pie-shaped portions of the continent that total about 85 percent of its
expanse. Boczek, The Soviet Union and the Antarctic Regime, 78 Am.
J. Int'l L. 834, 840 (1984); Hayton, The Antarctic Settlement of 1959, 54
Am. J. Int'l L. 349 (1960). The United States does not recognize other
nations' claims and does not itself assert a sovereign interest in Antarctica, although it maintains a basis for such a claim. Lissitzyn, The American Position on Outer Space and Antarctica, 53 Am. J. Int'l L. 126, 128
(1959). In any event, these sovereign claims have all been suspended by
the terms of the Antarctic Treaty, concluded in 1959. Antarctic Treaty,
Dec. 1, 1959, [1961] 12 U. S. T. 794, T. I. A. S. No. 4780. Article IV of the
treaty states that no claim may be enforced, expanded, or compromised
while the treaty is in force, id., art. IV, 12 U. S. T., at 796, thus essentially
freezing nations' sovereign claims as of the date of the treaty's execution.

Opinion of the Court
tate. At the time of his death, Smith worked as a carpenterat McMurdo Station on Ross Island, Antarctica, for a construction company under contract to the National ScienceFoundation, an agency of the United States. Smith and two
companions one day took a recreational hike to Castle Rock,
located several miles outside of McMurdo Station. On theirreturn, they departed from the marked route to walk across

a snow field in the direction of Scott Base, a New Zealandoutpost not far from McMurdo Station. After stopping for
a snack, one of the three men took a step and suddenlydropped from sight. Smith followed, and he, too, disappeared. Both men had fallen into a crevasse. Despite
search and rescue efforts, Smith died from exposure and internal injuries suffered as a result of the fall.

Petitioner filed this wrongful-death action against the
United States under the FTCA in the District Court for the
District of Oregon, the district where she resides. Petitioner alleged that the United States was negligent in failing
to provide adequate warning of the dangers posed by crevasses in areas beyond the marked paths. It is undisputed
that petitioner's claim is based exclusively on acts or omissions occurring in Antarctica. Upon the motion of the
United States, the District Court dismissed petitioner's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, 702 F. Supp.
1480 (1989), holding that her claim was barred by 28 U. S. C.

$ 2680(k), the foreign-country exception. Section 2680(k)
precludes the exercise of jurisdiction over "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country."

The Court of Appeals affirmed, 953 F. 2d 1116 (CA9 1991).
It noted that the term "foreign country" admits of multiple
interpretations, and thus looked to the language and structure of the FTCA as a whole to determine whether Antarctica is a "foreign country" within the meaning of the statute.
Adopting the analysis and conclusion of then-Judge Scalia,
see Beattie v. United States, 244 U. S. App. D. C. 70, 85-109,

200 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
of Appeals ruled that the FTCA does not apply to claimsarising in Antarctica. To hold otherwise, the Court of

Appeals stated, would render two other provisions of theFTCA, 28 U. S. C. $$ 1402(b), 1346(b), nonsensical. The
Court of Appeals held, in the alternative, that petitioner'ssuit would be barred even if Antarctica were not a "foreign
country" for purposes of the FTCA. Because the FTCAwas a limited relinquishment of the common-law immunity
of the United States, the Court of Appeals concluded thatthe absence of any clear congressional intent to subject the
United States to liability for claims arising in Antarctica pre-cluded petitioner's suit. We granted certiorari to resolve a
conflict between two Courts of Appeals,2 504 U. S. 984 (1992),and now affirm.

Petitioner argues that the scope of the foreign-country ex-ception turns on whether the United States has recognized
the legitimacy of another nation's sovereign claim over theforeign land. Otherwise, she contends, the land is not a
"country" for purposes of the FTCA. Petitioner points outthat the United States does not recognize the validity of
other nations' claims to portions of Antarctica. She asserts,moreover, that this construction of the term "foreign country" is most consistent with the purpose underlying theforeign-country exception. According to petitioner, Congress enacted the foreign-country exception in order to insu-late the United States from tort liability imposed pursuant
to foreign law. Because Antarctica has no law of its own,petitioner claims that conventional choice-of-law rules control and require the application of Oregon law, the law ofher domicil. Thus, petitioner concludes, the rationale for
the foreign-country exception would not be compromised bythe exercise of jurisdiction here, since the United States

2 Cf. Beattie v. United States, 244 U. S. App. D. C. 70, 756 F. 2d 91 (1984)
(holding that Antarctica is not a "foreign country" within the meaning of
the FTCA).

Opinion of the Court
would not be subject to liability under the law of a foreign
nation.

Petitioner's argument for governmental liability here faces
significant obstacles in addition to the foreign-country exception, but we turn first to the language of that proviso. It
states that the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity does
not apply to "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country." 28
U. S. C. $ 2680(k). Though the FTCA offers no definition of
"country," the commonsense meaning of the term undermines petitioner's attempt to equate it with "sovereign
state." The first dictionary definition of "country" is simply
"[a] region or tract of land." Webster's New International
Dictionary 609 (2d ed. 1945). To be sure, this is not the only
possible interpretation of the term, and it is therefore appropriate to examine other parts of the statute before making a
final determination. But the ordinary meaning of the language itself, we think, includes Antarctica, even though it
has no recognized government.

Our construction of the term "foreign country" draws support from the language of $ 1346(b), "[t]he principal provision
of the Federal Tort Claims Act." Richards v. United States,
369 U. S. 1, 6 (1962). That section waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for certain torts committed by
federal employees "under circumstances where the United
States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in
accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred." 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(b) (emphasis added). We
have construed $ 1346(b) in determining what law should
apply in actions brought under the FTCA. See Richards,
supra. But by its terms the section is more than a choiceof-law provision: It delineates the scope of the United States'
waiver of sovereign immunity. If Antarctica were not a
"foreign country," and for that reason included within the
FTCA's coverage, $ 1346(b) would instruct courts to look to
the law of a place that has no law in order to determine the

507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT
202 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
liability of the United States--surely a bizarre result.3 Ofcourse, if it were quite clear from the balance of the statute

that governmental liability was intended for torts committedin Antarctica, then the failure of $ 1346(b) to specify any governing law might be treated as a statutory gap that thecourts could fill by decisional law. But coupled with what
seems to us the most natural interpretation of the foreign-country exception, this portion of $ 1346(b) reinforces the
conclusion that Antarctica is excluded from the coverage ofthe FTCA.

Section 1346(b) is not, however, the only FTCA provisionthat contradicts petitioner's interpretation of the foreigncountry exception. The statute's venue provision, $ 1402(b),provides that claims under the FTCA may be brought "only
in the judicial district where the plaintiff resides or whereinthe act or omission complained of occurred." Because no
federal judicial district encompasses Antarctica, petitioner'sinterpretation of the FTCA would lead to yet another anomalous result: The FTCA would establish jurisdiction for alltort claims against the United States arising in Antarctica,
but no venue would exist unless the claimant happened toreside in the United States.

4 As we observed in Brunette

3 Nor can the law of the plaintiff's domicil, Oregon here, be substituted
in FTCA actions based on torts committed in Antarctica. "Congress has
expressly stated that the Government's liability is to be determined by
the application of a particular law, the law of the place where the act or
omission occurred . . . ." Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 9 (1962).
Petitioner does not contend that her cause of action is based on acts or
omissions occurring in Oregon.

4 The history of the FTCA reveals that Congress declined to enact earlier versions of the statute that would have differentiated between foreign
and United States residents. Those versions would have barred claims
"arising in a foreign country in behalf of an alien." S. 2690, 76th Cong.,
1st Sess., $ 303(12) (1939) (emphasis added); H. R. 7236, 76th Cong., 1st
Sess., $ 303(12) (1939) (emphasis added). At the suggestion of the Attorney General, the last five words of the proposed bills were dropped. See
Hearings on H. R. 5373 and H. R. 6463 before the House Committee on the
Judiciary, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 29, 35, 66 (1942). As we observed in

Opinion of the Court
Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U. S.706, 710, n. 8 (1972), "Congress does not in general intend

to create venue gaps, which take away with one hand whatCongress has given by way of jurisdictional grant with the
other." Thus, in construing the FTCA, it is "reasonable toprefer the construction that avoids leaving such a gap,"

ibid.,especially when that construction comports with the usual

meaning of a disputed term.Our decisions interpreting the FTCA contain varying
statements as to how it should be construed. See, e. g.,United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543, 547 (1951);
Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S. 15, 31 (1953); United
States v. Orleans, 425 U. S. 807, 813 (1976); Kosak v. UnitedStates, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9 (1984). See also United States

v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992). A recentstatement of this sort, and the one to which we now adhere,
is found in United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117-118(1979) (citations omitted): "We should also have in mind that
the Act waives the immunity of the United States and that. . . we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver
beyond that which Congress intended. Neither, however,should we assume the authority to narrow the waiver that
Congress intended." Reading the foreign-country excep-tion to the FTCA to exclude torts committed in Antarctica
accords with this canon of construction.Lastly, the presumption against extraterritorial application of United States statutes requires that any lingeringdoubt regarding the reach of the FTCA be resolved against

United States v. Spelar, 338 U. S. 217, 220 (1949), "[t]he superseded draft
had made the waiver of the Government's traditional immunity turn upon
the fortuitous circumstance of the injured party's citizenship." The
amended version, however, "identified the coverage of the Act with the
scope of United States sovereignty." Id., at 220-221. At least insofar as
Antarctica is concerned, petitioner's interpretation of the FTCA would
effectively resurrect the scheme rejected by Congress; it would deny relief
to foreign residents in circumstances where United States residents
could recover.

Opinion of the Court
its encompassing torts committed in Antarctica. "It is alongstanding principle of American law `that legislation of

Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to applyonly within the territorial jurisdiction of the United
States.' " EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.
244, 248 (1991) (quoting Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S.281, 285 (1949)). In applying this principle, "[w]e assume

that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the pre-sumption against extraterritoriality."

Arabian American
Oil Co., supra, at 248; accord, e. g., Argentine Republic v.
Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 440 (1989)
("When it desires to do so, Congress knows how to place thehigh seas within the jurisdictional reach of a statute"). The

applicability of the presumption is not defeated here just because the FTCA specifically addresses the issue of extrater-ritorial application in the foreign-country exception. To the

contrary, as we stated in United States v. Spelar, 338 U. S.
217, 222 (1949), "[t]hat presumption, far from being overcome
here, is doubly fortified by the language of this statute and
the legislative purpose underlying it." Petitioner does not
assert, nor could she, that there is clear evidence of congressional intent to apply the FTCA to claims arising
in Antarctica.5

For all of these reasons, we hold that the FTCA's waiver
of sovereign immunity does not apply to tort claims arising
in Antarctica. Some of these reasons are based on the language and structure of the statute itself; others are based
on presumptions as to extraterritorial application of Acts of
Congress and as to waivers of sovereign immunity. We

laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.' " Brief for Petitioner 16 (quoting EEOC v. Arabian American Oil
Co., 499 U. S., at 248). But the presumption is rooted in a number of
considerations, not the least of which is the commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.

think these norms of statutory construction have quite likelyled us to the same conclusion that the 79th Congress would

have reached had it expressly considered the question wenow decide: It would not have included a desolate and extraordinarily dangerous land such as Antarctica within thescope of the FTCA. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is therefore

Affirmed.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
In my opinion the Court's decision to grant certiorari inthis case was a wise exercise of its discretion. The question

whether the United States should be held responsible forthe tortious conduct of its agents in the vast "sovereignless
region" of Antarctica, ante, at 198, is profoundly important,not only because its answer identifies the character of our
concern about ordinary justice, but also because Antarcticais just one of three vast sovereignless places where the negligence of federal agents may cause death or physical injury.The negligence that is alleged in this case will surely have
its parallels in outer space as our astronauts continue theirexplorations of ungoverned regions far beyond the jurisdictional boundaries that were familiar to the Congress thatenacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in 1946. Moreover, our jurisprudence relating to negligence of federalagents on the sovereignless high seas points unerringly to
the correct disposition of this case. Unfortunately, theCourt has ignored that jurisprudence in its parsimonious
construction of the FTCA's "sweeping" waiver of sovereignimmunity.

In theory the territorial limits on the consent to sue theUnited States for the torts of its agents might be defined in

four ways: (1) there is no such limit; (2) territory subject to

the jurisdiction of a foreign country is the only exclusion; (3)it also excludes sovereignless land areas such as Antarctica,

but it includes the high seas and outer space; or (4) it hasan "exclusive domestic focus" that applies "only within the
territorial jurisdiction of the United States." 2 The "foreigncountry" exclusion in 28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k)

eliminates the first possibility. In my opinion, the secondis compelled by the text of the Act.

4 The third possibility

is not expressly rejected by the Court, but the reasoning inits terse opinion seems more consistent with the Government's unambiguous adoption of the fourth, and narrowest,interpretation. I shall therefore first explain why the text
of the FTCA unquestionably requires rejection of the Gov-ernment's submission.

I
The FTCA includes both a broad grant of jurisdiction tothe federal courts in $ 1346(b)

5 and a broad waiver of sover2 See Brief for United States 16, 21-22.
3 "The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall

not apply to--. . . . .

"(k) Any claim arising in a foreign country." 28 U. S. C. $ 2680(k).
4 In short, I agree with most of the analysis in Judge Fletcher's dissenting opinion in this case and Judge Wilkey's opinion for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Beattie v. United States, 244
U. S. App. D. C. 70, 756 F. 2d 91 (1984). Indeed, I am persuaded that the
79th Congress would have viewed torts committed by federal agents in
"desolate and extraordinarily dangerous" lands as falling squarely within
the central purpose of the FTCA. Ante, at 205.

5 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(b) provides:

"Subject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this title, the district courts,
together with the United States District Court for the District of the
Canal Zone and the District Court of the Virgin Islands, shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for
money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss
of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within
the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the

Stevens, J., dissenting
eign immunity in $ 2674.6 Neither of these sections identifies any territorial limit on the coverage of the Act. That
Congress intended and understood the broad language of
those two provisions to extend beyond the territory of the
United States is demonstrated by its enactment of two express exceptions from that coverage that would have been
unnecessary if the initial grant of jurisdiction and waiver of
immunity had been as narrow as the Government contends.
One of those, of course, is the "foreign country" exclusion in

$ 2680(k). See n. 6, supra. The other is the exclusion in

$ 2680(d) for claims asserted under the Suits in Admiralty
Act or the Public Vessels Act.7 Without that exclusion, a
party with a claim against the United States cognizable
under either of those venerable statutes would have had the
right to elect the pre-existing remedy or the newly enacted
FTCA remedy. Quite obviously that exclusion would have
been unnecessary if the FTCA waiver did not extend to the
sovereignless expanses of the high seas.

Indeed, it was the enactment of the FTCA in 1946 that
first subjected the United States to liability for maritime
negligence claims that could not be maintained under either
the Suits in Admiralty Act or the Public Vessels Act,8 in particular, claims arising from death or injury on the high seas.

United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred."

6 Section 2674 provides, in pertinent part:

"The United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title
relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a
private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages."

7 Section 2680(d) excludes from the coverage of the FTCA "[a]ny claim

for which a remedy is provided by sections 741-752, 781-790 of Title 46,
relating to claims or suits in admiralty against the United States."

8 See United States v. United Continental Tuna Corp., 425 U. S. 164,

could be brought only on the law side of the district courts under the

208 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
As enacted in 1920, the Death on the High Seas Act(DOHSA) provided a remedy against private parties but

contained no waiver of sovereign immunity.9 That changedwith the enactment of the FTCA, which waived the sovereign immunity of the United States for claims arising on thehigh seas under the DOHSA and the general maritime law.
See, e. g., United States v. Gavagan, 280 F. 2d 319, 321 (CA5
1960) (holding United States liable, under the FTCA and theDOHSA, for death resulting from negligent rescue efforts on

the high seas), cert. denied, 364 U. S. 933 (1961); Blumenthalv.

United States, 189 F. Supp. 439, 446-447 (ED Pa. 1960)

the Federal Tort Claims Act"), aff 'd, 306 F. 2d 16 (CA3 1962);
Kunkel v. United States, 140 F. Supp. 591, 594 (SD Cal. 1956)(same);

Moran v. United States, 102 F. Supp. 275 (Conn. 1951)
(holding that the FTCA waived the sovereign immunity of
the United States for claims arising from both personal injury and death on the high seas). See also McCormick v.
United States, 680 F. 2d 345, 349 (CA5 1982) (citing Moran
with approval); Roberts v. United States, 498 F. 2d 520, 525-
526 (CA9 1974) (noting that prior to 1960 amendments to
Suits in Admiralty Act, FTCA waived sovereign immunity
for claims under the general maritime law and the DOHSA).

In 1960, Congress amended the Suits in Admiralty Act so
as to bring all maritime torts asserted against the United
States, including those arising under the DOHSA, within the
purview of the Suits in Admiralty Act and thus outside the
waiver of sovereign immunity in the FTCA. See United
States v. United Continental Tuna Corp., 425 U. S. 164, 176,
n. 14 (1976). There can be no disputing the fact, however,
that at the time it was enacted, the FTCA waiver extended
to the sovereignless reaches of the high seas. Since the geographic scope of that waiver has never been amended, the

Government's submission that it is confined to territoryunder the jurisdiction of the United States is simply

untenable.That the 79th Congress intended the waiver of sovereign
immunity in the FTCA to extend to the high seas does not,of course, answer the question whether that waiver extends
to the sovereignless region of Antarctica. It does, however,undermine one premise of the Court's analysis: that the presumption against the extraterritorial application of federalstatutes supports its narrow construction of the geographic
reach of the FTCA. As the Court itself acknowledges, see
ante, at 204, that presumption operates "unless a contraryintent appears." Here, the contrary intent is unmistakable.

The same Congress that enacted the "foreign country" ex-ception to the broad waiver of sovereign immunity in $ 2674
subjected the United States to claims for wrongful death andinjury arising well beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the
United States. The presumption against extraterritorialapplication of federal statutes simply has no bearing on this
case. II

The Government, therefore, may not prevail unless Ant-arctica is a "foreign country" within the meaning of the exception in subsection (k). Properly, in my view, the Courtinquires as to how we are to construe this exception to the
FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity. Ante, at 203. In-stead of answering that question, however, the Court cites a
nebulous statement in United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S.111, 117-118 (1979), and simply asserts that construing the
foreign-country exception so as to deny recovery to this peti-tioner somehow accords with congressional intent.

Ante,at 203.

I had thought that canons of statutory construction weretools to be used to divine congressional intent, not empty
phrases used to ratify whatever result is desired in a partic-ular case. In any event, I would answer the question that

Stevens, J., dissenting
the Court poses, but then ignores. And as I read our cases,the answer is clear: Exceptions to the " `sweeping' " waiver

of sovereign immunity in the FTCA should be, and havebeen, "narrowly construed." United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (quoting United States v.
Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543, 547 (1951)).10 Accordingly,given a choice between two acceptable interpretations of the

term "country"--it may designate either a sovereign nationor an expanse of land--it is our duty to adopt the former.

Even without that rule of construction, we should favorthe interpretation of the term that the Court has previously
endorsed. Referring specifically to the term as used in theFTCA, we stated: "We know of no more accurate phrase in
common English usage than `foreign country' to denote terri-tory subject to the sovereignty of another nation."

UnitedStates v. Spelar, 338 U. S. 217, 219 (1949). That interpretation is consistent with a statutory scheme that imposes tortliability on the Government "in the same manner and to
the same extent as a private individual under like cir-cumstances," see n. 6, supra. As we explained in Spelar:
"[T]hough Congress was ready to lay aside a great portionof the sovereign's ancient and unquestioned immunity from
suit, it was unwilling to subject the United States to liabili-ties depending upon the laws of a foreign power." 338 U. S.,
at 221. Thus, the narrow interpretation of the term "for10 See also Block v. Neal, 460 U. S. 289, 298 (1983), and United States v.
Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 338 U. S. 366, 383 (1949). As we stated in
the latter:

"In argument before a number of District Courts and Courts of Appeals,
the Government relied upon the doctrine that statutes waiving sovereign
immunity must be strictly construed. We think that the congressional
attitude in passing the Tort Claims Act is more accurately reflected by
Judge Cardozo's statement . . . : `The exemption of the sovereign from suit
involves hardship enough where consent has been withheld. We are not
to add to its rigor by refinement of construction where consent has been
announced.' " Ibid. (quoting Anderson v. Hayes Construction Co., 243

eign country" is precisely tailored to make the scope of thesubsection (k) exception coextensive with its justification.

III
The Court seeks to buttress its interpretation of the "for-eign country" exception by returning to the language of the

jurisdictional grant in $ 1346(b). As I have noted, federalcourts have jurisdiction of civil claims against the United
States "for injury or loss of property, or personal injury ordeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of
any employee of the Government while acting within thescope of his office or employment, under circumstances
where the United States, if a private person, would be liableto the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where
the act or omission occurred." 11 Emphasizing the last dozenwords, the Court essentially argues that Antarctica is "a
place that has no law" and therefore it would be "bizarre" topredicate federal liability on its governing law. Ante, at
202.12Although the words the Court has italicized indicate that
Congress may not have actually thought about sovereignlessregions, they surely do not support the Court's conclusion.

11 The Court inaccurately refers to the jurisdictional grant as the section
that "waives the sovereign immunity of the United States," ante, at 201.
It is actually $ 2674 that waives immunity from liability by simply providing: "The United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this
title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as
a private individual under like circumstances . . . ." See n. 6, supra. The
Court does not quote $ 2674.

12 Apparently the Court is assuming that private contracts made in Antarctica are unenforceable and that there is no redress for torts committed
by private parties in sovereignless regions. Fortunately our legal system
is not that primitive. The statutory reference to "the law of the place
where the act or omission occurred" was unquestionably intended to identify the substantive law that would apply to a comparable act or omission
by a private party at that place. As long as private conduct is constrained
by rules of law, and it certainly is in Antarctica, see infra, at 212-213,
there is a governing "law of the place" within the meaning of the FTCA.

212 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
Those words, in conjunction with $ 2674, require an answerto the question whether a private defendant, in like circumstances, would be liable to the complainant. The Court failseven to ask that question, possibly because it is so obvious
that petitioner could maintain a cause of action against aprivate party whose negligence caused her husband's death
in Antarctica. It is simply wrong to suggest, as the Courtdoes, that Antarctica is "a place that has no law,"

ante, at201.
13

The relevant substantive law in this case is the law ofthe State of Oregon, where petitioner resides. As was well

settled at English common law before our Republic wasfounded, a nation's personal sovereignty over its own citizens
may support the exercise of civil jurisdiction in transitoryactions arising in places not subject to any sovereign. Mostyn v. Fabrigas, 98 Eng. Rep. 1021, 1032 (K. B. 1774). Seealso

Dutton v. Howell, 1 Eng. Rep. 17, 21 (H. L. 1693). Thisdoctrine of personal sovereignty is well recognized in our

cases. As Justice Holmes explained in American BananaCo. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347 (1909):

"No doubt in regions subject to no sovereign, like thehigh seas, or to no law that civilized countries would
recognize as adequate, such [civilized nations] may treatsome relations between their citizens as governed by
their own law, and keep to some extent the old notion ofpersonal sovereignty alive."

Id., at 355-356.

13 Indeed, it borders on the absurd to suggest that Antarctica is governed by nothing more than the law of the jungle. The United States
exercises both criminal jurisdiction, see 18 U. S. C. $ 7(7), and taxing jurisdiction, see 26 U. S. C. $ 863(d)(2)(A), over the approximately 2,500 Americans that live and work in and around Antarctica each year. See National
Science Foundation, Facts About the U. S. Antarctic Program 1 (July
1990). The National Science Foundation operates three year-round stations in Antarctica, the largest of which is composed of 85 buildings and
has a harbor, landing strips on sea ice and shelf ice, and a helicopter pad.
Ibid. Transportation to and from New Zealand is frequent during the
summer months. Id., at 2.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Holmes was referring to the assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction by the United States rather than an
individual State, but it is clear that the States also have
ample power to exercise legislative jurisdiction over the conduct of their own citizens abroad or on the high seas. As
we explained in Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U. S. 69 (1941):

"If the United States may control the conduct of its
citizens upon the high seas, we see no reason why the
State of Florida may not likewise govern the conduct of
its citizens upon the high seas with respect to matters
in which the State has a legitimate interest and where
there is no conflict with acts of Congress." Id., at 77.14

Surely the State of Oregon, the forum State, has a substantial interest in applying its civil tort law to a case involving
the allegedly wrongful death of the spouse of one of its residents. Certainly no other State has an interest in applying
its law to these facts. Moreover, application of Oregon's
substantive law would in no way conflict with an Act of Congress because Congress has expressly subjected the United
States to the laws of the various States for torts committed
by the United States and its agents. It is thus perfectly
clear that were the defendant in this case a private party,
there would be law to apply to determine that party's liability to petitioner. Given the plain language of $ 2674, I see
no basis for the Court's refusal to follow the statutory command and hold the United States "liable . . . in the same
manner and to the same extent as a private individual under
like circumstances."

14 Again, as Justice Holmes explained:
"[T]he bare fact of the parties being outside the territory [of the United
States] in a place belonging to no other sovereign would not limit the
authority of the State, as accepted by civilized theory. No one doubts the
power of England or France to govern their own ships upon the high
seas." The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398, 403 (1907).

214 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting

IV
Petitioner's action was filed "in the judicial district where
the plaintiff resides," as $ 1402(b) authorizes; there is, therefore, no objection to venue in this case. Because that provision would not provide a forum for a comparable action
brought by a nonresident alien, the statute contains an omission that is no stranger to our law. In our opinion in Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406
U. S. 706, 710, n. 8 (1972), we identified examples of "cases in
which the federal courts have jurisdiction but there is no
district in which venue is proper" and stated that "in construing venue statutes it is reasonable to prefer the construction that avoids leaving such a gap." (Emphasis added.)
Neither in that case nor in any other did we suggest that a
venue gap should be avoided by adopting a narrow construction of either a jurisdictional grant or the scope of a federal
cause of action. Yet that is the Court's perverse solution to
the narrow venue gap in the FTCA.

Because a hypothetical handful of nonresident aliens may
have no forum in which to seek relief for torts committed by
federal agents in outer space or in Antarctica, the Court decides that the scope of the remedy itself should be narrowly
construed. This anomalous conclusion surely derives no
support whatsoever from the basic decision to include aliens
as well as citizens within the protection of the statute, particularly since the overwhelming majority of aliens who may
have occasion to invoke the FTCA are surely residents. As
Judge Fletcher accurately observed in her dissenting opinion
in the Court of Appeals:

"Those who have no problem with venue should not be
foreclosed from bringing suit simply because others cannot, particularly with respect to a statute such as the
FTCA the primary purpose of which, as we have seen,
was to expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts."

Stevens, J., dissenting
At most, the imperfections in the statute indicate that in
1946 the 79th Congress did not specifically consider the likelihood of negligence actions arising in outer space or in a
sovereignless territory such as Antarctica. In view of the
fact that it did authorize actions against the United States
arising out of negligence on the high seas, see supra, at 207-
209, I am bewildered by the Court's speculation that if it had
expressly considered the equally dangerous area at issue in
this case, it would have distinguished between the two.
Ante, at 204-205. The claim asserted in this case is entirely
consistent with the central purpose of the entire Act.

Indeed, given that the choice is between imposing individual liability on federal agents for torts committed in the
course of their employment, on the one hand, or holding their
employer responsible, on the other hand, the amendment to
the FTCA adopted by Congress in 1988 sheds more light on
the issue presented in this case than the Court's unfounded
speculation about congressional intent. The congressional
findings explaining the decision to immunize federal employees from personal liability for negligence in the performance
of their duties indicate that Congress recognizes both the
practical value and the justice of a generous interpretation
of the FTCA.15 Moreover, those findings are thoroughly

15 In enacting the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, the stated purpose of which was "to protect Federal
employees from personal liability for common law torts committed within
the scope of their employment, while providing persons injured by the
common law torts of Federal employees with an appropriate remedy
against the United States," $ 2(b), 102 Stat. 4564, 28 U. S. C. $ 2671 note,
Congress made the following findings:

"(1) For more than 40 years the Federal Tort Claims Act has been the
legal mechanism for compensating persons injured by negligent or wrongful acts of Federal employees committed within the scope of their
employment.

"(2) The United States, through the Federal Tort Claims Act, is responsible to injured persons for the common law torts of its employees in the
same manner in which the common law historically has recognized the

consistent with the interpretative approach of the unusuallydistinguished panel of Circuit Judges who, shortly after the

FTCA was passed, wrote:

"When after many years of discussion and debate Con-gress has at length established a general policy of governmental generosity toward tort claimants, it wouldseem that that policy should not be set aside or hampered by a niggardly construction based on formal rulesmade obsolete by the very purpose of the Act itself. Particularly should this be true as to the broad terms ofcoverage employed in the basic grant of liability itself."
Spelar v. United States, 171 F. 2d 208, 209 (CA2 1948).16
The wisdom that prompted the Court's grant of certiorariis not reflected in its interpretation of the 1946 Act. Rather,

it reflects a vision that would exclude electronic eavesdrop-ping from the coverage of the Fourth Amendment and satellites from the coverage of the Commerce Clause. The inter-national community includes sovereignless places but no

responsibility of an employer for torts committed by its employees within
the scope of their employment.

"(3) Because Federal employees for many years have been protected
from personal common law tort liability by a broad based immunity, the
Federal Tort Claims Act has served as the sole means for compensating
persons injured by the tortious conduct of Federal employees.

"(4) Recent judicial decisions, and particularly the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in Westfall v. Erwin, have seriously eroded
the common law tort immunity previously available to Federal employees.

"(5) This erosion of immunity of Federal employees from common law
tort liability has created an immediate crisis involving the prospect of
personal liability and the threat of protracted personal tort litigation for
the entire Federal workforce.

"(6) The prospect of such liability will seriously undermine the morale
and well being of Federal employees, impede the ability of agencies to
carry out their missions, and diminish the vitality of the Federal Tort
Claims Act as the proper remedy for Federal employees torts." $ 2(a),

BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCILOF THE METROPOLITAN DISTRICT

v. ASSOCIATEDBUILDERS & CONTRACTORS OF MASSACHUSETTS/

RHODE ISLAND, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 91-261. Argued December 9, 1992--Decided March 8, 1993*
Following a lawsuit over its failure to prevent the pollution of

Boston Harbor, petitioner Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
(MWRA)--the state agency that provides, inter alia, sewage services
for eastern Massachusetts--was ordered to clean up the harbor. Under
state law, MWRA provides the funds for construction, owns the sewagetreatment facilities to be built, establishes all bid conditions, decides
all contract awards, pays the contractors, and generally supervises the
project. Petitioner Kaiser Engineers, Inc., the project manager selected by MWRA, negotiated an agreement with petitioner Building and
Construction Trades Council and affiliated organizations (BCTC) that
would assure labor stability over the life of the project, and MWRA
directed in Specification 13.1 of its solicitation for project bids that each
successful bidder must agree to abide by the labor agreement's terms.
Respondent organization, which represents nonunion construction industry employers, filed suit against petitioners, seeking, among other
things, to enjoin enforcement of Bid Specification 13.1 on the grounds
that it is pre-empted under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
The District Court denied the organization's motion for a preliminary
injunction, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that MWRA's
intrusion into the bargaining process was pervasive and not the sort
of peripheral regulation that would be permissible under San Diego
Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, and that Bid Specification 13.1 was pre-empted under Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132, because MWRA was regulating
activities that Congress intended to be unrestricted by governmental
power.

prehire collective-bargaining agreement negotiated by private parties.
This Court has articulated two distinct NLRA pre-emption principles:
"Garmon pre-emption" forbids state and local regulation of activities
that are protected by $ 7 of the NLRA or constitute an unfair labor
practice under $ 8, while "Machinists pre-emption" prohibits state and
municipal regulation of areas that have been left to be controlled by the
free play of economic forces. These pre-emption doctrines apply only
to state labor regulation, see, e. g., Machinists, 427 U. S., at 144. A
State may act without offending them when it acts as a proprietor and
its acts therefore are not tantamount to regulation or policymaking.
Permitting States to participate freely in the marketplace is not only
consistent with NLRA pre-emption principles generally but also, in this
case, promotes the legislative goals that animated the passage of the
NLRA's $$ 8(e) and (f) exceptions regarding prehire agreements in the
construction industry. It is undisputed that the agreement between
Kaiser and BCTC is a valid labor contract under $$ 8(e) and (f). In
enacting the exceptions, Congress intended to accommodate conditions
specific to the construction industry, and there is no reason to expect
the industry's defining features to depend upon the public or private
nature of the entity purchasing contracting services. Absent any express or implied indication by Congress that a State may not manage
its own property when pursuing a purely proprietary interest such as
MWRA's interest here, and where analogous private conduct would be
permitted, this Court will not infer such a restriction. Pp. 224-233.

Director of the Program Management Division of MWRA).MWRA has primary responsibility for the project. Under
its enabling statute and the Commonwealth's public-biddinglaws, MWRA provides the funds for construction (assisted
by state and federal grants), owns the sewage-treatment
facilities to be built, establishes all bid conditions, decides all
contract awards, pays the contractors, and generally supervises the project. See 935 F. 2d, at 347 (citing Mass. Gen.
Laws Ann., ch. 92 App., $ 1-1 et seq. (1993). Mass. Gen.
Laws $$ 149:44A to 149:44I, and 30:39M (1990)).

In the spring of 1988, MWRA selected Kaiser Engineers,
Inc., as its project manager. Kaiser was to be primarily in
charge of managing and supervising construction activity.
Kaiser also was to advise MWRA on the development of a
labor-relations policy that would maintain worksite harmony,
labor-management peace, and overall stability throughout
the duration of the project. To that end, Kaiser suggested
to MWRA that Kaiser be permitted to negotiate an agreement with the Building and Construction Trades Council and
affiliated organizations (BCTC) that would assure labor
stability over the life of the project. App. to Pet. for Cert.
in No. 91-274, p. 75a (MWRA Pet. App.). MWRA accepted
Kaiser's suggestion, and Kaiser accordingly proceeded to
negotiate the Boston Harbor Wastewater Treatment Facilities Project Labor Agreement (Agreement). Ibid. The
Agreement included: recognition of BCTC as the exclusive
bargaining agent for all craft employees; use of specified
methods for resolving all labor-related disputes; a requirement that all employees be subject to union-security provi507US1$39F 11-18-96 20:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

sions compelling them to become union members withinseven days of their employment; the primary use of BCTC's

hiring halls to supply the project's craft labor force; a 10-year no-strike commitment; and a requirement that all contractors and subcontractors agree to be bound by the Agree-ment. 935 F. 2d, at 348. See generally MWRA Pet. App.
107a (full text of Agreement). MWRA's board of directorsapproved and adopted the Agreement in May 1989 and directed that Bid Specification 13.1 be incorporated into itssolicitation of bids for work on the project.

1 935 F. 2d, at

347. Bid Specification 13.1 provides in pertinent part:

"[E]ach successful bidder and any and all levels of sub-contractors, as a condition of being awarded a contract

or subcontract, will agree to abide by the provisions ofthe Boston Harbor Wastewater Treatment Facilities
Project Labor Agreement as executed and effectiveMay 22, 1989, by and between Kaiser . . . on behalf
of [MWRA] and [BCTC] . . . and will be bound by theprovisions of that agreement in the same manner as any
other provision of the contract." MWRA Pet. App.141a-142a.

In March 1990, a contractors' association not a party tothis litigation filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) contending that the Agreement violatedthe NLRA. The NLRB General Counsel refused to issue a
complaint, finding: (1) that the Agreement is a valid prehireagreement under $ 8(f ) of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. $ 158(f),
which authorizes such agreements in the construction indus1 Massachusetts competitive-bidding laws require MWRA to state its
preference for a contract term, such as a project labor agreement, in the
form of a bid specification. These laws, which MWRA's Enabling Act explicitly incorporates, see Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 92 App., $ 1-8(g) (1993)
(incorporating Mass. Gen. Laws $$ 30:39M, and 149:44A to 149:44H), require that the competitive-bidding process be carried out by the awarding

try; and (2) that the Agreement's provisions limiting workon the project to contractors who agree to abide by the

Agreement are lawful under the construction-industry pro-viso to $ 8(e), 29 U. S. C. $ 158(e). This proviso sets forth an
exception from $ 8(e)'s prohibition against "hot cargo" agreements that require an employer to refrain from doing busi-ness with any person not agreeing to be bound by a prehire

agreement. Building & Trades Council (Kaiser Engineers,
Inc.), Case 1-CE-71, NLRB Advice Memo, June 25, 1990,
MWRA Pet. App. 88a.Also in March 1990, respondent Associated Builders and

Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc. (ABC), an
organization representing nonunion construction-industry
employers, brought this suit against MWRA, Kaiser, and
BCTC, seeking, among other things, to enjoin enforcement
of Bid Specification 13.1. ABC alleged pre-emption under
the NLRA, pre-emption under $ 514(c) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 897, 29
U. S. C. $ 1144(c) (ERISA), violations of the Equal Protection
and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment,
conspiracy to reduce competition in violation of the Sherman
Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1, and various
state-law claims. Only NLRA pre-emption is at issue here.

The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts rejected each of ABC's claims and denied its motion
for a preliminary injunction. MWRA Pet. App. 76a-83a.
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and directed entry of a preliminary injunction restraining the use
of Bid Specification 13.1, reaching only the issue of NLRA
pre-emption. 135 LRRM 2713 (1990). The Court of Appeals subsequently granted a petition for rehearing en banc,
vacating the panel opinion. MWRA Pet. App. 84a. Upon
rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals, by a 3-to-2 vote,
again reversed the judgment of the District Court, once
more reaching only the pre-emption issue. 935 F. 2d, at

bargaining process was pervasive and not the sort of periph-eral regulation that would be permissible under San Diego

Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959).See 935 F. 2d, at 353. It also held that Bid Specification 13.1
was pre-empted under Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132 (1976), becauseMWRA was regulating activities that Congress intended

to be unrestricted by governmental power. Because of theimportance of the issue, we granted certiorari, 504 U. S.
908 (1992). II

The NLRA contains no express pre-emption provision.Therefore, in accordance with settled pre-emption principles,
we should not find MWRA's bid specification pre-empted" ` "unless it conflicts with federal law or would frustrate the
federal scheme, or unless [we] discern from the totality ofthe circumstances that Congress sought to occupy the field
to the exclusion of the States." ' " Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 747-748 (1985) (citationsomitted). We are reluctant to infer pre-emption. See

Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 516 (1992);Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947).
"Consideration under the Supremacy Clause starts with thebasic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace
state law." Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746(1981). With these general principles in mind, we turn to
the particular pre-emption doctrines that have developedaround the NLRA.

In Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S.,at 748, we noted: "The Court has articulated two distinct
NLRA pre-emption principles." The first, "Garmon pre-emption," see San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, supra, forbids state and local regulation of activitiesthat are "protected by $ 7 of the [NLRA], or constitute an
unfair labor practice under $ 8." 359 U. S., at 244. See alsoGarner v. Teamsters, 346 U. S. 485, 498-499 (1953) ("[W]hen

Opinion of the Court
two separate remedies are brought to bear on the sameactivity, a conflict is imminent").

Garmon pre-emption
prohibits regulation even of activities that the NLRA only
arguably protects or prohibits. See Wisconsin Dept. of
Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 286 (1986). This rule
of pre-emption is designed to prevent conflict between, onthe one hand, state and local regulation and, on the other,

Congress' "integrated scheme of regulation," Garmon, 359U. S., at 247, embodied in $$ 7 and 8 of the NLRA, which
includes the choice of the NLRB, rather than state or fed-eral courts, as the appropriate body to implement the Act.
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S., at
748-749, and n. 26.

In Garmon, this Court held that a state court was precluded from awarding damages to employers for economic
injuries resulting from peaceful picketing by labor unions
that had not been selected by a majority of employees as
their bargaining agent. 359 U. S., at 246. The Court said:
"Our concern is with delimiting areas of conduct which must
be free from state regulation if national policy is to be left
unhampered." Ibid. In Gould, we held that the NLRA
pre-empts a statute that disqualifies from doing business
with the State persons who have violated the NLRA three
times within a 5-year period. We emphasized there that
"the Garmon rule prevents States not only from setting
forth standards of conduct inconsistent with the substantive
requirements of the NLRA, but also from providing their
own regulatory or judicial remedies for conduct prohibited
or arguably prohibited by the Act." 475 U. S., at 286 (citing
359 U. S., at 247).

A second pre-emption principle, "Machinists preemption," see Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S., at 147, prohibits state and municipal regulation of areas that have been left " `to be controlled
by the free play of economic forces.' " Id., at 140 (citation
omitted). See also Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los

(Golden State II). Machinists pre-emption preservesCongress' "intentional balance ` "between the uncontrolled
power of management and labor to further their respectiveinterests." ' "

Golden State I, 475 U. S., at 614 (citationsomitted).

In Machinists, we held that the Wisconsin EmploymentRelations Commission could not designate as an unfair labor
practice under state law a concerted refusal by a union andits members to work overtime, because Congress did not
mean such self-help activity to be regulable by the States.427 U. S., at 148-150. We said that it would frustrate Congress' intent to "sanction state regulation of such economicpressure deemed by the federal Act `desirabl[y] . . . left for
the free play of contending economic forces . . . ." Id., at150 (citation omitted). In

Golden State I, we applied theMachinists doctrine to hold that the city of Los Angeles was

pre-empted from conditioning renewal of a taxicab operatinglicense upon the settlement of a labor dispute. 475 U. S., at
618. We reiterated the principle that a "local government. . . lacks the authority to ` "introduce some standard of properly `balanced' bargaining power" . . . or to define "what eco-nomic sanctions might be permitted negotiating parties in an
`ideal' or `balanced' state of collective bargaining." ' " Id.,at 619 (quoting

Machinists, 427 U. S., at 149-150) (internalcitation omitted). In

Golden State II, supra, we determinedthat the taxicab employer who was challenging the city's conduct in Golden State I was entitled to maintain an actionunder 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for compensatory damages against
the city. In so holding, we stated that the Machinists rulecreated a zone free from all regulations, whether state or
federal. 493 U. S., at 112. III

When we say that the NLRA pre-empts state law, wemean that the NLRA prevents a State from regulating

227Cite as: 507 U. S. 218 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
within a protected zone, whether it be a zone protected andreserved for market freedom, see

Machinists, or for NLRB
jurisdiction, see Garmon. A State does not regulate, how-ever, simply by acting within one of these protected areas.

When a State owns and manages property, for example, it
must interact with private participants in the marketplace.In so doing, the State is not subject to pre-emption by the

NLRA, because pre-emption doctrines apply only to state
regulation.

Our decisions in this area support the distinction betweengovernment as regulator and government as proprietor.

We have held consistently that the NLRA was intended to
supplant state labor regulation, not all legitimate state activity that affects labor. In Machinists, for example, we referred to Congress' pre-emptive intent to "leave some activities unregulated," 427 U. S., at 144 (emphasis added), and
held that the activities at issue--workers deciding together
to refuse overtime work--were not "regulable by States,"
id., at 149 (emphasis added). In Golden State I, we held
that the reason Los Angeles could not condition renewal of
a taxicab franchise upon settlement of a labor dispute was
that "Machinists pre-emption . . . precludes state and municipal regulation `concerning conduct that Congress intended
to be unregulated.' " 475 U. S., at 614 (emphasis added)
(quoting Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471
U. S., at 749). We refused to permit the city's exercise of its
regulatory power of license nonrenewal to restrict Golden
State's right to use lawful economic weapons in its dispute
with its union. See 475 U. S., at 615-619. As petitioners
point out, a very different case would have been presented
had the city of Los Angeles purchased taxi services from
Golden State in order to transport city employees. Brief for
Petitioners 35. In that situation, if the strike had produced
serious interruptions in the services the city had purchased,
the city would not necessarily have been pre-empted from
advising Golden State that it would hire another company if

Opinion of the Court

the labor dispute were not resolved and services resumed bya specific deadline.

In Gould, we rejected the argument that the State wasacting as proprietor rather than regulator for purposes of
Garmon pre-emption when the State refused to do business
with persons who had violated the NLRA three times withinfive years. We noted in doing so that

in that case, "debarment . . . serves plainly as a means of enforcing the NLRA."475 U. S., at 287. We said there that "[t]he State concedes,

as we think it must, that the point of the statute is to deterlabor law violations"; we concluded that "[n]o other purpose
could credibly be ascribed." Ibid.Respondents quote the following passage from

Gould, arguing that it stands for the proposition that the State as
proprietor is subject to the same pre-emption limitations asthe State as regulator:

"Nothing in the NLRA, of course, prevents private
purchasers from boycotting labor law violators. But
government occupies a unique position of power in oursociety, and its conduct, regardless of form, is rightly

subject to special restraints. Outside the area of Com-merce Clause jurisprudence, it is far from unusual for
federal law to prohibit States from making spendingdecisions in ways that are permissible for private
parties . . . . The NLRA, moreover, has long been un-derstood to protect a range of conduct against state but
not private interference . . . . The Act treats state action differently from private action not merely becausethey frequently take different forms, but also because in

our system States simply are different from private
parties and have a different role to play." Id., at 290.

The above passage does not bear the weight that respondents would have it support. The conduct at issue in Gould
was a state agency's attempt to compel conformity with the
NLRA. Because the statute at issue in Gould addressed

507US1$39F 11-18-96 20:04:59 PAGES OPINPGT

229Cite as: 507 U. S. 218 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
employer conduct unrelated to the employer's performance
of contractual obligations to the State, and because the
State's reason for such conduct was to deter NLRA violations, we concluded: "Wisconsin `simply is not functioning as
a private purchaser of services,' . . . [and therefore,] for all
practical purposes, Wisconsin's debarment scheme is tantamount to regulation." Id., at 289. We emphasized that we
were "not say[ing] that state purchasing decisions may never
be influenced by labor considerations." Id., at 291.

The conceptual distinction between regulator and purchaser exists to a limited extent in the private sphere as
well. A private actor, for example, can participate in a boycott of a supplier on the basis of a labor policy concern rather
than a profit motive. See id., at 290. The private actor
under such circumstances would be attempting to "regulate"
the suppliers and would not be acting as a typical proprietor.
The fact that a private actor may "regulate" does not mean,
of course, that the private actor may be "pre-empted" by the
NLRA; the Supremacy Clause does not require pre-emption
of private conduct. Private actors therefore may "regulate"
as they please, as long as their conduct does not violate the
law. As the above passage in Gould makes clear, however,
States have a qualitatively different role to play from private
parties. Ibid. When the State acts as regulator, it performs a role that is characteristically a governmental rather
than a private role, boycotts notwithstanding. Moreover, as
regulator of private conduct, the State is more powerful than
private parties. These distinctions are far less significant
when the State acts as a market participant with no interest
in setting policy.

In Gould, we did not address fully the implications of these
distinctions. We left open the question whether a State
may act without offending the pre-emption principles of the
NLRA when it acts as a proprietor and its acts therefore are
not "tantamount to regulation" or policymaking. As ex507US1$39F 11-18-96 20:04:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court

plained more fully below, we now answer this question inthe affirmative.

IV
Permitting the States to participate freely in the market-place is not only consistent with NLRA pre-emption principles generally but also, in these cases, promotes the legisla-tive goals that animated the passage of the $$ 8(e) and (f)
exceptions for the construction industry. In 1959, Congressamended the NLRA to add $ 8(f) and modify $ 8(e). Section
8(f) explicitly permits employers in the construction indus-try--but no other employers--to enter into prehire agreements. Prehire agreements are collective-bargaining agree-ments providing for union recognition, compulsory union
dues or equivalents, and mandatory use of union hiring halls,prior to the hiring of any employees. 935 F. 2d, at 356; Jim
McNeff, Inc. v. Todd, 461 U. S. 260, 265-266 (1983). The1959 amendment adding a proviso to subsection (e) permits
a general contractor's prehire agreement to require an em-ployer not to hire other contractors performing work on that
particular project site unless they agree to become bound bythe terms of that labor agreement. See

Woelke & RomeroFraming, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U. S. 645, 657 (1982). Section

8(f) contains a final proviso that permits employees, oncehired, to utilize the NLRB election process under $$ 9(c) and
(e) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. $$ 159(c) and (e), if they wish toreject the bargaining representative or to cancel the union
security provisions of the prehire agreement. See NLRB v.
Iron Workers, 434 U. S. 335, 345 (1978).It is undisputed that the Agreement between Kaiser and

BCTC is a valid labor contract under $$ 8(e) and (f). Asnoted above, those sections explicitly authorize this type of
contract between a union and an employer like Kaiser, whichis engaged primarily in the construction industry, covering
employees engaged in that industry.Of course, the exceptions provided for the construction
industry in $$ 8(e) and (f), like the prohibitions from which

507US1$39F 11-18-96 20:04:59 PAGES OPINPGT

231Cite as: 507 U. S. 218 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
they provide relief, are not made specifically applicable tothe State. This is because the State is excluded from the

definition of the term "employer" under the NLRA, see29 U. S. C. $ 152(2), and because the State, in any event, is
acting not as an employer but as a purchaser in this case.
Nevertheless, the general goals behind passage of $$ 8(e)and (f ) are still relevant to determining what Congress

intended with respect to the State and its relationship tothe agreements authorized by these sections.

It is evident from the face of the statute that in enactingexemptions authorizing certain kinds of project labor agreements in the construction industry, Congress intended to
accommodate conditions specific to that industry. Such conditions include, among others, the short-term nature of employment which makes posthire collective bargaining difficult, the contractor's need for predictable costs and a steady
supply of skilled labor, and a longstanding custom of prehire
bargaining in the industry. See S. Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong.,
1st Sess., 28, 55-56 (1959); H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong.,
1st Sess., 19-20 (1959).

There is no reason to expect these defining features of the
construction industry to depend upon the public or private
nature of the entity purchasing contracting services. To the
extent that a private purchaser may choose a contractor
based upon that contractor's willingness to enter into a prehire agreement, a public entity as purchaser should be permitted to do the same. Confronted with such a purchaser,
those contractors who do not normally enter such agreements are faced with a choice. They may alter their usual
mode of operation to secure the business opportunity at
hand, or seek business from purchasers whose perceived
needs do not include a project labor agreement. In the absence of any express or implied indication by Congress that
a State may not manage its own property when it pursues
its purely proprietary interests, and where analogous private
conduct would be permitted, this Court will not infer such a

restriction. See, e. g., Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at746 ("Consideration under the Supremacy Clause starts with

the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displacestate law").

2 Indeed, there is some force to petitioners' argument, Brief for Petitioners 25, that denying an option topublic owner-developers that is available to private ownerdevelopers itself places a restriction on Congress' intendedfree play of economic forces identified in

Machinists.

V
In the instant case, MWRA acted on the advice of a man-ager hired to organize performance of a cleanup job over

which, under Massachusetts law, MWRA is the proprietor.There is no question but that MWRA was attempting to ensure an efficient project that would be completed as quicklyand effectively as possible at the lowest cost. As petitioners
note, moreover, Brief for Petitioners 26, the challenged ac-tion in this litigation was specifically tailored to one particular job, the Boston Harbor cleanup project. There is there-fore no basis on which to distinguish the incentives at work
here from those that operate elsewhere in the constructionindustry, incentives that this Court has recognized as legitimate. See Woelke & Romero Framing Co. v. NLRB, 456U. S., at 662, and n. 14.

We hold today that Bid Specification 13.1 is not govern-ment regulation and that it is therefore subject to neither
Garmon nor Machinists pre-emption. Bid Specification13.1 constitutes proprietary conduct on the part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which legally has enforced avalid project labor agreement. As Chief Judge Breyer aptly

2 Respondents suggest in their brief, Brief for Respondents 22, n. 12,
that under H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99, 103 (1970), $ 8(d) of the
NLRA expressly prohibits the conduct of MWRA at issue in this case.
The Court of Appeals did not rely on this section of the statute, nor did
we grant certiorari on this question. We therefore decline the invitation
to address the application, if any, of $ 8(d) to Bid Specification 13.1.

noted in his dissent in the Court of Appeals, "when theMWRA, acting in the role of purchaser of construction services, acts just like a private contractor would act, and condi-tions its purchasing upon the very sort of labor agreement
that Congress explicitly authorized and expected frequentlyto find, it does not `regulate' the workings of the market
forces that Congress expected to find; it exemplifies them."935 F. 2d, at 361.

Because we find that Bid Specification 13.1 is not pre-empted by the NLRA, it follows that a preliminary injunction against enforcement of this bid specification was im-proper. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court
of Appeals and remand these cases for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Syllabus

ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-7749. Argued December 7, 1992--Decided March 8, 1993
In United States v. Holmes, 680 F. 2d 1372, 1373, the Court of Appeals

held that "a defendant who flees after conviction, but before sentencing,
waives his right to appeal from the conviction unless he can establish
that his absence was due to matters completely beyond his control."
Relying on that authority, and without further explanation, the court
issued a per curiam order dismissing the appeal of petitioner, who failed
to appear for sentencing following his conviction on federal narcotics
charges, but was recaptured before he filed his appeal.

Held: When a defendant's flight and recapture occur before appeal, the

defendant's former fugitive status may well lack the kind of connection
to the appellate process that would justify an appellate sanction of dismissal. Pp. 239-252.

(a) This Court's settled rule that dismissal is an appropriate sanction
when a convicted defendant is a fugitive during "the ongoing appellate
process," see Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534, 542, n. 11, is amply
supported by a number of justifications, including concerns about the
enforceability of the appellate court's judgment against the fugitive, see,
e. g., Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97; the belief that flight disentitles
the fugitive to relief, see Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, 366; the
desire to promote the "efficient . . . operation" of the appellate process
and to protect the "digni[ty]" of the appellate court, see Estelle, 420
U. S., at 537; and the view that the threat of dismissal deters escapes,
see ibid. Pp. 239-242.

(b) The foregoing rationales do not support a rule of dismissal for all
appeals filed by former fugitives who are returned to custody before
they invoke the jurisdiction of the appellate tribunal. These justifications all assume some connection between the defendant's fugitive status and the appellate process, sufficient to make an appellate sanction a
reasonable response. When both flight and recapture occur while a
case is pending before the district court, the justifications are necessarily attenuated and often will not apply. Pp. 242-249.

(c) This Court does not hold that a court of appeals is entirely without
authority to dismiss an appeal because of fugitive status predating the

on the appellate process sufficient to warrant an appellate sanction. As
this case reaches the Court, however, there is no indication in the record
that the Court of Appeals made such a judgment under the standard
here announced. Application of the Holmes rule, as formulated by the
lower court thus far, does not require the kind of connection between
fugitivity and the appellate process that is necessary; instead it may
rest on nothing more than the faulty premise that any act of judicial
defiance, whether or not it affects the appellate process, is punishable
by appellate dismissal. Pp. 249-252.

from the conviction unless he can establish that his absencewas due to matters completely beyond his control." Relying
on that authority, and without further explanation, the courtdismissed petitioner's appeal.

In the early evening of November 7, 1988, a Customs Serv-ice pilot was patrolling the Cay Sal Bank area, located midway between Cuba and the Florida Keys. Approximately30 miles southwest of Cay Sal, the pilot observed a low-flying
aircraft circling over a white boat and dropping bales. Theboat, described by the pilot as 40 to 50 feet in length, was
circling with the plane and retrieving the bales from thewater as they dropped. Because the Customs Service plane
was flying at an altitude of 2,500 feet, and visibility was lessthan optimal, the pilot was unable to identify the name of
the boat. United States v. Mieres-Borges, 919 F. 2d 652,654-655 (CA11 1990), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 980 (1991);
Report and Recommendation in United States v. Ortega-Rodriguez, No. 88-10035-CR-KING (SD Fla., Feb. 23, 1989).

The following morning, another Customs Service pilotfound the Wilfred, a boat resembling the one spotted approximately 12 hours earlier. This boat, located just off thebeach of Cay Sal, was described as a 30- to 40-foot sportfishing vessel. Upon making this discovery, the pilot firstflew to the drop point identified the night before, 30 miles
away, and found no activity. Returning to Cay Sal, he founda number of bales stacked on the beach, and the

Wilfredunderway and headed toward Cuba.

The pilot alerted the captain of a Coast Guard cutter, whointercepted, boarded, and searched the

Wilfred. He foundno narcotics, weapons, or other incriminating evidence on the

boat. Nevertheless, the three members of the crew failed toconvince the Coast Guard that they were fishing for dolphin,
although a large number of similar vessels frequently do soin the area. Mieres-Borges, 919 F. 2d, at 655-657, 659-660.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner is one of the three crew members arrested,tried, and convicted of possession with intent to distribute,

and conspiring to possess with intent to distribute, over fivekilograms of cocaine. After the trial, the District Court set
June 15, 1989, as the date for sentencing. Petitioner did not
appear and was sentenced in absentia to a prison term of 19years and 7 months, to be followed by 5 years of supervised

release.2 Though petitioner's codefendants appealed theirconvictions and sentences, no appeal from the judgment was
filed on petitioner's behalf.The District Court issued a warrant for petitioner's arrest,
and 11 months later, on May 24, 1990, he was apprehended.Petitioner was indicted and found guilty of contempt of

Opinion of the Court
Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. $ 3551 et seq., the DistrictCourt imposed a prison sentence of 21 months, to be served

after the completion of the sentence on the cocaine offensesand to be followed by a 3-year term of supervised release.

While petitioner was under indictment after his arrest, theCourt of Appeals disposed of his two codefendants' appeals.

The court affirmed one conviction, but reversed the other
because the evidence was insufficient to establish guilt be-yond a reasonable doubt.

6 Also after petitioner was taken

into custody, his attorney filed a "motion to vacate sentenceand for resentencing," as well as a motion for judgment of

acquittal. The District Court denied the latter but grantedthe former, vacating the judgment previously entered on the
cocaine convictions.7 The District Court then resentenced

more than one year, or both; and

"(B) if the person was released for appearance as a material witness,
a fine under this chapter or imprisonment for not more than one year,

"(2) A term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be consecutive to the sentence of imprisonment for any other offense.

"(c) Affirmative Defense.--It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that uncontrollable circumstances prevented the
person from appearing or surrendering, and that the person did not contribute to the creation of such circumstances in reckless disregard of the
requirement to appear or surrender, and that the person appeared or surrendered as soon as such circumstances ceased to exist."

661, though the dissenting judge viewed the evidence as insufficient as to
both appealing defendants, id., at 663-664. Petitioner represents that he
is situated identically to the codefendant whose conviction was reversed,
with nothing in the record that would support a distinction between their
cases. The Government does not take issue with that representation, but
maintains that the evidence is sufficient to support all three convictions.

Opinion of the Court
petitioner to a prison term of 15 years and 8 months, to befollowed by a 5-year period of supervised release.

8 Petitioner filed a timely appeal from that final judgment.9On appeal, petitioner argued that the same insufficiency of

the evidence rationale underlying reversal of his codefend-ant's conviction should apply in his case, because precisely
the same evidence was admitted against the two defendants.Without addressing the merits of this contention, the Government moved to dismiss the appeal. The Government'smotion was based entirely on the fact that petitioner had
become a fugitive after his conviction and before his initialsentencing, so that "[u]nder the holding in

Holmes, he cannotnow challenge his 1989 conviction for conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine." 10 In a per curiamorder, the Court of Appeals granted the motion to dismiss.

II
It has been settled for well over a century that an appel-late court may dismiss the appeal of a defendant who is a

fugitive from justice during the pendency of his appeal. TheSupreme Court applied this rule for the first time in

Smithv. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876), to an escaped defendant

who remained at large when his petition arose before theCourt. Under these circumstances, the Court explained,
there could be no assurance that any judgment it issued

8 Id., at 51-56.
9 Id., at 57. This sequence of events makes petitioner's case somewhat

unusual. Had the District Court denied petitioner's motion for resentencing, petitioner would have been barred by applicable time limits from appealing his initial sentence and judgment. Petitioner was able to file a
timely appeal only because the District Court granted his motion to resentence. Entry of the second sentence and judgment, from which petitioner
noticed his appeal, is treated as the relevant "sentencing" for purposes of
this opinion. We have no occasion here to comment on the propriety of
either the District Court's initial decision to sentence in absentia, or its
subsequent decision to resentence.

Opinion of the Court
would prove enforceable. The Court concluded that it is"clearly within our discretion to refuse to hear a criminal

case in error, unless the convicted party, suing out the writ,is where he can be made to respond to any judgment we may
render." Ibid. On two subsequent occasions, we gave thesame rationale for dismissals based on the fugitive status of
defendants while their cases were pending before our Court.
Bohanan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887); Eisler v. UnitedStates, 338 U. S. 189 (1949).

11

Enforceability is not, however, the only explanation wehave offered for the fugitive dismissal rule. In Molinaro v.

New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, 366 (1970), we identified an addi-tional justification for dismissal of an escaped prisoner's
pending appeal:

"No persuasive reason exists why this Court should pro-ceed to adjudicate the merits of a criminal case after the

convicted defendant who has sought review escapesfrom the restraints placed upon him pursuant to the conviction. While such an escape does not strip the caseof its character as an adjudicable case or controversy,
we believe it disentitles the defendant to call upon theresources of the Court for determination of his claims."

As applied by this Court, then, the rule allowing dismissalof fugitives' appeals has rested in part on enforceability concerns, and in part on a "disentitlement" theory that con-strues a defendant's flight during the pendency of his appeal
as tantamount to waiver or abandonment.

11 The dissenting Justices in Eisler, noting that the case was not rendered moot by Eisler's escape, believed that the Court should have exercised its discretion to decide the merits in light of the importance of the
issue presented. See 338 U. S., at 194 (Murphy, J., dissenting); id., at 195
(Jackson, J., dissenting). In United States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675 (1985),
despite the respondent's fugitive status, the Court declined to remand the
case to the Court of Appeals with directions to dismiss, and proceeded to
decide the merits. Id., at 681, n. 2. See also id., at 688 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring); id., at 721-723 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Opinion of the Court
That ensuring enforceability is not the sole rationale forfugitive dismissals is also evident from our review of state

provisions regarding escaped prisoners' pending appeals.In Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138 (1897), we upheld not only
a state court's dismissal of a fugitive's appeal, but also itsrefusal to reinstate the appeal after the defendant's recapture, when enforceability would no longer be at issue. Wefollowed

Allen in Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534 (1975),upholding the constitutionality of a Texas statute providing

for automatic appellate dismissal when a defendant escapesduring the pendency of his appeal, unless the defendant voluntarily returns within 10 days. Although the defendant in
Estelle had been recaptured before his appeal was consid-ered and dismissed, resolving any enforceability problems,

there were, we held, other reasons for dismissal. Referringto our own dismissal in Molinaro, we found that the state
statute served "similar ends . . . . It discourages the felonyof escape and encourages voluntary surrenders. It promotes the efficient, dignified operation of the Texas Courtof Criminal Appeals." 420 U. S., at 537 (footnotes omitted).

Estelle went on to consider whether the Texas statute wasirrational because it applied only to prisoners with appeals
pending when they fled custody. Citing the "peculiar prob-lems posed by escape of a prisoner during the ongoing appellate process," id., at 542, n. 11, we concluded that it was not.The distinct concerns implicated by an escape pending appeal justified a special rule for such appeals:

"Texas was free to deal more severely with those whosimultaneously invoked the appellate process and escaped from its custody than with those who first escapedfrom its custody, returned, and then invoked the appellate process within the time permitted by law. Whileeach class of prisoners sought to escape, the first did so
in the very midst of their invocation of the appellateprocess, while the latter did so before returning to custody and commencing that process. If Texas is free to

242 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
adopt a policy which deters escapes by prisoners, as allof our cases make clear that it is, it is likewise free to

impose more severe sanctions on those whose escape isreasonably calculated to disrupt the very appellate process which they themselves have set in motion." Id., at541-542.

Thus, our cases consistently and unequivocally approvedismissal as an appropriate sanction when a prisoner is a
fugitive during "the ongoing appellate process." Moreover,this rule is amply supported by a number of justifications.
In addition to addressing the enforceability concerns identi-fied in

Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876), and Boha-nan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887), dismissal by an appellate court after a defendant has fled its jurisdiction servesan important deterrent function and advances an interest in
efficient, dignified appellate practice. Estelle, 420 U. S., at537. What remains for our consideration is whether the
same rationales support a rule mandating dismissal of an ap-peal of a defendant who flees the jurisdiction of a district
court, and is recaptured before he invokes the jurisdiction ofthe appellate tribunal.

III
In 1982, the Government persuaded the Eleventh Circuitthat our reasoning in Molinaro should be extended to the

appeal of a "former fugitive," returned to custody prior tosentencing and notice of appeal.

12 The Court of Appeals

12 For present purposes, the time of sentencing and the time of appeal
may be treated together, as the two dates normally must occur within 10
days of one another. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b); see also n. 9, supra;
Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 314-315 (1988) (discussing
mandatory nature of Rule 4 time limits). Cases in which a defendant flees
during that 10-day interval will be resolved easily: If the defendant fails
to file a timely appeal, his case concludes; if the defendant's attorney files
an appeal for him in his absence, the appeal will be subject to dismissal
under straightforward application of Smith and Molinaro. Should a defendant flee after sentencing but return before appeal--in other words,

243Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
recognized in Holmes that all of the cases on which the Gov-ernment relied were distinguishable, "because each involved

a defendant who fled after filing a notice of appeal." 680F. 2d, at 1373 (emphasis added). The court was satisfied,
however, that the disentitlement rationale of Molinaro "isequally forceful whether the defendant flees before or after
sentencing." 680 F. 2d, at 1374. The Eleventh Circuit alsoexpressed concern that absent dismissal, the Government
might be prejudiced by delays in proceedings resulting frompresentencing escapes.

13

The rule of Holmes differs from that applied in Molinaroin three key respects. First, of course, the

Holmes rulereaches defendants who flee while their cases are before district courts, as well as those who flee while their appealsare pending. Second, the Holmes rule, unlike the rule of
Molinaro, will not mandate dismissal of an entire appealwhenever it is invoked. As the Eleventh Circuit explained,
because flight cannot fairly be construed as a waiver of ap-peal from errors occurring after recapture, defendants who
flee presentencing retain their right to appeal sentencing er-rors, though they lose the right to appeal their

convictions.680 F. 2d, at 1373.
14 Finally, as announced in Holmes and

should his period of fugitivity begin after sentencing and end less than 10
days later--then a timely filed appeal would be subject to the principles
we apply today.

13 The court reasoned that the right of appeal, purely a creature of statute, may be waived by failure to file a timely notice of appeal "or by
abandonment through flight which may postpone filing a notice of appeal
for years after conviction." Holmes, 680 F. 2d, at 1373-1374. The court
then explained: "Such untimeliness would make a meaningful appeal impossible in many cases. In case of a reversal, the government would obviously be prejudiced in locating witnesses and retrying the case." Id.,
at 1374.

14 "We hold that a defendant who flees after conviction, but before sentencing, waives his right to appeal from the conviction unless he can establish that his absence was due to matters completely beyond his control.
Such a defendant does not waive his right to appeal from any alleged
errors connected to his sentencing." Id., at 1373 (emphasis added).

244 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
applied in this case, the Eleventh Circuit rule appears to callfor automatic dismissal, rather than an exercise of discretion.

See n. 11, supra.In our view, the rationales that supported dismissal in
cases like Molinaro and Estelle should not be extended asfar as the Eleventh Circuit has taken them. Our review of
rules adopted by the courts of appeals in their supervisorycapacity is limited in scope, but it does demand that such
rules represent reasoned exercises of the courts' authority.See

Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140, 146-148 (1985). Accord-ingly, the justifications we have advanced for allowing appellate courts to dismiss pending fugitive appeals all assume
some connection between a defendant's fugitive status andthe appellate process, sufficient to make an appellate sanction a reasonable response.15 These justifications are neces-sarily attenuated when applied to a case in which both flight
and recapture occur while the case is pending before the district court, so that a defendant's fugitive status at no time
coincides with his appeal.There is, for instance, no question but that dismissal of a

former fugitive's appeal cannot be justified by reference tothe enforceability concerns that animated

Smith v. United
States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876), and the cases that followed. Adefendant returned to custody before he invokes the appellate process presents no risk of unenforceability; he is withincontrol of the appellate court throughout the period of appeal
and issuance of judgment. Cf. United States v. Gordon, 538
F. 2d 914, 915 (CA1 1976) (dismissing pending appeal of fugi-tive because it is "unlikely that [the] convicted party will

respond to an unfavorable decision").

15 The reasonableness standard of Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140 (1985),
is not, however, the only reason we require some connection between the
appellate process and an appellate sanction. As the dissent notes, post,
at 254, n. 2, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47, which authorizes the
promulgation of rules by the courts of appeals, limits that authority to
rules "governing [the] practice" before those courts.

245Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Similarly, in many cases, the "efficient . . . operation" of
the appellate process, identified as an independent concern
in Estelle, 420 U. S., at 537, will not be advanced by dismissal
of appeals filed after former fugitives are recaptured. It is
true that an escape may give rise to a "flurry of extraneous
matters," requiring that a court divert its attention from the
merits of the case before it. United States v. Puzzanghera,
820 F. 2d 25, 26 (CA1), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 900 (1987).
The court put to this "additional trouble," 820 F. 2d, at 26,
however, at least in the usual course of events, will be the
court before which the case is pending at the time of escape.
When an appeal is filed after recapture, the "flurry," along
with any concomitant delay, likely will exhaust itself well
before the appellate tribunal enters the picture.16

Nor does dismissal of appeals filed after recapture operate
to protect the "digni[ty]" of an appellate court. Cf. Estelle,
420 U. S., at 537. It is often said that a fugitive "flouts" the
authority of the court by escaping, and that dismissal is an
appropriate sanction for this act of disrespect. See, e. g.,
United States v. DeValle, 894 F. 2d 133, 138 (CA5 1990);
United States v. Persico, 853 F. 2d 134, 137-138 (CA2 1988);

16 This case well illustrates the way in which preappeal flight may delay
district court, but not appellate court, proceedings. Petitioner's sentencing was scheduled for June 1989. Because he fled, however, and because
the District Court resentenced him upon his return to custody, his final
sentence was not entered until January 1991. Supra, at 237-238. Accordingly, petitioner's 11-month period of fugitivity delayed culmination of the
District Court proceedings by as much as 19 months.

In the appellate court, on the other hand, the timing of proceedings was
unaffected by petitioner's flight. Had petitioner filed his notice of appeal
before he fled, of course, then the Court of Appeals might have been required to reschedule an already docketed appeal, causing some delay. But
here, petitioner filed his notice of appeal only after he was returned to
custody, and the Court of Appeals was therefore free to docket his case
pursuant to its regular schedule and at its convenience. In short, a lapse
of time that precedes invocation of the appellate process does not translate, by itself, into delay borne by the appellate court.

246 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Ali v. Sims, 788 F. 2d 954, 958-959 (CA3 1986); United States
v. London, 723 F. 2d 1538, 1539 (CA11), cert. denied, 467 U. S.
1228 (1984). Indeed, the premise of Molinaro's disentitlement theory is that "the fugitive from justice has demonstrated such disrespect for the legal processes that he has no
right to call upon the court to adjudicate his claim." Ali v.
Sims, 788 F. 2d, at 959; see Molinaro, 396 U. S., at 366. We
have no reason here to question the proposition that an
appellate court may employ dismissal as a sanction when a
defendant's flight operates as an affront to the dignity of

the court's proceedings.

The problem in this case, of course, is that petitioner, who
fled before sentencing and was recaptured before appeal,
flouted the authority of the District Court, not the Court
of Appeals. The contemptuous disrespect manifested by his
flight was directed at the District Court, before which his
case was pending during the entirety of his fugitive period.
Therefore, under the reasoning of the cases cited above, it is
the District Court that has the authority to defend its own
dignity, by sanctioning an act of defiance that occurred solely
within its domain. See United States v. Anagnos, 853 F. 2d
1, 2 (CA1 1988) (declining to follow Holmes because former
fugitive's "misconduct was in the district court, and should
affect consequences in that court, not in ours").

We cannot accept an expansion of this reasoning that
would allow an appellate court to sanction by dismissal any
conduct that exhibited disrespect for any aspect of the judicial system, even where such conduct has no connection to
the course of appellate proceedings. See supra, at 244, and
n. 15. Such a rule would sweep far too broadly, permitting,
for instance, this Court to dismiss a petition solely because
the petitioner absconded for a day during district court
proceedings, or even because the petitioner once violated a
condition of parole or probation. None of our cases calls
for such a result, and we decline today to adopt such an

Opinion of the Court
approach.17 Accordingly, to the extent that the Holmes rulerests on the premise that Molinaro's disentitlement theory

by itself justifies dismissal of an appeal filed after a formerfugitive is returned to custody, see 680 F. 2d, at 1374, it cannot be sustained.Finally,

Estelle's deterrence rationale, 420 U. S., at 537, of-fers little support for the Eleventh Circuit rule. Once jurisdiction has vested in the appellate court, as in Estelle, thenany deterrent to escape must flow from appellate consequences, and dismissal may be an appropriate sanction bywhich to deter. Until that time, however, the district court
is quite capable of defending its own jurisdiction. While acase is pending before the district court, flight can be deterred with the threat of a wide range of penalties availableto the district court judge. See

Katz v. United States, 920F. 2d 610, 613 (CA9 1990) (when defendant is before district

court, "disentitlement doctrine does not stand alone as a de-terrence to escape").

Moreover, should this deterrent prove ineffective, and adefendant flee while his case is before a district court, the
district court is well situated to impose an appropriate pun-ishment. While an appellate court has access only to the
blunderbuss of dismissal, the district court can tailor a morefinely calibrated response. Most obviously, because flight is
a separate offense punishable under the Criminal Code, seenn. 3-4,

supra, the district court can impose a separate sen-tence that adequately vindicates the public interest in deter17 Even the Eleventh Circuit, we note, seems unprepared to take such
an extreme position. If appellate dismissal were indeed an appropriate
sanction for all acts of judicial defiance, then there would be no reason to
exempt sentencing errors from the scope of the Holmes rule. See 680 F.
2d, at 1373; supra, at 243. Whether or not Holmes' distinction between
appeals from sentencing errors and appeals from convictions is logically
supportable, see United States v. Anagnos, 853 F. 2d 1, 2 (CA1 1988) (questioning logic of distinction), it reflects an acknowledgment by the Eleventh
Circuit that the sanction of appellate dismissal should not be wielded indiscriminately as an all-purpose weapon against defendant misconduct.

ring escape and safeguards the dignity of the court. In thiscase, for instance, the District Court concluded that a term

of imprisonment of 21 months, followed by three years ofsupervised release, would serve these purposes.

18 If we assume that there is merit to petitioner's appeal, then theEleventh Circuit's dismissal is tantamount to an additional

punishment of 15 years for the same offense of flight. Cf.
United States v. Snow, 748 F. 2d 928 (CA4 1984).19 Our rea-soning in Molinaro surely does not compel that result.

Indeed, as Justice Stewart noted in his dissenting opinionin Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S., at 544-545, punishment by
appellate dismissal introduces an element of arbitrarinessand irrationality into sentencing for escape.

20 Use of the

dismissal sanction as, in practical effect, a second punishmentfor a defendant's flight is almost certain to produce the kind

of disparity in sentencing that the Sentencing Reform Actof 1984

21 and the Sentencing Guidelines were intended to

eliminate.22

18 See supra, at 237-238.
19 "The Court is not condoning [defendant's] flight from justice. However, it presumes his actions constitute an independent crime, i. e., `escape
from custody.' We refrain from punishing [defendant] twice by dismissing
his appeal." United States v. Snow, 748 F. 2d, at 930, n. 3.

20 "[T]he statute imposes totally irrational punishments upon those subject to its application. If an escaped felon has been convicted in violation
of law, the loss of his right to appeal results in his serving a sentence that
under law was erroneously imposed. If, on the other hand, his trial was
free of reversible error, the loss of his right to appeal results in no punishment at all. And those whose appeals would have been reversed if their
appeals had not been dismissed serve totally disparate sentences, dependent not upon the circumstances of their escape, but upon whatever sentences may have been meted out under their invalid convictions." Estelle, 420 U. S., at 544.

Opinion of the Court
Accordingly, we conclude that while dismissal of an appealpending while the defendant is a fugitive may serve substantial interests, the same interests do not support a rule ofdismissal for all appeals filed by former fugitives, returned
to custody before invocation of the appellate system. Ab-sent some connection between a defendant's fugitive status
and his appeal, as provided when a defendant is at large dur-ing "the ongoing appellate process,"

Estelle, 420 U. S., at 542,n. 11, the justifications advanced for dismissal of fugitives'

pending appeals generally will not apply.We do not ignore the possibility that some actions by a
defendant, though they occur while his case is before thedistrict court, might have an impact on the appellate process
sufficient to warrant an appellate sanction. For that reason,we do not hold that a court of appeals is entirely without
authority to dismiss an appeal because of fugitive status pre-dating the appeal. For example, the Eleventh Circuit, in
formulating the Holmes rule, expressed concern that a longescape, even if ended before sentencing and appeal, may so
delay the onset of appellate proceedings that the Govern-ment would be prejudiced in locating witnesses and presenting evidence at retrial after a successful appeal. Holmes,680 F. 2d, at 1374; see also United States v. Persico, 853 F.
2d, at 137. We recognize that this problem might, in someinstances, make dismissal an appropriate response. In the
class of appeals premised on insufficiency of the evidence,however, in which petitioner's appeal falls, retrial is not permitted in the event of reversal, and this type of prejudice tothe Government will not serve as a rationale for dismissal.

Similarly, a defendant's misconduct at the district courtlevel might somehow make "meaningful appeal impossible,"
Holmes, 680 F. 2d, at 1374, or otherwise disrupt the appellateprocess so that an appellate sanction is reasonably imposed.

purpose of administering evenhanded justice. In this case, it is the dissent's proposed disposition that would produce inconsistent judgments, as
petitioner served a 15-year sentence while his codefendant's conviction
was reversed for insufficiency of evidence.

250 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The appellate courts retain the authority to deal with such
cases, or classes of cases,23 as necessary. Here, for instance,
petitioner's flight prevented the Court of Appeals from consolidating his appeal with those of his codefendants, which
we assume would be its normal practice. See United States
v. Mieres-Borges, 919 F. 2d, at 654, n. 1 (noting that petitioner is absent and not party to appeal). If the Eleventh
Circuit deems this consequence of petitioner's flight a significant interference with the operation of its appellate process, then, under the reasoning we employ today, a dismissal
rule could properly be applied.

As this case reaches us, however, there is no reason to
believe that the Eleventh Circuit has made such a judgment.
Application of the Holmes rule, as formulated by the Eleventh Circuit thus far, does not require the kind of connection
between fugitivity and the appellate process that we hold
necessary today; instead, it may rest on nothing more than
the faulty premise that any act of judicial defiance, whether
or not it affects the appellate process, is punishable by appellate dismissal. See Holmes, 680 F. 2d, at 1374; supra, at 246.
Accordingly, that the Eleventh Circuit saw fit to dismiss this
case under Holmes does not by itself reflect a determination

23 We cannot agree with petitioner that the courts may only consider
whether to dismiss the appeal of a former fugitive on an individual, casespecific basis. Though dismissal of fugitive appeals is always discretionary, in the sense that fugitivity does not "strip the case of its character as
an adjudicable case or controversy," Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U. S.
365, 366 (1970); see also n. 11, supra, appellate courts may exercise that
discretion by developing generally applicable rules to cover specific, recurring situations. Indeed, this Court itself has formulated a general rule
allowing for dismissal of petitions that come before it while the petitioner
is at large. See Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876). The problem
with the Holmes rule is not that the appeals it reaches are subject to
automatic dismissal, but that it reaches too many appeals--including those
of defendants whose former fugitive status in no way affects the appellate process.

251Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
that dismissal would be appropriate under the narrower circumstances we now define.

Nor is there any indication in the record below--either in
the Government's motion to dismiss, or in the Eleventh Circuit's per curiam order--that petitioner's former fugitivity
was deemed to present an obstacle to orderly appellate review. Thus, we have no reason to assume that the Eleventh
Circuit would consider the duplication of resources involved
in hearing petitioner's appeal separately from those of his
codefendants--which can of course be minimized by reliance
on the earlier panel decision in United States v. MieresBorges, see supra, at 238, and n. 6--sufficiently disruptive of
the appellate process that dismissal would be a reasonable
response, on the facts of this case and under the standard we
announce today. We leave that determination to the Court
of Appeals on remand.24

In short, when a defendant's flight and recapture occur before appeal, the defendant's former fugitive status may well
lack the kind of connection to the appellate process that
would justify an appellate sanction of dismissal. In such
cases, fugitivity while a case is pending before a district
court, like other contempts of court, is best sanctioned by the
district court itself. The contempt for the appellate process
manifested by flight while a case is pending on appeal remains subject to the rule of Molinaro.

24 Neither the reasonableness standard of Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140
(1985), nor Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47, mandates uniformity
among the circuits in their approach to fugitive dismissal rules. See
Thomas, 474 U. S., at 157 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In other words, so
long as all circuit rules meet the threshold reasonableness requirement, in
that they mandate dismissal only when fugitivity has some connection to
the appellate process, they may vary considerably in their operation. For
this additional reason, we hesitate to decide as a general matter whether
and under what circumstances preappeal flight that leads to severance of
codefendants' appeals will warrant appellate dismissal, and instead leave
that question to the various courts of appeals.

252 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion. So ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White,
Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court holds that, in general, a court of appeals maynot dismiss an appeal based on a defendant's fugitive status

if that status does not coincide with the pendency of the ap-peal. We disagree. The only difference between a defendant who absconds preappeal and one who absconds postap-peal is that the former has filed a notice of appeal while the
latter has not. This "distinction" is not strong enough tosupport the Court's holding, for there is as much of a chance
that flight will disrupt the proper functioning of the appellateprocess if it occurs before the court of appeals obtains jurisdiction as there is if it occurs after the court of appealsobtains jurisdiction. As a consequence, there is no reason
why the authority to dismiss an appeal should be based onthe timing of a defendant's escape. Although we agree with
the Court that there must be some "connection" betweenescape and the appellate process, we disagree with the conclusion that recapture before appeal generally breaks theconnection.

1

It is beyond dispute that the courts of appeals have super-visory power to create and enforce "procedural rules governing the management of litigation." Thomas v. Arn, 474

1 The Court erroneously strikes the Holmes rule on the basis that "it
reaches too many appeals," ante, at 250, n. 23, because there is no overbreadth doctrine applicable in this context. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma,
413 U. S. 601, 610-611 (1973) (overbreadth doctrine is the exception rather
than the rule because "courts are not roving commissions assigned to pass
judgment on the validity of the Nation's laws"). As long as the fugitive
dismissal rule was applied legally to the facts of this case, the Eleventh
Circuit's rule cannot be struck down. It is for this reason that we would
affirm the Eleventh Circuit rather than vacating and remanding.

U. S. 140, 146 (1985). The only limit on this authority is thatthe rules may not violate the Constitution or a statute, and

must be reasonable in light of the concerns they are designedto address. See

id., at 146-148. There can be no argument
that the fugitive dismissal rule employed by the Eleventh
Circuit violates the Constitution because a convicted crimi-nal has no constitutional right to an appeal.

Abney v.
United States, 431 U. S. 651, 656 (1977). Nor is the rule in-consistent with 28 U. S. C. $ 1291, which grants to criminal

defendants the right of appeal, because that section does notset forth the procedural requirements for perfecting an appeal. Those requirements are set forth in the Federal Rules
of Appellate Procedure and the local rules of the courts of
appeals. Indeed, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47, each court of appeals has authority to make rules
"governing its practice" either through rulemaking or
adjudication.

The fugitive dismissal rule is reasonable in light of the
interests it is designed to protect. In Molinaro v. New
Jersey, 396 U. S. 365 (1970), we declined to adjudicate a defendant's case because he fled after appealing his state conviction. We reasoned that by absconding, the defendant
forfeited his right to "call upon the resources of the Court for
determination of his claims." Id., at 366. And in Estelle v.
Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534 (1975), we upheld a Texas statute
that mandated dismissal of an appeal if the defendant fled
after invoking the jurisdiction of the appellate court. We
recognized that Texas reasonably has an interest in discouraging felony escape, encouraging voluntary surrenders, and
promoting the "efficient, dignified operation of the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals." Id., at 537. Both Molinaro
and Estelle are premised on the idea that a reviewing court
may invoke procedural rules to protect its jurisdiction and to
ensure the orderly and efficient use of its limited resources.

While we agree with the Court that there must be some
connection between fugitivity and the appellate process in

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
order to justify a rule providing for dismissal on that basis,
we do not agree that flight generally does not have the required connection simply because it occurs before the defendant or his counsel files a notice of appeal.2 It is fallacious to
suggest that a defendant's actions in fleeing likely will have
no effect upon the appellate process unless those actions
occur while the court of appeals has jurisdiction over the
case. Indeed, flight during the pendency of an appeal may
have less of an effect on the appellate process, especially in
cases where the defendant flees and is recaptured while the
appeal is pending. Because there is no delay between conviction and invocation of the appellate process, dismissal in
such a case is premised on the mere threat to the proper
operation of the appellate process. Yet the Court concedes,
as it must, that courts of appeals may dismiss an appeal in
this situation. Ante, at 239-242; see Allen v. Georgia, 166
U. S. 138 (1897).

If, as in the present case, the defendant eventually is recaptured and resentenced, he obtains a second chance to
challenge his conviction and sentence, and consequently delays the appellate process by at least the amount of time
he managed to elude law enforcement authorities. We are
startled by the Court's assertion that "any concomitant delay
. . . likely will exhaust itself well before the appellate tribunal
enters the picture." Ante, at 245. If the defendant obtains
an additional opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal, the
court of appeals, in the absence of a fugitive dismissal rule
or any jurisdictional defect, must entertain the appeal. At

2 The very wording of Rule 47, which gives the appellate courts authority to create local procedural rules, supports the connection requirement:
"Each court of appeals by action of a majority of the circuit judges in
regular active service may from time to time make and amend rules governing its practice not inconsistent with these rules. In all cases not
provided for by rule, the courts of appeals may regulate their practice in
any manner not inconsistent with these rules." Fed. Rule App. Proc. 47

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
the very least, the result is an increase in the court's docketand a blow to docket organization and predictability. This

disruption to the management of the court's docketing proce-dures is qualitatively different from delay caused by other
factors like settlement by the parties. Unlike the fugitive's
case, the settled case will not turn up as an additional andunexpected case on the court's docket some time down the

road. And of course, the burden of delay increases exponen-tially with the number of defendants who abscond preappeal,
but are recaptured and invoke the appellate court's jurisdic-tion in a timely manner. The Court fails to explain how this
obvious delay somehow disappears when the defendant is recaptured before invoking the appellate court's jurisdiction.

As is demonstrated by the instant case, the delay caused
by preappeal flight can thwart the administration of justice
by forcing a severance, requiring duplication of precious appellate resources, and raising the specter of inconsistent
judgments. Here, the appellate process was delayed by approximately 19 months (counting both the period of fugitivity
and the time used by the District Court to resentence petitioner). During this delay, the Eleventh Circuit heard and
decided the appeals filed by petitioner's codefendants.
United States v. Mieres-Borges, 919 F. 2d 652 (1990), cert.
denied, 499 U. S. 980 (1991). Because petitioner fled, the
Eleventh Circuit was unable to consolidate petitioner's
appeal with those filed by his codefendants and conserve
judicial resources. In addition to forcing a severance, petitioner's flight created a real possibility of inconsistent judgments. Petitioner's flight "imposed exactly the same burden of duplication on the court of appeals that it would have
if he had filed his notice of appeal before absconding." Brief
for United States 21. Had petitioner's counsel filed a notice
of appeal on petitioner's behalf while he remained at large,
the Court of Appeals could have dismissed the appeal with
prejudice. See Molinaro, 396 U. S., at 366. Since petitioner's flight had an adverse effect on the proper functioning of

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
the Eleventh Circuit's process, there is no principled reasonwhy that court should not be able to dismiss petitioner's

appeal.In addition to administration, the Eleventh Circuit's fugitive dismissal rule is supported by an interest in deterring
flight and encouraging voluntary surrender. Due to the ad-verse effects that flight, whenever it occurs, can have on the

proper functioning of the appellate process, courts of appealshave an obvious interest in deterring escape and encouraging voluntary surrender. Unfortunately, today's opiniononly encourages flight and discourages surrender. To a defendant deciding whether to flee before or after filing a notice of appeal, today's decision makes the choice simple. If
the defendant flees preappeal and happens to get caught
after the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired, he still
has the opportunity for appellate review if he can persuade a
district judge to resentence him. If the district judge refuses, the defendant is at no more of a disadvantage than he
would have been had he escaped after filing an appeal since
flight after appeal can automatically extinguish the right to
appellate review. See Molinaro, supra.

A rule permitting dismissal when a defendant's flight interrupts the appellate process protects respect for the judicial system. When a defendant escapes, whether before or
after lodging an appeal, he flouts the authority of the judicial process, of which the court of appeals is an integral part.
Surely the Court does not mean to argue that a defendant
who escapes during district court proceedings intends only
disrespect for that tribunal. Quite obviously, a fleeing defendant has no intention of returning, at least voluntarily.
His flight therefore demonstrates an equal amount of disrespect for the authority of the court of appeals as it does for
the district court. Viewed in this light, the "finely calibrated response" available to the district court, ante, at 247,
does nothing to vindicate the affront to the appellate process.
The Court's argument is not enhanced by the use of far507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT

fetched hypotheticals, see ante, at 246, because the dignityrationale does not exist in a vacuum. As outlined above, a

reviewing court may not dismiss an appeal in the absence ofsome effect on its orderly functioning.

While the Court recognizes that the reasoning underlyingthe opinion requires an exception for cases in which flight
throws a wrench into the proper workings of the appellateprocess,

ante, at 249-250, its rule is too narrow. The Courtlimits the exception to cases in which flight creates a "significant interference with the operation of [the] appellateprocess." Ante, at 250. Translated, the rule applies preappeal only when retrial is hampered, a " `meaningful appeal[is] impossible,' " or the case involves multiple defendants,
thereby causing a forced severance. Ante, at 249-250. Thisgrudging concession is insufficient because it fails to include
those cases where sheer delay caused by the fugitivity ofthe lone defendant has an adverse effect on the appellate
process.In sum, courts of appeals have supervisory authority, both
inherent and under Rule 47, to create and enforce proceduralrules designed to promote the management of their docket.
Fugitivity dismissal rules are no exception. In cases wherefugitivity obstructs the orderly workings of the appellate
process, this authority is properly exercised. Because peti-tioner's flight delayed the appellate process by approximately 19 months, and involved the burden of duplicationand the risk of inconsistent judgments, we would hold that
the Eleventh Circuit properly applied its fugitive dismissalrule in this case.

REITER et al. v. COOPER, trustee for CAROLINA

MOTOR EXPRESS, INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 91-1496. Argued December 1, 1992--Decided March 8, 1993
The Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) requires that motor common carriers

charge the tariff rates they file with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), 49 U. S. C. $ 10762, and that such rates be "reasonable,"

$ 10701(a). Between 1984 and 1986, petitioner shippers tendered shipments to Carolina Motor Express, Inc., a motor carrier subject to ICC
regulation, at negotiated rates that were lower than the applicable tariff
rates on file with the ICC. When Carolina filed for bankruptcy, respondents, the trustee in bankruptcy and a rate auditing firm, brought
adversary proceedings against petitioners in the Bankruptcy Court to
recover the difference between the negotiated and tariff rates. Petitioners responded, inter alia, that the tariff rates were unlawful because
they were unreasonably high. The Bankruptcy Court entered judgment for respondents based on the tariff rates, but the District Court
reversed and referred petitioners' defenses to the ICC. The Court of
Appeals reversed, holding the petitioners' "unreasonable rate" claims
were no obstacle to respondents' actions because, even if the tariff rates
were unreasonable, the "filed rate doctrine" required petitioners to pay
those rates first and then seek relief in a separate action under

$ 11705(b)(3), which gives shippers an express cause of action against
carriers for damages (reparations) in the amount of the difference between the tariff rate and the rate determined by the ICC to be
reasonable.

Held:

1. Petitioners' unreasonable-rate claims under $ 11705(b)(3) are subject to the ordinary rules governing counterclaims. Pp. 262-267.

(a) While respondents are technically correct that the unreasonablerate issue cannot be asserted as a defense, petitioners' $ 11705(b)(3)
claims relate to the same shipments for which respondents seek to collect and, thus, are properly raised here as counterclaims. It makes no
difference that the counterclaims may have been mistakenly designated
as defenses. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Pp. 262-263.

(b) The 2-year limitation for bringing a civil action under

$ 11705(b)(3) is not applicable here since petitioners' claims seek merely

recoupment. See United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S.
59, 71. Pp. 263-265.

(c) Nothing in the ICA provides that, in a carrier's undercharge
collection action, a $ 11705(b)(3) counterclaim is not subject to the normally applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 54(b). That Rule permits a district court to enter separate
final judgment on any claim or counterclaim after making "an express
determination that there is no just reason for delay." The "filed rate
doctrine"--which embodies the principle that a shipper cannot avoid
paying the tariff rate by invoking common-law claims and defenses--
does not preclude avoidance of the tariff rate through claims and defenses that are specifically accorded by the ICA itself. Crancer v. Lowden, 315 U. S. 631, distinguished. Pp. 265-267.

2. Respondents' arguments that petitioners' counterclaims are not
yet cognizable in court are rejected. Pp. 267-270.

(a) The contention that paying the tariff rate is a prerequisite for
litigating the reasonableness issue finds no support in the ICA. Rather,
the ICA provides that a claim related to shipment of property accrues
on delivery or tender of delivery, $ 11706(g). Pp. 267-268.

(b) Nor are petitioners required initially to present their claims to
the ICC. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires only that a
court enable "referral" to an administrative agency of a claim containing
an issue within the agency's special competence, but does not deprive
the court of jurisdiction. And the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies--which would deprive the court of jurisdiction--is inapplicable here, both because the ICC has long interpreted the ICA as
giving it no power to decree reparations itself, and because the Court
can discern within the ICA no intent that ICC determination of the
reasonable-rate issue must be obtained before filing the civil action.
Pp. 268-270.

3. The courts below made no "express determination" required under
Rule 54(b) for entry of a separate judgment on respondents' claims, and
it cannot be said categorically that it would be an abuse of discretion
either to grant or to deny such judgment. Although insolvency of the
claimant is a factor weighing against separate judgment in that claimant's favor, this Court cannot say that insolvency is an absolute bar.

This case presents the question whether, when a shipperdefends against a motor common carrier's suit to collect

the tariff rates that the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), 49U. S. C. $ 10701

shipper to recover the difference between the negotiatedrates and the tariff rates. Shippers' standard defenses

against such "undercharge" actions have been (1) that thecarrier's attempt to collect more than the agreed-upon rates
is an "unreasonable practice" proscribed by the Act, see$ 10701(a), and (2) that the tariff rates were unlawful because
they were unreasonably high, see ibid. In 1989, the ICC

Motor Common Carrier Rates, 3 I. C. C. 2d 99 (1986); Maislin, 497 U. S., at 121-122. Our decision in Maislin held that
policy invalid under the ICA, because it would "rende[r] nugatory" the specific command of $ 10761 that the carrier
charge the filed rate. Id., at 133. While Maislin thus eliminated the shippers' "unreasonable practice" defense, it expressly noted that "[t]he issue of the reasonableness of the
tariff rates is open for exploration on remand." Id., at 129,

has arisen out of that issue.

The shippers here are petitioners California Consolidated
Enterprises (CCE) and Peter Reiter. Between 1984 and
1986, they were engaged in the business of brokering motor
carrier transportation, which essentially involves serving as
a middleman between motor carriers and the shipping public.
During that period, petitioners tendered shipments to Carolina Motor Express, Inc., which was operating as a certified
motor carrier in interstate commerce subject to regulation
by the ICC. Carolina and petitioners negotiated rates for
several shipments that were lower than the applicable tariff

rates on file with the ICC. (Petitioners believed that Caro-lina would publish these negotiated rates in its tariffs, but

Carolina never did so.)In 1986, Carolina filed for bankruptcy and respondent
Langdon Cooper was appointed trustee. Respondent Mark& Associates of North Carolina was retained to conduct

an audit of Carolina's shipping bills, which revealed under-charges (below applicable tariff rates) in the amount of
$58,793.03 on shipments made by CCE and $13,795.73 onshipments made by Reiter. Respondents brought adversary
proceedings against petitioners in Bankruptcy Court to col-lect those amounts. Petitioners raised the standard "unreasonable practice" and "unreasonable rate" claims, and movedthe Bankruptcy Court to stay proceedings and to refer those
claims to the ICC. The Bankruptcy Court refused to do soand entered judgment for respondents. In re Carolina
Motor Express, Inc., 84 B. R. 979 (WDNC 1988). In 1989(prior to our decision in Maislin), the District Court reversed and held that the "unreasonable practice" defenseshould be referred to the ICC. The Court of Appeals, after
holding respondents' appeal in abeyance until our decision in
Maislin, reversed the District Court. In re Carolina MotorExpress, Inc., 949 F. 2d 107 (CA4 1991). It held that, in

light of Maislin, there was no need to refer the "unreason-able practice" issue to the ICC, 949 F. 2d, at 109; and that
the "unreasonable rate" claim was no obstacle to the carrier'saction, since even if the tariff rates were unreasonable the
"filed rate" doctrine requires the shipper to pay them firstand then seek relief in a separate action for damages under

$ 11705(b)(3), id., at 110-111. We granted certiorari. 504U. S. 907 (1992).

II
The ICA requires carriers' rates to be "reasonable,"$ 10701(a), and gives shippers an express cause of action

against carriers for damages (called "reparations" in the pre-codification version of the statute, see 49 U. S. C. $$ 304a(2),

(5) (1976 ed.)) in the amount of the difference between thetariff rate and the rate determined to be reasonable by the

ICC, $ 11705(b)(3).1 Respondents argue, however, that theunreasonableness of a tariff rate may not be asserted as a
"defense" to an action to recover charges based on that rate.That may be true in a technical sense, since $ 11705(b)(3) provides a cause of action rather than a defense. But that doesnot establish that the "unreasonable rate" issue cannot be
raised in the present suit, since a defendant having a causeof action against a plaintiff may--indeed, often

must--assertthat cause of action as a counterclaim. See Fed. Rule Civ.

Proc. 13; Southern Constr. Co. v. Pickard, 371 U. S. 57, 60(1962). Petitioners' claims under $ 11705(b)(3) are certainly
properly raised here, since they relate to the same shipmentsfor which respondents seek to collect. And it makes no difference that petitioners may have mistakenly designatedtheir counterclaims as defenses, since Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 8(c) provides that "the court on terms, if justiceso requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a
proper designation." See also 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Fed-eral Practice and Procedure $ 1275, pp. 459-460 (2d ed. 1990)
("Inasmuch as it is not clear whether set-offs and recoup-ments should be viewed as defenses or counterclaims, the
court, by invoking the misdesignation provision in Rule 8(c),should treat matter of this type as if it had been properly
designated by defendant, and should not penalize improperlabelling").

Under 49 U. S. C. $ 11706(c)(2), a shipper "must begin acivil action to recover damages under [$ 11705(b)(3)] within
two years after the claim accrues," which occurs "on deliveryor tender of delivery by the carrier," $ 11706(g). That limi1 Section 11705(b)(3) provides in relevant part:
"A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . is liable for damages resulting from the
imposition of rates for transportation or service the Commission finds to
be in violation of this subtitle."

264 REITER v. COOPER

Opinion of the Court
tation is not applicable here, however, since presented in re-sponse to the carrier's suit petitioners' claims seek merely

"recoupment"--i. e., the setting off against asserted liabilityof a counterclaim arising out of the same transaction. Recoupment claims are generally not barred by a statute of
limitations so long as the main action is timely. See Bull v.
United States, 295 U. S. 247, 262 (1935); 3 J. Moore, B.
Ward, & J. Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice || 13.11 (1992).There is no reason not to apply this principle to suits under

the ICA, and we have indeed already done so. In United
States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 59, 71 (1956), we
held that an ICA limitation provision nearly identical to the
one at issue here did not prohibit the shipper (the United
States) from asserting "by way of defense" unreasonablerate claims against a carrier seeking to collect on previous
shipments. Respondents seek to distinguish Western Pacific on the ground that the United States has a unique statutory setoff right (now codified at 31 U. S. C. $ 3726), allowing
it to deduct from amounts due to a carrier prior overcharges
by the carrier. That statute may well have been essential
to the holding in the case, since some of the amounts withheld by the United States were not recoupments (they related to shipments other than those that were the subjects
of the carriers' suits). But the rationale of the case is the
same as the rationale that permits recoupment here: "Only
the clearest congressional language could force us to a result
which would allow a carrier to recover unreasonable charges
with impunity merely by waiting two years before filing
suit." 352 U. S., at 71. See Glama Dress Co. v. Mid-South
Transports, Inc., 335 I. C. C. 586, 589 (1969). Courts of Appeals have understood Western Pacific as expressing not just
a narrow holding based on the United States setoff statute,
but a general principle of recoupment applicable in other contexts. See Distribution Services, Ltd. v. Eddie Parker Interests, Inc., 897 F. 2d 811, 813 (CA5 1990); In re Smith, 737
F. 2d 1549, 1554 (CA11 1984); 118 East 60th Owners, Inc.

(CA2 1963).One major consequence does attach to the fact that an
unreasonable-rate claim is technically a counterclaim ratherthan a defense: A defense cannot possibly be adjudicated
separately from the plaintiff 's claim to which it applies; acounterclaim can be. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b)
permits a district court to enter separate final judgment onany claim or counterclaim, after making "an express determination that there is no just reason for delay." See Sears,
Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U. S. 427 (1956); Cold Metal
Process Co. v. United Engineering & Foundry Co., 351 U. S.445 (1956). This power is largely discretionary, see CurtissWright Corp. v. General Electric Co., 446 U. S. 1, 10 (1980),to be exercised in light of "judicial administrative interests
as well as the equities involved," id., at 8, and giving dueweight to " `the historic federal policy against piecemeal appeals,' " ibid. (quoting Sears, supra, at 438).2Nothing in the ICA provides that, in an action by a carrier
to collect undercharges, a $ 11705(b)(3) counterclaim is notsubject to the normally applicable provisions of the Federal
Rules. Respondents contend that the so-called "filed ratedoctrine" gives them absolute entitlement to judgment on
their undercharge claims, without defense or counterclaim.

2 For purposes of applying the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing counterclaims, it does not matter that this action arose in bankruptcy.
Rules 8 and 54 are made fully applicable in adversary proceedings by
Bankruptcy Rules 7008 and 7054, and Rule 13 is made applicable with
only minor variation (not relevant here) by Bankruptcy Rule 7013. It is
well settled, moreover, that a bankruptcy defendant can meet a plaintiffdebtor's claim with a counterclaim arising out of the same transaction, at
least to the extent that the defendant merely seeks recoupment. See In
re B & L Oil Co., 782 F. 2d 155, 157 (CA10 1986); Lee v. Schweiker, 739
F. 2d 870, 875 (CA3 1984). Recoupment permits a determination of the
"just and proper liability on the main issue," and involves "no element of
preference." 4 Collier on Bankruptcy || 553.03, p. 553-17 (15th ed. 1991).

266 REITER v. COOPER

Opinion of the Court
We disagree. The filed rate doctrine embodies the principlethat a shipper cannot avoid payment of the tariff rate by

invoking common-law claims and defenses such as ignorance,estoppel, or prior agreement to a different rate. See

Texas
& Pacific R. Co. v. Mugg, 202 U. S. 242, 245 (1906); Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94, 98 (1915);
Pittsburgh, C., C. & S. L. R. Co. v. Fink, 250 U. S. 577, 581-
582 (1919). It assuredly does not preclude avoidance of thetariff rate, however, through claims and defenses that are

specifically accorded by the ICA itself. We can agree withrespondents that this latter category does not include any
"unreasonable rate defense," derived from the general ICA
requirement (now codified in $ 10701(a)) that a carrier's rates
be "reasonable." See T. I. M. E. Inc. v. United States, 359
U. S. 464, 468-472 (1959). But we cannot agree that the filed
rate doctrine precludes shippers from asserting (by way of
claim or counterclaim) the reparations rights explicitly conferred by $ 11705(b)(3).

Contrary to respondents' contention, the preclusive effect
of the filed rate doctrine over reparations counterclaims is
not established by our opinion in Crancer v. Lowden, 315
U. S. 631 (1942). There, shippers sued by a rail carrier for
payment of tariff rates challenged them as unreasonable, and
sought to stay the collection action until the ICC had an
opportunity to rule on that issue. The District Court denied
the stay and entered judgment for the carrier. But unlike
the present petitioners, the shippers in Crancer had no counterclaim; they had already instituted an administrative reparations proceeding (as the ICA allowed for rail carriage)
before they were sued in district court, see Reply Brief for
Petitioners 13 and Brief for Respondents 18, in Crancer v.
Lowden, O. T. 1941, No. 505, which precluded filing a reparations claim in district court. See 49 U. S. C. $ 9 (1946 ed.).
Moreover, all that Crancer held was that "there was no
abuse of discretion by the trial judge," since the equities balanced against waiting for the ICC's determination. 315

267Cite as: 507 U. S. 258 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 636. Thus, Crancer held that the court was notrequired to stay the collection proceeding until the ICC

ruled on the reasonableness of rates; not that the court wasprohibited from doing so. That is entirely consistent with
our holding here. III

Respondents raise two arguments to the effect that peti-tioners' $ 11705(b)(3) counterclaims are not yet cognizable in
court. First, respondents argue that there exists what theydenominate as a "pay first" rule, whereby payment of the
tariff rate is a "prerequisite to litigating the rate reasonable-ness issue." Brief for Respondents 23. See also

MilneTruck Lines, Inc. v. Makita U. S. A., Inc., 970 F. 2d 564,

572 (CA9 1992) (embracing similar theory). That argumentwould have merit if the holding in United States ex rel.
Louisville Cement Co. v. ICC, 246 U. S. 638 (1918), were stillgood law. In that case, this Court held that a shipper's
cause of action for reparations did not accrue "until paymenthad been made of the unreasonable charges."

Id., at 644.The opinion noted that "if Congress had intended that the

cause of action of the shipper to recover damages for unrea-sonable charges should accrue when the shipment was received, or when it was delivered by the carrier, . . . a simpleand obvious form for expressing that intention would have
been used." Ibid. Within two years, Congress enacted asimple and obvious provision stating that any "cause of action in respect of a shipment of property shall . . . be deemedto accrue upon delivery or tender of delivery." Transportation Act of 1920, $ 424, 41 Stat. 492. That provision survivesin substantially the same form in text now codified at 49
U. S. C. $ 11706(g). While it is theoretically possible for astatute to create a cause of action that accrues at one time
for the purpose of calculating when the statute of limitationsbegins to run, but at another time for the purpose of bringing suit, we will not infer such an odd result in the absenceof any such indication in the statute. We therefore hold that

507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT
268 REITER v. COOPER

Opinion of the Court
petitioners could assert a claim under $ 11705(b)(3) beforepayment, but after their shipments were delivered.

Second, respondents contend that the doctrine of primaryjurisdiction requires petitioners initially to present their
unreasonable-rate claims to the ICC, rather than to a court.
That reflects a mistaken understanding of primary jurisdic-tion, which is a doctrine specifically applicable to claims

properly cognizable in court that contain some issue withinthe special competence of an administrative agency. It requires the court to enable a "referral" to the agency, stayingfurther proceedings so as to give the parties reasonable opportunity to seek an administrative ruling.3 See Western
Pacific, 352 U. S., at 63-64; Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 409 U. S. 289, 291, 302 (1973); Port of Boston Marine
Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400
U. S. 62, 65, 68 (1970). Referral of the issue to the adminis-trative agency does not deprive the court of jurisdiction; it

has discretion either to retain jurisdiction or, if the parties
would not be unfairly disadvantaged, to dismiss the case

3 "Referral" is sometimes loosely described as a process whereby a court
refers an issue to an agency. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 1336. But the ICA
(like most statutes) contains no mechanism whereby a court can on its
own authority demand or request a determination from the agency; that
is left to the adversary system, the court merely staying its proceedings
while the shipper files an administrative complaint under $ 11701(b). See

$ 11705(c)(1) (second sentence). Use of the term "referral" to describe
this process seems to have originated in Western Pacific, which asserted
that, where issues within the special competence of an agency arise, "the
judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views." United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352
U. S. 59, 64 (1956). At the conclusion of that passage, the Western Pacific
Court cited General American Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado Terminal
Co., 308 U. S. 422, 433 (1940), which in turn cited Mitchell Coal & Coke Co.
v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 230 U. S. 247 (1913). Mitchell Coal spelled out
the actual procedure contemplated, holding that further action by the district court should "be stayed so as to give the plaintiff a reasonable opportunity within which to apply to the Commission for a ruling as to the
reasonableness of the practice," id., at 267.

without prejudice. See Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound
Conference, 383 U. S. 213, 222-223 (1966); Mitchell Coal &
Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 230 U. S. 247, 266-267(1913); Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1037,

1055 (1964).

The result that respondents seek would be produced, notby the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, but by the doctrine

of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Where relief isavailable from an administrative agency, the plaintiff is ordinarily required to pursue that avenue of redress before pro-ceeding to the courts; and until that recourse is exhausted,
suit is premature and must be dismissed. See Myers v.
Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U. S. 41, 50-51 (1938);
Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 617, 619, and n. 12 (1984).
That doctrine is inapplicable to petitioners' reparations
claims, however, because the ICC has long interpreted its
statute as giving it no power to decree reparations relief.
Shortly after enactment of the provision now codified at

$ 11705(b)(3), the ICC said that the law did not "grant the
Commission any initial jurisdiction . . . with respect to the
award of reparations"; rather, "shippers' recourse must be
to the courts," which would "refer" the issue of rate reasonableness to the Commission. Informal Procedure for Determining Motor Carrier and Freight Forwarder Reparation, 335 I. C. C. 403, 413 (1969). The ICC continues to
adhere to that view. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9, n. 6; NITL--Petition to Institute Rulemaking on Negotiated Motor Common Carrier Rates, 3 I. C. C. 2d, at 106-
107; NITL--Petition to Institute Rulemaking on Negotiated
Motor Common Carrier Rates, 5 I. C. C. 2d, at 625, 630-631.
We find that to be at least a reasonable interpretation of the
statute, and hence a binding one. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837
(1984).

Nor can we discern within the ICA an intent that, even
though the ICC cannot decree relief, ICC determination of

507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:19 PAGES OPINPGT
270 REITER v. COOPER

Opinion of the Court
the reasonable-rate issue must be obtained before filing thecivil action. Since the limitations period for filing actions

under $ 11705(b)(3) begins running at the time of delivery ofthe shipment, rather than at the time the ICC enters an
order, compare $$ 11706(c)(2) and (g) with $ 11706(e), theperiod could expire before the ICC acted. We are not disposed to find an implicit prior-agency-determination require-ment that would have such consequences.

IV
Since we have concluded that petitioners' unreasonable-rate claims are subject to the ordinary rules governing counterclaims, the judgment below must be reversed. Neitherthe Court of Appeals nor the District Court made the "express determination" required under Rule 54(b) for entry ofa separate judgment on respondents' claims, and we cannot
say categorically that it would be an abuse of discretioneither to grant or to deny separate judgment. In the ordinary case, where a carrier is solvent and has promptlyinitiated suit, the equities favor separate judgment on the
principal claim: referral of the unreasonable-rate issue couldproduce substantial delay, and tariff rates not disapproved
by the ICC are legal rates, binding on both the shipper andthe carrier. See

Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co.,260 U. S. 156, 163 (1922); Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison,

T. & S. F. R. Co., 284 U. S. 370, 384 (1932); Lowden v.Simonds-Shields-Lonsdale Grain Co., 306 U. S. 516, 520
(1939). The equities change, however, when the suing car-rier is in bankruptcy. Indeed, we have previously held that
even a "threat of insolvency" of the party seeking separatejudgment is a factor weighing against it. See

Curtiss-Wright, 446 U. S., at 12. Even so, we cannot say that insolvency is an absolute bar. Conceivably, a district court coulddetermine that other equities favor separate judgment--for
example, a threat that the shipper may become insolvent,which Rule 62(h) would allow a court to protect against by

entering separate judgment for the carrier but staying en-forcement on condition that the shipper deposit the amount

of the judgment with the court. Id., at 13, n. 3.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.

v. LASHLEY

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the eighth circuit

No. 92-409. Decided March 8, 1993
During the penalty phase of respondent Lashley's capital murder trial, his

counsel requested that the jury be instructed on the mitigating circumstance that Lashley had no significant criminal history. However, when
neither Lashley's counsel nor the prosecutor presented proof of the mitigating circumstance, the trial judge refused to give the requested instruction and Lashley was sentenced to death. Subsequently a Federal
District Court dismissed Lashley's habeas petition, rejecting his claim
that the state judge's failure to give the instruction violated due process. The Court of Appeals granted relief, holding that this Court's decision in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, required the State, which was in
a peculiarly advantageous position to show a significant prior criminal
history, to come forward with evidence or else the court must instruct
the jury on the mitigating circumstance.

Held: State courts are not obligated by the Constitution to give mitigating

circumstance instructions when no evidence is offered to support them.
Because the jury heard no evidence concerning Lashley's prior criminal
history, the trial judge did not err in refusing to give the requested
instruction. States are not better positioned than defendants to adduce
evidence of a defendant's own criminal history. Assuming, arguendo,
that a presumption of innocence of other crimes did attach at Lashley's
sentencing, he still was not constitutionally entitled to a "presumption
of innocence" instruction.

Certiorari granted; 957 F. 2d 1495, reversed.

convicted of capital murder, Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 565.001 (1978)

Lashley's attorneys asked the judge to instruct the jury on
the mitigating circumstance that "[t]he defendant ha[d] no
significant history of prior criminal activity," Mo. Rev.
Stat. $ 565.012.3(1) (1978) (current version Mo. Rev. Stat.

$ 565.032.3(1) (Supp. 1991)). App. to Pet. for Cert. A-86 to
A-87. Defense counsel sought this instruction even though
she repeatedly asserted that she would not try to show that
Lashley lacked a criminal past. Id., at A-84, A-86. At the
same time, she moved for an order prohibiting the State from
cross-examining defense witnesses as to Lashley's juvenile
record. Id., at A-83, A-84. Such questioning may not
have been permissible under Missouri law. See Mo. Rev.
Stat. $ 211.271 (1986). In any event, the judge did not expressly rule on the latter motion. See Lashley v. Armontrout, 957 F. 2d 1495, 1501, n. 1 (1992) ("[T]he trial court
was not called upon to rule in respect to the admissibility of
defendant's juvenile record"). The judge did indicate, however, that Lashley would not be entitled to the requested
instruction without supporting evidence. App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-84, A-87.

Perhaps Lashley's attorneys chose not to make the necessary proffer because they feared that the prosecutor would
be permitted to respond with evidence that Lashley had engaged in criminal activity as a juvenile. One of the attorneys so testified in a state collateral proceeding. Tr. 29
(Apr. 10, 1985). Or perhaps defense counsel sought to avoid
opening the door to evidence that Lashley had committed
other crimes as an adult. As the Missouri Supreme Court
observed, the record indicates that, following his arrest,
Lashley confessed to committing several other crimes after

Whatever their reasons, Lashley's lawyers presented noproof that he lacked a significant criminal history. Nor did
the prosecutor submit any evidence that would support themitigating circumstance. The trial judge refused to give the
jury the "no significant history of prior criminal activity"instruction. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed. It reasoned that Missouri law requires mitigating circumstance in-structions to be supported by some evidence, see,

stealing. Tr. 425 (Jan. 27, 1982). The motion was made not on the
ground that the crimes were connected to the charged offense, cf. post, at
280, n. 1, or that they were committed while Lashley was a juvenile, but
because they were "extremely prejudicial" and "[ir]relevant" to Lashley's
guilt or innocence of the murder. Motion in Limine, Record 143 (Jan. 21,

least one of the crimes had been committed "a week or two" before the
murder--that is, when Lashley was already an adult. Tr. 425 (Jan. 27,
1982). The presentence report contains additional evidence. Under the
heading "Adult Arrest Record," the report indicates that Lashley was arrested for three offenses (robbery, burglary, and stealing) the day after
his arrest for the present crime. Missouri Dept. of Social Services, Div.

relief. Lashley v. Armontrout, 957 F. 2d 1495 (1992). TheCourt of Appeals thought that the trial judge's ruling violated the Eighth Amendment under Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S.586 (1978). In the majority's view, "

Lockett requires the
State--which is in a peculiarly advantageous position to
show a significant prior criminal history, if indeed Lashleyhas such a history--to come forward with evidence, or else

the court must tell the jury it may consider the requestedmitigating circumstance." 957 F. 2d, at 1502. The court
held that "the lack of any evidence whatever of Lashley'sprior criminal activity entitled [him] to the requested instruction." Ibid.

As Judge Fagg explained in dissent, see id., at 1502-1504,
the majority plainly misread our precedents. We have held
that the sentencer must be allowed to consider in mitigation
"any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of
the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers
as a basis for a sentence less than death." Lockett, supra,
at 604 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Accord, Penry
v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 317 (1989); Eddings v. Oklahoma,

long as the class of murderers subject to capital punishment
is narrowed, there is no constitutional infirmity in a procedure that allows a jury to recommend mercy based on the
mitigating evidence introduced by a defendant" (emphasis

mitigating circumstances in the absence of any supporting
evidence.

On the contrary, we have said that to comply with due
process state courts need give jury instructions in capital
cases only if the evidence so warrants. See Hopper v.
Evans, 456 U. S. 605, 611 (1982). And, answering a question
expressly reserved in Lockett, we recently made clear that a
State may require the defendant " `to bear the risk of nonpersuasion as to the existence of mitigating circumstances.' "

Lockett, supra, at 609, n. 16); see also 497 U. S.,
at 669-673 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment) (rejecting

Lockett). In Walton we rejected a
challenge to a state statute that imposed on capital defendants the burden of establishing the existence of mitigatingcircumstances by a preponderance of the evidence--a higher

evidentiary standard, we note, than Missouri has adopted.Discerning no "constitutional imperative . . . that would require the [sentencer] to consider the mitigating circum-stances claimed by a defendant unless the State negated
them," 497 U. S., at 650, we concluded that "[s]o long as a
State's method of allocating the burdens of proof does not
lessen the State's burden . . . to prove the existence of aggravating circumstances, a defendant's constitutional rights
are not violated by placing on him the burden of proving
mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for
leniency," ibid.

Even prior to Walton, other lower courts rejected arguments similar to Lashley's. For example, in State v. Fullwood, 323 N. C. 371, 373 S. E. 2d 518 (1988), vacated and
remanded on other grounds, 494 U. S. 1022 (1990), the court
held that the trial judge did not err by refusing to submit to
the jury a "no significant history of prior criminal activity"
instruction where neither the defendant nor the State introduced evidence to support it. 323 N. C., at 394, 373 S. E. 2d,
at 532; see also Hutchins v. Garrison, 724 F. 2d 1425, 1436-

it, any error resulting from failure to give the instruction

to a mitigating instruction under Penry because he had made
a "tactical decision" not to introduce supporting evidence

May v. Collins, 904 F. 2d 228, 232 (CA5 1990), cert.
denied, 498 U. S. 1055 (1991).In short, until the Court of Appeals' decision in this case, it

appears that lower courts consistently applied the principles
established by Lockett and its progeny. Today we make ex-plicit the clear implication of our precedents: Nothing in the

Constitution obligates state courts to give mitigating cir-cumstance instructions when no evidence is offered to support them. Because the jury heard no evidence concerningLashley's prior criminal history, the trial judge did not err
in refusing to give the requested instruction.

We are not persuaded by the Court of Appeals' assertion
that the State was uniquely situated to prove whether or not
Lashley had a significant prior criminal history. As an initial matter, Missouri law does not demand proof that a mitigating circumstance exists; it requires only some supporting
evidence. Lashley acknowledged in his federal habeas petition that his attorneys could have put forward some evidence
that he lacked a significant prior criminal history; indeed,
he contended that they were constitutionally ineffective for
failing to do so. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-71. There is no
reason to suppose, as the dissent suggests, post, at 288, that
Lashley would be required to testify in order to receive the
mitigating instruction. Before the state trial court, the
prosecution submitted that testimony by Lashley's acquaintances would suffice. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-83. On these
facts, we cannot say that the State unfairly required Lashley
to prove a negative.

Nor are we convinced that, as a general rule, States are
better positioned than criminal defendants to adduce evidence of the defendants' own criminal history. While the
prosecution may have ready access to records of crimes committed within its own jurisdiction, the same may not be true
when the defendant has committed crimes in other jurisdictions, perhaps over a period of many years. And any pre507us1$42J 11-20-96 17:23:55 PAGES OPINPGT

sentence report that is created is available to both the gov-ernment and the defense. In this case, Lashley has not

suggested that he was unable to offer his presentence reportas evidence that his prior criminal record was insignificant.
Moreover, the statutory mitigating circumstance refers notto arrests or convictions, but more broadly to "criminal activity." To the extent that this includes criminal conduct thathas not resulted in formal charges, no one is better able than
the defendant to make the required proffer.

II
The dissent contends that this case is not about the re-quirements of Lockett at all, but about the "presumption of

innocence." Post, at 281. The question the dissent raisesis indeed "novel," ibid.; it apparently was not raised in either
the District Court or the Court of Appeals, and it was notpresented to this Court. Nor does the dissent's argument
compel a different result. To be sure, we have said that"[t]he presumption of innocence, although not articulated in
the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial underour system of criminal justice."

Estelle v. Williams, 425U. S. 501, 503 (1976). The presumption operates at the guilt

phase of a trial to remind the jury that the State has theburden of establishing every element of the offense beyond
a reasonable doubt. Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U. S. 478, 484,n. 12 (1978). But even at the guilt phase, the defendant is
not entitled automatically to an instruction that he is pre-sumed innocent of the charged offense.

Kentucky v. Whor-ton, 441 U. S. 786, 789 (1979) (per curiam). An instruction

is constitutionally required only when, in light of the totalityof the circumstances, there is a " `genuine danger' " that the
jury will convict based on something other than the State'slawful evidence, proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Ibid.(quoting Taylor, supra, at 488).

Once the defendant has been convicted fairly in the guiltphase of the trial, the presumption of innocence disappears.

Blackmun, J., dissenting). We have not considered previously whether a presumption that the defendant is inno-cent of other crimes attaches at the sentencing phase. But

even assuming that such a presumption does attach, Lashley
was not entitled to a "presumption of innocence" instruction.Under our precedents, the instruction would have been constitutionally required only if the circumstances created agenuine risk that the jury would conclude, from factors
other than the State's evidence, that the defendant had com-mitted other crimes. See,

e. g., Whorton, supra, at 788-789.
Lashley does not contend that any such circumstances existed in this case. As the dissent acknowledges, post, at 281,
the record before the jury was completely silent on the question whether Lashley had committed prior offenses. The
jury was specifically instructed that the State had the burden of proving the existence of any aggravating circumstances "beyond a reasonable doubt." Instructions Nos. 20-
21, Record 77, 79 (Jan. 29, 1982). Nothing disturbed the
presumption that Lashley was a first offender.

The "circumstances" on which the dissent relies, post, at
284-285, had no bearing on the jurors' perceptions. Lashley's
age and the sentence to which he was subject were irrelevant
to the question whether the jury might conclude improperly
that he was a repeat offender. The dissent assigns special
weight to the fact that defense counsel may have decided not
to introduce evidence concerning Lashley's prior criminal
history for fear that the State would introduce Lashley's juvenile record. We note that, had the trial court improperly
admitted evidence of Lashley's juvenile record, defense counsel could have objected and preserved the issue for appeal.
In any event, the only impact that defense counsel's decision
not to make the necessary proffer could have had on the jury
was to deprive it of possible testimony that Lashley lacked
a criminal history. Without such testimony, the record before the jury was still silent on the question of Lashley's

probable that several of those "other" crimes were com-mitted in connection with the murder, a comment by respondent's counsel in a pretrial conference indicates that oneof them involved the same victim's house "a week or two
beforehand." 1 The record tells us nothing about the man-ner in which that specific statement was elicited, the seriousness of the incident, the dates when that or any of the otherincidents occurred, or even whether counsel's description of
the statement was accurate. Yet that one vague referencemay now explain the Court's willingness to reinstate re1 In support of a motion in limine respondent's counsel asked the court

merits of the novel and important constitutional question
that the case presents. That question is whether the presumption of innocence (uncontradicted in any way by the
prosecution) supports an instruction to the jury at sentencing that the capital defendant's lack of a significant criminal
history is a factor mitigating against its imposition of the
death penalty. The Court acknowledges that the defendant's testimonial assertion of innocence would support the
instruction, see ante, at 277; it fails to recognize that the
presumption of innocence does so as well.

The question arises because the record on which the jury
relied in imposing the death sentence contains no evidence
of any criminal activity by respondent except the serious
felony for which he has been convicted and sentenced. Speculation by appellate judges, see ante, at 273-274, about a matter that was neither available to the sentencing authority nor
mentioned by the State in its petition in this Court is not a
substitute for admissible evidence presented in an adversary
proceeding.2 Speculation about his juvenile record is impermissible; state law prohibits any use of such evidence in adult

2 Although the majority is willing to rely on these unfounded remarks,
see ante, at 273-274, the State itself did not present any such evidence at
respondent's trial or sentencing, and it has not suggested to us (or to any
lower court) that respondent actually committed a single criminal act between his 17th birthday and the murder of his cousin.

As the Court notes, ante, at 274, n., respondent argued both that this
statement was "[ir]relevant," and that "to admit the statements or written
confessions into evidence would be extremely prejudicial . . . ." Motion
in Limine, Record 143 (Jan. 21, 1982). Respondent was correct, of course,
about the improper prejudice that would have resulted from admitting
statements about alleged crimes with which he was never charged and on
which the State has never relied in arguing that the instruction in question was properly withheld. It is unfortunate that respondent was spared
such prejudice in the trial court only to have it reapplied (under the
Court's reading of a stray comment in the record) here.

criminal proceedings.3 Accordingly, as the case comes to us,the record is silent on the question whether respondent led

an entirely blameless life prior to this offense.Missouri's capital sentencing statute provides that the absence of any significant history of prior criminal activity is acircumstance militating against the imposition of the death
penalty.4 In Missouri, therefore--as in the many Stateswith the same statutory mitigating factor--the jury should
be so instructed when the record contains no evidence of anyprior record of criminal activity.

The legal basis for the Court's summary disposition of thiscase is the general rule that a trial judge's instructions to the
jury must normally relate to evidence in the record. Thatgeneral rule, however, has no application to an instruction
on the presumption of innocence in an ordinary criminal trial.In my opinion, the general rule is equally inapplicable in the
capital sentencing process when the defendant requests an

shall be deemed a conviction nor shall the adjudication operate to impose
any of the civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from conviction nor shall
the child be found guilty or be deemed a criminal by reason of the

"3. After a child is taken into custody as provided in section 211.131,
all admissions, confessions, and statements by the child to the juvenile

"The defendant ha[d] no significant history of prior criminal activity."
Even if the statute did not so provide, our holding in Lockett v. Ohio,

instruction explaining the statutory mitigating circumstance
at issue in this case.

I

It has been settled for almost a century that the presumption of innocence, when uncontradicted, is an adequate substitute for affirmative evidence. In 1895 the Court held that
refusing to give an instruction on the presumption of innocence was reversible error, explaining that "this presumption is an instrument of proof created by the law in favor
of one accused, whereby his innocence is established until
sufficient evidence is introduced to overcome the proof which
the law has created." Coffin v. United States, 156 U. S. 432,
459. A few years later, in his landmark treatise on evidence,
Professor Thayer, while noting that a presumption is not itself evidence, concluded:

"What appears to be true may be stated thus:--

"1. A presumption operates to relieve the party in
whose favor it works from going forward in argument
or evidence.

"2. It serves therefore the purposes of a prima facie
case, and in that sense it is, temporarily, the substitute
or equivalent for evidence." J. Thayer, A Preliminary
Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, Appendix B,
p. 575 (1898) (hereinafter Thayer).5

The presumption of innocence plays a unique role in criminal proceedings. As Chief Justice Burger explained in his
opinion for the Court in Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S. 501
(1976):

5 "A presumption may be called `an instrument of proof,' in the sense
that it determines from whom evidence shall come, and it may be called
something `in the nature of evidence,' for the same reason; or it may be
called a substitute for evidence, and even `evidence'--in the sense that it
counts at the outset, for evidence enough to make a prima facie case."
Thayer 576.

"The presumption of innocence, although not articulated
in the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial
under our system of criminal justice. Long ago this
Court stated:

" `The principle that there is a presumption of innocence
in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic
and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.' Coffin
v. United States, 156 U. S. 432, 453 (1895)." Id., at
503.

The failure to instruct the jury on the presumption may
violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment even when a proper instruction on the prosecution's
burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt has been
given. Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U. S. 478 (1978). Whether
the omission amounts to a constitutional violation in a noncapital case depends on "the totality of the circumstances,"
Kentucky v. Whorton, 441 U. S. 786, 789 (1979). In my judgment, the instruction should always be given in a capital
case.

That conclusion is not essential to my appraisal of the capital case before us today, however, because the totality of
circumstances here included respondent's age, the sentence
to which he was subject, and--of special importance--the
trial judge's erroneous refusal to prohibit cross-examination
about his juvenile record. As Chief Judge Arnold explained:

"[T]rial counsel made a reasonable effort to introduce
[affirmative evidence showing that petitioner had no significant criminal history] but was prevented from doing
so by an incorrect ruling of the state trial court. The
court told counsel that if she insisted on offering evidence that Lashley had no criminal record, it would permit the state to counter this evidence by showing that
petitioner had committed juvenile offenses. This ruling

This erroneous ruling by the trial judge unquestionably ex-plains why the record contains no specific testimony about

respondent's prior criminal history. Even though due proc-ess may not automatically entitle a defendant to an instruction that he is presumed innocent of other offenses at thepenalty phase of the trial, under Whorton, supra, the instruction should certainly be given when a trial court erroris responsible for the absence of evidence supporting the
instruction.The failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence at the guilt phase of respondent's trial--whether ornot respondent had presented any evidence of his innocence--would have been constitutional error requiring re-versal of his conviction. Under our holding in

Lockett v.
Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), the comparable refusal in this casewas also constitutional error requiring the vacation of respondent's death sentence.7 The Court of Appeals, there-fore, properly set aside a sentence of death imposed by a

6 The other two members of the panel did not agree with Chief Judge
Arnold's opinion that this error constituted "a separate and distinct violation of the principle of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 . . . (1978)," 957 F. 2d,
at 1500-1501, n. 1, but they did not question his interpretation of state law.

7 We have made it clear that procedural safeguards constitutionally required at the guilt stage of a capital trial are also required at the penalty
stage. Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 358 (1977) (plurality opinion)
("[I]t is now clear that the sentencing process, as well as the trial itself,
must satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause"); Estelle v.
Smith, 451 U. S. 454 (1981) (Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination applies at capital sentencing); Bullington v. Missouri, 451
U. S. 430 (1981) (Double Jeopardy Clause applies at capital sentencing).
In Bullington we actually considered the same Missouri statutes that regulated this respondent's capital sentencing, and held that "[b]y enacting a
capital sentencing procedure that resembles a trial on the issue of guilt or
innocence, however, Missouri explicitly requires the jury to determine
whether the prosecution has `proved its case.' " Id., at 444 (emphasis in

had no prior criminal record.8

II
The mitigating factor in question corresponds precisely tothe presumption of innocence. When the trial record reveals no prior criminal history at all the presumption servesas "a

prima facie case, and in that sense it is, temporarily,the substitute or equivalent for evidence," Thayer 575, that

a criminal defendant is blameless in spite of his indictment,and that even after conviction of one crime, he is presumptively innocent of all other crimes. The State cannot refutethe presumption of innocence at the guilt phase of the trial
without presenting any evidence that the defendant com-mitted the act for which he was indicted; similarly, it has no
basis for objecting to a mitigating instruction on the absenceof a prior criminal history if it has done nothing to rebut the
prima facie case established by the presumption of inno-cence at the sentencing phase of the trial.

8 It is true that respondent's claim of constitutional error focused on the
trial court's refusal to prohibit cross-examination about his juvenile record
and did not mention the presumption of innocence. Similarly, the Court
of Appeals relied on the rationale of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978),
without mentioning the presumption. Nevertheless, our jurisprudence
firmly establishes that it is appropriate to affirm a judgment on a ground
that was not raised below. It is manifestly unjust to reverse a correct
judgment and to reinstate the death penalty simply because the basis for
the judgment was not adequately articulated in earlier proceedings.

9 As the Court correctly notes, just as we have held generally that refusing to give an instruction on the presumption of innocence is not always
reversible error, we have also held as a general matter that a capital defendant may be required to present evidence supporting a requested instruction on a statutory mitigating factor. Ante, at 275-276. We have
even held that the State may require a capital defendant to support a
requested jury instruction with a preponderance of the evidence. Walton
v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). But we have never held that a defendant

In this case, as the Court expressly acknowledges, nothingin the record "disturbed the presumption that Lashley was

a first offender." Ante, at 279. There was no danger thatthe "jury might conclude improperly that he was a repeat
offender." Ibid. What was lacking, however, was advice tothe jury that Missouri law draws a distinction between first
offenders and repeat offenders and provides that member-ship in one class rather than the other shall be considered a
mitigating fact no matter how serious the offense committedby the defendant may be. Failure to advise the jury about
the mitigating effect of his status as first offender is just asunfair as the failure to advise the jury that it should consider
evidence offered by a defendant "as mitigating evidence andthat it could give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence." Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 320 (1989)(emphasis in original).

port of that record to receive an instruction about it. Whether the presumption that a defendant--even a convicted capital defendant--is innocent of all other crimes is viewed as evidence in his favor or merely as a
rule of evidence imposing a burden of proof on the State, it means that the
State must offer something to disprove it. Because the State in this case
offered nothing to disprove it, the instruction was constitutionally required.

Tit. 21, $ 701.10 (1980). Lockett requires the sentencer to listen." Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115, n. 10 (1982). "I disagree with the
suggestion in the dissent that remanding this case may serve no useful
purpose. Even though the petitioner had an opportunity to present evidence in mitigation of the crime, it appears that the trial judge believed
that he could not consider some of the mitigating evidence in imposing
sentence. In any event, we may not speculate as to whether the trial
judge and the Court of Criminal Appeals actually considered all of the
mitigating factors and found them insufficient to offset the aggravating
circumstances, or whether the difference between this Court's opinion and
the trial court's treatment of the petitioner's evidence is `purely a matter
of semantics,' as suggested by the dissent. Woodson [v. North Carolina,

for finding ambiguity concerning the factors actually considered by the

history before the jury may be allowed to rely on the mitigating circumstance when it considers putting him to death.
This suggestion is inconsistent with our refusal to allow the
capital sentencing process to burden the defendant's Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.11 It obviously would have been constitutional error for the prosecutor
or the judge to comment on the defendant's failure to testify
at the guilt or sentencing phase of the trial; it is equally
wrong to deny him an otherwise appropriate mitigating instruction because he failed to testify.

Admittedly, my analysis of the case enables the respondent
to obtain a double benefit from his youth. That he was
barely 17 years old when he committed the offense is itself a
mitigating circumstance; it also serves to shield any earlier
misbehavior from scrutiny when his life is at stake. I believe, however, that such a double benefit is entirely appropriate when a State seeks to take the life of a young person.
To deny that benefit undermines important protections that
the law has traditionally provided to youthful offenders because of their lesser moral culpability and greater potential
for rehabilitation. It is doubly disturbing that the Court
acts summarily in this case, thus expediting the execution of
a defendant who, I firmly believe, should not be eligible for

11 The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, applied
against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment in Malloy v.
Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), clearly applies at the sentencing phase of a

DEMOS v. STORRIE et al.
on motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

No. 92-6846. Decided March 8, 1993
Since this Court denied petitioner Demos leave to proceed in forma pauperis in all future petitions for extraordinary relief, he has filed 14 petitions for certiorari.

Held: Demos is denied leave to proceed under this Court's Rule 39.8, and

the Clerk is directed to reject all future petitions for certiorari from
Demos in noncriminal matters unless he pays the required docketing fee
and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33. His continued
course of abusive filings plainly warrants this sanction.

Motion denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner John R. Demos, Jr., has made 48 in formapauperis filings in this Court since the beginning of the October 1988 Term, many of which challenged sanctions im-posed by lower courts for frivolous filings. Almost two
years ago, we prospectively denied Demos leave to proceed
in forma pauperis "in all future petitions for extraordinaryrelief." In re Demos, 500 U. S. 16, 17 (1991) (per curiam).

At that time, we said that Demos "remains free under thepresent order to file in forma pauperis requests for relief
other than an extraordinary writ, if he qualifies under thisCourt's Rule 39 and does not similarly abuse that privilege." Ibid.Since then, Demos has filed 14 petitions for certiorari.
We denied the first seven petitions outright, and deniedDemos leave to proceed

in forma pauperis under our Rule39.8 as to the following six. Today, we invoke Rule 39.8

again with respect to the instant petition. Demos is alloweduntil March 29, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees
required by Rule 38 and to submit the petition in compliancewith this Court's Rule 33. Because Demos has refused to
heed our prior warning, we further direct the Clerk to reject

all future petitions for certiorari from Demos in noncriminalmatters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule

38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33. SeeMartin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S.
1, 1-2 (1992) (per curiam). Demos' continued course of abu-sive filings plainly warrants this sanction.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.

In my opinion, the administration of special procedures fordisposing of repetitive and frivolous petitions is less efficient
than our past practice of simply denying such petitions.* Icontinue to adhere to my previously stated views on this
issue, see Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals,506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (

Stevens, J., dissenting); Zatko v. California, 502 U. S. 16, 18 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting), andwould deny certiorari rather than invoking Rule 39 in this

case. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

*The next issue the Court will confront in developing its Rule 39.8 jurisprudence, for instance, is whether to apply orders like today's retroactively, to petitions pending on the date they are issued.

RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.

v. FLORES et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-905. Argued October 13, 1992--Decided March 23, 1993
Respondents are a class of alien juveniles arrested by the Immigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) on suspicion of being deportable, and
then detained pending deportation hearings pursuant to a regulation,
promulgated in 1988 and codified at 8 CFR $ 242.24, which provides for
the release of detained minors only to their parents, close relatives, or
legal guardians, except in unusual and compelling circumstances. An
immigration judge will review the initial deportability and custody determinations upon request by the juvenile. $ 242.2(d). Pursuant to a
consent decree entered earlier in the litigation, juveniles who are not
released must be placed in juvenile care facilities that meet or exceed
state licensing requirements for the provision of services to dependent
children. Respondents contend that they have a right under the Constitution and immigration laws to be routinely released into the custody
of other "responsible adults." The District Court invalidated the regulatory scheme on unspecified due process grounds, ordering that "responsible adult part[ies]" be added to the list of persons to whom a
juvenile must be released and requiring that a hearing before an immigration judge be held automatically, whether or not the juvenile requests it. The Court of Appeals, en banc, affirmed.

Held:

1. Because this is a facial challenge to the regulation, respondents
must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the regulation would be valid. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745.
Pp. 300-301.

2. Regulation 242.24, on its face, does not violate the Due Process
Clause. Pp. 301-309.

(a) The regulation does not deprive respondents of "substantive
due process." The substantive right asserted by respondents is properly described as the right of a child who has no available parent, close
relative, or legal guardian, and for whom the government is responsible, to be placed in the custody of a private custodian rather than of
a government-operated or government-selected child-care institution.
That novel claim cannot be considered " `so rooted in the traditions and
conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' " United

States v. Salerno, supra, at 751. It is therefore sufficient that the
regulation is rationally connected to the government's interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of detained juveniles, and is not punitive since it is not excessive in relation to that valid purpose. Nor does
each unaccompanied juvenile have a substantive right to an individualized hearing on whether private placement would be in his "best interests." Governmental custody must meet minimum standards, as the
consent decree indicates it does here, but the decision to exceed those
standards is a policy judgment, not a constitutional imperative. Any
remaining constitutional doubts are eliminated by the fact that almost
all respondents are aliens suspected of being deportable, a class that
can be detained, and over which Congress has granted the Attorney
General broad discretion regarding detention. 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1).
Pp. 301-306.

(b) Existing INS procedures provide alien juveniles with "procedural due process." Respondents' demand for an individualized custody hearing for each detained alien juvenile is merely the "substantive
due process" argument recast in procedural terms. Nor are the procedures faulty because they do not require automatic review by an immigration judge of initial deportability and custody determinations. In
the context of this facial challenge, providing the right to review suffices. It has not been shown that all of the juveniles detained are too
young or ignorant to exercise that right; any waiver of a hearing is
revocable; and there is no evidence of excessive delay in holding hearings when requested. Pp. 306-309.

3. The regulation does not exceed the scope of the Attorney General's
discretion to continue custody over arrested aliens under 8 U. S. C.

$ 1252(a)(1). It rationally pursues a purpose that is lawful for the INS
to seek, striking a balance between the INS's concern that the juveniles'
welfare will not permit their release to just any adult and the INS's
assessment that it has neither the expertise nor the resources to conduct
home studies for individualized placements. The list of approved custodians reflects the traditional view that parents and close relatives are
competent custodians, and otherwise defers to the States' proficiency in
the field of child custody. The regulation is not motivated by administrative convenience; its use of presumptions and generic rules is reasonable; and the period of detention that may result is limited by the pending deportation hearing, which must be concluded with reasonable
dispatch to avoid habeas corpus. Pp. 309-315.

the deportation hearing.1 The Board of Immigration Ap-peals has stated that "[a]n alien generally . . . should not

be detained or required to post bond except on a findingthat he is a threat to the national security . . . or that he is
a poor bail risk." Matter of Patel, 15 I. & N. Dec. 666 (1976);cf.

INS v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc.(NCIR), 502 U. S. 183 (1991) (upholding INS regulation imposing conditions upon release). In the case of arrestedalien juveniles, however, the INS cannot simply send them
off into the night on bond or recognizance. The parties tothe present suit agree that the Service must assure itself
that someone will care for those minors pending resolutionof their deportation proceedings. That is easily done when
the juvenile's parents have also been detained and the familycan be released together; it becomes complicated when the
juvenile is arrested alone, i. e., unaccompanied by a parent,guardian, or other related adult. This problem is a serious
one, since the INS arrests thousands of alien juveniles eachyear (more than 8,500 in 1990 alone)--as many as 70% of
them unaccompanied. Brief for Petitioners 8. Most ofthese minors are boys in their midteens, but perhaps 15%
are girls and the same percentage 14 years of age or younger.See id., at 9, n. 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 177a.

For a number of years the problem was apparently dealtwith on a regional and ad hoc basis, with some INS offices
releasing unaccompanied alien juveniles not only to theirparents but also to a range of other adults and organizations.

1 Title 8 U. S. C. $1252(a)(1), 66 Stat. 208, as amended, provides: "[A]ny
such alien taken into custody may, in the discretion of the Attorney General and pending such final determination of deportability, (A) be continued in custody; or (B) be released under bond . . . containing such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe; or (C) be released on
conditional parole. But such bond or parole . . . may be revoked at any
time by the Attorney General, in his discretion . . . ."

The Attorney General's discretion to release aliens convicted of aggravated felonies is narrower. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. III).

296 RENO v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
In 1984, responding to the increased flow of unaccompaniedjuvenile aliens into California, the INS Western Regional

Office adopted a policy of limiting the release of detainedminors to " `a parent or lawful guardian,' " except in " `unusual and extraordinary cases,' " when the juvenile could bereleased to " `a responsible individual who agrees to provide
care and be responsible for the welfare and well being of thechild.' " See

Flores v. Meese, 934 F. 2d 991, 994 (CA9 1990)(quoting policy), vacated, 942 F. 2d 1352 (CA9 1991) (en banc).

In July of the following year, the four respondents filed anaction in the District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of a class, later certified by the court, con-sisting of all aliens under the age of 18 who are detained by
the INS Western Region because "a parent or legal guardianfails to personally appear to take custody of them." App.
29. The complaint raised seven claims, the first two chal-lenging the Western Region release policy (on constitutional,
statutory, and international law grounds), and the final fivechallenging the conditions of the juveniles' detention.

The District Court granted the INS partial summary judg-ment on the statutory and international law challenges to
the release policy, and in late 1987 approved a consent decreethat settled all claims regarding the detention conditions.
The court then turned to the constitutional challenges to therelease policy, and granted respondents partial summary
judgment on their equal protection claim that the INS hadno rational basis for treating alien minors in deportation proceedings differently from alien minors in exclusion proceed-ings

2 (whom INS regulations permitted to be paroled, in

some circumstances, to persons other than parents and legalguardians, including other relatives and "friends," see 8 CFR

$ 212.5(a)(2)(ii) (1987)). This prompted the INS to initiate

2 Exclusion proceedings, which are not at issue in the present case, involve aliens apprehended before "entering" the United States, as that
term is used in the immigration laws. See Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357
U. S. 185, 187 (1958).

Opinion of the Court
notice-and-comment rulemaking "to codify Service policyregarding detention and release of juvenile aliens and to

provide a single policy for juveniles in both deportation andexclusion proceedings." 52 Fed. Reg. 38245 (1987). The
District Court agreed to defer consideration of respondents'
due process claims until the regulation was promulgated.The uniform deportation-exclusion rule finally adopted,

published on May 17, 1988, see Detention and Release ofJuveniles, 53 Fed. Reg. 17449 (codified as to deportation at
8 CFR $ 242.24 (1992)), expanded the possibilities for releasesomewhat beyond the Western Region policy, but not as far
as many commenters had suggested. It provides that alien
juveniles "shall be released, in order of preference, to: (i) a
parent; (ii) a legal guardian; or (iii) an adult relative (brother,
sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent) who are [sic] not presently
in INS detention," unless the INS determines that "the
detention of such juvenile is required to secure his timely
appearance before the Service or the immigration court or
to ensure the juvenile's safety or that of others." 8 CFR

$ 242.24(b)(1) (1992). If the only listed individuals are in
INS detention, the Service will consider simultaneous release of the juvenile and custodian "on a discretionary caseby-case basis." $ 242.24(b)(2). A parent or legal guardian
who is in INS custody or outside the United States may also,
by sworn affidavit, designate another person as capable and
willing to care for the child, provided that person "execute[s]
an agreement to care for the juvenile and to ensure the juvenile's presence at all future proceedings." $ 242.24(b)(3).
Finally, in "unusual and compelling circumstances and in
the discretion of the [INS] district director or chief patrol
agent," juveniles may be released to other adults who execute a care and attendance agreement. $ 242.24(b)(4).

If the juvenile is not released under the foregoing provision, the regulation requires a designated INS official, the
"Juvenile Coordinator," to locate "suitable placement . . .
in a facility designated for the occupancy of juveniles."

$ 242.24(c). The Service may briefly hold the minor in an"INS detention facility having separate accommodations for

juveniles," $ 242.24(d), but under the terms of the consentdecree resolving respondents' conditions-of-detention claims,
the INS must within 72 hours of arrest place alien juveniles
in a facility that meets or exceeds the standards establishedby the Alien Minors Care Program of the Community Relations Service (CRS), Department of Justice, 52 Fed. Reg.15569 (1987). See Memorandum of Understanding Re Compromise of Class Action: Conditions of Detention, Floresv.

Meese, No. 85-4544-RJK (Px) (CD Cal., Nov. 30, 1987)
(incorporating the CRS notice and program description),
reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a-205a (hereinafter
Juvenile Care Agreement).

Juveniles placed in these facilities are deemed to be in INS
detention "because of issues of payment and authorization
of medical care." 53 Fed. Reg., at 17449. "Legal custody"
rather than "detention" more accurately describes the reality
of the arrangement, however, since these are not correctional
institutions but facilities that meet "state licensing requirements for the provision of shelter care, foster care, group
care, and related services to dependent children," Juvenile
Care Agreement 176a, and are operated "in an open type of
setting without a need for extraordinary security measures,"
id., at 173a. The facilities must provide, in accordance with
"applicable state child welfare statutes and generally accepted child welfare standards, practices, principles and procedures," id., at 157a, an extensive list of services, including
physical care and maintenance, individual and group counseling, education, recreation and leisure-time activities, family
reunification services, and access to religious services, visitors, and legal assistance, id., at 159a, 178a-185a.

Although the regulation replaced the Western Region release policy that had been the focus of respondents' constitutional claims, respondents decided to maintain the litigation
as a challenge to the new rule. Just a week after the regula507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:14 PAGES OPINPGT

tion took effect, in a brief, unpublished order that referredonly to unspecified "due process grounds," the District Court

granted summary judgment to respondents and invalidatedthe regulatory scheme in three important respects. Flores
v. Meese, No. CV 85-4544-RJK (Px) (CD Cal., May 25, 1988),App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a. First, the court ordered the
INS to release "any minor otherwise eligible for release . . .to his parents, guardian, custodian, conservator,

or otherresponsible adult party." Ibid. (emphasis added). Second,

the order dispensed with the regulation's requirement thatunrelated custodians formally agree to care for the juvenile,
8 CFR $$ 242.24(b)(3) and (4) (1992), in addition to ensuringhis attendance at future proceedings. Finally, the District
Court rewrote the related INS regulations that provide foran initial determination of prima facie deportability and
release conditions before an INS examiner, see $ 287.3, withreview by an immigration judge upon the alien's request, see

$ 242.2(d). It decreed instead that an immigration-judgehearing on probable cause and release restrictions should be
provided "forthwith" after arrest, whether or not the juve-nile requests it. App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed. Floresv. Meese, 934 F. 2d 991 (CA9 1990). The Ninth Circuit voted
to rehear the case and selected an 11-judge en banc court.See Ninth Circuit Rule 35-3. That court vacated the panel
opinion and affirmed the District Court order "in all re-spects."

Flores v. Meese, 942 F. 2d 1352, 1365 (1991). Onejudge dissented in part, see id., at 1372-1377 (opinion of

Rymer, J.), and four in toto, see id., at 1377-1385 (opinionof Wallace, C. J.). We granted certiorari. 503 U. S. 905
(1992). II

Respondents make three principal attacks upon INS regu-lation 242.24. First, they assert that alien juveniles suspected of being deportable have a "fundamental" right to"freedom from physical restraint," Brief for Respondents 16,

Opinion of the Court
and it is therefore a denial of "substantive due process" todetain them, since the Service cannot prove that it is pursuing an important governmental interest in a manner nar-rowly tailored to minimize the restraint on liberty. Second,
respondents argue that the regulation violates "proceduraldue process," because it does not require the Service to determine, with regard to each individual detained juvenilewho lacks an approved custodian, whether his best interests
lie in remaining in INS custody or in release to some other"responsible adult." Finally, respondents contend that even
if the INS regulation infringes no constitutional rights, itexceeds the Attorney General's authority under 8 U. S. C.

$ 1252(a)(1). We find it economic to discuss the objections inthat order, though we of course reach the constitutional issues only because we conclude that the respondents' statu-tory argument fails.

3

Before proceeding further, however, we make two impor-tant observations. First, this is a facial challenge to INS

regulation 242.24. Respondents do not challenge its applica-tion in a particular instance; it had not yet been applied in a
particular instance--because it was not yet in existence--when their suit was brought (directed at the 1984 Western
Region release policy), and it had been in effect only a weekwhen the District Court issued the judgment invalidating
it. We have before us no findings of fact, indeed no record,concerning the INS's interpretation of the regulation or the

3 The District Court and all three judges on the Court of Appeals panel
held in favor of the INS on this statutory claim, see Flores v. Meese, 934
F. 2d 991, 995, 997-1002 (CA9 1991); id., at 1015 (Fletcher, J., dissenting);
the en banc court (curiously) did not address the claim, proceeding immediately to find the rule unconstitutional. Although respondents did not
cross-petition for certiorari on the statutory issue, they may legitimately
defend their judgment on any ground properly raised below. See Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S.
463, 476, n. 20 (1979). The INS does not object to our considering the
issue, and we do so in order to avoid deciding constitutional questions
unnecessarily. See Jean v. Nelson, 472 U. S. 846, 854 (1985).

Opinion of the Court
history of its enforcement. We have only the regulation it-self and the statement of basis and purpose that accompanied

its promulgation. To prevail in such a facial challenge, re-spondents "must establish that no set of circumstances exists
under which the [regulation] would be valid." United Statesv.

Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). That is true as to boththe constitutional challenges, see Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S.

253, 268, n. 18 (1984), and the statutory challenge, see NCIR,502 U. S., at 188.

The second point is related. Respondents spend muchtime, and their amici even more, condemning the conditions
under which some alien juveniles are held, alleging that theconditions are so severe as to belie the Service's stated reasons for retaining custody--leading, presumably, to the con-clusion that the retention of custody is an unconstitutional
infliction of punishment without trial. See Salerno, supra,at 746-748;

Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 237(1896). But whatever those conditions might have been

when this litigation began, they are now (at least in theWestern Region, where all members of the respondents'
class are held) presumably in compliance with the extensiverequirements set forth in the Juvenile Care Agreement that
settled respondents' claims regarding detention conditions,see

supra, at 298. The settlement agreement entitles re-spondents to enforce compliance with those requirements in

the District Court, see Juvenile Care Agreement 148a-149a,which they acknowledge they have not done, Tr. of Oral Arg.
43. We will disregard the effort to reopen those settledclaims by alleging, for purposes of the challenges to the regulation, that the detention conditions are other than what theconsent decree says they must be.

III
Respondents' "substantive due process" claim relies uponour line of cases which interprets the Fifth and Fourteenth

Amendments' guarantee of "due process of law" to include

302 RENO v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
a substantive component, which forbids the government toinfringe certain "fundamental" liberty interests

at all, no
matter what process is provided, unless the infringement isnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. See,

e. g., Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992);
Salerno, supra, at 746; Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186,191 (1986). "Substantive due process" analysis must begin

with a careful description of the asserted right, for "[t]hedoctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the
utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground inthis field."

Collins, supra, at 125; see Bowers v. Hardwick,
supra, at 194-195. The "freedom from physical restraint"
invoked by respondents is not at issue in this case. Surely
not in the sense of shackles, chains, or barred cells, given the
Juvenile Care Agreement. Nor even in the sense of a right
to come and go at will, since, as we have said elsewhere,
"juveniles, unlike adults, are always in some form of custody," Schall, 467 U. S., at 265, and where the custody of the
parent or legal guardian fails, the government may (indeed,
we have said must) either exercise custody itself or appoint
someone else to do so. Ibid. Nor is the right asserted the
right of a child to be released from all other custody into the
custody of its parents, legal guardian, or even close relatives:
The challenged regulation requires such release when it is
sought. Rather, the right at issue is the alleged right of
a child who has no available parent, close relative, or legal
guardian, and for whom the government is responsible, to be
placed in the custody of a willing-and-able private custodian rather than of a government-operated or governmentselected child-care institution.

If there exists a fundamental right to be released into
what respondents inaccurately call a "non-custodial setting,"
Brief for Respondents 18, we see no reason why it would
apply only in the context of government custody incidentally
acquired in the course of law enforcement. It would presumably apply to state custody over orphans and abandoned

children as well, giving federal law and federal courts amajor new role in the management of state orphanages and

other child-care institutions. Cf. Ankenbrandt v. Richards,504 U. S. 689, 703-704 (1992). We are unaware, however,
that any court--aside from the courts below--has ever held
that a child has a constitutional right not to be placed in adecent and humane custodial institution if there is available

a responsible person unwilling to become the child's legalguardian but willing to undertake temporary legal custody.
The mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubtthat "substantive due process" sustains it; the alleged right
certainly cannot be considered " `so rooted in the traditions
and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' " Salerno, supra, at 751 (quoting Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)). Where a juvenile has no
available parent, close relative, or legal guardian, where the
government does not intend to punish the child, and where
the conditions of governmental custody are decent and humane, such custody surely does not violate the Constitution.
It is rationally connected to a governmental interest in "preserving and promoting the welfare of the child," Santosky v.
Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 766 (1982), and is not punitive since
it is not excessive in relation to that valid purpose. See
Schall, supra, at 269.

Although respondents generally argue for the categorical
right of private placement discussed above, at some points
they assert a somewhat more limited constitutional right:
the right to an individualized hearing on whether private
placement would be in the child's "best interests"--followed
by private placement if the answer is in the affirmative. It
seems to us, however, that if institutional custody (despite
the availability of responsible private custodians) is not unconstitutional in itself, it does not become so simply because
it is shown to be less desirable than some other arrangement
for the particular child. "The best interests of the child," a
venerable phrase familiar from divorce proceedings, is a

Opinion of the Court
proper and feasible criterion for making the decision as towhich of two parents will be accorded custody. But it is not

traditionally the sole criterion--much less the sole constitutional criterion--for other, less narrowly channeled judgments involving children, where their interests conflict in
varying degrees with the interests of others. Even if itwere shown, for example, that a particular couple desirous

of adopting a child would best provide for the child's welfare,the child would nonetheless not be removed from the custody
of its parents so long as they were providing for the child
adequately. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 255
(1978). Similarly, "the best interests of the child" is not the
legal standard that governs parents' or guardians' exercise
of their custody: So long as certain minimum requirements
of child care are met, the interests of the child may be subordinated to the interests of other children, or indeed even to
the interests of the parents or guardians themselves. See,
e. g., R. C. N. v. State, 141 Ga. App. 490, 491, 233 S. E. 2d 866,
867 (1977).

"The best interests of the child" is likewise not an absolute
and exclusive constitutional criterion for the government's
exercise of the custodial responsibilities that it undertakes,
which must be reconciled with many other responsibilities.
Thus, child-care institutions operated by the State in the exercise of its parens patriae authority, see Schall, supra, at
265, are not constitutionally required to be funded at such a
level as to provide the best schooling or the best health care
available; nor does the Constitution require them to substitute, wherever possible, private nonadoptive custody for institutional care. And the same principle applies, we think,
to the governmental responsibility at issue here, that of retaining or transferring custody over a child who has come
within the Federal Government's control, when the parents
or guardians of that child are nonexistent or unavailable.
Minimum standards must be met, and the child's fundamental rights must not be impaired; but the decision to go be507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:14 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
yond those requirements--to give one or another of thechild's additional interests priority over other concerns that

compete for public funds and administrative attention--is apolicy judgment rather than a constitutional imperative.

Respondents' "best interests" argument is, in essence, a
demand that the INS program be narrowly tailored to mini-mize the denial of release into private custody. But narrow

tailoring is required only when fundamental rights are in-volved. The impairment of a lesser interest (here, the alleged interest in being released into the custody of strang-ers) demands no more than a "reasonable fit" between
governmental purpose (here, protecting the welfare of the
juveniles who have come into the Government's custody) and
the means chosen to advance that purpose. This leaves
ample room for an agency to decide, as the INS has, that
administrative factors such as lack of child-placement expertise favor using one means rather than another. There is,
in short, no constitutional need for a hearing to determine
whether private placement would be better, so long as institutional custody is (as we readily find it to be, assuming compliance with the requirements of the consent decree) good
enough.

If we harbored any doubts as to the constitutionality of
institutional custody over unaccompanied juveniles, they
would surely be eliminated as to those juveniles (concededly
the overwhelming majority of all involved here) who are
aliens. "For reasons long recognized as valid, the responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United
States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government." Mathews v.
Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 81 (1976). " `[O]ver no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.' "
Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 792 (1977) (quoting Oceanic
Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U. S. 320, 339
(1909)). Thus, "in the exercise of its broad power over immigration and naturalization, `Congress regularly makes

rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.' "430 U. S., at 792 (quoting Mathews v. Diaz, supra, at 79-80).

Respondents do not dispute that Congress has the authorityto detain aliens suspected of entering the country illegally
pending their deportation hearings, see Carlson v. Landon,342 U. S. 524, 538 (1952);

Wong Wing v. United States, 163U. S., at 235. And in enacting the precursor to 8 U. S. C.

$ 1252(a), Congress eliminated any presumption of releasepending deportation, committing that determination to the
discretion of the Attorney General. See Carlson v. Landon,supra, at 538-540. Of course, the INS regulation must still
meet the (unexacting) standard of rationally advancing somelegitimate governmental purpose--which it does, as we shall
discuss later in connection with the statutory challenge.Respondents also argue, in a footnote, that the INS release
policy violates the "equal protection guarantee" of the FifthAmendment because of the disparate treatment evident in
(1) releasing alien juveniles with close relatives or legalguardians but detaining those without, and (2) releasing to
unrelated adults juveniles detained pending federal delin-quency proceedings, see 18 U. S. C. $ 5034, but detaining unaccompanied alien juveniles pending deportation proceed-ings. The tradition of reposing custody in close relatives
and legal guardians is in our view sufficient to support theformer distinction; and the difference between citizens and
aliens is adequate to support the latter.

IV
We turn now from the claim that the INS cannot depriverespondents of their asserted liberty interest

at all, to the"procedural due process" claim that the Service cannot do so

on the basis of the procedures it provides. It is well estab-lished that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings. See The Japanese
Immigrant Case, 189 U. S. 86, 100-101 (1903). To determinewhether these alien juveniles have received it here, we must

first review in some detail the procedures the INS hasemployed.

Though a procedure for obtaining warrants to arrestnamed individuals is available, see 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1); 8
CFR $ 242.2(c)(1) (1992), the deportation process ordinarilybegins with a warrantless arrest by an INS officer who has
reason to believe that the arrestee "is in the United Statesin violation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is
likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained," 8 U. S. C.$ 1357(a)(2). Arrested aliens are almost always offered the
choice of departing the country voluntarily, 8 U. S. C.$ 1252(b) (1988 ed., Supp. III); 8 CFR $ 242.5 (1992), and as
many as 98% of them take that course. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1044 (1984). Before the Service
seeks execution of a voluntary departure form by a juvenile,however, the juvenile "must in fact communicate with either
a parent, adult relative, friend, or with an organization foundon the free legal services list." 8 CFR $ 242.24(g) (1992).

4

If the juvenile does not seek voluntary departure, he mustbe brought before an INS examining officer within 24 hours

of his arrest. $ 287.3; see 8 U. S. C. $ 1357(a)(2). The exam-ining officer is a member of the Service's enforcement staff,
but must be someone other than the arresting officer (unlessno other qualified examiner is readily available). 8 CFR

$ 287.3 (1992). If the examiner determines that "there isprima facie evidence establishing that the arrested alien is
in the United States in violation of the immigration laws,"
ibid., a formal deportation proceeding is initiated throughthe issuance of an order to show cause, $ 242.1, and within

24 hours the decision is made whether to continue the alienjuvenile in custody or release him, $ 287.3.

4 Alien juveniles from Canada and Mexico must be offered the opportunity to make a telephone call but need not in fact do so, see 8 CFR

$ 242.24(g) (1992); the United States has treaty obligations to notify diplomatic or consular officers of those countries whenever their nationals are
detained, see $ 242.2(g).

308 RENO v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
The INS notifies the alien of the commencement of a de-portation proceeding and of the decision as to custody by

serving him with a Form I-221S (reprinted in App. to Brieffor Petitioners 7a-8a) which, pursuant to the Immigration
Act of 1990, 8 U. S. C. $ 1252b(a)(3)(A) (1988 ed., Supp. III),
must be in English and Spanish. The front of this form no-tifies the alien of the allegations against him and the date of

his deportation hearing. The back contains a section en-titled "NOTICE OF CUSTODY DETERMINATION," in
which the INS officer checks a box indicating whether thealien will be detained in the custody of the Service, released on recognizance, or released under bond. Beneath
these boxes, the form states: "You may request the Immigration Judge to redetermine this decision." See 8 CFR

$ 242.2(c)(2) (1992). (The immigration judge is a quasijudicial officer in the Executive Office for Immigration Review, a division separated from the Service's enforcement
staff. $ 3.10.) The alien must check either a box stating
"I do" or a box stating "[I] do not request a redetermination
by an Immigration Judge of the custody decision," and must
then sign and date this section of the form. If the alien
requests a hearing and is dissatisfied with the outcome, he
may obtain further review by the Board of Immigration
Appeals, $ 242.2(d); $ 3.1(b)(7), and by the federal courts,
see, e. g., Carlson v. Landon, supra, at 529, 531.

Respondents contend that this procedural system is unconstitutional because it does not require the Service to determine in the case of each individual alien juvenile that detention in INS custody would better serve his interests than
release to some other "responsible adult." This is just the
"substantive due process" argument recast in "procedural
due process" terms, and we reject it for the same reasons.

The District Court and the en banc Court of Appeals concluded that the INS procedures are faulty because they do
not provide for automatic review by an immigration judge
of the initial deportability and custody determinations. See

Opinion of the Court
942 F. 2d, at 1364. We disagree. At least insofar as thisfacial challenge is concerned, due process is satisfied by giving the detained alien juveniles the right to a hearing beforean immigration judge. It has not been shown that all of
them are too young or too ignorant to exercise that rightwhen the form asking them to assert or waive it is presented.
Most are 16 or 17 years old and will have been in telephonecontact with a responsible adult outside the INS--sometimes
a legal services attorney. The waiver, moreover, is revoca-ble: The alien may request a judicial redetermination at any
time later in the deportation process. See 8 CFR $ 242.2(d)(1992);

Matter of Uluocha, Interim Dec. 3124 (BIA 1989).We have held that juveniles are capable of "knowingly and

intelligently" waiving their right against self-incriminationin criminal cases. See

Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707,724-727 (1979); see also United States v. Saucedo-Velasquez,

843 F. 2d 832, 835 (CA5 1988) (applying Fare to alien ju-venile). The alleged right to redetermination of prehearing custody status in deportation cases is surely no moresignificant.

Respondents point out that the regulations do not set atime period within which the immigration-judge hearing, if
requested, must be held. But we will not assume, on thisfacial challenge, that an excessive delay will invariably
ensue--particularly since there is no evidence of such delay,even in isolated instances. Cf.

Matter of Chirinos, 16 I. &N. Dec. 276 (BIA 1977).

V
Respondents contend that the regulation goes beyond thescope of the Attorney General's discretion to continue custody over arrested aliens under 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1). Thatcontention must be rejected if the regulation has a " `reasonable foundation,' " Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S., at 541, thatis, if it rationally pursues a purpose that it is lawful for the
INS to seek. See also NCIR, 502 U. S., at 194. We thinkthat it does.

310 RENO v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
The statement of basis and purpose accompanying promulgation of regulation 242.24, in addressing the question "as
to whose custody the juvenile should be released," began
with the dual propositions that "concern for the welfare of
the juvenile will not permit release to just any adult" and
that "the Service has neither the expertise nor the resources
to conduct home studies for placement of each juvenile released." Detention and Release of Juveniles, 53 Fed. Reg.
17449 (1988). The INS decided to "strik[e] a balance" by
defining a list of presumptively appropriate custodians while
maintaining the discretion of local INS directors to release
detained minors to other custodians in "unusual and compelling circumstances." Ibid. The list begins with parents,
whom our society and this Court's jurisprudence have always presumed to be the preferred and primary custodians
of their minor children. See Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584,
602-603 (1979). The list extends to other close blood relatives, whose protective relationship with children our society
has also traditionally respected. See Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977); cf. Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas,
416 U. S. 1 (1974). And finally, the list includes persons
given legal guardianship by the States, which we have said
possess "special proficiency" in the field of domestic relations, including child custody. Ankenbrandt v. Richards,
504 U. S., at 704. When neither parent, close relative, or
state-appointed guardian is immediately available,5 the INS
will normally keep legal custody of the juvenile, place him
in a government-supervised and state-licensed shelter-care

5 The regulation also provides for release to any person designated by a
juvenile's parent or guardian as "capable and willing to care for the juvenile's well-being." 8 CFR $ 242.24(b)(3) (1992). "[To] ensur[e] that the
INS is actually receiving the wishes of the parent or guardian," 53 Fed.
Reg. 17450 (1988), the designation must be in the form of a sworn affidavit
executed before an immigration or consular officer.

facility, and continue searching for a relative or guardian,although release to others is possible in unusual cases.

Respondents object that this scheme is motivated purelyby "administrative convenience," a charge echoed by the

dissent, see, e. g., post, at 320. This fails to grasp the dis-tinction between administrative convenience (or, to speak
less pejoratively, administrative efficiency) as the purposeof a policy--for example, a policy of not considering late-filed
objections--and administrative efficiency as the reason forselecting one means of achieving a purpose over another.
Only the latter is at issue here. The requisite statement ofbasis and purpose published by the INS upon promulgation
of regulation 242.24 declares that the purpose of the rule isto protect "the welfare of the juvenile," 53 Fed. Reg. 17449
(1988), and there is no basis for calling that false. (Respond-ents' contention that the real purpose was to save money
imputes not merely mendacity but irrationality, since re-spondents point out that detention in shelter-care facilities
is more expensive than release.) Because the regulation in-volves no deprivation of a "fundamental" right, the Service
was not compelled to ignore the costs and difficulty of alter-native means of advancing its declared goal. Cf.

Stanley v.

6 The dissent maintains that, in making custody decisions, the INS cannot rely on "[c]ategorical distinctions between cousins and uncles, or between relatives and godparents or other responsible persons," because
"[d]ue process demands more, far more." Post, at 343. Acceptance of
such a proposition would revolutionize much of our family law. Categorical distinctions between relatives and nonrelatives, and between relatives
of varying degree of affinity, have always played a predominant role in
determining child custody and in innumerable other aspects of domestic
relations. The dissent asserts, however, that it would prohibit such distinctions only for the purpose of "prefer[ring] detention [by which it means
institutional detention] to release," and accuses us of "mischaracteriz[ing]
the issue" in suggesting otherwise. Post, at 343, n. 29. It seems to us
that the dissent mischaracterizes the issue. The INS uses the categorical
distinction between relatives and nonrelatives not to deny release, but to
determine which potential custodians will be accepted without the safeguard of state-decreed guardianship.

312 RENO v. FLORES

Opinion of the Court
Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656-657 (1972). It is impossible tocontradict the Service's assessment that it lacks the "expertise," and is not "qualified," to do individualized child-placement studies, 53 Fed. Reg. 17449 (1988), and the right
alleged here provides no basis for this Court to impose upon
what is essentially a law enforcement agency the obligationto expend its limited resources in developing such expertise

and qualification.7 That reordering of priorities is for Con-gress--which has shown, we may say, no inclination to shrink
from the task. See, e. g., 8 U. S. C. $ 1154(c) (requiring INSto determine if applicants for immigration are involved in
"sham" marriages). We do not hold, as the dissent contends,that "minimizing administrative costs" is adequate justification for the Service's detention of juveniles, post, at 320;but we do hold that a detention program justified by the
need to protect the welfare of juveniles is not constitutionally required to give custody to strangers if that entails the
expenditure of administrative effort and resources that the
Service is unwilling to commit.8

7 By referring unrelated persons seeking custody to state guardianship
procedures, the INS is essentially drawing upon resources and expertise
that are already in place. Respondents' objection to this is puzzling, in
light of their assertion that the States generally view unrelated adults as
appropriate custodians. See post, at 325-326, n. 7 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (collecting state statutes). If that is so, one wonders why the individuals and organizations respondents allege are eager to accept custody do
not rush to state court, have themselves appointed legal guardians (temporary or permanent, the States have procedures for both), and then obtain
the juveniles' release under the terms of the regulation. Respondents
and their amici do maintain that becoming a guardian can be difficult, but
the problems they identify--delays in processing, the need to ensure that
existing parental rights are not infringed, the "bureaucratic gauntlet"--
would be no less significant were the INS to duplicate existing state
procedures.

8 We certainly agree with the dissent that this case must be decided in

accordance with "indications of congressional policy," post, at 334. The
most pertinent indication, however, is not, as the dissent believes, the
federal statute governing detention of juveniles pending delinquency

313Cite as: 507 U. S. 292 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Respondents also contend that the INS regulation violatesthe statute because it relies upon a "blanket" presumption

of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, closerelatives, and guardians. We have stated that, at least in
certain contexts, the Attorney General's exercise of discre-tion under $ 1252(a)(1) requires "some level of individualized
determination." NCIR, 502 U. S., at 194; see also Carlsonv.

Landon, 342 U. S., at 538. But as NCIR itself demon-strates, this does not mean that the Service must forswear

use of reasonable presumptions and generic rules. See 502U. S., at 196, n. 11; cf. Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458,
467 (1983). In the case of each detained alien juvenile, theINS makes those determinations that are specific to the individual and necessary to accurate application of the regula-tion: Is there reason to believe the alien deportable? Is the
alien under 18 years of age? Does the alien have an availproceedings, 18 U. S. C. $ 5034, but the statute under which the Attorney
General is here acting, 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1). That grants the Attorney
General discretion to determine when temporary detention pending deportation proceedings is appropriate, and makes his exercise of that discretion "presumptively correct and unassailable except for abuse." Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 540 (1952). We assuredly cannot say that
the decision to rely on universally accepted presumptions as to the custodial competence of parents and close relatives, and to defer to the expertise of the States regarding the capabilities of other potential custodians, is
an abuse of this broad discretion simply because it does not track policies
applicable outside the immigration field. See NCIR, 502 U. S. 183, 193-
194 (1991). Moreover, reliance upon the States to determine guardianship
is quite in accord with what Congress has directed in other immigration
contexts. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1154(d) (INS may not approve immigration petition for an alien juvenile orphan being adopted unless "a valid home-study
has been favorably recommended by an agency of the State of the child's
proposed residence, or by an agency authorized by that State to conduct
such a study"); $ 1522(d)(2)(B)(ii) (for refugee children unaccompanied by
parents or close relatives, INS shall "attempt to arrange . . . placement
under the laws of the States"); see also 45 CFR $ 400.113 (1992) (providing
support payments under $ 1522 until the refugee juvenile is placed with a
parent or with another adult "to whom legal custody and/or guardianship
is granted under State law").

able adult relative or legal guardian? Is the alien's case soexceptional as to require consideration of release to someone else? The particularization and individuation need gono further than this.

Finally, respondents claim that the regulation is an abuseof discretion because it permits the INS, once having determined that an alien juvenile lacks an available relative or
legal guardian, to hold the juvenile in detention indefinitely.
That is not so. The period of custody is inherently limited
by the pending deportation hearing, which must be concluded with "reasonable dispatch" to avoid habeas corpus.
8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1); cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.,
at 747 (noting time limits placed on pretrial detention by
the Speedy Trial Act). It is expected that alien juveniles
will remain in INS custody an average of only 30 days. See
Juvenile Care Agreement 178a. There is no evidence that
alien juveniles are being held for undue periods pursuant to
regulation 242.24, or that habeas corpus is insufficient to
remedy particular abuses.10 And the reasonableness of the

9 The dissent would mandate fully individualized custody determinations
for two reasons. First, because it reads Carlson v. Landon, supra, as
holding that the Attorney General may not employ "mere presumptions"
in exercising his discretion. Post, at 337. But it was only the dissenters
in Carlson who took such a restrictive view. See 342 U. S., at 558-559,
563-564, 568 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Second, because it believes
that $ 1252(a) must be interpreted to require individualized hearings in
order to avoid " `constitutional doubts.' " Post, at 334 (quoting United
States v. Witkovich, 353 U. S. 194, 199 (1957)); see post, at 339-340. The
"constitutional doubts" argument has been the last refuge of many an interpretive lost cause. Statutes should be interpreted to avoid serious
constitutional doubts, Witkovich, supra, at 202, not to eliminate all possible contentions that the statute might be unconstitutional. We entertain
no serious doubt that the Constitution does not require any more individuation than the regulation provides, see supra, at 303-305, 309, and thus
find no need to supplement the text of $ 1252(a).

10 The dissent's citation of a single deposition from 1986, post, at 323, and

n. 6, is hardly proof that "excessive delay" will result in the "typical" case,
post, at 324, under regulation 242.24, which was not promulgated until
mid-1988.

We think the INS policy now in place is a reasonable re-sponse to the difficult problems presented when the Service

It is so ordered.

I join the Court's opinion and write separately simply toclarify that in my view these children have a constitutionally
protected interest in freedom from institutional confinement.That interest lies within the core of the Due Process Clause,
and the Court today does not hold otherwise. Rather, wereverse the decision of the Court of Appeals because the INS
program challenged here, on its face, complies with the re-quirements of due process.

"Freedom from bodily restraint has always been at thecore of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from
arbitrary governmental action." Foucha v. Louisiana, 504U. S. 71, 80 (1992). "Freedom from bodily restraint" means
more than freedom from handcuffs, straitjackets, or deten-tion cells. A person's core liberty interest is also implicated
when she is confined in a prison, a mental hospital, or someother form of custodial institution, even if the conditions of
confinement are liberal. This is clear beyond cavil, at least

where adults are concerned. "In the substantive due proc-ess analysis, it is the State's affirmative act of restraining

the individual's freedom to act on his own behalf--throughincarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint
of personal liberty--which is the `deprivation of liberty' trig-gering the protections of the Due Process Clause . . . ."

De-Shaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489

U. S. 189, 200 (1989). The institutionalization of an adult bythe government triggers heightened, substantive due process scrutiny. There must be a "sufficiently compelling" gov-ernmental interest to justify such action, usually a punitive
interest in imprisoning the convicted criminal or a regula-tory interest in forestalling danger to the community.
United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 748 (1987); see
Foucha, supra, at 80-81.Children, too, have a core liberty interest in remaining

free from institutional confinement. In this respect, achild's constitutional "[f]reedom from bodily restraint" is
no narrower than an adult's. Beginning with In re Gault,387 U. S. 1 (1967), we consistently have rejected the assertion that "a child, unlike an adult, has a right `not to libertybut to custody.' "

Id., at 17. Gault held that a child indelinquency proceedings must be provided various procedural due process protections (notice of charges, right tocounsel, right of confrontation and cross-examination, privilege against self-incrimination) when those proceedingsmay result in the child's institutional confinement. As we
explained:

"Ultimately, however, we confront the reality of . . .the Juvenile Court process . . . . A boy is charged with

misconduct. The boy is committed to an institutionwhere he may be restrained of liberty for years. It is of
no constitutional consequence--and of limited practicalmeaning--that the institution to which he is committed
is called an Industrial School. The fact of the matter isthat, however euphemistic the title, a `receiving home'

or an `industrial school' for juveniles is an institution ofconfinement in which the child is incarcerated for a

greater or lesser time. His world becomes a buildingwith whitewashed walls, regimented routine and institutional hours. Instead of mother and father and sis-ters and brothers and friends and classmates, his world
is peopled by guards, custodians, [and] state em-ployees . . . ."

J. R., 442 U. S. 584 (1979) (proceedings to commit child tomental hospital must satisfy procedural due process).

Our decision in Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253 (1984),makes clear that children have a protected liberty interest
in "freedom from institutional restraints," id., at 265, evenabsent the stigma of being labeled "delinquent," see

Breed,supra, at 529, or "mentally ill," see Parham, supra, at 600-

601. In Schall, we upheld a New York statute authorizingpretrial detention of dangerous juveniles, but only after
analyzing the statute at length to ensure that it compliedwith substantive and procedural due process. We recognized that children "are assumed to be subject to the controlof their parents, and if parental control falters, the State
must play its part as parens patriae." 467 U. S., at 265.But this

parens patriae purpose was seen simply as aplausible justification for state action implicating the child's

protected liberty interest, not as a limitation on the scopeof due process protection. See

ibid. Significantly, Schallwas essentially a facial challenge, as is this case, and New

York's policy was to detain some juveniles in "open facil-it[ies] in the community . . . without locks, bars, or security
officers where the child receives schooling and counselingand has access to recreational facilities." Id., at 271. A

child's placement in this kind of governmental institutionis hardly the same as handcuffing her, or confining her to

a cell, yet it must still satisfy heightened constitutionalscrutiny.

It may seem odd that institutional placement as such, even
where conditions are decent and humane and where the childhas no less authority to make personal choices than she

would have in a family setting, nonetheless implicates theDue Process Clause. The answer, I think, is this. Institutionalization is a decisive and unusual event. "The conse-quences of an erroneous commitment decision are more
tragic where children are involved. [C]hildhood is a particularly vulnerable time of life and children erroneously institutionalized during their formative years may bear the scars
for the rest of their lives." Parham, supra, at 627-628 (footnotes omitted) (opinion of Brennan, J.). Just as it is true
that "[i]n our society liberty [for adults] is the norm, and
detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception," Salerno, supra, at 755, so too, in our society,
children normally grow up in families, not in governmental
institutions. To be sure, government's failure to take custody of a child whose family is unable to care for her may
also effect harm. But the purpose of heightened scrutiny
is not to prevent government from placing children in an
institutional setting, where necessary. Rather, judicial review ensures that government acts in this sensitive area
with the requisite care.

In sum, this case does not concern the scope of the Due
Process Clause. We are not deciding whether the constitutional concept of "liberty" extends to some hitherto unprotected aspect of personal well-being, see, e. g., Collins v.
Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115 (1992); Michael H. v. Gerald
D., 491 U. S. 110 (1989); Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186

(substantive due process scrutiny); ante, at 306-309 (procedural due process scrutiny). Specifically, the absence of
available parents, close relatives, or legal guardians to care
for respondents does not vitiate their constitutional interest
in freedom from institutional confinement. It does not place
that interest outside the core of the Due Process Clause.
Rather, combined with the Juvenile Care Agreement, the
fact that the normal forms of custody have faltered explains
why the INS program facially challenged here survives
heightened, substantive due process scrutiny. "Where a
juvenile has no available parent, close relative, or legal
guardian, where the government does not intend to punish
the child, and where the conditions of governmental custody
are decent and humane, such custody surely does not violate
the Constitution. It is rationally connected to a governmental interest in `preserving and promoting the welfare of
the child,' Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 766 (1982), and
is not punitive since it is not excessive in relation to that
valid purpose." Ante, at 303. Because this is a facial challenge, the Court rightly focuses on the Juvenile Care Agreement. It is proper to presume that the conditions of
confinement are no longer " `most disturbing,' " Flores v.
Meese, 942 F. 2d 1352, 1358 (CA9 1991) (en banc) (quoting
Flores v. Meese, 934 F. 2d 991, 1014 (CA9 1990) (Fletcher, J.,
dissenting)), and that the purposes of confinement are no
longer the troublesome ones of lack of resources and expertise published in the Federal Register, see 53 Fed. Reg.
17449 (1988), but rather the plainly legitimate purposes associated with the Government's concern for the welfare of the
minors. With those presumptions in place, "the terms and
conditions of confinement . . . are in fact compatible with
[legitimate] purposes," Schall, supra, at 269, and the Court
finds that the INS program conforms with the Due Process
Clause. On this understanding, I join the opinion of the
Court.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.

The Court devotes considerable attention to debunking thenotion that "the best interests of the child" is an "absolute
and exclusive" criterion for the Government's exercise of thecustodial responsibilities that it undertakes.

Ante, at 304.The Court reasons that as long as the conditions of detention

are "good enough," ante, at 305, the Immigration and Natu-ralization Service (INS or Agency) is perfectly justified in
declining to expend administrative effort and resources tominimize such detention. Ante, at 305, 311-312.

As I will explain, I disagree with that proposition, for inmy view, an agency's interest in minimizing administrative
costs is a patently inadequate justification for the detentionof harmless children, even when the conditions of detention
are "good enough." 1 What is most curious about theCourt's analysis, however, is that the INS itself vigorously
denies that its policy is motivated even in part by a desireto avoid the administrative burden of placing these children
in the care of "other responsible adults." Reply Brief forPetitioners 4. That is, while the Court goes out of its way
to attack "the best interest of the child" as a criterion forjudging the INS detention policy, it is precisely that interest
that the INS invokes as the sole basis for its refusal to re-lease these children to "other responsible adults":

"[T]he articulated basis for the detention is that it fur-thers the government's interest in ensuring the welfare
of the juveniles in its custody. . . ."[Respondents] argu[e] that INS's interest in furthering juvenile welfare does not in fact support the policy
1 Though the concurring Justices join the Court's opinion, they too
seem to reject the notion that the fact that "other concerns . . . compete
for public funds and administrative attention," ante, at 305, is a sufficient
justification for the INS' policy of refusing to make individualized determinations as to whether these juveniles should be detained. Ante, at 319

because INS has a `blanket' policy that requires deten-tion without any factual showing that detention is necessary to ensure respondents' welfare. . . . That argument,however, represents nothing more than a policy disagreement, because it criticizes INS for failing to pursuea view of juvenile welfare that INS has not adopted,
namely the view held by respondent: that it is better foralien juveniles to be released to unrelated adults than to
be cared for in suitable, government-monitored juvenile-care facilities, except in those cases where the government has knowledge that the particular adult seekingcustody is unfit. The policy adopted by INS, reflecting the traditional view of our polity that parentsand guardians are the most reliable custodians for
juveniles, is that it is inappropriate to release alienjuveniles--whose troubled background and lack of familiarity with our society and culture, give them partic-ularized needs not commonly shared by domestic juveniles--to adults who are not their parents or guardians."
Id., at 4-5 (internal citations, emphasis, and quotationmarks omitted).

Possibly because of the implausibility of the INS' claimthat it has made a reasonable judgment that detention in
government-controlled or government-sponsored facilities is"better" or more "appropriate" for these children than release to independent responsible adults, the Court reachesout to justify the INS policy on a ground not only not argued,
but expressly disavowed by the INS, that is, the tug of"other concerns that compete for public funds and administrative attention," ante, at 305. I cannot share my col-leagues' eagerness for that aggressive tack in a case involving a substantial deprivation of liberty. Instead, I willbegin where the INS asks us to begin, with its assertion that
its policy is justified by its interest in protecting the welfareof these children. As I will explain, the INS' decision to
detain these juveniles despite the existence of responsible

Stevens, J., dissenting
adults willing and able to assume custody of them is contraryto federal policy, is belied by years of experience with both

citizen and alien juveniles, and finds no support whatsoeverin the administrative proceedings that led to the promulgation of the Agency's regulation. I will then turn to theCourt's statutory and constitutional analysis and explain why
this ill-conceived and ill-considered regulation is neither au-thorized by $ 242(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
nor consistent with fundamental notions of due process oflaw.

At the outset, it is important to emphasize two criticalpoints. First, this case involves the institutional detention
of juveniles who pose no risk of flight and no threat of harmto themselves or to others. They are children who have
responsible third parties available to receive and care forthem; many, perhaps most, of them will never be deported.

2

It makes little difference that juveniles, unlike adults, arealways in some form of custody, for detention in an institution pursuant to the regulation is vastly different from re-lease to a responsible person--whether a cousin,

3 a godparent, a friend, or a charitable organization--willing to assumeresponsibility for the juvenile for the time the child would

otherwise be detained.4 In many ways the difference is

2 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 55 (statement by counsel for petitioners).
3 The Court assumes that the rule allows release to any "close relative,"

ante, at 302. The assumption is incorrect for two reasons: The close character of a family relationship is determined by much more than the degree
of affinity; moreover, contrary to the traditional view expressed in Moore
v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 504 (1977), the INS rule excludes cousins.

4 The difference is readily apparent even from the face of the allegedly

benign Memorandum of Understanding Re Compromise of Class Action:
Conditions of Detention, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a-

205a (Juvenile Care Agreement), upon which the Court so heavily relies
to sustain this regulation. To say that a juvenile care facility under the
agreement is to be operated " `in an open type of setting without a need
for extraordinary security measures,' " ante, at 298 (quoting Juvenile
Care Agreement 173a) (emphasis added), suggests that the facility has
some standard level of security designed to ensure that children do not

comparable to the difference between imprisonment and pro-bation or parole. Both conditions can be described as "legal

custody," but the constitutional dimensions of individual "lib-erty" identify the great divide that separates the two. See
Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 482 (1972). The sameis true regarding the allegedly improved conditions of
confinement--a proposition, incidentally, that is disputed byseveral

amici curiae.5 The fact that the present conditionsmay satisfy standards appropriate for incarcerated juvenile

offenders does not detract in the slightest from the basicproposition that this is a case about the wholesale detention
of children who do not pose a risk of flight, and who are nota threat to either themselves or the community.

Second, the period of detention is indefinite, and has, onoccasion, approached one year.

leave. That notion is reinforced by the very next sentence in the agreement: "However, [r]ecipients are required to design programs and strategies to discourage runaways and prevent the unauthorized absence of minors in care." Ibid.

Indeed, the very definition of the word "detention" in the American
Bar Association's Juvenile Justice Standards reflects the fact that it still
constitutes detention even if a juvenile is placed in a facility that is "decent
and humane," ante, at 303:

"The definition of detention in this standard includes every facility used
by the state to house juveniles during the interim period. Whether it
gives the appearance of the worst sort of jail, or a comfortable and pleasant home, the facility is classified as `detention' if it is not the juvenile's
usual place of abode." Institute of Judicial Administration, American Bar
Association, Juvenile Justice Standards: Standards Relating to Interim
Status 45 (1980) (citing Wald, "Pretrial Detention for Juveniles," in Pursuing Justice for the Child 119, 120 (Rosenheim ed. 1976)).

The point cannot be overemphasized. The legal formalism that children are always in someone else's custody should not obscure the fact that
"[i]nstitutionalization," as Justice O'Connor explains, "is a decisive and
unusual event." Ante, at 318 (concurring opinion).

governing proposed contracts with private institutionsthat may assume physical (though not legal) custody of

these minors, the INS stated that the duration of theconfinement "is anticipated to be approximately thirty (30)
days; however, due to the variables and uncertainties in-herent in each case, [r]ecipients must design programs which
are able to provide a combination of short term and longterm care." Juvenile Care Agreement 178a. The INS rule
itself imposes no time limit on the period of detention. Theonly limit is the statutory right to seek a writ of habeas
corpus on the basis of a "conclusive showing" that the Attor-ney General is not processing the deportation proceeding
"with such reasonable dispatch as may be warranted bythe particular facts and circumstances in the case . . . ." 8
U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1). Because examples of protracted depor-tation proceedings are so common, the potential for a lengthy
period of confinement is always present. The fact that anexcessive delay may not "invariably ensue," ante, at 309,
provides small comfort to the typical detainee.

I
The Court glosses over the history of this litigation, butthat history speaks mountains about the bona fides of the

Government's asserted justification for its regulation, anddemonstrates the complete lack of support, in either evidence
or experience, for the Government's contention that detain-ing alien juveniles when there are "other responsible parties" willing to assume care somehow protects the interestsof these children.

The case was filed as a class action in response to a policychange adopted in 1984 by the Western Regional Office of
the INS. Prior to that change, the relevant policy in theWestern Region had conformed to the practice followed by
the INS in the rest of the country, and also followed by fed-eral magistrates throughout the country in the administration of $ 504 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Preven507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:15 PAGES OPINPGT

in a number of recommended standards for the treatment of
juveniles,7 that statute authorizes the release of a juvenile

7 See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, Model Acts for
Family Courts and State-Local Children's Programs 24 (1975) ("[W]ith all
possible speed" the child should be released to "parents, guardian, custodian, or other suitable person able and willing to provide supervision and
care"); U. S. Dept. of Justice, National Advisory Committee for Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Standards for the Administration of
Juvenile Justice 299 (1980) (a juvenile subject to the jurisdiction of the

when . . . there is no person willing and able to provide supervision and
care"); National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and

State law from across the country regarding the disposition of juveniles
who come into state custody is consistent with these standards. See, e. g.,

director of a shelter-care facility) upon their promise tobring such juvenile before the appropriate court when requested by such court unless the magistrate determines,after hearing, at which the juvenile is represented by counsel, that the detention of such juvenile is required to securehis timely appearance before the appropriate court or to

8 There is no evidence in the record of this

litigation that any release by the INS, or by a federal magis-trate, to an "other responsible party" ever resulted in any

harm to a juvenile. Thus, nationwide experience prior to1984 discloses no evidence of any demonstrated need for a
change in INS policy.Nevertheless, in 1984 the Western Region of the INS
adopted a separate policy for minors in deportation proceed-ings, but not for exclusion proceedings. The policy provided
that minors would be released only to a parent or lawfulguardian, except " `in unusual and extraordinary cases, at the

a committing magistrate to release a juvenile "upon his own recognizance

the Commissioner's expressed concern about possible legal liability may
well have been genuine, in view of the fact that the policy change occurred
prior to our decision in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social
Services, 489 U. S. 189 (1989), the Court of Appeals was surely correct in
observing that "governmental agencies face far greater exposure to liability by maintaining a special custodial relationship than by releasing children from the constraints of governmental custody." 942 F. 2d, at 1363.
Even if that were not true, the Agency's selfish interest in avoiding potential liability would be manifestly insufficient to justify its wholesale deprivation of a core liberty interest. In this Court, petitioners have prudently avoided any reliance on what may have been the true explanation

is most difficult to comprehend.

The evidence relating to the period after 1984 only increases the doubt concerning the true motive for the policy
adopted in the Western Region. First, as had been true before 1984, the absence of any indication of a need for such a
policy in any other part of the country persisted. Moreover,
there is evidence in the record that in the Western Region
when undocumented parents came to claim their children,
they were immediately arrested and deportation proceedings
were instituted against them. 934 F. 2d, at 1023 (Fletcher,

serve a rational enforcement purpose that played a partin the original decisional process, that possibility can only

add to the Government's burden of trying to establish itslegitimacy.

After this litigation was commenced, the District Courtenjoined the enforcement of the new policy because there
was no rational basis for the disparate treatment of juvenilesin deportation and exclusion proceedings. That injunction
prompted the INS to promulgate the nationwide rule that isnow at issue.

15 Significantly, however, in neither the rulemaking proceedings nor this litigation did the INS offer anyevidence that compliance with that injunction caused any

harm to juveniles or imposed any administrative burdens onthe Agency.

The Agency's explanation for its new rule relied on four
factual assertions. First, the rule "provides a single policy
for juveniles in both deportation and exclusion proceedings."53 Fed. Reg. 17449 (1988). It thus removed the basis for the

outstanding injunction. Second, the INS had "witnessed adramatic increase in the number of juvenile aliens it encounters," most of whom were "not accompanied by a parent,legal guardian, or other adult relative."

Ibid. There is no
mention, however, of either the actual or the approximate
number of juveniles encountered, or the much smaller num-ber that do not elect voluntary departure.

16 Third, the

15 The rule differs from the regional policy in three respects: (1) it applies to the entire country, rather than just the Western Region; (2) it
applies to exclusion as well as deportation proceedings; and (3) it authorizes release to adult brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents as
well as parents and legal guardians.

16 In its brief in this Court petitioners' attempt to describe the magnitude of the problem addressed by the rule is based on material that is not
in the record--an independent study of a sample of juveniles detained in
Texas in 1989, see Brief for Petitioners 8, n. 12, and the Court in turn
relies on the assertions made in the brief for petitioners about the problem
in 1990. See ante, at 295. Since all of those figures relate to a period well
after the rule was proposed in 1987 and promulgated in 1988, they obvi507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:15 PAGES OPINPGT

Agency stated that "concern for the welfare of the juvenilewill not permit release to just any adult." Ibid. (emphasis

added).17 There is no mention, however, of the obvious dis-tinction between "just any adult" and the broad spectrum of
responsible parties that can assume care of these children,such as extended family members, godparents, friends, and
private charitable organizations. Fourth, "the Service hasneither the expertise nor the resources to conduct home
studies for placement of each juvenile released." Ibid.Again, however, there is no explanation of why any more
elaborate or expensive "home study" would be necessary toevaluate the qualifications of apparently responsible persons
than had been conducted in the past. There is a strangeirony in both the fact that the INS suddenly decided that
temporary releases that had been made routinely to respon-sible persons in the past now must be preceded by a "home
study," and the fact that the scarcity of its "resources" pro-vides the explanation for spending far more money on detention than would be necessary to perform its newly discov-ered home study obligation.

ously tell us nothing about the "dramatic increase" mentioned by the INS.
53 Fed. Reg. 17449 (1988). Indeed, the study cited by the Government
also has nothing to say about any increase in the number of encounters
with juvenile aliens. In all events, the fact that both the Government and
this Court deem it appropriate to rely on a post hoc, nonrecord exposition
of the dimensions of the problem that supposedly led to a dramatic change
in INS policy merely highlights the casual character of the Agency's deliberative process. One can only speculate about whether the "dramatic increase in the number of juvenile aliens it encounters," ibid., or the District
Court's injunction was the more important cause of the new rule.

17 This statement may be the source of the Court's similar comment that

"the INS cannot simply send them off into the night on bond or recognizance." Ante, at 295. There is, of course, no evidence that the INS had
ever followed such an irresponsible practice, or that there was any danger
that it would do so in the future.

as $100 per day per juvenile. Deposition of Robert J. Schmidt, Immigration and Naturalization Service (July 31, 1986), p. 76. Even the sort of

What the Agency failed to explain may be even more sig-nificant than what it did say. It made no comment at all on

the uniform body of professional opinion that recognizes theharmful consequences of the detention of juveniles.

19 It

made no comment on the period of detention that would berequired for the completion of deportation proceedings, or

the reasons why the rule places no limit on the duration ofthe detention. Moreover, there is no explanation for the
absence of any specified procedure for either the consider-ation or the review of a request for release to an apparently
responsible person.20 It is difficult to understand why an
elaborate home study that might be appropriate as a predicate to the adoption of a newborn baby should not cost as much as a few days of detention.
Moreover, it is perfectly obvious that the qualifications of most responsible
persons can readily be determined by a hearing officer, and that in any
doubtful case release should be denied. The respondents have never argued that there is a duty to release juveniles to "just any adult." 53 Fed.
Reg. 17449 (1988).

19 Consistent with the standards developed by the American Bar Association and other organizations and agencies, see n. 7, supra, the United
States Department of Justice's own Standards for the Administration of
Juvenile Justice describe "the harsh impact that even brief detention may
have on a juvenile, especially when he/she is placed in a secure facility,
and the corresponding need to assure as quickly as possible that such detention is necessary." U. S. Dept. of Justice, Standards for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, supra n. 7, at 304.

20 As Judge Rymer pointed out in her separate opinion in the Court of

Appeals: "Unlike the statutes at issue in Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253
. . . (1984), and [United States v.] Salerno, [481 U. S. 739 (1987),] which
survived due process challenges, the INS regulations provide no opportunity for the reasoned consideration of an alien juvenile's release to the
custody of a non-relative by a neutral hearing officer. Nor is there any
provision for a prompt hearing on a $ 242.24(b)(4) release. No findings or
reasons are required. Nothing in the regulations provides the unaccompanied detainee any help, whether from counsel, a parent or guardian, or
anyone else. Similarly, the regulation makes no provision for appointing
a guardian if no family member or legal guardian comes forward. There
is no analogue to a pretrial services report, however cursory. While the
INS argues that it lacks resources to conduct home studies, there is no
substantial indication that some investigation or opportunity for independ507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:15 PAGES OPINPGT

agency purportedly motivated by the best interests of de-tained juveniles would have so little to say about obvious

objections to its rule.The promulgation of the nationwide rule did not, of course,
put an end to the pending litigation. The District Court
again enjoined its enforcement, this time on the ground thatit deprived the members of the respondent class of their liberty without the due process of law required by the FifthAmendment. For the period of over four years subsequent
to the entry of that injunction, the INS presumably has con-tinued to release juveniles to responsible persons in the
Western Region without either performing any home studiesor causing any harm to alien juveniles. If any evidence confirming the supposed need for the rule had developed in recent years, it is certain that petitioners would have calledit to our attention, since the INS did not hesitate to provide

us with off-the-record factual material on a less significant
point. See n. 16, supra.

The fact that the rule appears to be an ill-considered response to an adverse court ruling, rather than the product
of the kind of careful deliberation that should precede a
policy change that has an undeniably important impact on
individual liberty, is not, I suppose, a sufficient reason for
concluding that it is invalid.21 It does, however, shed light

ent, albeit informal consideration of the juvenile's circumstances in relation to the adult's agreement to care for her is impractical or financially
or administratively infeasible. Although not entirely clear where the burden of proof resides, it has not clearly been imposed on the government.
And there is no limit on when the deportation hearing must be held, or
put another way, how long the minor may be detained. In short, there is
no ordered structure for resolving custodial status when no relative steps
up to the plate but an unrelated adult is able and willing to do so." Flores
v. Meese, 942 F. 2d, 1352, 1374-1375 (CA9 1991) (opinion concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part) (footnotes omitted).

21 That fact may, however, support a claim that the INS' issuance of

the regulation was arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 706. See Motor Vehicle

on the question whether the INS has legitimately exercised
the discretion that the relevant statute has granted to the Attorney General. In order to avoid the constitutional question, I believe we should first address that statutory issue.
In the alternative, as I shall explain, I would hold that
a rule providing for the wholesale detention of juveniles
for an indeterminate period without individual hearings is
unconstitutional.

Section 242(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
provides that any "alien taken into custody may, in the
discretion of the Attorney General and pending [a] final determination of deportability, (A) be continued in custody; or
(B) be released under bond . . . containing such conditions
as the Attorney General may prescribe; or (C) be released
on conditional parole." 8 U. S. C. $ 1252(a)(1). Despite the
exceedingly broad language of $ 242(a), the Court has recognized that "once the tyranny of literalness is rejected, all
relevant considerations for giving a rational content to the
words become operative." United States v. Witkovich, 353

Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.
Co., 463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983) ("[A]n agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended
it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed
to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise"). Respondents
brought such a claim in the District Court, but do not renew that line of
argument in this Court. In any event, even if the INS has managed to
stay within the bounds of the APA, there is nonetheless a disturbing parallel between the Court's ready conclusion that no individualized hearing
need precede the deprivation of liberty of an undocumented alien so long
as the conditions of institutional custody are "good enough," ante, at 305,
and similar post hoc justifications for discrimination that is more probably
explained as nothing more than "the accidental byproduct of a traditional
way of thinking about" the disfavored class, see Califano v. Goldfarb, 430

U. S. 194, 199 (1957). See also INS v. National Center for
Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183 (1991) (NCIR).

Our cases interpreting $ 242(a) suggest that two such "con-siderations" are paramount: indications of congressional policy, and the principle that "a restrictive meaning must be
given if a broader meaning would generate constitutionaldoubts."

Witkovich, 353 U. S., at 199. Thus, in Carlson v.
Landon, 342 U. S. 524 (1952), we upheld the Attorney Gener-al's detention of deportable members of the Communist

Party, relying heavily on the fact that Congress had enactedlegislation, the Internal Security Act of 1950, based on its
judgment that Communist subversion threatened the Nation. Id., at 538. The Attorney General's discretionary decision to detain certain alien Communists was thus "wholly
consistent with Congress' intent," NCIR, 502 U. S., at 194
(summarizing Court's analysis in Carlson). Just last Term,
we faced the question whether the Attorney General acted
within his authority in requiring that release bonds issued
pursuant to $ 242(a) contain a condition forbidding unauthorized employment pending determination of deportability.
See NCIR, supra. Relying on related statutes and the
"often recognized" principle that "a primary purpose in restricting immigration is to preserve jobs for American workers," id., at 194, and n. 8 (internal quotation marks omitted),
we held that the regulation was "wholly consistent with this
established concern of immigration law and thus squarely
within the scope of the Attorney General's statutory authority." Ibid. Finally, in Witkovich, the Court construed a
provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act which
made it a criminal offense for an alien subject to deportation
to willfully fail to provide to the Attorney General " `information . . . as to his nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and such other information . . . as the
Attorney General may deem fit and proper.' " 353 U. S., at

raised on the Government's [broad] view of the statute," weheld that the statute merely authorized inquiries calculated

to determine the continued availability for departure ofaliens whose deportation was overdue. Id., at 201-202.

The majority holds that it was within the Attorney Gener-al's authority to determine that parents, guardians, and certain relatives are "presumptively appropriate custodians" forthe juveniles that come into the INS' custody,

ante, at 310,and therefore to detain indefinitely those juveniles who are

without one of the "approved" custodians.22 In my view,however, the guiding principles articulated in Carlson,
NCIR, and Witkovich compel the opposite conclusion.Congress has spoken quite clearly on the question of the
plight of juveniles that come into federal custody. As ex-plained above, $ 504 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention Act of 1974 demonstrates Congress' clear prefer-ence for release, as opposed to detention. See S. Rep. No.

22 While the regulation provides that release can be granted to a broader
class of custodians in "unusual and compelling circumstances," the practice
in the Western Region after the 1984 order, but before the issuance of the
injunction, was to exercise that discretion only in the event of medical
emergency. See Federal Defendants' Responses to Plaintiffs' Second Set
of Interrogatories (CD Cal., Jan. 30, 1986), pp. 11-12. At oral argument,
counsel for petitioners suggested that "extraordinary and compelling circumstances" might include the situation where a godfather has lived and
cared for the child, has a kind of family relationship with the child, and is
in the process of navigating the state bureaucracy in order to be appointed
a guardian under state law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 54. Regardless of the precise contours of the exception to the INS' sweeping ban on discretion, it
seems fair to conclude that it is meant to be extremely narrow.

There is nothing at all "puzzling," ante, at 312, n. 7, in respondents'
objection to the INS' requirement that would-be custodians apply for and
become guardians in order to assume temporary care of the juveniles in
INS custody. Formal state guardianship proceedings, regardless of how
appropriate they may be for determinations relating to permanent custody, would unnecessarily prolong the detention of these children. What
is puzzling is that the Court acknowledges, see ibid., but then ignores the
fact that were these children in state custody, they would be released to
"other responsible adults" as a matter of course. See n. 7, supra.

Stevens, J., dissenting
93-1011, p. 56 (1974) ("[Section 504] establishes a presump-tion for release of the juvenile").

23 And, most significantly

for this case, it demonstrates that Congress has rejected thevery presumption that the INS has made in this case; for

under the Act juveniles are not to be detained when there isa "responsible party," 18 U. S. C. $ 5034, willing and able to
assume care for the child.24 It is no retort that $ 504 is di-rected at citizens, whereas the INS' regulation is directed at
aliens, ante, at 305-306, 312-313, n. 8; Reply Brief for Peti23 As I have already noted, the 1938 Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act
authorized the magistrate to release an arrested juvenile "upon his own
recognizance or that of some responsible person," $ 5, 52 Stat. 765 (emphasis added). This language was retained in the 1948 Act, see 62 Stat. 858,
and amended to its present form in 1974. The Senate Report on the 1974
bill stated that it "also amends the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act,
virtually unchanged for the past thirty-five years, to provide basic procedural rights for juveniles who come under Federal jurisdiction and to
bring Federal procedures up to the standards set by various model acts,
many state codes and court decisions." S. Rep. No. 93-1011, p. 19 (1974).
Juveniles arrested by the INS are, of course, within the category of "juveniles who come under Federal jurisdiction."

24 I find this evidence of congressional intent and congressional policy

far more significant than the fact that Congress has made the unexceptional determination that state human service agencies should play a role
in the permanent resettlement of refugee children, ante, at 313, n. 8 (citing
8 U. S. C. $ 1522(d)(2)(B)), and orphans adopted abroad by United States
citizens, ante, at 313, n. 8 (citing 8 U. S. C. $ 1154(d)). This case is not
about the permanent settlement of alien children, or the establishment or
permanent legal custody over alien children. It is about the temporary
detention of children that come into federal custody, which is precisely
the focus of $ 504 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act
of 1974.

Furthermore, the Court is simply wrong in asserting that the INS' policy is rooted in the "universally accepted presumptio[n] as to the custodial
competence of parents and close relatives," ante, at 313, n. 8. The flaw in
the INS' policy is not that it prefers parents and close relatives over unrelated adults, but that it prefers government detention over release to responsible adults. It is that presumption--that detention is better or more
appropriate for these children than release to unrelated responsible
adults--that is contrary to congressional policy.

tioners 5, n. 4. As explained above, the INS justifies itspolicy as serving the best interests of the juveniles that come

into its custody. In seeking to dismiss the force of the Juve-nile Justice and Delinquency Act as a source of congressional
policy, the INS is reduced to the absurdity of contending thatCongress has authorized the Attorney General to treat allegedly illegal aliens better than American citizens. In my view,Congress has spoken on the detention of juveniles, and has
rejected the very presumption upon which the INS relies.There is a deeper problem with the regulation, however,
one that goes beyond the use of the particular presumptionat issue in this case. Section 242(a) grants to the Attorney
General the discretion to detain individuals pending depor-tation. As we explained in Carlson, a "purpose to injure
[the United States] could not be imputed generally to allaliens subject to deportation, so discretion was placed by the
1950 Act in the Attorney General to detain aliens withoutbail . . . ." 342 U. S., at 538. In my view, Congress has
not authorized the INS to rely on mere presumptions as asubstitute for the exercise of that discretion.

The Court's analysis in Carlson makes that point clear. Ifever there were a factual predicate for a "reasonable presumptio[n]," ante, at 313, it was in that case, because Con-gress had expressly found that communism posed a "clear and
present danger to the security of the United States," andthat mere membership in the Communist Party was a sufficient basis for deportation.25 Yet, in affirming the Attorney

25 The Internal Security Act of 1950 was based on explicit findings regarding the nature of the supposed threat posed by the worldwide Communist conspiracy. The Communist Party in the United States, Congress
found, " `is an organization numbering thousands of adherents, rigidly and
ruthlessly disciplined . . . [a]waiting and seeking to advance a moment
when the United States may be so far extended by foreign engagements,
so far divided in counsel, or so far in industrial or financial straits, that
overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence
may seem possible of achievement . . . .' " 342 U. S., at 535, n. 21 (quoting

$ 2(15) of the Internal Security Act of 1950).

General's detention of four alien Communists, the Court wascareful to note that the Attorney General had not merely

relied on a presumption that alien Communists posed a riskto the United States, and that therefore they should be detained, but that the detention order was grounded in "evi-dence of membership

plus personal activity in supportingand extending the Party's philosophy concerning violence,"

342 U. S., at 541 (emphasis added). In fact, the Court ex-pressly noted that "[t]here is no evidence or contention that
all persons arrested as deportable under the . . . InternalSecurity Act for Communist membership are denied bail,"
and that bail is allowed "in the large majority of cases." Id.,at 541-542.

By the same reasoning, the Attorney General is not au-thorized, in my view, to rely on a presumption regarding the
suitability of potential custodians as a substitute for deter-mining whether there is, in fact, any reason that a

particularjuvenile should be detained. Just as a "purpose to injure

could not be imputed generally to all aliens," id., at 538, theunsuitability of certain unrelated adults cannot be imputed
generally to all adults so as to lengthen the detention towhich these children are subjected. The particular circumstances facing these juveniles are too diverse, and the rightto be free from government detention too precious, to permit
the INS to base the crucial determinations regarding deten-tion upon a mere presumption regarding "appropriate custodians," ante, at 310. I do not believe that Congress intendedto authorize such a policy.

26 Neither NCIR, 502 U. S. 183 (1991), nor Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S.
458, 467 (1983), upon which the majority relies for the proposition that the
INS can rely on "reasonable presumptions" and "generic rules," ante, at
313, are to the contrary. The Court mentioned the word "presumption" in
a footnote in the NCIR case, 502 U. S., at 196, n. 11, merely in noting that
the regulation at issue--a broad rule requiring that all release bonds contain a condition forbidding unauthorized employment--seemed to presume
that undocumented aliens taken into INS custody were not, in fact, author507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:15 PAGES OPINPGT

And finally, even if it were not clear to me that the Attor-ney General has exceeded her authority under $ 242(a), I

would still hold that $ 242(a) requires an individualized deterized to work. We said that such a de facto presumption was reasonable
because the vast majority of aliens that come into INS custody do not
have such authorization, and because the presumption was easily rebutted.
Ibid. To the extent that case has any bearing on the INS' use of presumptions, it merely says that the INS may use some easily rebuttable
presumptions in identifying the class of individuals subject to its regulations--in that case, aliens lacking authorization to work. Once that class
is properly identified, however, the issue becomes whether the INS can
use mere presumptions as a basis for making fundamental decisions about
detention and freedom. On that question, NCIR is silent; for the regulation at issue there was not based on a presumption at all. It simply provided that an alien who violates American law by engaging in unauthorized employment also violates the terms of his release from INS custody.
Id., at 185.

Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458 (1983), presents a closer analog to
what the INS has done in this case, but only as a matter of logic, for the
factual differences between the governmental action approved in Heckler
and the INS' policy in this case renders the former a woefully inadequate
precedent to support the latter. In Heckler, the Court approved the use
of pre-established medical-vocational guidelines for determining Social Security disability benefits, stating:

"The Court has recognized that even where an agency's enabling statute
expressly requires it to hold a hearing, the agency may rely on its rulemaking authority to determine issues that do not require case-by-case
consideration. A contrary holding would require the agency continually
to relitigate issues that may be established fairly and efficiently in a single
rulemaking." Id., at 467 (citations omitted).

Suffice it to say that the determination as to the suitability of a temporary guardian for a juvenile, unlike the determination as to the nature and
type of jobs available for an injured worker, is an inquiry that requires
case-by-case consideration, and is not one that may be established fairly
and efficiently in a single rulemaking. More importantly, the determination as to whether a child should be released to the custody of a friend,
godparent, or cousin, as opposed to being detained in a government institution, implicates far more fundamental concerns than whether an individual will receive a particular government benefit. In my view, the Court's
reliance on Heckler v. Campbell cuts that case from its administrative law

mination as to whether detention is necessary when a juve-nile does not have an INS-preferred custodian available to

assume temporary custody. " `When the validity of an actof the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious
doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principlethat this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of
the statute is fairly possible by which the question may beavoided.' "

Witkovich, 353 U. S., at 201-202 (quoting Cro-well v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932)). The detention of

juveniles on the basis of a general presumption as to thesuitability of particular custodians without an individualized
determination as to whether that presumption bears any re-lationship at all to the facts of a particular case implicates
an interest at the very core of the Due Process Clause, theconstitutionally protected interest in freedom from bodily restraint. As such, it raises even more serious constitutionalconcerns than the INS policy invalidated in

Witkovich. Leg-islative grants of discretionary authority should be construed

to avoid constitutional issues and harsh consequences thatwere almost certainly not contemplated or intended by Congress. Unlike my colleagues, I would hold that the Attor-ney General's actions in this case are not authorized by

$ 242(a). III

I agree with Justice O'Connor that respondents "have aconstitutionally protected interest in freedom from institutional confinement . . . [that] lies within the core of the DueProcess Clause."

to determine, by rulemaking, that children are better off in government
detention facilities than in the care of responsible friends, cousins, godparents, or other responsible parties.

("We have always been careful not to `minimize the impor-tance and fundamental nature' of the individual's right to

liberty") (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739,750 (1987)).

I am not as convinced as she, however, that "the Court
today does not hold otherwise." Ante, at 315 (concurringopinion). For the children at issue in this case

are being
confined in government-operated or government-selectedinstitutions, their liberty

has been curtailed, and yet the
Court defines the right at issue as merely the "alleged rightof a child who has no available parent, close relative, or

legal guardian, and for whom the government is responsible,
to be placed in the custody of a willing-and-able private custodian rather than of a government-operated or governmentselected child-care institution." Ante, at 302. Finding such
a claimed constitutional right to be "nove[l]," ante, at 303,
and certainly not "fundamental," ante, at 305, 311, the Court
concludes that these juveniles' alleged "right" to be released
to "other responsible adults" is easily trumped by the government's interest in protecting the welfare of these children
and, most significantly, by the INS' interest in avoiding the
administrative inconvenience and expense of releasing them
to a broader class of custodians. Ante, at 305, 311-312.

In my view, the only "novelty" in this case is the Court's
analysis. The right at stake in this case is not the right of
detained juveniles to be released to one particular custodian
rather than another, but the right not to be detained in the
first place. "In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited
exception." Salerno, 481 U. S., at 755. It is the government's burden to prove that detention is necessary, not the
individual's burden to prove that release is justified. And,
as Justice O'Connor explains, that burden is not easily
met, for when government action infringes on this most
fundamental of rights, we have scrutinized such conduct to
ensure that the detention serves both "legitimate and com507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:15 PAGES OPINPGT

pelling" interests, id., at 749, and, in addition, is implementedin a manner that is "carefully limited" and "narrowly focused." Foucha, 504 U. S., at 81.27

27 A comparison of the detention regimes upheld in Salerno and struck
down in Foucha is illustrative. In Salerno, we upheld against due process attack provisions of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 which allow a federal
court to detain an arrestee before trial if the Government can demonstrate
that no release conditions will " `reasonably assure . . . the safety of any
other person and the community.' " Salerno, 481 U. S., at 741. As we
explained in Foucha:

"The statute carefully limited the circumstances under which detention
could be sought to those involving the most serious of crimes . . . , and
was narrowly focused on a particularly acute problem in which the government interests are overwhelming. In addition to first demonstrating
probable cause, the Government was required, in a full-blown adversary
hearing, to convince a neutral decisionmaker by clear and convincing
evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety
of the community or any person . . . . Furthermore, the duration of
confinement under the Act was strictly limited. The arrestee was entitled to a prompt detention hearing and the maximum length of pretrial detention was limited by the stringent limitations of the Speedy
Trial Act." 504 U. S., at 81 (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted).

By contrast, the detention statute we struck down in Foucha was anything but narrowly focused or carefully limited. Under Louisiana law,
criminal defendants acquitted by reason of insanity were automatically
committed to state psychiatric institutions, regardless of whether they
were then insane, and held until they could prove that they were no longer
dangerous. Id., at 73. We struck down the law as a violation of the
substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment:

"Unlike the sharply focused scheme at issue in Salerno, the Louisiana
scheme of confinement is not carefully limited. Under the state statute,
Foucha is not now entitled to an adversary hearing at which the State
must prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is demonstrably dangerous to the community. Indeed, the State need prove nothing to justify
continued detention, for the statute places the burden on the detainee to
prove that he is not dangerous . . . .. . . . .

"It was emphasized in Salerno that the detention we found constitutionally permissible was strictly limited in duration. Here, in contrast,

On its face, the INS' regulation at issue in this case cannotwithstand such scrutiny.

28 The United States no doubt has

a substantial and legitimate interest in protecting the wel-fare of juveniles that come into its custody. Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 266 (1984). However, a blanket rule thatsimply

presumes that detention is more appropriate than re-lease to responsible adults is not narrowly focused on serving

that interest. Categorical distinctions between cousins anduncles, or between relatives and godparents or other responsible persons, are much too blunt instruments to justifywholesale deprivations of liberty. Due process demands
more, far more.29 If the Government is going to detain juve-niles in order to protect their welfare, due process requires
that it demonstrate, on an individual basis, that detentionin fact serves that interest. That is the clear command of
our cases. See, e. g., Foucha, 504 U. S., at 81 (finding dueprocess violation when individual who is detained on grounds

the State asserts that . . . [Foucha] may be held indefinitely." Id., at
81-82.

As explained in the text, the INS' regulation at issue in this case falls
well on the Foucha side of the Salerno/Foucha divide.

28 Because this is a facial challenge, the Court asserts that respondents

cannot prevail unless there is " `no set of circumstances . . . under which
the [regulation] would be valid.' " Ante, at 301. This is a rather puzzling
pronouncement. Would a facial challenge to a statute providing for imprisonment of all alien children without a hearing fail simply because there
is a set of circumstances in which at least one such alien should be detained? Is the Court saying that this challenge fails because the categorical deprivation of liberty to the members of the respondent class may turn
out to be beneficial to some? Whatever the Court's rhetoric may signify,
it seems clear to me, as I explain in the text, that detention for an insufficient reason without adequate procedural safeguards is a deprivation of
liberty without due process of law.

29 In objecting to this statement, see ante, at 311, n. 6, the majority once

again mischaracterizes the issue presented in this case. As explained
above, see n. 24, supra, the INS can of course favor release of a juvenile
to a parent or close relative over release to an unrelated adult. What the
INS cannot do, in my view, is prefer detention over release to a responsible adult, a proposition that hardly "revolutionize[s]" our family law.

Japanese ancestry without a determination as to whether any particular

Stevens, J., dissenting
If, in fact, the Due Process Clause establishes a powerfulpresumption against unnecessary official detention that is

not based on an individualized evaluation of its justification,why has the INS refused to make such determinations? As
emphasized above, the argument that detention is moreappropriate for these children than release to responsible
adults is utterly lacking in support, in either the history ofthis litigation, or expert opinion. Presumably because of
the improbability of the INS' asserted justification for itspolicy, the Court does not rely on it as the basis for upholding
the regulation. Instead, the Court holds that even if deten-tion is not really

better for these juveniles than release toresponsible adults, so long as it is "good enough,"

ante, at305, the INS need not spend the time and money that would

be necessary to actually serve the "best interests" of thesechildren. Ante, at 304-305. In other words, so long as its
cages are gilded, the INS need not expend its administrativeresources on a program that would better serve its asserted
interests and that would not need to employ cages at all.The linchpin in the Court's analysis, of course, is its narrow
reading of the right at stake in this case. By characterizingit as some insubstantial and nonfundamental right to be re216. The Court today does not cite that case, but the Court's holding
in Korematsu obviously supports the majority's analysis, for the Court
approved a serious infringement of individual liberty without requiring a
case-by-case determination as to whether such an infringement was in
fact necessary to effect the Government's compelling interest in national
security. I understand the majority's reluctance to rely on Korematsu.
The exigencies of war that were thought to justify that categorical deprivation of liberty are not, of course, implicated in this case. More importantly, the recent congressional decision to pay reparations to the
Japanese-Americans who were detained during that period, see Restitution for World War II Internment of Japanese Americans and Aleuts, 102
Stat. 903, suggests that the Court should proceed with extreme caution
when asked to permit the detention of juveniles when the Government
has failed to inquire whether, in any given case, detention actually serves
the Government's interest in protecting the interests of the children in
its custody.

leased to an unrelated adult, the Court is able to escape theclear holding of our cases that "administrative convenience"

is a thoroughly inadequate basis for the deprivation of coreconstitutional rights. Ante, at 311 (citing, for comparison,
Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645 (1972)). As explainedabove, however, the right at issue in this case is not the right
to be released to an unrelated adult; it is the right to be freefrom Government confinement that is the very essence of the
liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. It is a rightthat cannot be defeated by a claim of a lack of expertise or
a lack of resources. In my view, then, Stanley v. Illinois isnot a case to look to for comparison, but one from which to
derive controlling law. For in Stanley, we flatly rejectedthe premise underlying the Court's holding today.

In that case, we entertained a due process challenge to astatute under which children of unwed parents, upon the
death of the mother, were declared wards of the State with-out any hearing as to the father's fitness for custody. In
striking down the statute, we rejected the argument that aState's interest in conserving administrative resources was
a sufficient basis for refusing to hold a hearing as to a father'sfitness to care for his children:

"Procedure by presumption is always cheaper andeasier than individualized determination. But when, as
here, the procedure forecloses the determinative issuesof competence and care, when it explicitly disdains present realities in deference to past formalities, it need-lessly risks running roughshod over the important interests of both parent and child. It therefore cannot stand."

Bell v. Burson[, 402 U. S. 535 (1971),] held that theState could not, while purporting to be concerned with

fault in suspending a driver's license, deprive a citizenof his license without a hearing that would assess fault.
Absent fault, the State's declared interest was so attenu-ated that administrative convenience was insufficient to
excuse a hearing where evidence of fault could be con507us2$u44 11-15-96 17:57:15 PAGES OPINPGT

sidered. That drivers involved in accidents, as a statis-tical matter, might be very likely to have been wholly

or partially at fault did not foreclose hearing and proofon specific cases before licenses were suspended.

"We think the Due Process Clause mandates a similarresult here. The State's interest in caring for Stanley's
children is de minimis if Stanley is shown to be a fitfather. It insists on presuming rather than proving
Stanley's unfitness solely because it is more convenientto presume than to prove. Under the Due Process
Clause that advantage is insufficient to justify refusinga father a hearing when the issue at stake is the dismemberment of his family." Id., at 656-658.
Just as the State of Illinois could not rely on the administra-tive convenience derived from denying fathers a hearing, the

INS may not rely on the fact that "other concerns . . . com-pete for public funds and administrative attention,"

ante, at305, as an excuse to keep from doing what due process commands: determining, on an individual basis, whether the de-tention of a child in a government-operated or governmentsponsored institution actually serves the INS' assertedinterest in protecting the welfare of that child.

31

Ultimately, the Court is simply wrong when it asserts that"freedom from physical restraint" is not at issue in this case.

That is precisely what is at issue. The Court's assumptionthat the detention facilities used by the INS conform to the

31 Of course, even as a factual matter the INS' reliance on its asserted
inability to conduct home studies because of a lack of resources or expertise as a justification for its wholesale detention policy is unpersuasive.
It is perfectly clear that the costs of detention far exceed the cost of the
kinds of inquiry that are necessary or appropriate for temporary release
determinations. See n. 18, supra. Moreover, it is nothing less than perverse that the Attorney General releases juvenile citizens to the custody
of "other responsible adults" without the elaborate "home studies" allegedly necessary to safeguard the juvenile's interests but deems such studies
necessary before releasing noncitizens to the custody of "other responsible adults."

standards set forth in the partial settlement in this case hasnothing to do with the fact that the juveniles who are not

released to relatives or responsible adults are held in deten-tion facilities. They do not have the "freedom from physical
restraint" that those who are released do have. That iswhat this case is all about. That is why the respondent class
continues to litigate. These juveniles do not want to becommitted to institutions that the INS and the Court believe
are "good enough" for aliens simply because they conform tostandards that are adequate for the incarceration of juvenile
delinquents. They want the same kind of liberty that theConstitution guarantees similarly situated citizens. And as
I read our precedents, the omission of any provision for indi-vidualized consideration of the best interests of the juvenile
in a rule authorizing an indefinite period of detention of pre-sumptively innocent and harmless children denies them precisely that liberty.I respectfully dissent.

SAUDI ARABIA et al. v. NELSON et ux.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-522. Argued November 30, 1992--Decided March 23, 1993
The respondents Nelson, a married couple, filed this action for damages

against petitioners, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a Saudi hospital, and
the hospital's purchasing agent in the United States. They alleged,
among other things, that respondent husband suffered personal injuries
as a result of the Saudi Government's unlawful detention and torture of
him and petitioners' negligent failure to warn him of the possibility of
severe retaliatory action if he attempted to report on-the-job hazards.
The Nelsons asserted jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(2), which confers jurisdiction where
an action is "based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United
States by the foreign state." The District Court dismissed for lack of
subject-matter jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding
that respondent husband's recruitment and hiring were "commercial
activities" upon which the Nelsons' action was "based" for purposes of

$ 1605(a)(2).

Held: The Nelsons' action is not "based upon a commercial activity"

within the meaning of the first clause of $ 1605(a)(2), and the Act therefore confers no jurisdiction over their suit. Pp. 355-363.

(a) This action is not "based upon" a commercial activity. Although
the Act does not define "based upon," the phrase is most naturally read
to mean those elements of a claim that, if proven, would entitle a plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case, and the statutory context
confirms that the phrase requires something more than a mere connection with, or relation to, commercial activity. Even taking the Nelsons'
allegations about respondent husband's recruitment and employment as
true, those facts alone entitle the Nelsons to nothing under their theory
of the case. While these arguably commercial activities may have led
to the commission of the torts that allegedly injured the Nelsons, it is
only those torts upon which their action is "based" for purposes of the
Act. Pp. 355-358.

(b) Petitioners' tortious conduct fails to qualify as "commercial activity" within the meaning of the Act. This Court has ruled that the Act
largely codifies the so-called "restrictive" theory of foreign sovereign
immunity, Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U. S. 607, 612,
and that a state engages in commercial activity under that theory where

507us2$45D 11-15-96 18:00:24 PAGES OPINPGT
350 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

Syllabus
it exercises only those powers that can also be exercised by private
citizens, rather than those powers peculiar to sovereigns, id., at 614.
The intentional conduct alleged here (the Saudi Government's wrongful
arrest, imprisonment, and torture of Nelson) boils down to abuse of the
power of the police. However monstrous such abuse undoubtedly may
be, a foreign state's exercise of that power has long been understood for
purposes of the restrictive theory as peculiarly sovereign in nature.
The Nelsons' argument that respondent husband's mistreatment constituted retaliation for his reporting of safety violations, and was therefore
commercial in character, does not alter the fact that the powers allegedly abused were those of police and penal officers. In any event, that
argument goes to the purpose of petitioners' conduct, which the Act
explicitly renders irrelevant to the determination of an activity's commercial character. Pp. 358-363.

(c) The Nelsons' attempt to claim failure to warn is merely a semantic
ploy. A plaintiff could recast virtually any claim of intentional tort
committed by sovereign act as a claim of failure to warn. To give jurisdictional significance to this feint of language would effectively thwart
the Act's manifest purpose to codify the restrictive theory of foreign
sovereign immunity. Cf. United States v. Shearer, 473 U. S. 52, 54-55

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 entitles
foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of courts
in the United States, 28 U. S. C. $ 1604, subject to certain
enumerated exceptions. $ 1605. One is that a foreign state
shall not be immune in any case "in which the action is based
upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States
by the foreign state." $ 1605(a)(2). We hold that respondents' action alleging personal injury resulting from unlawful
detention and torture by the Saudi Government is not "based
upon a commercial activity" within the meaning of the Act,
which consequently confers no jurisdiction over respondents' suit.

352 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

Opinion of the Court
under an agreement signed with Saudi Arabia in 1973. Id.,at 73.

In its recruitment effort, HCA placed an advertisement ina trade periodical seeking applications for a position as a
monitoring systems engineer at the hospital. The adver-tisement drew the attention of respondent Scott Nelson in
September 1983, while Nelson was in the United States.After interviewing for the position in Saudi Arabia, Nelson
returned to the United States, where he signed an employ-ment contract with the hospital,

id., at 4, satisfied personnelprocessing requirements, and attended an orientation session that HCA conducted for hospital employees. In thecourse of that program, HCA identified Royspec as the point
of contact in the United States for family members whomight wish to reach Nelson in an emergency.

Id., at 33.In December 1983, Nelson went to Saudi Arabia and began

work at the hospital, monitoring all "facilities, equipment,utilities and maintenance systems to insure the safety of patients, hospital staff, and others." Id., at 4. He did his jobwithout significant incident until March 1984, when he discovered safety defects in the hospital's oxygen and nitrous
oxide lines that posed fire hazards and otherwise endangeredpatients' lives.

Id., at 57-58. Over a period of several
months, Nelson repeatedly advised hospital officials of thesafety defects and reported the defects to a Saudi Government commission as well. Id., at 4-5. Hospital officialsinstructed Nelson to ignore the problems.

Id., at 58.
The hospital's response to Nelson's reports changed, however, on September 27, 1984, when certain hospital employ-ees summoned him to the hospital's security office where

agents of the Saudi Government arrested him.1 The agents

1 Petitioners assert that the Saudi Government arrested Nelson because
he had falsely represented to the hospital that he had received a degree
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and had provided the hospital with a forged diploma to verify his claim. Brief for Petitioners 4-5.

Opinion of the Court
transported Nelson to a jail cell, in which they "shackled,tortured and bea[t]" him,

id., at 5, and kept him four days
without food, id., at 59. Although Nelson did not under-stand Arabic, government agents forced him to sign a statement written in that language, the content of which he did
not know; a hospital employee who was supposed to act asNelson's interpreter advised him to sign "anything" the

agents gave him to avoid further beatings. Ibid. Two dayslater, government agents transferred Nelson to the Al Sijan

Prison "to await trial on unknown charges." Ibid.At the prison, Nelson was confined in an overcrowded cell
area infested with rats, where he had to fight other prisonersfor food and from which he was taken only once a week for
fresh air and exercise. Ibid. Although police interrogators
repeatedly questioned him in Arabic, Nelson did not learnthe nature of the charges, if any, against him.

Id., at 5. For
several days, the Saudi Government failed to advise Nelson'sfamily of his whereabouts, though a Saudi official eventually

told Nelson's wife, respondent Vivian Nelson, that he couldarrange for her husband's release if she provided sexual favors. Ibid.Although officials from the United States Embassy visited
Nelson twice during his detention, they concluded that his
allegations of Saudi mistreatment were "not credible" and
made no protest to Saudi authorities. Id., at 64. It was
only at the personal request of a United States Senator that
the Saudi Government released Nelson, 39 days after his
arrest, on November 5, 1984. Id., at 60. Seven days later,
after failing to convince him to return to work at the hospital, the Saudi Government allowed Nelson to leave the country. Id., at 60-61.

In 1988, Nelson and his wife filed this action against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida seeking damages for personal injury.
The Nelsons' complaint sets out 16 causes of action, which
fall into three categories. Counts II through VII and counts
X, XI, XIV, and XV allege that petitioners committed vari507us2$45D 11-15-96 18:00:24 PAGES OPINPGT
354 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

Opinion of the Court
ous intentional torts, including battery, unlawful detainment,wrongful arrest and imprisonment, false imprisonment, inhuman torture, disruption of normal family life, and inflictionof mental anguish.

Id., at 6-11, 15, 19-20. Counts I, IX,
and XIII charge petitioners with negligently failing to warn
Nelson of otherwise undisclosed dangers of his employment,namely, that if he attempted to report safety hazards the

hospital would likely retaliate against him and the SaudiGovernment might detain and physically abuse him without
legal cause. Id., at 5-6, 14, 18-19. Finally, counts VIII,XII, and XVI allege that Vivian Nelson sustained derivative
injury resulting from petitioners' actions. Id., at 11-12, 16,
20. Presumably because the employment contract provided
that Saudi courts would have exclusive jurisdiction over
claims for breach of contract, id., at 47, the Nelsons raised
no such matters.

The District Court dismissed for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
of 1976, 28 U. S. C. $$ 1330, 1602 et seq. It rejected the Nelsons' argument that jurisdiction existed, under the first
clause of $ 1605(a)(2), because the action was one "based upon
a commercial activity" that petitioners had "carried on in the
United States." Although HCA's recruitment of Nelson in
the United States might properly be attributed to Saudi Arabia and the hospital, the District Court reasoned, it did not
amount to commercial activity "carried on in the United
States" for purposes of the Act. Id., at 94-95. The court
explained that there was no sufficient "nexus" between Nelson's recruitment and the injuries alleged. "Although [the
Nelsons] argu[e] that but for [Scott Nelson's] recruitment in
the United States, he would not have taken the job, been
arrested, and suffered the personal injuries," the court said,
"this `connection' [is] far too tenuous to support jurisdiction"
under the Act. Id., at 97. Likewise, the court concluded

that Royspec's commercial activity in the United States,
purchasing supplies and equipment for the hospital, id., at

355Cite as: 507 U. S. 349 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
93-94, had no nexus with the personal injuries alleged in the
complaint; Royspec had simply provided a way for Nelson's
family to reach him in an emergency, id., at 96.

The Court of Appeals reversed. 923 F. 2d 1528 (CA11
1991). It concluded that Nelson's recruitment and hiring
were commercial activities of Saudi Arabia and the hospital,
carried on in the United States for purposes of the Act, id.,
at 1533, and that the Nelsons' action was "based upon" these
activities within the meaning of the statute, id., at 1533-
1536. There was, the court reasoned, a sufficient nexus between those commercial activities and the wrongful acts that
had allegedly injured the Nelsons: "the detention and torture
of Nelson are so intertwined with his employment at the
Hospital," the court explained, "that they are `based upon'
his recruitment and hiring" in the United States. Id., at
1535. The court also found jurisdiction to hear the claims

The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act "provides the sole
basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the
courts of this country." Argentine Republic v. Amerada
Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 443 (1989). Under the
Act, a foreign state is presumptively immune from the jurisdiction of United States courts; unless a specified exception
applies, a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over
a claim against a foreign state. Verlinden B. V. v. Central
Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 488-489 (1983); see 28
U. S. C. $ 1604; J. Dellapenna, Suing Foreign Governments
and Their Corporations 11, and n. 64 (1988).

doctrine, 923 F. 2d, at 1536, and we do not consider that doctrine here.

356 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

Opinion of the Court
Only one such exception is said to apply here. The first
clause of $ 1605(a)(2) of the Act provides that a foreign state
shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of United States
courts in any case "in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state." 3 The Act defines such activity as "commercial
activity carried on by such state and having substantial contact with the United States," $ 1603(e), and provides that a
commercial activity may be "either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or
act," the "commercial character of [which] shall be determined by reference to" its "nature," rather than its "purpose," $ 1603(d).

There is no dispute here that Saudi Arabia, the hospital,
and Royspec all qualify as "foreign state[s]" within the
meaning of the Act. Brief for Respondents 3; see 28 U. S. C.

$$ 1603(a), (b) (term " `foreign state' " includes " `an agency or
instrumentality of a foreign state' "). For there to be jurisdiction in this case, therefore, the Nelsons' action must be
"based upon" some "commercial activity" by petitioners that
had "substantial contact" with the United States within the
meaning of the Act. Because we conclude that the suit is
not based upon any commercial activity by petitioners, we
need not reach the issue of substantial contact with the
United States.

We begin our analysis by identifying the particular conduct on which the Nelsons' action is "based" for purposes
of the Act. See Texas Trading & Milling Corp. v. Federal

3 In full, $ 1605(a)(2) provides that "[a] foreign state shall not be immune
from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any
case . . . in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried
on in the United States by the foreign state; or upon an act performed in
the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign
state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the territory of the United States
in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere
and that act causes a direct effect in the United States."

"Sovereign" Out of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act:A Functional Approach to the Commercial Activity Exception, 17 Yale J. Int'l L. 489, 500 (1992). Although the Act
contains no definition of the phrase "based upon," and therelatively sparse legislative history offers no assistance,

guidance is hardly necessary. In denoting conduct thatforms the "basis," or "foundation," for a claim, see Black's
Law Dictionary 151 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "base"); RandomHouse Dictionary 172 (2d ed. 1987) (same); Webster's Third
New International Dictionary 180, 181 (1976) (defining
"base" and "based"), the phrase is read most naturally to
mean those elements of a claim that, if proven, would entitle
a plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case. See
Callejo v. Bancomer, S. A., 764 F. 2d 1101, 1109 (CA5 1985)
(focus should be on the "gravamen of the complaint"); accord,
Santos v. Compagnie Nationale Air France, 934 F. 2d

Affairs, 272 U. S. App. D. C. 240, 246, 855 F. 2d 879, 885
(1988).

What the natural meaning of the phrase "based upon" suggests, the context confirms. Earlier, see n. 3, supra, we
noted that $ 1605(a)(2) contains two clauses following the one
at issue here. The second allows for jurisdiction where a
suit "is based . . . upon an act performed in the United States
in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state
elsewhere," and the third speaks in like terms, allowing for
jurisdiction where an action "is based . . . upon an act outside
the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act
causes a direct effect in the United States." Distinctions
among descriptions juxtaposed against each other are naturally understood to be significant, see Melkonyan v. Sulli507us2$45D 11-15-96 18:00:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
van, 501 U. S. 89, 94-95 (1991), and Congress manifestly understood there to be a difference between a suit "based
upon" commercial activity and one "based upon" acts performed "in connection with" such activity. The only reasonable reading of the former term calls for something more
than a mere connection with, or relation to, commercial
activity.4

In this case, the Nelsons have alleged that petitioners recruited Scott Nelson for work at the hospital, signed an employment contract with him, and subsequently employed
him. While these activities led to the conduct that eventually injured the Nelsons, they are not the basis for the Nelsons' suit. Even taking each of the Nelsons' allegations
about Scott Nelson's recruitment and employment as true,
those facts alone entitle the Nelsons to nothing under their
theory of the case. The Nelsons have not, after all, alleged
breach of contract, see supra, at 354, but personal injuries
caused by petitioners' intentional wrongs and by petitioners'
negligent failure to warn Scott Nelson that they might commit those wrongs. Those torts, and not the arguably commercial activities that preceded their commission, form the
basis for the Nelsons' suit.

Petitioners' tortious conduct itself fails to qualify as "commercial activity" within the meaning of the Act, although the
Act is too " `obtuse' " to be of much help in reaching that
conclusion. Callejo, supra, at 1107 (citation omitted). We
have seen already that the Act defines "commercial activity"
as "either a regular course of commercial conduct or a partic4 We do not mean to suggest that the first clause of $ 1605(a)(2) necessarily requires that each and every element of a claim be commercial activity
by a foreign state, and we do not address the case where a claim consists
of both commercial and sovereign elements. We do conclude, however,
that where a claim rests entirely upon activities sovereign in character, as
here, see infra, at 361-363, jurisdiction will not exist under that clause
regardless of any connection the sovereign acts may have with commercial activity.

reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particulartransaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose."
28 U. S. C. $ 1603(d). If this is a definition, it is one distinguished only by its diffidence; as we observed in our mostrecent case on the subject, it "leaves the critical term `commercial' largely undefined." Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U. S. 607, 612 (1992); see Donoghue, supra, at
499; Lowenfeld, Litigating a Sovereign Immunity Claim--The

Haiti Case, 49 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 377, 435, n. 244 (1974)
(commenting on then-draft Act) ("Start with `activity,' proceed via `conduct' or `transaction' to `character,' then refer

started out to define in the first place"); G. Born & D. Westin,
International Civil Litigation in United States Courts 479-
480 (2d ed. 1992). We do not, however, have the option to
throw up our hands. The term has to be given some interpretation, and congressional diffidence necessarily results
in judicial responsibility to determine what a "commercial
activity" is for purposes of the Act.

We took up the task just last Term in Weltover, supra,
which involved Argentina's unilateral refinancing of bonds it
had issued under a plan to stabilize its currency. Bondholders sued Argentina in federal court, asserting jurisdiction
under the third clause of $ 1605(a)(2). In the course of holding the refinancing to be a commercial activity for purposes
of the Act, we observed that the statute "largely codifies the
so-called `restrictive' theory of foreign sovereign immunity
first endorsed by the State Department in 1952." 504 U. S.,
at 612. We accordingly held that the meaning of "commercial" for purposes of the Act must be the meaning Congress
understood the restrictive theory to require at the time it
passed the statute. See id., at 612-613.

Under the restrictive, as opposed to the "absolute," theory
of foreign sovereign immunity, a state is immune from the

jurisdiction of foreign courts as to its sovereign or publicacts (jure imperii), but not as to those that are private or

commercial in character (jure gestionis). Verlinden B. V. v.Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S., at 487; Alfred Dunhill

Analysis of the American Law of Foreign State Immunity,50 Ford. L. Rev. 155, 168 (1981). We explained in Weltover,
supra, at 614 (quoting Dunhill, supra, at 704), that a stateengages in commercial activity under the restrictive theory
where it exercises " `only those powers that can also be exer-cised by private citizens,' " as distinct from those " `powers
peculiar to sovereigns.' " Put differently, a foreign state en-gages in commercial activity for purposes of the restrictive
theory only where it acts "in the manner of a private playerwithin" the market. 504 U. S., at 614; see Restatement
(Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States$ 451 (1987) ("Under international law, a state or state instrumentality is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts ofanother state, except with respect to claims arising out of
activities of the kind that may be carried on by privatepersons").

We emphasized in Weltover that whether a state acts "in
the manner of " a private party is a question of behavior,not motivation:

"[B]ecause the Act provides that the commercial character of an act is to be determined by reference to its
`nature' rather than its `purpose,' the question is notwhether the foreign government is acting with a profit

motive or instead with the aim of fulfilling uniquely sov-ereign objectives. Rather, the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs (whatever

Opinion of the Court
the motive behind them) are the type of actions by which
a private party engages in `trade and traffic or commerce.' " Weltover, supra, at 614 (citations omitted)
(emphasis in original).

We did not ignore the difficulty of distinguishing " `purpose'
(i. e., the reason why the foreign state engages in the activity) from `nature' (i. e., the outward form of the conduct that
the foreign state performs or agrees to perform)," but recognized that the Act "unmistakably commands" us to observe
the distinction. 504 U. S., at 617 (emphasis in original). Because Argentina had merely dealt in the bond market in
the manner of a private player, we held, its refinancing of
the bonds qualified as a commercial activity for purposes
of the Act despite the apparent governmental motivation.
Ibid.

Unlike Argentina's activities that we considered in
Weltover, the intentional conduct alleged here (the Saudi
Government's wrongful arrest, imprisonment, and torture
of Nelson) could not qualify as commercial under the restrictive theory. The conduct boils down to abuse of the power
of its police by the Saudi Government, and however monstrous such abuse undoubtedly may be, a foreign state's exercise of the power of its police has long been understood for
purposes of the restrictive theory as peculiarly sovereign in
nature. See Arango v. Guzman Travel Advisors Corp., 621

of the powers of police and penal officers is not the sort of
action by which private parties can engage in commerce.

The Nelsons and their amici urge us to give significance
to their assertion that the Saudi Government subjected
Nelson to the abuse alleged as retaliation for his persistence

character of the mistreatment was consequently commercial.

5 The State Department's practice prior to the passage of the Act supports this understanding. Prior to the Act's passage, the State Department would determine in the first instance whether a foreign state was
entitled to immunity and make an appropriate recommendation to the
courts. See Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480,
486-488 (1983). A compilation of available materials demonstrates that
the Department recognized immunity with respect to claims involving the
exercise of the power of the police or military of a foreign state. See
Sovereign Immunity Decisions of the Department of State, May 1952 to
January 1977 (M. Sandler, D. Vagts, & B. Ristau eds.), in 1977 Digest of
United States Practice in International Law 1017, 1045-1046 (claim that
Cuban armed guard seized cash from plaintiff at Havana airport); id., at
1053-1054 (claim that Saudi militia fired on plaintiffs and caused personal
and property damage).

Justice White points to an episode in which the State Department
declined to recognize immunity with respect to a claim by Jamaican
nationals, working in the United States, against the British West Indies
Central Labour Organization, a foreign governmental agency. See id., at
1062-1063; post, at 367-368, n. 3. In our view that episode bears little
relation to this case, for the Jamaican nationals did not allege mistreatment by the police of a foreign state.

Amicus Curiae 6. But this argument does not alter thefact that the powers allegedly abused were those of police

and penal officers. In any event, the argument is off thepoint, for it goes to purpose, the very fact the Act renders
irrelevant to the question of an activity's commercial charac-ter. Whatever may have been the Saudi Government's
motivation for its allegedly abusive treatment of Nelson,it remains the case that the Nelsons' action is based upon a
sovereign activity immune from the subject-matter jurisdic-tion of United States courts under the Act.

In addition to the intentionally tortious conduct, theNelsons claim a separate basis for recovery in petitioners'
failure to warn Scott Nelson of the hidden dangers asso-ciated with his employment. The Nelsons allege that, at
the time petitioners recruited Scott Nelson and thereafter,they failed to warn him of the possibility of severe retaliatory action if he attempted to disclose any safetyhazards he might discover on the job. See supra, at 354.
In other words, petitioners bore a duty to warn of theirown propensity for tortious conduct. But this is merely a
semantic ploy. For aught we can see, a plaintiff could recastvirtually any claim of intentional tort committed by
sovereign act as a claim of failure to warn, simply bycharging the defendant with an obligation to announce
its own tortious propensity before indulging it. To givejurisdictional significance to this feint of language would
effectively thwart the Act's manifest purpose to codifythe restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity. Cf.
United States v. Shearer, 473 U. S. 52, 54-55 (1985) (opin-ion of Burger, C. J.).

White, J., concurring in judgment
Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,concurring in the judgment.

According to respondents' complaint, Scott Nelson's em-ployer retaliated against him for reporting safety problems
by "summon[ing him] . . . to the hospital's security office fromwhich he was transported to a jail cell." App. 5. Once
there, he allegedly was "shackled, tortured and beaten bypersons acting at the direction, instigation, provocation, instruction or request of " petitioners--Saudi Arabia, King Faisal Specialist Hospital, and Royspec. Id., at 5, 14, 18. Themajority concludes that petitioners enjoy sovereign immunity because respondents' action is not "based upon a com-mercial activity." I disagree. I nonetheless concur in the
judgment because in my view the commercial conduct upon
which respondents base their complaint was not "carried on
in the United States."

I

A

As the majority notes, the first step in the analysis is to
identify the conduct on which the action is based. Respondents have pointed to two distinct possibilities. The first,
seemingly pressed at trial and on appeal, consists of the recruiting and hiring activity in the United States. See Brief
for Appellant in No. 89-5981 (CA11), pp. 12-15. Although
this conduct would undoubtedly qualify as "commercial," I
agree with the majority that it is "not the basis for the Nelsons' suit," ante, at 358, for it is unrelated to the elements of
respondents' complaint.

In a partial change of course, respondents suggest to this
Court both in their brief and at oral argument that we focus
on the hospital's commercial activity in Saudi Arabia, its employment practices and disciplinary procedures. Under this
view, the Court would then work its way back to the recruiting and hiring activity in order to establish that the commercial conduct in fact had "substantial contact" with the United

States. See Brief for Respondents 22, 24-25, 31; Tr. of Oral
Arg. 44-45. The majority never reaches this second stage,
finding instead that petitioners' conduct is not commercial
because it "is not the sort of action by which private parties
can engage in commerce." Ante, at 362. If by that the majority means that it is not the manner in which private parties ought to engage in commerce, I wholeheartedly agree.
That, however, is not the relevant inquiry. Rather, the
question we must ask is whether it is the manner in which
private parties at times do engage in commerce.

B
To run and operate a hospital, even a public hospital, is
to engage in a commercial enterprise. The majority never
concedes this point, but it does not deny it either, and to
my mind the matter is self-evident. By the same token,
warning an employee when he blows the whistle and taking
retaliatory action, such as harassment, involuntary transfer,
discharge, or other tortious behavior, although not prototypical commercial acts, are certainly well within the bounds
of commercial activity. The House and Senate Reports accompanying the legislation virtually compel this conclusion,
explaining as they do that "a foreign government's . . .
employment or engagement of laborers, clerical staff or
marketing agents . . . would be among those included within"
the definition of commercial activity. H. R. Rep. No. 94-
1487, p. 16 (1976) (House Report); S. Rep. No. 94-1310,
p. 16 (1976) (Senate Report). Nelson alleges that petitioners harmed him in the course of engaging in their commercial enterprise, as a direct result of their commercial acts.
His claim, in other words, is "based upon commercial
activity."

Indeed, I am somewhat at a loss as to what exactly the
majority believes petitioners have done that a private employer could not. As countless cases attest, retaliation for

366 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

White, J., concurring in judgment
whistle-blowing is not a practice foreign to the marketplace.1Congress passed a statute in response to such behavior, see

Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 U. S. C. $ 1213 et seq.(1988 ed., Supp. III), as have numerous States. On occasion,
private employers also have been known to retaliate by en-listing the help of police officers to falsely arrest employees.
See, e. g., Rosario v. Amalgamated Ladies Garment Cutters'
Union, 605 F. 2d 1228, 1233, 1247-1248 (CA2 1979), cert. de-nied, 446 U. S. 919 (1980). More generally, private parties

have been held liable for conspiring with public authoritiesto effectuate an arrest, see, e. g., Adickes v. S. H. Kress &
Co., 398 U. S. 144 (1970), and for using private securitypersonnel for the same purposes, see

Albright v. LongviewPolice Dept., 884 F. 2d 835, 841-842 (CA5 1989).

Therefore, had the hospital retaliated against Nelson byhiring thugs to do the job, I assume the majority--no longer
able to describe this conduct as "a foreign state's exerciseof the power of its police," ante, at 361--would consent to
calling it "commercial." For, in such circumstances, thestate-run hospital would be operating as any private participant in the marketplace and respondents' action would bebased on the operation by Saudi Arabia's agents of a commercial business.2

1 See, e. g., English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 75-76 (1990);

White, J., concurring in judgment
At the heart of the majority's conclusion, in other words,is the fact that the hospital in this case chose to call in government security forces. See ante, at 362. I find this fixa-tion on the intervention of police officers, and the ensuing
characterization of the conduct as "peculiarly sovereign innature,"

ante, at 361, to be misguided. To begin, it fails tocapture respondents' complaint in full. Far from being directed solely at the activities of the Saudi police, it allegesthat agents of the hospital summoned Nelson to its security
office because he reported safety concerns and that the hos-pital played a part in the subsequent beating and imprisonment. App. 5, 14. Without more, that type of behaviorhardly qualifies as sovereign. Thus, even assuming for the
sake of argument that the role of the official police somehowaffected the nature of petitioners' conduct, the claim cannot
be said to "res[t] entirely upon activities sovereign in charac-ter." See

ante, at 358, n. 4. At the very least it "consistsof both commercial and sovereign elements," thereby presenting the specific question the majority chooses to elude.See

ibid. The majority's single-minded focus on the exer-cise of police power, while certainly simplifying the case,

thus hardly does it justice.3

3 In contrast, the cases cited by the majority involve action that did not
take place in a commercial context and that could be considered purely
sovereign. For instance, in Arango v. Guzman Travel Advisors Corp.,
621 F. 2d 1371 (CA5 1980), plaintiffs were expelled from the Dominican
Republic pursuant to a decision by immigration officials that they were
" `undesirable aliens.' " Id., at 1373. As the Court of Appeals reasoned,
the airline's actions "were not commercial. [It] was impressed into service to perform these functions . . . by Dominican immigration officials pursuant to that country's laws." Id., at 1379. Nor was there a hint of commercial activity in Herbage v. Meese, 747 F. Supp. 60 (DC 1990), affirmance
order, 292 U. S. App. D. C. 84, 946 F. 2d 1564 (1991), an extradition case
that did not so much as mention the commercial activity exception.

Absence of a commercial context also distinguishes those incidents relied on by the majority that predate passage of the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act. See ante, at 362, n. 5. Yet the majority gives short
shrift to an occurrence that most closely resembles the instant case and

368 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

White, J., concurring in judgment
Reliance on the fact that Nelson's employer enlisted thehelp of public rather than private security personnel is also

at odds with Congress' intent. The purpose of the commer-cial exception being to prevent foreign states from taking
refuge behind their sovereignty when they act as marketparticipants, it seems to me that this is precisely the type of
distinction we should seek to avoid. Because both the hospi-tal and the police are agents of the state, the case in my mind
turns on whether the sovereign is acting in a commercialcapacity, not on whether it resorts to thugs or government
officers to carry on its business. That, when the hospitalcalls in security to get even with a whistle-blower, it comes
clothed in police apparel says more about the state-ownednature of the commercial enterprise than about the noncommercial nature of its tortious conduct. I had thought the
that suggests strongly that the hospital's enlistment of, and cooperation
with, the police should not entitle it to immunity. The incident involved
allegations that an agency of the Jamaican Government conspired to have
Jamaican nationals working in the United States "falsely arrested, imprisoned and blacklisted, and to deprive them of wages and other employee
rights." Sovereign Immunity Decisions of the Department of State, May
1952 to January 1977 (M. Sandler, D. Vagts, & B. Ristau eds.), in 1977
Digest of United States Practice in International Law 1062. Significantly,
the State Department did not take refuge behind the words "arres[t]" and
"impriso[n]" and decide that the actions were sovereign in nature.
Rather, it declined to recognize immunity, focusing on the fact that private
parties acting in an employment context could do exactly what the Jamaican agency was alleged to have done: "[T]he activities under consideration
are of a private nature . . . . The Department of State is impressed by
the fact that the activities of the British West Indies Central Labour Organization . . . are very much akin to those that might be conducted by a
labor union or by a private employment agency--arranging and servicing
an agreement between private employers and employees. Although it
may be argued that some of the acts performed by the British West Indies
Central Labour Organization in this case are consular in nature, the Department believes that they arise from the involvement of the British West
Indies Central Labour Organization in the private employer-employee
contractual relationship rather than from a consular responsibility, and
cannot be separated therefrom." Id., at 1063.

"It is, we think, a sound principle, that when a govern-ment becomes a partner in any trading company, it devests itself, so far as concerns the transactions of thatcompany, of its sovereign character, and takes that of a
private citizen. Instead of communicating to the com-pany its privileges and its prerogatives, it descends to a
level with those with whom it associates itself, and takesthe character which belongs to its associates, and to the
business which is to be transacted." Bank of United
States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat. 904, 907(1824).

Contrary to the majority's suggestion, ante, at 363, thisconclusion does not involve inquiring into the purpose of the

conduct. Matters would be different, I suppose, if Nelsonhad been recruited to work in the Saudi police force and,
having reported safety violations, suffered retributive pun-ishment, for there the Saudi authorities would be engaged
in distinctly sovereign activities. Cf. House Report, at 16("Also public or governmental and not commercial in nature,
would be the employment of diplomatic, civil service, or mili-tary personnel"); Senate Report, at 16. The same would be
true if Nelson was a mere tourist in Saudi Arabia and hadbeen summarily expelled by order of immigration officials.
See Arango v. Guzman Travel Advisors Corp., 621 F. 2d1371 (CA5 1980). In this instance, however, the state-owned
hospital was engaged in ordinary commercial business and"[i]n their commercial capacities, foreign governments do not
exercise powers peculiar to sovereigns. Instead, they exer-cise only those powers that can also be exercised by private

citizens." Alfred Dunhill, supra, at 704 (plurality opinion).As we recently stated, "when a foreign government acts, not

as regulator of a market, but in the manner of a privateplayer within it, the foreign sovereign's actions are `commercial' within the meaning of the FSIA." Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U. S. 607, 614 (1992). That, I be-lieve, is the case here.

Nevertheless, I reach the same conclusion as the majoritybecause petitioners' commercial activity was not "carried on

in the United States." The Act defines such conduct as"commercial activity . . . having substantial contact with the
United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(e). Respondents point tothe hospital's recruitment efforts in the United States, including advertising in the American media, and the signingof the employment contract in Miami. See Brief for Respondents 43-45. As I earlier noted, while these may verywell qualify as commercial activity in the United States, they
do not constitute the commercial activity upon which re-spondents' action is based. Conversely, petitioners' commercial conduct in Saudi Arabia, though constituting thebasis of the Nelsons' suit, lacks a sufficient nexus to the
United States. Neither the hospital's employment prac-tices, nor its disciplinary procedures, has any apparent connection to this country. On that basis, I agree that the Actdoes not grant the Nelsons access to our courts.

I join all of the Court's opinion except the last paragraphof Part II, where, with almost no explanation, the Court
rules that, like the intentional tort claim, the claims basedon negligent failure to warn are outside the subject-matter
jurisdiction of the federal courts. These claims stand on amuch different footing from the intentional tort claims for

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).In my view, they ought to be remanded to the District Court

for further consideration. I

A
I agree with the Court's holding that the Nelsons' claimsof intentional wrongdoing by the hospital and the Kingdom

of Saudi Arabia are based on sovereign, not commercial, ac-tivity, and so fall outside the commercial activity exception
to the grant of foreign sovereign immunity contained in 28U. S. C. $ 1604. The intentional tort counts of the Nelsons'
complaint recite the alleged unlawful arrest, imprisonment,and torture of Mr. Nelson by the Saudi police acting in their
official capacities. These are not the sort of activities bywhich a private party conducts its business affairs; if we classified them as commercial, the commercial activity exceptionwould in large measure swallow the rule of foreign sovereign
immunity Congress enacted in the FSIA.

B
By the same token, however, the Nelsons' claims allegingthat the hospital, the Kingdom, and Royspec were negligent

in failing during their recruitment of Nelson to warn him offoreseeable dangers are based upon commercial activity having substantial contact with the United States. As such,they are within the commercial activity exception and the
jurisdiction of the federal courts. Unlike the intentionaltort counts of the complaint, the failure to warn counts do
not complain of a police beating in Saudi Arabia; rather, theycomplain of a negligent omission made during the recruiting
of a hospital employee in the United States. To obtain re-lief, the Nelsons would be obliged to prove that the hospital's
recruiting agent did not tell Nelson about the foreseeablehazards of his prospective employment in Saudi Arabia.
Under the Court's test, this omission is what the negligencecounts are "based upon." See ante, at 356.

372 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Omission of important information during employee re-cruiting is commercial activity as we have described it. See

Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U. S. 607 (1992).It seems plain that recruiting employees is an activity undertaken by private hospitals in the normal course of business.
Locating and hiring employees implicates no power uniqueto the sovereign. In explaining the terms and conditions of

employment, including the risks and rewards of a particularjob, a governmental entity acts in "the manner of a private
player within" the commercial marketplace. Id., at 614.Under the FSIA, as a result, it must satisfy the same general
duties of care that apply to private actors under state law.
If a private company with operations in Saudi Arabia would
be obliged in the course of its recruiting activities subject to
state law to tell a prospective employee about the risk of
arbitrary arrest and torture by Saudi authorities, then so
would King Faisal Specialist Hospital.

The recruiting activity alleged in the failure to warn
counts of the complaint also satisfies the final requirement
for invoking the commercial activity exception: that the
claims be based upon commercial activity "having substantial contact with the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(e).
Nelson's recruitment was performed by Hospital Corporation of America, Ltd. (HCA), a wholly owned subsidiary of
a United States corporation, which, for a period of at least
16 years beginning in 1973, acted as the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia's exclusive agent for recruiting employees for the
hospital. HCA in the regular course of its business seeks
employees for the hospital in the American labor market.
HCA advertised in an American magazine, seeking applicants for the position Nelson later filled. Nelson saw the ad
in the United States and contacted HCA in Tennessee.
After an interview in Saudi Arabia, Nelson returned to Florida, where he signed an employment contract and underwent
personnel processing and application procedures. Before
leaving to take his job at the hospital, Nelson attended an

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
orientation session conducted by HCA in Tennessee for new
employees. These activities have more than substantial
contact with the United States; most of them were "carried
on in the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(2). In alleging that the petitioners neglected during these activities to
tell him what they were bound to under state law, Nelson
meets all of the statutory requirements for invoking federal
jurisdiction under the commercial activity exception.

II
Having met the jurisdictional prerequisites of the FSIA,
the Nelsons' failure to warn claims should survive petitioners' motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)
to dismiss for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. Yet instead of remanding these claims to the District Court for
further proceedings, the majority dismisses them in a single
short paragraph. This is peculiar, since the Court suggests
no reason to question the conclusion that the failure to warn
claims are based on commercial activity having substantial
contact with the United States; indeed, the Court does not
purport to analyze these claims in light of the statutory requirements for jurisdiction.

The Court's summary treatment may stem from doubts
about the underlying validity of the negligence cause of action. The Court dismisses the claims because it fears that
if it did not, "a plaintiff could recast virtually any claim of
intentional tort committed by a sovereign act as a claim of
failure to warn, simply by charging the defendant with an
obligation to announce its own tortious propensity before indulging it." Ante, at 363. In the majority's view, "[t]o give
jurisdictional significance to this feint of language would
effectively thwart the Act's manifest purpose to codify the
restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity." Ibid.
These doubts, however, are not relevant to the analytical
task at hand.

374 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The FSIA states that with respect to any claim against aforeign sovereign that falls within the statutory exceptions

to immunity listed in $ 1605, "the foreign state shall be liablein the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances." 28 U. S. C. $ 1606. The
Act incorporates state law and "was not intended to affectthe substantive law determining the liability of a foreign

state." First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio
Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611, 620 (1983). If the governing state law, which has not yet been determined, would per-mit an injured person to plead and prove a tortious wrong

for failure to warn against a private defendant under facts
similar to those in this case, we have no authority under the
FSIA to ordain otherwise for those suing a sovereign entity.
"[W]here state law provides a rule of liability governing private individuals, the FSIA requires the application of that
rule to foreign states in like circumstances." Id., at 622,
n. 11.

The majority's citation of United States v. Shearer, 473
U. S. 52, 54-55 (1985) (opinion of Burger, C. J.), see ante, at
363, provides no authority for dismissing the failure to warn
claims. Shearer refused to permit a plaintiff to recast in
negligence terms what was essentially an intentional tort
claim, but that case was decided under the doctrine of Feres
v. United States, 340 U. S. 135 (1950). The Feres doctrine is
a creature of federal common law that allows the Court much
greater latitude to make rules of pleading than we have in
the current case. Here, our only task is to interpret the
explicit terms of the FSIA. The Court's conclusion in
Shearer was also based upon the fact that the intentional
tort exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act at issue there,
28 U. S. C. $ 2680(h), precludes "[a]ny claim arising out of "
the specified intentional torts. This language suggests that
Congress intended immunity under the FTCA to cover more
than those claims which simply sounded in intentional tort.
There is no equivalent language in the commercial activity

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
exception to the FSIA. It is also worth noting that theCourt has not adopted a uniform rule barring the recasting

of intentional tort claims as negligence claims under theFTCA; under certain circumstances, we have permitted recovery in that situation. See Sheridan v. United States, 487
U. S. 392 (1988).As a matter of substantive tort law, it is not a novel proposition or a play on words to describe with precision the con-duct upon which various causes of action are based or to
recognize that a single injury can arise from multiple causes,each of which constitutes an actionable wrong. See Restatement (Second) of Torts $$ 447-449 (1965); Sheridan, supra,
at 405 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 272 (1985). In Sheridan, for example, this
Court permitted an action for negligent supervision to go
forward under the FTCA when a suit based upon the intentional tort that was the immediate cause of injury was
barred under the statute. See 487 U. S., at 400. As the
Court observed, "it is both settled and undisputed that in at
least some situations the fact that an injury was directly
caused by an assault or battery will not preclude liability
against the Government for negligently allowing the assault
to occur." Id., at 398.

We need not determine, however, that on remand the Nelsons will succeed on their failure to warn claims. Quite
apart from potential problems of state tort law that might
bar recovery, the Nelsons appear to face an obstacle based
upon the former adjudication of their related lawsuit against
Saudi Arabia's recruiting agent, HCA. The District Court
dismissed that suit, which raised an identical failure to warn
claim, not only as time barred, but also on the merits. See
Nelson v. Hospital Corp. of America, No. 88-0484-CIV-
Nesbitt (SD Fla., Nov. 1, 1990). That decision was affirmed
on appeal, judgment order reported at 946 F. 2d 1546 (CA11
1991), and may be entitled to preclusive effect with respect
to the Nelsons' similar claims against the sovereign defend507us2$45D 11-15-96 18:00:24 PAGES OPINPGT

ants, whose recruitment of Nelson took place almost entirelythrough HCA. See generally

Montana v. United States,
440 U. S. 147, 153 (1979) ("a final judgment on the meritsbars further claims by parties or their privies based on the

same cause of action"); Lawlor v. National Screen Service
Corp., 349 U. S. 322, 330 (1955) (defendants not party to aprior suit may invoke res judicata if "their liability was . . .

`altogether dependent upon the culpability' of the [prior] de-fendants") (quoting

Bigelow v. Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co., 225 U. S. 111, 127 (1912)); 18 C. Wright,A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure

$ 4463, p. 567 (1981) (recognizing general rule that "judgmentin an action against either party to a vicarious liability relationship establishe[s] preclusion in favor of the other"); Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 51 (1982).

But the question of claim preclusion, like the substantive
validity under state law of the Nelsons' negligence cause of
action, has not yet been litigated and is outside the proper
sphere of our review. "[I]t is not our practice to reexamine
a question of state law of [this] kind or, without good reason,
to pass upon it in the first instance." Sheridan, supra, at

401. That a remand to the District Court may be of no avail
to the Nelsons is irrelevant to our task here; if the jurisdictional requirements of the FSIA are met, the case must be
remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In my
view, the FSIA conferred subject-matter jurisdiction on the
District Court to entertain the failure to warn claims, and
with all respect, I dissent from the Court's refusal to remand them.

Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment in part

join Justice Kennedy's opinion insofar as it concludes thatthe "failure to warn" claims should be remanded.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976(FSIA), a foreign state is subject to the jurisdiction of American courts if two conditions are met: The action must be"based upon a commercial activity" and that activity must
have a "substantial contact with the United States." 1 Thesetwo conditions should be separately analyzed because they
serve two different purposes. The former excludes com-mercial activity from the scope of the foreign sovereign's
immunity from suit; the second identifies the contacts withthe United States that support the assertion of jurisdiction
over the defendant.2

1 Section 4(a) of the FSIA provides:
"(a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts
of the United States or of the States in any case--. . . . .

"(2) in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on
in the United States by the foreign state." 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(2).

The key terms of this provision are defined in $ 1603. Section 1603(e)
defines "commercial activity carried on in the United States by a foreign
state" as "commercial activity carried on by such state and having substantial contact with the United States." Section 1603(d), in turn, defines
"commercial activity" as "either a regular course of commercial conduct
or a particular commercial transaction or act." Thus, interpolating the
definitions from $ 1603 into $ 1605(a)(2) produces this equivalence:

"A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of
the United States or of the States in any case in which the action is based
upon a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial
transaction carried on by such state and having substantial contact with
the United States."

2 See, e. g., Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea, 224 U. S. App. D. C. 119, 130, n. 18, 693 F. 2d 1094, 1105,
n. 18 (1982) ("the immunity determination involves considerations distinct
from the issue of personal jurisdiction, and the FSIA's interlocking provisions are most profitably analyzed when these distinctions are kept in
mind"). See also J. Dellapenna, Suing Foreign Governments and Their

378 SAUDI ARABIA v. NELSON

Stevens, J., dissenting
In this case, as Justice White has demonstrated, peti-tioner Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's operation of the hospital

and its employment practices and disciplinary proceduresare "commercial activities" within the meaning of the statute, and respondent Scott Nelson's claim that he was pun-ished for acts performed in the course of his employment
was unquestionably "based upon" those activities. Thus,the first statutory condition is satisfied; petitioner is not entitled to immunity from the claims asserted by respondent.Unlike

Justice White, however, I am also convinced thatpetitioner's commercial activities--whether defined as the

regular course of conduct of operating a hospital or, morespecifically, as the commercial transaction of engaging respondent "as an employee with specific responsibilities inthat enterprise," Brief for Respondents 25--have sufficient
contact with the United States to justify the exercise of fed-eral jurisdiction. Petitioner Royspec maintains an office in
Maryland and purchases hospital supplies and equipment inthis country. For nearly two decades the hospital's American agent has maintained an office in the United States andregularly engaged in the recruitment of personnel in this
country. Respondent himself was recruited in the UnitedStates and entered into his employment contract with the
hospital in the United States. Before traveling to SaudiArabia to assume his position at the hospital, respondent attended an orientation program in Tennessee. The positionfor which respondent was recruited and ultimately hired was
that of a monitoring systems manager, a troubleshooter, and,taking respondent's allegations as true, it was precisely respondent's performance of those responsibilities that led tothe hospital's retaliatory actions against him.

Corporations 66, 144 (1988) ("The nexus rules must be analyzed separately
from the substantive immunity rules . . . in order to understand jurisdictional questions under the Act" and because "the laws regulating . . .
jurisdiction . . . and immunity serve different purposes, and thus require
different dispositions") (footnotes omitted).

Whether the first clause of $ 1605(a)(2) broadly authorizes"general" jurisdiction over foreign entities that engage in

substantial commercial activity in this country, or, more nar-rowly, authorizes only "specific" jurisdiction over particular
commercial claims that have a substantial contact with theUnited States,

3 petitioners' contacts with the United States

in this case are, in my view, plainly sufficient to subject peti-tioners to suit in this country on a claim arising out of their

nonimmune commercial activity relating to respondent. Ifthe same activities had been performed by a private business, I have no doubt jurisdiction would be upheld. Andthat, of course, should be a touchstone of our inquiry; for as
Justice White explains, ante, at 366, n. 2, and 368-369,when a foreign nation sheds its uniquely sovereign status
and seeks out the benefits of the private marketplace, itmust, like any private party, bear the burdens and responsibilities imposed by that marketplace. I would therefore af-firm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

4

3 Though this case does not require resolution of that question (because
petitioners' contacts with the United States satisfy, in my view, the more
narrow requirements of "specific" jurisdiction), I am inclined to agree with
the view expressed by Judge Higginbotham in his separate opinion in
Vencedora Oceanica Navigacion, S. A. v. Compagnie Nationale Algerienne de Navigation, 730 F. 2d 195, 204-205 (1984) (concurring in part and
dissenting in part), that the first clause of $ 1605(a)(2), interpreted in light
of the relevant legislative history and the second and third clauses of the
provision, does authorize "general" jurisdiction over foreign entities that
engage in substantial commercial activities in the United States.

4 My affirmance would extend to respondents' failure to warn claims. I

am therefore in agreement with Justice Kennedy's analysis of that aspect of the case.

PARTNERSHIP et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 91-1695. Argued November 30, 1992--Decided March 24, 1993
As unsecured creditors of petitioner--a company seeking relief under

Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code--respondents were required to file
proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court before the deadline, or bar
date, established by that court. An August 3, 1989, bar date was included in a "Notice for Meeting of Creditors" received from the court
by Mark Berlin, an official for respondents. Respondents' attorney was
provided with a complete copy of the case file and, when asked, assertedly assured Berlin that no bar date had been set. On August 23, 1989,
respondents asked the court to accept their proofs under Bankruptcy
Rule 9006(b)(1), which allows a court to permit late filings where the
movant's failure to comply with the deadline "was the result of excusable neglect." The court refused, holding that a party may claim excusable neglect only if the failure to timely perform was due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. The District Court remanded
the case, ordering the Bankruptcy Court to evaluate respondents' conduct under a more liberal standard. The Bankruptcy Court applied
that standard and again denied the motion, finding that several factors--
the danger of prejudice to the debtor, the length of the delay and its
potential impact on judicial proceedings, and whether the creditor acted
in good faith--favored respondents, but that the delay was within their
control and that they should be penalized for their counsel's mistake.
The District Court affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed. It
found that the Bankruptcy Court had inappropriately penalized respondents for their counsel's error, since Berlin had asked the attorney
about the impending deadlines and since the peculiar and inconspicuous
placement of the bar date in a notice for a creditors' meeting without
any indication of the date's significance left a dramatic ambiguity in
the notification that would have confused even a person experienced
in bankruptcy.

Held:

1. An attorney's inadvertent failure to file a proof of claim by the
bar date can constitute "excusable neglect" within the meaning of Rule
9006(b)(1). Pp. 387-397.

Syllabus
(a) Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, Congress plainly contemplated that the courts would be permitted to accept late filings caused
by inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness, not just those caused by intervening circumstances beyond the party's control. This flexible understanding comports with the ordinary meaning of "neglect." It also
accords with the underlying policies of Chapter 11 and the bankruptcy
rules, which entrust broad equitable powers to the courts in order to
ensure the success of a debtor's reorganization. In addition, this view
is confirmed by the history of the present bankruptcy rules and is
strongly supported by the fact that the phrase "excusable neglect," as
used in several of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is understood
to be a somewhat "elastic concept." Pp. 387-395.

(b) The determination of what sorts of neglect will be considered
"excusable" is an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances. These include the first four factors applied in the instant case.
However, the Court of Appeals erred in not attributing to respondents
the fault of their counsel. Clients may be held accountable for their
attorney's acts and omissions. See, e. g., Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370
U. S. 626. Thus, in determining whether respondents' failure to timely
file was excusable, the proper focus is upon whether the neglect of
respondents and their counsel was excusable. Pp. 395-397.

2. The neglect of respondents' counsel was, under all the circumstances, excusable. As the Court of Appeals found, the lack of any prejudice to the debtor or to the interest of efficient judicial administration,
combined with the good faith of respondents and their counsel, weigh
strongly in favor of permitting the tardy claim. As for the culpability
of respondents' counsel, it is significant that the notice of the bar date
in this case was outside the ordinary course in bankruptcy cases. Normally, such a notice would be prominently announced and accompanied
by an explanation of its significance, not inconspicuously placed in a
notice regarding a creditors' meeting. Pp. 397-399.

Opinion of the Court

John A. Lucas argued the cause for respondents. Withhim on the brief was Lansing R. Palmer.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
Rule 3003(c) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Proce-dure sets out the requirements for filing proofs of claim in

Chapter 9 Municipality and Chapter 11 Reorganizationcases.

1 Rule 3003(c)(3) provides that the "court shall fix and

for cause shown may extend the time within which proofs ofclaim or interest may be filed." Rule 9006 is a general rule

governing the computation, enlargement, and reduction ofperiods of time prescribed in other bankruptcy rules. Rule
9006(b)(1) empowers a bankruptcy court to permit a late fil-ing if the movant's failure to comply with an earlier deadline
"was the result of excusable neglect." 2 In this case, we are

1 Bankruptcy Rule 3003(c), in relevant part, provides:
"(c) Filing Proof of Claim.
"(1) Who May File. Any creditor or indenture trustee may file a proof
of claim within the time prescribed by subdivision (c)(3) of this rule.

"(2) Who Must File. Any creditor or equity security holder whose
claim or interest is not scheduled or scheduled as disputed, contingent, or

On April 12, 1989, petitioner filed a voluntary petition forbankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the

Eastern District of Tennessee. The petition sought reliefunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Petitioner also
filed a list of its 20 largest unsecured creditors, including allbut one of respondents here. The following month, after obtaining extensions of time from the Bankruptcy Court, petitioner filed a statement of financial affairs and schedules ofits assets and liabilities. The schedules, as amended, listed

all of the respondents except Ft. Oglethorpe Associates Lim-ited Partnership as creditors holding contingent, unliquidated, or disputed claims; the Ft. Oglethorpe partnership
was not listed at all. Under $ 1111 of the Bankruptcy Code,11 U. S. C. $ 1111(a), and Bankruptcy Rule 3003(c)(2), all such

creditors are required to file a proof of claim with the bank-ruptcy court before the deadline, or "bar date," established
by the court.On April 13, 1989, the day after petitioner filed its Chapter
11 petition, the Bankruptcy Court mailed a "Notice for Meet-ing of Creditors" to petitioner's creditors. Along with the
announcement of a May 5 meeting was the following passage:
tion of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to
act was the result of excusable neglect.

"(2) Enlargement Not Permitted. The court may not enlarge the time
for taking action under Rules 1007(d), 1017(b)(3), 2003(a) and (d), 7052,
9023, and 9024.

"(3) Enlargment Limited. The court may enlarge the time for taking

Opinion of the Court

"You must file a proof of claim if your claim is scheduledas disputed, contingent or unliquidated, is unlisted or

you do not agree with the amount. See 11 U. S. C. Sec.1111 & Bankruptcy rule 3003. Bar date is August 3,
1989." App. 29a.
The notice was received and read by Mark A. Berlin, presi-dent of the corporate general partners of each of the respondents. Berlin duly attended the creditors' meeting onMay 5. The following month, respondents retained an experienced bankruptcy attorney, Marc Richards, to representthem in the proceedings. Berlin stated in an affidavit that
he provided Richards with a complete copy of the case file,including a copy of the court's April 13, 1989, notice to creditors. Berlin also asserted that he inquired of Richardswhether there was a deadline for filing claims and that Richards assured him that no bar date had been set and thatthere was no urgency in filing proofs of claim.

Id., at 121a.Richards and Berlin both attended a subsequent meeting of

creditors on June 16, 1989.Respondents failed to file any proofs of claim by the August 3, 1989, bar date. On August 23, 1989, respondentsfiled their proofs, along with a motion that the court permit
the late filing under Rule 9006(b)(1). In particular, respond-ents' counsel explained that the bar date, of which he was
unaware, came at a time when he was experiencing "a majorand significant disruption" in his professional life caused by
his withdrawal from his former law firm on July 31, 1989.
Id., at 56a. Because of this disruption, counsel did not haveaccess to his copy of the case file in this matter until midAugust. Ibid.The Bankruptcy Court refused the late filing. Following
precedent from the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir-cuit, the court held that a party may claim "excusable neglect" only if its " `failure to timely perform a duty was dueto circumstances which were beyond [its] reasonable [c]ontrol.' " Id., at 124a (quoting In re South Atlantic Financial

sub nom. Biscayne 21
Condominium Associates, Inc. v. South Atlantic Financial
Corp., 475 U. S. 1015 (1986)). Finding that respondents had
received notice of the bar date and could have complied, the
court ruled that they could not claim "excusable neglect."On appeal, the District Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found "respectable authority forthe narrow reading of `excusable neglect' " adopted by the
Bankruptcy Court, but concluded that the Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit would follow "a more liberal approach."
App. 157a. Embracing a test announced by the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the District Court remanded
with instructions that the Bankruptcy Court evaluate respondents' conduct against several factors, including: " ` "(1)
whether granting the delay will prejudice the debtor; (2) the
length of the delay and its impact on efficient court administration; (3) whether the delay was beyond the reasonable
control of the person whose duty it was to perform; (4)
whether the creditor acted in good faith; and (5) whether
clients should be penalized for their counsel's mistake or neglect." ' " Id., at 158a-159a (quoting In re Dix, 95 B. R. 134,
138 (CA9 Bkrtcy. Appellate Panel 1988) (in turn quoting In
re Magouirk, 693 F. 2d 948, 951 (CA9 1982))). The District
Court also suggested that the Bankruptcy Court consider
whether the failure to comply with the bar date "resulted
from negligence, indifference or culpable conduct on the part
of a moving creditor or its counsel." App. 159a.

On remand, the Bankruptcy Court applied the so-called
Dix factors and again denied respondents' motion. Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court found (1) that petitioner would
not be prejudiced by the late filings; (2) that the 20-day delay
in filing the proofs of claim would have no adverse impact on
efficient court administration; (3) that the reason for the
delay was not outside respondents' control; (4) that respondents and their counsel acted in good faith; and (5) that, in

Opinion of the Court

light of Berlin's business sophistication and his actual knowl-edge of the bar date, it would not be improper to penalize

respondents for the neglect of their counsel. App. 168a-172a. The court also found that respondents' counsel was
negligent in missing the bar date and, "[t]o a degree," indifferent to it. Id., at 172a. In weighing these considerations,the Bankruptcy Court "attache[d] considerable importance

to Dix factors 3 and 5," and concluded that a ruling in re-spondents' favor, notwithstanding their actual notice of the
bar date, "would render nugatory the fixing of the claims'bar date in this case."

Id., at 173a. The District Court
affirmed the ruling.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. The
Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that "excusable neglect" was not limited to cases where the failure to
act was due to circumstances beyond the movant's control.
The Court of Appeals also agreed with the District Court
that the five "Dix factors" were helpful, although not necessarily exhaustive, guides. In re Pioneer Investment Services Co., 943 F. 2d 673, 677 (1991). The court found, however, that the Bankruptcy Court had misapplied the fifth Dix
factor to this case. Because Berlin had inquired of counsel
whether there were any impending filing deadlines and been
told that none existed, the Court of Appeals ruled that the
Bankruptcy Court had "inappropriately penalized the [respondents] for the errors of their counsel." 943 F. 2d, at 677.

The Court of Appeals also found "it significant that the
notice containing the bar date was incorporated in a document entitled `Notice for Meeting of Creditors.' " Id., at 678.
"Such a designation," the court explained, "would not have
put those without extensive experience in bankruptcy on notice that the date appended to the end of this notice was
intended to be the final date for filing proof of claims." Ibid.
Indeed, based on a comparison between the notice in this
case and the model notice set out in Official Bankruptcy
Form 16, the court concluded that the notice given respond507us2$46J 11-19-96 16:11:29 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ents contained a "dramatic ambiguity," which could wellhave confused "[e]ven persons experienced in bankruptcy."

Ibid. Having determined that the fifth Dix factor favoredrespondents rather than petitioner, the Court of Appeals
found that the record demonstrated "excusable neglect."Because of the conflict in the Courts of Appeals over the
meaning of "excusable neglect," 3 we granted certiorari, 504U. S. 984 (1992), and now affirm.

There is, of course, a range of possible explanations for aparty's failure to comply with a court-ordered filing deadline.

God or unforeseeable human intervention. At the other, a

3 The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh
Circuits have taken a narrow view of "excusable neglect" under Rule
9006(b)(1), requiring a showing that the delay was caused by circumstances beyond the movant's control. See In re Davis, 936 F. 2d 771, 774
(CA4 1991); In re Danielson, 981 F. 2d 296, 298 (CA7 1992); Hanson v.
First Bank of South Dakota, N. A., 828 F. 2d 1310, 1314-1315 (CA8 1987);
In re Analytical Systems, Inc., 933 F. 2d 939, 942 (CA11 1991). The
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, by contrast, has applied a more
flexible analysis similar to that employed by the Court of Appeals in the
present case. In re Centric Corp., 901 F. 2d 1514, 1517-1518, cert. denied
sub nom. Trustees of Centennial State Carpenters Pension Trust Fund
v. Centric Corp., 498 U. S. 852 (1990). The Courts of Appeals similarly
have divided in their interpretations of "excusable neglect" as found in
Rule 4(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Some courts
have required a showing that the movant's failure to meet the deadline
was beyond its control, see, e. g., 650 Park Ave. Corp. v. McRae, 836 F. 2d
764, 767 (CA2 1988); Pratt v. McCarthy, 850 F. 2d 590, 592 (CA9 1988),
while others have adopted a more flexible approach similar to that employed by the Court of Appeals in this case, see, e. g., Consolidated

Opinion of the Court

party simply may choose to flout a deadline. In between liecases where a party may

choose to miss a deadline although
for a very good reason, such as to render first aid to an acci-dent victim discovered on the way to the courthouse, as well

as cases where a party misses a deadline through inadvertence, miscalculation, or negligence. Petitioner contendsthat the Bankruptcy Court was correct when it first interpreted Rule 9006(b)(1) to require a showing that the mov-ant's failure to comply with the court's deadline was caused
by circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Petitionersuggests that exacting enforcement of filing deadlines is essential to the Bankruptcy Code's goals of certainty and finality in resolving disputed claims. Under petitioner's view,
any showing of fault on the part of the late filer would defeat
a claim of "excusable neglect."

We think that petitioner's interpretation is not consonant
with either the language of the Rule or the evident purposes
underlying it. First, the Rule grants a reprieve to out-oftime filings that were delayed by "neglect." The ordinary
meaning of "neglect" is "to give little attention or respect"
to a matter, or, closer to the point for our purposes, "to leave
undone or unattended to esp[ecially] through carelessness."
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 791 (1983) (emphasis added). The word therefore encompasses both simple, faultless omissions to act and, more commonly, omissions
caused by carelessness. Courts properly assume, absent
sufficient indication to the contrary, that Congress intends
the words in its enactments to carry "their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning." Perrin v. United States, 444
U. S. 37, 42 (1979). Hence, by empowering the courts to accept late filings "where the failure to act was the result of
excusable neglect," Rule 9006(b)(1), Congress plainly contemplated that the courts would be permitted, where appropriate, to accept late filings caused by inadvertence, mistake,
or carelessness, as well as by intervening circumstances beyond the party's control.

Opinion of the Court
Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, this flexible understanding of "excusable neglect" accords with the policies underlying Chapter 11 and the bankruptcy rules. The "excusable neglect" standard of Rule 9006(b)(1) governs late filings
of proofs of claim in Chapter 11 cases but not in Chapter
7 cases.4 The rules' differentiation between Chapter 7 and
Chapter 11 filings corresponds with the differing policies of
the two chapters. Whereas the aim of a Chapter 7 liquidation is the prompt closure and distribution of the debtor's
estate, Chapter 11 provides for reorganization with the aim
of rehabilitating the debtor and avoiding forfeitures by creditors. See United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U. S.
198, 203 (1983). In overseeing this latter process, the bankruptcy courts are necessarily entrusted with broad equitable
powers to balance the interests of the affected parties,
guided by the overriding goal of ensuring the success of the
reorganization. See NLRB v. Bildisco & Bildisco, 465 U. S.
513, 527-528 (1984). This context suggests that Rule 9006's
allowance for late filings due to "excusable neglect" entails a
correspondingly equitable inquiry.

The history of the present bankruptcy rules confirms this
view. Rule 9006(b) is derived from Rule 906(b) of the
former bankruptcy rules, which governed bankruptcy pro4 The time-computation and time-extension provisions of Rule 9006, like
those of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6, are generally applicable to any
time requirement found elsewhere in the rules unless expressly excepted.
Subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of Rule 9006 enumerate those time requirements excluded from the operation of the "excusable neglect" standard.
One of the time requirements listed as excepted in Rule 9006(b)(3) is that
governing the filing of proofs of claim in Chapter 7 cases. Such filings are
governed exclusively by Rule 3002(c). See Rule 9006(b)(3); In re Coastal
Alaska Lines, Inc., 920 F. 2d 1428, 1432 (CA9 1990). By contrast, Rule
9006(b) does not make a similar exception for Rule 3003(c), which, as noted
earlier, establishes the time requirements for proofs of claim in Chapter
11 cases. Consequently, Rule 9006(b)(1) must be construed to govern the
permissibility of late filings in Chapter 11 bankruptcies. See Advisory
Committee's Note accompanying Rule 9006(b)(1).

ceedings under the former Bankruptcy Act. Like Rule9006(b)(1), former Rule 906(b) permitted courts to accept late

filings "where the failure to act was the result of excusableneglect." The forerunner of Rule 3003(c), which now establishes the requirements for filing claims in Chapter 11 cases,was former Rule 10-401(b), which established the filing requirements for proofs of claim in reorganization cases underChapter X of the former Act, Chapter 11's predecessor. The
Advisory Committee's Notes accompanying that former Rulemake clear that courts were entrusted with the authority
under Rules 10-401(b) and 906(b) to accept tardy filings "inaccordance with the equities of the situation":

"If the court has fixed a bar date for the filing ofproofs of claim, it may still enlarge that time within the
provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 906(b) which is madeapplicable in this subdivision. This policy is in accord
with Chapter X generally which is to preserve ratherthan to forfeit rights. In $ 102 it rejects the notion expressed in $ 57n of the Act that claims must be filedwithin a six-month period to participate in any distribution. Section 224(4) of Chapter X of the Act permitsdistribution to certain creditors even if they fail to file
claims and $ 204 fixes a minimum period of 5 years be-fore distribution rights under a plan may be forfeited.
This approach was intentional as expressed in SenateReport 1916 (75th Cong., 3d Sess., April 20, 1938):

" `Sections 204 and 205 insure participation in the benefits of the reorganization to those who, through inad-vertence or otherwise, have failed to file their claims or

otherwise evidence their interests during the pendency
of the proceedings.'"This attitude is carried forward in the rules, first by

dispensing with the need to file proofs of claims andstock interests in most instances and, secondly, by permitting enlargement of the fixed bar date in a particular

401.01, p. 10-401-4 (14th ed. 1977).
This history supports our conclusion that the enlargement ofprescribed time periods under the "excusable neglect" standard of Rule 9006(b)(1) is not limited to situations where thefailure to timely file is due to circumstances beyond the control of the filer.Our view that the phrase "excusable neglect" found in
Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1) is not limited as petitioner wouldhave it is also strongly supported by the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, which use that phrase in several places.Indeed, Rule 9006(b)(1) was patterned after Rule 6(b) of
those Rules.5 Under Rule 6(b), where the specified periodfor the performance of an act has elapsed, a district court
may enlarge the period and permit the tardy act where theomission is the "result of excusable neglect."

6 As with Rule

9006(b)(1), there is no indication that anything other than thecommonly accepted meaning of the phrase was intended by

its drafters. It is not surprising, then, that in applying Rule6(b), the Courts of Appeals have generally recognized that

discretion (1) with or without motion or notice order the period enlarged
if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally
prescribed or as extended by a previous order, or (2) upon motion made
after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where
the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect; but it may not extend
the time for taking any action under Rules 50(b) and (c)(2), 52(b), 59(b),

Opinion of the Court

"excusable neglect" may extend to inadvertent delays.7 Al-though inadvertence, ignorance of the rules, or mistakes

construing the rules do not usually constitute "excusable"neglect, it is clear that "excusable neglect" under Rule 6(b)
is a somewhat "elastic concept" 8 and is not limited strictlyto omissions caused by circumstances beyond the control of
the movant.9The "excusable neglect" standard for allowing late filings
is also used elsewhere in the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-dure. When a party should have asserted a counterclaim
but did not, Rule 13(f) permits the counterclaim to be setup by amendment where the omission is due to "oversight,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice re-quires." In the context of such a provision, it is difficult
indeed to imagine that "excusable neglect" was intended tobe limited as petitioner insists it should be.

9 The Courts of Appeals generally have given a similar interpretation

to "excusable neglect" in the context of Rule 45(b) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, which, like Rule 9006(b), was modeled after Rule 6(b).
See, e. g., United States v. Roberts, 978 F. 2d 17, 21-24 (CA1 1992); Warren

10 In assessing what constitutes "excusable neglect" under Rule 13(f),

the lower courts have looked, inter alia, to the good faith of the claimant,
the extent of the delay, and the danger of prejudice to the opposing party.

Opinion of the Court
The same is true of Rule 60(b)(1), which permits courtsto reopen judgments for reasons of "mistake, inadvertence,

surprise, or excusable neglect," but only on motion madewithin one year of the judgment. Rule 60(b)(6) goes further, however, and empowers the court to reopen a judgment
even after one year has passed for "any other reason justify-ing relief from the operation of the judgment." These provisions are mutually exclusive, and thus a party who failedto take timely action due to "excusable neglect" may not
seek relief more than a year after the judgment by resortingto subsection (6).

Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition
Corp., 486 U. S. 847, 863, and n. 11 (1988). To justify reliefunder subsection (6), a party must show "extraordinary circumstances" suggesting that the party is faultless in the
delay. See ibid.; Ackermann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193,197-200 (1950);

Klapprott v. United States, 335 U. S. 601,
613-614 (1949). If a party is partly to blame for the delay,relief must be sought within one year under subsection (1)

and the party's neglect must be excusable. In Klapprott,for example, the petitioner had been effectively prevented
from taking a timely appeal of a judgment by incarceration,ill health, and other factors beyond his reasonable control.
Four years after a default judgment had been entered
against him, he sought to reopen the matter under Rule 60(b)and was permitted to do so. As explained by Justice Black:

"It is contended that the one-year limitation [of subsection (1)] bars petitioner on the premise that the petition
to set aside the judgment showed, at most, nothing but`excusable neglect.' And of course, the one-year limitation would control if no more than `neglect' was disclosedby the petition. In that event the petitioner could not
avail himself of the broad `any other reason' clause of
Technographics, Inc. v. Mercer Corp., 142 F. R. D. 429, 430 (MD Pa. 1992).
Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7013 contains a similar allowance
for late counterclaims brought by a trustee or debtor in possession.

60(b). But petitioner's allegations set up an extraordi-nary situation which cannot fairly or logically be classified as mere `neglect' on his part. The undenied factsset out in the petition reveal far more than a failure to
defend . . . due to inadvertence, indifference, or carelessdisregard of consequences."

Id., at 613.

Justice Frankfurter, although dissenting on other grounds,agreed that Klapprott's allegations of inability to comply

with earlier deadlines took his case outside the scope of "ex-cusable neglect" "because `neglect' in the context of its subject matter carries the idea of negligence and not merely ofnon-action."

Id., at 630.Thus, at least for purposes of Rule 60(b), "excusable neglect" is understood to encompass situations in which thefailure to comply with a filing deadline is attributable to negligence. Because of the language and structure of Rule60(b), a party's failure to file on time for reasons beyond his

Klapprott, supra.11 This latter result, however, would notobtain under Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1). Had respondents

here been prevented from complying with the bar date byan act of God or some other circumstance beyond their control, the Bankruptcy Court plainly would have been permit-ted to find "excusable neglect." At the same time, reading
Rule 9006(b)(1) inflexibly to exclude every instance of an in-advertent or negligent omission would ignore the most natu11 A similar, but even more explicit, dichotomy can be found in a former
Rule of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit governing the late
filing of appeals. That Rule permitted late filings " `upon a showing . . .
(a) that the delay has been due to cause beyond the control of the moving
party or (b) that the delay has been due to circumstances which shall be
deemed to be merely excusable neglect . . . .' " Rule 15(2), U. S. C. C. A.,
Second Circuit, quoted in Pyramid Motor Freight Corp. v. Ispass, 330
U. S. 695, 703, n. 10 (1947). Although the meaning given "excusable neglect" for purposes of this Rule obviously is not controlling for purposes
of Rule 9006(b)(1), it does suggest that the meaning of "excusable neglect"
urged by petitioner is far from natural.

ral meaning of the word "neglect" and would be at odds withthe accepted meaning of that word in analogous contexts.

B
This leaves, of course, the Rule's requirement that theparty's neglect of the bar date be "excusable." It is this

requirement that we believe will deter creditors or otherparties from freely ignoring court-ordered deadlines in
the hopes of winning a permissive reprieve under Rule9006(b)(1). With regard to determining whether a party's
neglect of a deadline is excusable, we are in substantialagreement with the factors identified by the Court of Appeals. Because Congress has provided no other guidepostsfor determining what sorts of neglect will be considered "excusable," we conclude that the determination is at bottom anequitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances
surrounding the party's omission.13 These include, as theCourt of Appeals found, the danger of prejudice to the
debtor, the length of the delay and its potential impact onjudicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including
whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith. See 943 F. 2d,
at 677.14

12 See also United States v. Boyle, 469 U. S. 241, 245, n. 3 (1985)
("neglect" as used in statute governing late filing of tax returns "impl[ies] carelessness").

13 The dissent discerns in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497

U. S. 871 (1990), an indication that the factors relevant to this inquiry
extend no further than the movant's culpability and the reason for the delay, see post, at 401. We cannot agree. Lujan held that a District Court
did not abuse its discretion in declining to permit a late filing under Rule
6(b) of the Civil Rules on grounds of excusable neglect. 497 U. S., at 897-
898. The Court did not, however, define "excusable neglect" or even decide whether that standard could have been met on the facts of that case.

14 The dissent would permit judges to take account of the full range of

equitable considerations only if they have first made a threshold determination that the movant is "sufficiently blameless" in the delay, see post, at
400. The dissent believes that this formulation of the Rule's requirements

Opinion of the Court

There is one aspect of the Court of Appeals' analysis, however, with which we disagree. The Court of Appeals suggested that it would be inappropriate to penalize respondents for the omissions of their attorney, reasoning that "the
ultimate responsibility of filing the . . . proof[s] of clai[m]
rested with [respondents'] counsel." Ibid. The court also
appeared to focus its analysis on whether respondents did all
they reasonably could in policing the conduct of their attorney, rather than on whether their attorney, as respondents'
agent, did all he reasonably could to comply with the courtordered bar date. In this, the court erred.

In other contexts, we have held that clients must be held
accountable for the acts and omissions of their attorneys. In
Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626 (1962), we held that a
client may be made to suffer the consequence of dismissal of
its lawsuit because of its attorney's failure to attend a scheduled pretrial conference. In so concluding, we found "no
merit to the contention that dismissal of petitioner's claim
because of his counsel's unexcused conduct imposes an unjust
penalty on the client." Id., at 633. To the contrary, the
Court wrote:

would bring needed clarity to the Rule's application and save judicial resources. See post, at 408. But narrowing the range of factors to be considered in making the "excusable neglect" determination will not eliminate
disputes over how the remaining factors should be applied in any given
case. For purposes of the present case at least, the dissent appears willing to draw a line between ordinary negligence and partial "indifference"
to deadlines, see post, at 407, but parties with valuable interests at stake
will no doubt find this distinction susceptible of litigation. The only reliable means of eliminating the "indeterminacy" the dissent finds so troubling would be to adopt a bright-line rule of the sort embraced by some
Courts of Appeals, erecting a rigid barrier against late filings attributable
in any degree to the movant's negligence. As we have suggested, however, such a construction is irreconcilable with our cases assigning a more
flexible meaning to "excusable neglect." Faced with a choice between our
own precedent and Black's Law Dictionary, we adhere to the former.

Opinion of the Court
"Petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his repre-sentative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selectedagent. Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent
with our system of representative litigation, in whicheach party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyeragent and is considered to have `notice of all facts, noticeof which can be charged upon the attorney.' "

Id., at633-634 (quoting Smith v. Ayer, 101 U. S. 320, 326

(1880)).
This principle also underlies our decision in United States v.
Boyle, 469 U. S. 241 (1985), that a client could be penalizedfor counsel's tardy filing of a tax return. This principle applies with equal force here and requires that respondents beheld accountable for the acts and omissions of their chosen
counsel. Consequently, in determining whether respond-ents' failure to file their proofs of claim prior to the bar date
was excusable, the proper focus is upon whether the neglectof respondents

and their counsel was excusable.

III
Although the Court of Appeals in this case erred in notattributing to respondents the fault of their counsel, we conclude that its result was correct nonetheless. First, peti-tioner does not challenge the findings made below concerning
the respondents' good faith and the absence of any danger ofprejudice to the debtor or of disruption to efficient judicial
administration posed by the late filings. Nor would we beinclined in any event to unsettle factual findings entered by
a Bankruptcy Court and affirmed by both the District Courtand Court of Appeals. See Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co.,
482 U. S. 656, 665 (1987). Indeed, in this case, the Bank-ruptcy Court took judicial notice of the fact that the debtor's
second amended plan of reorganization, offered after this liti-gation was well underway, takes account of respondents'
claims. App. 168a-169a. As the Court of Appeals found,

Opinion of the Court

the lack of any prejudice to the debtor or to the interests ofefficient judicial administration, combined with the good faith

of respondents and their counsel, weigh strongly in favor ofpermitting the tardy claim.

In assessing the culpability of respondents' counsel, we
give little weight to the fact that counsel was experiencingupheaval in his law practice at the time of the bar date. We

do, however, consider significant that the notice of the bardate provided by the Bankruptcy Court in this case was outside the ordinary course in bankruptcy cases. As the Courtof Appeals noted, ordinarily the bar date in a bankruptcy
case should be prominently announced and accompanied byan explanation of its significance. See 943 F. 2d, at 678. We
agree with the court that the "peculiar and inconspicuous
placement of the bar date in a notice regarding a creditors[']meeting," without any indication of the significance of the

bar date, left a "dramatic ambiguity" in the notification.
Ibid.15 This is not to say, of course, that respondents' counsel was not remiss in failing to apprehend the notice. To be
sure, were there any evidence of prejudice to petitioner or
to judicial administration in this case, or any indication at all
of bad faith, we could not say that the Bankruptcy Court
abused its discretion in declining to find the neglect to be
"excusable." In the absence of such a showing, however, we

15 Indeed, one commentator has warned expressly of the deficiency in
the method of notification employed by the Bankruptcy Court here: "Prior
to the adoption of the present bankruptcy rules some bankruptcy courts
placed a time to close the receipt of claims in chapter 11 in the notice sent
to the listed creditors for the first meeting of creditors. This practice
should be strongly discouraged. It conflicts with some of the factual circumstances giving rise to a claim in chapter 11 and can ambush unwitting
creditors. Since creditors are notorious for failing to read all of the boilerplate language in the xeroxed form distributed as the notice of the first
meeting of creditors, counsel for creditors will be wise to double check and
ask for a prompt receipt of the notice from the client or examine the notice
on file in the particular bankruptcy case." R. Aaron, Bankruptcy Law
Fundamentals $ 8.02[7], p. 8-21 (rev. ed. 1991).

conclude that the unusual form of notice employed in thiscase requires a finding that the neglect of respondents' counsel was, under all the circumstances, "excusable."For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is

Affirmed.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice
Souter, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Today the Court replaces the straightforward analysiscommended by the language of Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1)

with a balancing test. Because the Court's approach is in-consistent with the Rule's plain language and unduly complicates the task of courts called upon to apply it, I respect-fully dissent.

I
Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1) provides that, if a party movesfor permission to act after having missed a deadline, the

court "may at any time in its discretion . . . permit the act tobe done where the failure to act was the result of excusable
neglect." This language establishes two requirements thatmust be met before untimely action will be permitted.
First, no relief is available unless the failure to comply withthe deadline "was the result of excusable neglect." Bkrtcy.
Rule 9006(b)(1). Second, the court may withhold relief if itbelieves forbearance inappropriate; the statute does not

re-quire the court to forgive every omission caused by excusable neglect, but states that the court "may" grant relief"in its discretion." Ibid. (emphasis added). Thus, the court
must at the threshold determine its authority to allow un-timely action by asking whether the failure to meet the deadline resulted from excusable neglect; if the answer is yes,
then the court should consider the equities and decidewhether to excuse the error.

Instead of following the plain meaning of the Rule andexamining this case in these two steps, the Court employs a

multifactor balancing test covering numerous equitable con-siderations, including (and perhaps not limited to) "the danger of prejudice to the debtor, the length of the delay andits potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for
the delay, . . . and whether the movant acted in good faith."
Ante, at 395. But Rule 9006(b) does not simply commandcourts to permit late filing whenever it would be "equitable"

in light of all the circumstances. Rather, it establishes thatthe courts may exercise their discretion in accord with the
equities only if the failure to meet the deadline resulted fromexcusable neglect in the first place. Whether the failure resulted from excusable neglect depends on the nature of the
omission itself, both in terms of cause and culpability. Consequently, until the reason for the omission is determined to
be sufficiently blameless, the consequences of the failure,
such as the effect on the parties or the impact on the judicial
system, are not relevant. In re Vertientes, Ltd., 845 F. 2d
57, 60 (CA3 1988) ("The court has no discretion to grant an
extension simply because no prejudice would result, or for
any other equitable reason"); In re South Atlantic Financial
Corp., 767 F. 2d 814, 819 (CA11 1985) (The focus of the Rule
is on the omission and the reasons therefor rather than on
the effect on others), cert. denied, 475 U. S. 1015 (1986); see
also Maressa v. A. H. Robins Co., 839 F. 2d 220, 221 (CA4
1988) (no exception to claim filing deadlines based on general
equitable principles).

Although the Court pays lipservice to the existence of a
threshold determination regarding excusable neglect, see
ante, at 382 ("Rule 9006(b)(1) empowers a bankruptcy court
to permit a late filing if the movant's failure to comply with
an earlier deadline `was the result of excusable neglect' "),
it holds that the threshold question is "at bottom an equitable one." Ante, at 395. Our case law is to the contrary.

In Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871
(1990), we applied the virtually identical language of Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b). Under that Rule, as under

this one, a court may not permit untimely filing unless it"find[s] as a substantive matter . . . that the failure to file on

time `was the result of excusable neglect.' " 497 U. S., at897. Characterizing that "obstacle" as "the greatest of all,"
ibid., we examined the reasons for the movant's failure to
make a timely filing. Nowhere in our discussion did wemention the equities or the consequences of the movant's

failure to file. Instead, we concentrated exclusively on theasserted cause of the failure and the movant's culpability.
See ibid.The Court concedes that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
6(b) and Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) have virtually identicallanguage; indeed, it even relies on the former to support its
interpretation of the latter. Ante, at 391-392. Yet the majority provides no reason why we should depart from theanalysis we so recently employed in

Lujan, except to say it
reads that case differently. See ante, at 395, n. 13. Whileit is true that we did not "define" the phrase "excusable neglect" in Lujan, ante, at 395, n. 13, there is no denying thatwe applied that phrase to the facts before us: There is simply
no other explanation for the opinion's discussion of whetherthe movant had overcome that "greatest" of "substantive obstacle[s]," 497 U. S., at 897. But even if Lujan might be read
differently, the majority offers no affirmative reason to be-lieve that the equities

should bear on whether neglect is
"excusable." Instead it states:

"Because Congress has provided no other guideposts for
determining what sorts of neglect will be considered `ex-cusable,' we conclude that the determination is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party's omission." Ante,
at 395.

In my view, Congress has provided "guideposts" as to how
courts should determine whether "neglect will be considered
`excusable.' " The majority simply fails to follow them.

O'Connor, J., dissenting

First is the remaining language of Rule 9006(b)(1) itself, agood portion of which the majority fails to consult. The

Rule, read in its entirety, establishes that the excusable ne-glect determination requires inquiry into causation rather
than consequences: Unless "the failure to act was the result"of the excusable neglect, relief is unavailable. "It is clear
from this language that the focus of [the Rule] is on the mov-ant's actions and the reasons for those actions, not on the
effect that an extension might have on the other parties' po-sitions."

In re South Atlantic Financial Corp., supra, at819. Moreover, Rule 9006(b)(1) indicates that the court

must determine whether the neglect was "excusable" as ofthe moment it occurred rather than in light of facts known
when untimely action is proposed. The Rule authorizes re-lief in cases where the failure "

was" the result of excusableneglect, not as to incidents where the neglect is excusable in

light of current knowledge.The majority also overlooks a second and dispositive
guidepost--the accepted dictionary definition of "excusableneglect." That definition does not incorporate the results
or consequences of a failure to take appropriate and timelyaction; to the contrary, it turns on the cause or reasons
for the failure and the culpability involved. Accordingto Black's Law Dictionary 566 (6th ed. 1990), "excusable
neglect" is:

"[A] failure to take the proper steps at the proper time,not in consequence of the party's own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court,but in consequence of some unexpected or unavoidable
hindrance or accident, or reliance on the care and vigi-lance of his counsel or on promises made by the adverse
party. As used in rule (e. g. Fed. R. Civil P. 6(b)) au-thorizing court to permit an act to be done after expiration of the time within which under the rules such actwas required to be done, where failure to act was the
result of `excusable neglect', quoted phrase is ordinarily

understood to be the act of a reasonably prudent personunder the same circumstances."

Cf. 4A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Proce-dure $ 1165, pp. 480, 482 (2d ed. 1987) ("Excusable neglect [in
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 6(b)] seems to require a demonstrationof good faith on the part of the party seeking an enlargement
and some reasonable basis for noncompliance . . . . Absenta showing along these lines, relief will be denied"). Of
course, we are not bound to accept Black's Law Dictionaryas the authoritative expositor of American law. But if Congress had intended to depart from the accepted meaning ofexcusable neglect--supplementing its exclusive focus on the
reason for the error with an emphasis on its effect--surelyit would have so indicated.

In any event, it is quite unnatural to read the term "excus-able neglect" to mean a variety of neglect that, in light of
subsequent events and all the equities, turns out to be ex-cusable. Not only does such an interpretation suffer from
circularity--excusable neglect becomes the neglect thatthe court in its equitable discretion chooses to excuse--but
it also renders critical language in the Rule superfluous.After all, the majority's interpretation would be no different
if Rule 9006(b) afforded courts discretion to give relief incases of "neglect" rather than "excusable neglect." The
term "neglect" would describe the acceptable level of culpa-bility, see

ante, at 387-395, and the equities still would movethe court's discretionary decision on whether it in fact would

excuse the error once "neglect" was shown. The Court's in-terpretation thus reads the word "excusable" right out of the
Rule. In my view, Congress included the word "excusable"to convey the notion that some types of neglect--at a minimum, the highly culpable and the willful--cannot be for-given, regardless of the consequences.

The Court does recognize one guidepost. It states thatthe requirement of "excusable neglect" should be construed
so as to "deter creditors or other parties from freely ignoring

court-ordered deadlines in the hopes of winning a permissivereprieve under Rule 9006(b)(1)." Ante, at 395. But rather

than concentrating on the types of culpable neglect thatought to be deterred, the majority immediately shifts its
focus to considerations such as the effect of the failure totake timely action, including prejudice to the debtor and the
effect on judicial proceedings. Ibid. If the goal of requir-ing neglect to be "excusable" is to deter culpable noncompliance, the consequences of such noncompliance should beirrelevant. To hold otherwise not only undermines deterrence but excuses the inexcusable.

II
The Court's approach also undermines the interests theBankruptcy Rules seek to promote. Because the majority's

balancing test is indeterminate, its results frequently will becalled into question. Reasonable minds often differ greatly
on what the equities require. This case is a prime example.Applying much the same test the Court applies today, two
courts below held that respondents' neglect was inexcusable.Then the Court of Appeals substituted its view and held otherwise. Today the Court evens the score at two to two.We ought not unnecessarily introduce so much uncertainty
into a routine matter like an "excusable neglect" determina-tion. Nor should we unhesitatingly endorse an approach
that invites litigants to seek redetermination of their proce-dural disputes from four different courts.

Direct application of Rule 9006(b)(1)'s plain language tothis case, in contrast, is straightforward. First, we must examine the failure to act itself and ask if it resulted from ex-cusable neglect. If it did, then the lower court may, in its
discretion, permit untimely action in accord with the equi-ties. But if the failure did not result from excusable neglect,
there is no reason to consider the effects of the failure.That, of course, brings us to the question to which the
majority devotes the bulk of its discussion: whether mere

405Cite as: 507 U. S. 380 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
negligence can qualify as excusable neglect. Ante, at 387-395. As the majority points out,

ante, at 387, the Courts of
Appeals have disagreed on this matter. Some require theomission to result from circumstances beyond counsel's reasonable control. See, e. g., In re South Atlantic Financial
Corp., 767 F. 2d, at 819, and cases cited ante, at 387, n. 3.Others hold that negligence may constitute excusable neglect

but distinguish among different types of negligence. Cf.
Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v. Larson, 827
F. 2d 916, 919 (CA3 1987) ("Excusable neglect" inquiry en-tails a "qualitative distinction between inadvertence which

occurs despite counsel's affirmative efforts to comply and
inadvertence which results from counsel's lack of diligence")
(Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)), cert. denied sub nom. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v. Secretary of
Transp. of Pennsylvania, 484 U. S. 1032 (1988). In my
view, we need not resolve that dispute in this case. Once we
properly clarify the factors that are relevant to the excusable
neglect determination, the Bankruptcy Court's findings compel the conclusion that respondents' neglect was inexcusable
under any standard.

The Bankruptcy Court expressly found that respondents'
former counsel's failure to file a timely proof of claim resulted
from negligence and, to some degree, an attitude of "indifference" toward the deadline. App. 172a. In addition, the
court noted that the client, a sophisticated business person
and an active participant in the bankruptcy proceedings, had
received actual notice of, and was aware of, the deadline.
Id., at 171a. Thus, this is not a case of a clerical or other
minor error yielding an untoward result despite counsel's
best efforts; it is a case in which counsel simply failed to look
after his business properly, even if that failure was not the
result of bad faith.

The Court of Appeals held the neglect excusable nonetheless for two reasons. First, it thought it inequitable to saddle the client with the mistakes of its attorney. The Court

507us2$46J 11-19-96 16:11:30 PAGES OPINPGT
406 PIONEER INVESTMENT SERVICES CO. v. BRUNSWICK

ASSOCIATES LTD. PARTNERSHIP

O'Connor, J., dissenting

today properly rejects that rationale. Ante, at 396-397.The second reason offered by the Court of Appeals was that

the notice containing the deadline was incorporated in a doc-ument entitled "Notice for Meeting of Creditors." That designation, the court explained, was not enough to put those
without extensive bankruptcy experience on notice that the"bar date" at the end of the notice was the final date for

filing proofs of claims. In re Pioneer Investment Services
Co., 943 F. 2d 673, 678 (CA6 1991). In addition, the court
noted that use of the term "bar date" to designate the dead-line for filing a proof of claim was "dramatic[ally] ambigu[ous]" since there are many bar dates in bankruptcy, not all
of them for the filing of proofs of claims. Ibid. The Court
today signals its agreement. Ante, at 398, and n. 15. The
majority and the Court of Appeals may be correct that the
form of notice was unorthodox; they also may be correct in
asserting that, if the inadequacy of notice caused respondents to miss the deadline, respondents' failure was the result
of "excusable neglect." But they are not correct in asserting that respondents' former lawyer overlooked the deadline
"as a result of " the unorthodox form of notice. The Bankruptcy Court made no such finding. Nor did it find that the
notice's ambiguity somehow led counsel astray. On the contrary, the Bankruptcy Court found that both counsel and client had actual notice of the deadline and that the cause of
their failure to file on time was indifference and negligence.
App. 172a.

To be sure, we would not be obligated to accept those findings if they were not supported by the record. But they are
supported by the record. Indeed, in a commendable display
of candor, respondents' former counsel admitted that the
"foul-up" was "particularly" his own. Id., at 72a. Accord,
id., at 112a ("[T]he foul-up I can't lay to the clients' shoes
because it really is probably mine"). There is no indication
that he blamed his error on petitioner's form of notice.
Rather, he appealed to the Bankruptcy Court's sense of fair507us2$46J 11-19-96 16:11:30 PAGES OPINPGT

407Cite as: 507 U. S. 380 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
ness, arguing that it would be inequitable to penalize hisclient so greatly where the "delay was occasioned not by [the

client], but by its counsel." Id., at 73a. Accord, id., at102(a) ("[U]nder all the circumstances, we think it would be
unfair and inequitable to visit the sins of the lawyer on the
client"); id., at 112a (Although the foul-up was respondents'attorney's, given "the lack of prejudice [and] the totality of

all the circumstances, [it would be] inherently inequitable tovisit the sins on the client for this situation").

Perhaps it would have been desirable for the BankruptcyCourt to make a specific factual finding on whether the unorthodox form of notice actually caused respondents' former
counsel to miss the deadline. Given that respondents' lawyer offered no reason why he overlooked the bar date, it is
not inconceivable that the notice's unorthodoxy led him
astray. Id., at 57a (no recollection of seeing the order setting the deadline); id., at 103a (same). But if there is uncertainty, the answer is to remand to the Bankruptcy Court for
appropriate factual findings. Based on the current state of
the record and the findings the Bankruptcy Court did make,
I cannot accept the majority's finding that counsel's failure
in fact resulted from the inadequacy of notice.

Respondents' former counsel's error may represent a relatively unaggravated instance of negligence. He did not miss
deadlines repeatedly despite clear warnings. Nor did he act
in bad faith. But respondents, their former lawyer, the
Court of Appeals, and the majority today have all failed to
produce a reasonable explanation for this rather major error.
More important still, the Bankruptcy Court did explain the
error. It found that respondents' failure to meet the deadline resulted at least in part from counsel's "indifference."
The majority offers no reason for ignoring that finding.
Even accepting the conclusion that excusable neglect may
cover some instances of negligence, indifference falls outside
the range of the "excusable." Because the failure to act in
this case did not result from excusable neglect, there is no

occasion to consider whether the Bankruptcy Court properly
exercised its discretion in light of the equities; respondents
were ineligible for relief in any event.

The Court's only response is that, even if one focuses exclusively on the nature of the error and why it occurred, the
parties can still litigate the Rule's application. Ante, at 395-
396, n. 14. But that objection can be made to any approach;
courts always must apply law to facts. The point is that
following the plain language of Rule 9006(b)(1) renders the
law's application both easier and more certain. A determination that a party missed the filing deadline on account of
"indifference" or some other reason is not as "susceptible of
litigation," ibid., as the result of multifactor balancing. The
determination is factual and, as such, may be overturned on
review only if clearly erroneous. In fact, no one--neither
the parties nor any of the many courts that have reviewed
this case--has suggested that there was clear error here.
Rather, in this case, as in most others like it, the Bankruptcy
Court's findings are more than adequately supported by the
record.

Indeed, the majority succeeds in circumventing the finding
of "indifference" only by ignoring it, concentrating instead
on other considerations in the multifactor test. The Court's
technique will no doubt prove instructive to anyone appealing an excusable neglect determination in the future, for it
highlights the indeterminacy of the test: A simple shift in
focus from one factor to another--here, from cause to effects--shifts the balance and the result. The approach required by the Rule itself, in contrast, precludes that slippery
tactic. At the threshold, there is but one question on which
to focus: the reason the deadline was missed. Contrary to
the Court's assertion, ibid., that singular focus does not require us to hold today that all incidents of negligence are
inexcusable. We need hold only that indifference is inexcusable. That, I would have thought, goes without saying.

III
When courts depart from the language of a congressionalcommand, they often create unintended difficulties in the

process. This case, I fear, may prove no exception. Themajority's single-step, multifactor, equitable balancing approach to "excusable neglect" is contrary to the language ofRule 9006(b) and inconsistent with sensible notions of judicial
economy. Its indeterminacy not only renders consistentapplication unlikely but also invites unproductive recourse
to appeal. Such consequences are especially unfortunatein the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. An entity in bankruptcy can ill afford to waste resources on litigation; everydollar spent on lawyers is a dollar creditors will never see.
Congress established in Rule 9006(b) the inquiry that shouldbe made when courts contemplate permitting untimely action. Under the approach commended by that Rule, re-spondents are barred from filing an untimely proof of claim
because its omission resulted from a neglect that, on thisrecord, was simply inexcusable; the equities, no matter how
compelling, cannot propel respondents over that hurdle. Itherefore respectfully dissent.

CITY OF CINCINNATI v. DISCOVERY NETWORK,INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 91-1200. Argued November 9, 1992--Decided March 24, 1993
In 1989, petitioner city authorized respondent companies to place 62 freestanding newsracks on public property for the purpose of distributing
free magazines that consisted primarily of advertisements for respondents' services. In 1990, motivated by its interest in the safety and
attractive appearance of its streets and sidewalks, the city revoked
respondents' permits on the ground that the magazines were "commercial handbill[s]," whose distribution on public property was prohibited
by a pre-existing ordinance. In respondents' ensuing lawsuit, the
District Court concluded that this categorical ban violated the First
Amendment under the "reasonable fit" standard applied to the regulation of commercial speech in Board of Trustees of State University of
N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The city's selective and categorical ban on the distribution, via

newsrack, of "commercial handbills" is not consistent with the dictates
of the First Amendment. Pp. 416-431.

(a) The record amply supports the conclusion that the city has not
met its burden of establishing a "reasonable fit" between its legitimate
interests in safety and esthetics and the means it chose to serve those
interests. The ordinance's outdated prohibition of handbill distribution
was enacted long before any concern about newsracks developed, for
the apparent purpose of preventing the kind of visual blight caused by
littering, rather than any harm associated with permanent, freestanding dispensing devices. The fact that the city failed to address its
recently developed concern about newsracks by regulating their size,
shape, appearance, or number indicates that it has not "carefully calculated" the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition. See Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. The lower courts
correctly ruled that the benefit to be derived from the removal of 62
newsracks out of a total of 1,500-2,000 on public property was small.
Pp. 416-418.

(b) The Court rejects the city's argument that, because every decrease in the overall number of newsracks on its sidewalks necessarily
effects an increase in safety and an improvement in the attractiveness
of the cityscape, there is a close fit between its ban on newsracks

dispensing "commercial handbills" and its interests in safety and esthetics. This argument is premised upon the distinction the city has drawn
between commercial speech such as respondents', which is viewed as
having only a low value, and the assertedly more valuable noncommercial speech of "newspapers," whose distribution on public land is specifically authorized by separate provisions of the city code. The argument attaches more importance to that distinction than the Court's
cases warrant and seriously underestimates the value of commercial
speech. Moreover, because commercial and noncommercial publications are equally responsible for the safety concerns and visual blight
that motivated the city, the distinction bears no relationship whatsoever
to the admittedly legitimate interests asserted by the city and is an
impermissible means of responding to those interests. Thus, on this
record, the city has failed to make a showing that would justify its
differential treatment of the two types of newsracks. Pp. 418-428.

(c) Because the city's regulation of newsracks is predicated on the
difference in content between ordinary newspapers and commercial
speech, it is not content neutral and cannot qualify as a valid time,
place, or manner restriction on protected speech. See, e. g., Ward v.
Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791. Pp. 428-431.

412 CINCINNATI v. DISCOVERY NETWORK, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Motivated by its interest in the safety and attractive ap-pearance of its streets and sidewalks, the city of Cincinnati

has refused to allow respondents to distribute their commer-cial publications through freestanding newsracks located on
public property. The question presented is whether this re-fusal is consistent with the First Amendment.

1 In agreement with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, wehold that it is not.

I
Respondent Discovery Network, Inc., is engaged in thebusiness of providing adult educational, recreational, and social programs to individuals in the Cincinnati area. It ad-vertises those programs in a free magazine that it publishes
nine times a year. Although these magazines consist pri-marily of promotional material pertaining to Discovery's
courses, they also include some information about currentevents of general interest. Approximately one-third of
these magazines are distributed through the 38 newsracksthat the city authorized Discovery to place on public property in 1989.Respondent Harmon Publishing Company, Inc., publishes
and distributes a free magazine that advertises real estatefor sale at various locations throughout the United States.
The magazine contains listings and photographs of available
Stewart; and for the Washington Legal Foundation by Charles Fried,
Richard Willard, Daniel J. Popeo, and Richard A. Samp.

Briefs of amici curiae were filed for the City of New York by O. Peter
Sherwood, Leonard Koerner, and Paul T. Rephen; and for the American

1 The First Amendment provides, in part: "Congress shall make no

law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . . ." The Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been construed to
make this prohibition applicable to state action. See, e. g., Stromberg v.
California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931); Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938).

residential properties in the greater Cincinnati area, and
also includes some information about interest rates, market
trends, and other real estate matters. In 1989, Harmon
received the city's permission to install 24 newsracks at
approved locations. About 15% of its distribution in the
Cincinnati area is through those devices.

In March 1990, the city's Director of Public Works notified
each of the respondents that its permit to use dispensing
devices on public property was revoked, and ordered the
newsracks removed within 30 days. Each notice explained
that respondent's publication was a "commercial handbill"
within the meaning of $ 714-1-C of the Municipal Code 2 and
therefore $ 714-23 of the code 3 prohibited its distribution on
public property. Respondents were granted administrative
hearings and review by the Sidewalk Appeals Committee.
Although the Committee did not modify the city's position,

2 That section provides:
" `Commercial Handbill' shall mean any printed or written matter, dodger,
circular, leaflet, pamphlet, paper, booklet or any other printed or otherwise reproduced original or copies of any matter of literature:

"(a) Which advertises for sale any merchandise, product, commodity or
thing; or

"(b) Which directs attention to any business or mercantile or commercial establishment, or other activity, for the purpose of directly promoting
the interest thereof by sales; or

"(c) Which directs attention to or advertises any meeting, theatrical
performance, exhibition or event of any kind for which an admission fee
is charged for the purpose of private gain or profit." Cincinnati Municipal Code $ 714-1-C (1992).

3 That section provides:

"No person shall throw or deposit any commercial or non-commercial
handbill in or upon any sidewalk, street or other public place within the
city. Nor shall any person hand out or distribute or sell any commercial
handbill in any public place. Provided, however, that it shall not be
unlawful on any sidewalk, street or other public place within the city for
any person to hand out or distribute, without charge to the receiver
thereof, any non-commercial handbill to any person willing to accept it,
except within or around the city hall building." $ 714-23.

Opinion of the Court
it agreed to allow the dispensing devices to remain in placepending a judicial determination of the constitutionality of

its prohibition. Respondents then commenced this litiga-tion in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Ohio.After an evidentiary hearing the District Court concluded
that "the regulatory scheme advanced by the City of Cincin-nati completely prohibiting the distribution of commercial
handbills on the public right of way violates the FirstAmendment."

4 The court found that both publications were

"commercial speech" entitled to First Amendment protection because they concerned lawful activity and were notmisleading. While it recognized that a city "may regulate

publication dispensing devices pursuant to its substantial in-terest in promoting safety and esthetics on or about the
public right of way," 5 the District Court held, relying on
Board of Trustees of State University of N. Y. v. Fox, 492
U. S. 469 (1989), that the city had the burden of establishing
"a reasonable `fit' between the legislature's ends and themeans chosen to accomplish those ends." App. to Pet. for

Cert. 23a. (quoting Fox, 492 U. S., at 480). It explainedthat the "fit" in this case was unreasonable because the
number of newsracks dispensing commercial handbills was"minute" compared with the total number (1,500-2,000) on
the public right of way, and because they affected publicsafety in only a minimal way. Moreover, the practices in
other communities indicated that the city's safety and esthetic interests could be adequately protected "by regulatingthe size, shape, number or placement of such devices."

Opinion of the Court
On appeal, the city argued that since a number of courtshad held that a complete ban on the use of newsracks dispensing traditional newspapers would be unconstitutional,7and that the "Constitution . . . accords a lesser protection to
commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteedexpression,"

Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Pub-lic Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 563 (1980), its preferential treatment of newspapers over commercial publica-tions was a permissible method of serving its legitimate interest in ensuring safe streets and regulating visual blight.8The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the lesser status of commercial speech is relevant only when its regulationwas designed either to prevent false or misleading advertising, or to alleviate distinctive adverse effects of the specificspeech at issue. Because Cincinnati sought to regulate only
the "manner" in which respondents' publications were distributed, as opposed to their content or any harm caused bytheir content, the court reasoned that respondents' publications had "high value" for purposes of the Fox "reasonablefit" test. 946 F. 2d 464, 471 (CA6 1991) (italics omitted).
Applying that test, the Court of Appeals agreed with theDistrict Court that the burden placed on speech "cannot be
justified by the paltry gains in safety and beauty achievedby the ordinance."

7 See Sentinel Communications Co. v. Watts, 936 F. 2d 1189, 1196-1197
(CA11 1991), and cases cited therein.

8 In the words of the Court of Appeals:

"This `lesser protection' afforded commercial speech is crucial to Cincinnati's argument on appeal. Cincinnati argues that placing the entire burden of achieving its goal of safer streets and a more harmonious landscape
on commercial speech is justified by this lesser protection." 946 F. 2d
464, 469 (CA6 1991). See also id., at 471 ("The [city's] defense of that
ordinance rests solely on the low value allegedly accorded to commercial
speech in general").

9 The Court of Appeals also noted that the general ban on the distribution of handbills had been on the books long before the newsrack problem
arose. Id., at 473.

416 CINCINNATI v. DISCOVERY NETWORK, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Appeals decision, together with the dramatic growth in theuse of newsracks throughout the country,

10 prompted our

grant of certiorari. 503 U. S. 918 (1992).

II
There is no claim in this case that there is anything unlaw-ful or misleading about the contents of respondents' publications. Moreover, respondents do not challenge their char-acterization as "commercial speech." Nor do respondents
question the substantiality of the city's interest in safety andesthetics. It was, therefore, proper for the District Court
and the Court of Appeals to judge the validity of the city'sprohibition under the standards we set forth in Central Hudson and Fox.11 It was the city's burden to establish a "rea-sonable fit" between its legitimate interests in safety and
esthetics and its choice of a limited and selective prohibitionof newsracks as the means chosen to serve those interests.

12

10 We are advised that almost half of the single copy sales of newspapers
are now distributed through newsracks. See Brief for American Newspaper Publishers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 2.

11 While the Court of Appeals ultimately applied the standards set forth

in Central Hudson and Fox, its analysis at least suggested that those
standards might not apply to the type of regulation at issue in this case.
For if commercial speech is entitled to "lesser protection" only when the
regulation is aimed at either the content of the speech or the particular
adverse effects stemming from that content, it would seem to follow that a
regulation that is not so directed should be evaluated under the standards
applicable to regulations on fully protected speech, not the more lenient
standards by which we judge regulations on commercial speech. Because
we conclude that Cincinnati's ban on commercial newsracks cannot withstand scrutiny under Central Hudson and Fox, we need not decide
whether that policy should be subjected to more exacting review.

12 As we stated in Fox:

"[W]hile we have insisted that the free flow of commercial information is
valuable enough to justify imposing on would-be regulators the costs of
distinguishing . . . the harmless from the harmful, we have not gone
so far as to impose upon them the burden of demonstrating that the
distinguishment is 100% complete, or that the manner of restriction is
absolutely the least severe that will achieve the desired end. What our

417Cite as: 507 U. S. 410 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
There is ample support in the record for the conclusionthat the city did not "establish the reasonable fit we require." Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. The ordinance on which itrelied was an outdated prohibition against the distribution
of any commercial handbills on public property. It was en-acted long before any concern about newsracks developed.
Its apparent purpose was to prevent the kind of visual blightcaused by littering, rather than any harm associated with
permanent, freestanding dispensing devices. The fact thatthe city failed to address its recently developed concern
about newsracks by regulating their size, shape, appear-ance, or number indicates that it has not "carefully calculated" the costs and benefits associated with the burden onspeech imposed by its prohibition.

13 The benefit to be dedecisions require is a `fit' between the legislature's ends and the means
chosen to accomplish those ends--a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but
reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but
one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served; that employs not
necessarily the least restrictive means but, as we have put it in the other
contexts discussed above, a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective. Within those bounds we leave it to governmental decisionmakers to judge what manner of regulation may best be employed. . . .

"Here we require the government goal to be substantial, and the cost to
be carefully calculated. Moreover, since the State bears the burden of
justifying its restrictions, it must affirmatively establish the reasonable
fit we require." 492 U. S., at 480 (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted).

13 We reject the city's argument that the lower courts' and our consideration of alternative, less drastic measures by which the city could effectuate its interests in safety and esthetics somehow violates Fox's holding
that regulations on commercial speech are not subject to "leastrestrictive-means" analysis. To repeat, see n. 12, supra, while we have
rejected the "least-restrictive-means" test for judging restrictions on
commercial speech, so too have we rejected mere rational-basis review.
A regulation need not be "absolutely the least severe that will achieve
the desired end," Fox, 492 U. S., at 480, but if there are numerous and
obvious less-burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial
speech, that is certainly a relevant consideration in determining whether

the "fit" between ends and means is reasonable.

Opinion of the Court
rived from the removal of 62 newsracks while about 1,500-2,000 remain in place was considered "minute" by the District Court and "paltry" by the Court of Appeals. We sharetheir evaluation of the "fit" between the city's goal and its
method of achieving it.In seeking reversal, the city argues that it is wrong to
focus attention on the relatively small number of newsracksaffected by its prohibition, because the city's central concern
is with the overall number of newsracks on its sidewalks,rather than with the unattractive appearance of a handful
of dispensing devices. It contends, first, that a categoricalprohibition on the use of newsracks to disseminate commercial messages burdens no more speech than is necessary tofurther its interest in limiting the number of newsracks;
and, second, that the prohibition is a valid "time, place, andmanner" regulation because it is content neutral and leaves
open ample alternative channels of communication. Weconsider these arguments in turn.

III
The city argues that there is a close fit between its ban onnewsracks dispensing "commercial handbills" and its interests in safety and esthetics because every decrease in thenumber of such dispensing devices necessarily effects an
increase in safety and an improvement in the attractivenessof the cityscape. In the city's view, the prohibition is thus
entirely related to its legitimate interests in safety andesthetics.

We accept the validity of the city's proposition, but con-sider it an insufficient justification for the discrimination
against respondents' use of newsracks that are no moreharmful than the permitted newsracks, and have only a minimal impact on the overall number of newsracks on the city'ssidewalks. The major premise supporting the city's argument is the proposition that commercial speech has only a

419Cite as: 507 U. S. 410 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
low value. Based on that premise, the city contends that
the fact that assertedly more valuable publications are allowed to use newsracks does not undermine its judgment
that its esthetic and safety interests are stronger than the
interest in allowing commercial speakers to have similar access to the reading public.

We cannot agree. In our view, the city's argument attaches more importance to the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech than our cases warrant and
seriously underestimates the value of commercial speech.

This very case illustrates the difficulty of drawing bright
lines that will clearly cabin commercial speech in a distinct
category. For respondents' publications share important
characteristics with the publications that the city classifies
as "newspapers." Particularly, they are "commercial handbills" within the meaning of $ 714-1-C of the city's code
because they contain advertising, a feature that apparently
also places ordinary newspapers within the same category.14
Separate provisions in the code specifically authorize the distribution of "newspapers" on the public right of way, but
that term is not defined.15 Presumably, respondents' publications do not qualify as newspapers because an examination
of their content discloses a higher ratio of advertising to
other text, such as news and feature stories, than is found
in the exempted publications.16 Indeed, Cincinnati's City

14 See n. 2, supra.
15 Cincinnati Municipal Code $ 862-1 (1992) provides:

"Permission is hereby granted to any person or persons lawfully authorized to engage in the business of selling newspapers to occupy space on
the sidewalks of city streets for selling newspapers, either in the morning
or afternoon, where permission has been obtained from the owner or
tenant of the adjoining building."

16 Some ordinary newspapers try to maintain a ratio of 70% advertising

to 30% editorial content. See generally C. Fink, Strategic Newspaper
Management 43 (1988).

Opinion of the Court
Manager has determined that publications that qualify asnewspapers and therefore can be distributed by newsrack

are those that are published daily and/or weekly and "pri-marily presen[t] coverage of, and commentary on, current
events." App. 230 (emphasis added).The absence of a categorical definition of the difference
between "newspapers" and "commercial handbills" in thecity's code is also a characteristic of our opinions considering the constitutionality of regulations of commercial speech.Fifty years ago, we concluded that the distribution of a commercial handbill was unprotected by the First Amendment,even though half of its content consisted of political protest.
Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52 (1942). A few yearslater, over Justice Black's dissent, we held that the "commercial feature" of door-to-door solicitation of magazine sub-scriptions was a sufficient reason for denying First Amendment protection to that activity. Breard v. Alexandria, 341U. S. 622 (1951). Subsequent opinions, however, recognized that important commercial attributes of various formsof communication do not qualify their entitlement to constitutional protection. Thus, in Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S.748 (1976), we explained:

"We begin with several propositions that already aresettled or beyond serious dispute. It is clear, for example, that speech does not lose its First Amendmentprotection because money is spent to project it, as in a
paid advertisement of one form or another. Buckley v.

Amendment. Id., at 762.17

17 Justice Blackmun, writing for the Court in Bates v. State Bar of
Arizona, 433 U. S. 350 (1977), summarized the reasons for extending First
Amendment protection to "core" commercial speech:

"The listener's interest [in commercial speech] is substantial: the consumer's concern for the free flow of commercial speech often may be far
keener than his concern for urgent political dialogue. Moreover, significant societal interests are served by such speech. Advertising, though
entirely commercial, may often carry information of import to significant
issues of the day. See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975). And
commercial speech serves to inform the public of the availability, nature,
and prices of products and services, and thus performs an indispensable
role in the allocation of resources in a free enterprise system. See FTC

In later opinions we have stated that speech proposing acommercial transaction is entitled to lesser protection than

other constitutionally guaranteed expression. See Ohralikv. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 455-456 (1978). We
have also suggested that such lesser protection was ap-propriate for a somewhat larger category of commercial
speech--"that is, expression related solely to the economicinterests of the speaker and its audience."

Most of the appellee's mailings consisted primarilyof price and quantity information, and thus fell "within the
core notion of commercial speech--`speech which does "nomore than propose a commercial transaction." ' "

762, in turn quoting Pittsburgh Press Co. v. PittsburghComm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 385 (1973)).

Of course, we were not the first to recognize the value of commercial
speech:

mind, and are worthy of being enumerated among the many methods of
awakening and maintaining the popular attention, with which more modern times, beyond all preceding example, abound.' " D. Boorstin, The

Account of Newspapers (2d ed. 1810).

label for informational pamphlets that were concededly ad-vertisements referring to a specific product, and concluded

that they also were "commercial speech." 463 U. S., at66-67. It is noteworthy that in reaching that conclusion we
did not simply apply the broader definition of commercialspeech advanced in

Central Hudson--a definition that obvi-ously would have encompassed the mailings--but rather "examined [them] carefully to ensure that speech deserving ofgreater constitutional protection is not inadvertently suppressed." 463 U. S., at 66.18 In Fox, we described the cate-gory even more narrowly, by characterizing the proposal of
a commercial transaction as "the test for identifying commer-cial speech." 492 U. S., at 473-474 (emphasis added).

Under the Fox test it is clear that much of the material inordinary newspapers is commercial speech and, conversely,
that the editorial content in respondents' promotional publi-cations is not what we have described as "core" commercial
speech. There is no doubt a "commonsense" basis for distin-guishing between the two, but under both the city's code and
our cases the difference is a matter of degree.19

18 When the Court first advanced the broader definition of commercial
speech, a similar concern had been expressed. See Central Hudson, 447
U. S., at 579 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).

19 We note that because Cincinnati's regulatory scheme depends on a

governmental determination as to whether a particular publication is a
"commercial handbill" or a "newspaper," it raises some of the same concerns as the newsrack ordinance struck down in Lakewood v. Plain Dealer
Publishing Co., 486 U. S. 750 (1988). The ordinance at issue in Lakewood
vested in the mayor authority to grant or deny a newspaper's application
for a newsrack permit, but contained no explicit limit on the scope of the
mayor's discretion. The Court struck down the ordinance, reasoning

that a licensing scheme that vests such unbridled discretion in a government official may result in either content or viewpoint censorship. Id.,
at 757, 769-770. Similarly, because the distinction between a "newspaper" and a "commercial handbill" is by no means clear--as noted above,
the city deems a "newspaper" as a publication "primarily presenting
coverage of, and commentary on, current events," App. 230 (emphasis
added)--the responsibility for distinguishing between the two carries with

Opinion of the Court
Nevertheless, for the purpose of deciding this case, we assume that all of the speech barred from Cincinnati's sidewalks is what we have labeled "core" commercial speech and
that no such speech is found in publications that are allowed
to use newsracks. We nonetheless agree with the Court of
Appeals that Cincinnati's actions in this case run afoul of the
First Amendment. Not only does Cincinnati's categorical
ban on commercial newsracks place too much importance
on the distinction between commercial and noncommercial
speech, but in this case, the distinction bears no relationship
whatsoever to the particular interests that the city has asserted. It is therefore an impermissible means of responding to the city's admittedly legitimate interests. Cf. Simon
& Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims
Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 120 (1991) (distinction drawn by Son of
Sam law between income derived from criminal's descriptions of his crime and other sources "has nothing to do with"

noncommercial "entail[s] a substantial exercise of discretion by a city's
official" and therefore "presents a real danger of curtailing noncommercial
speech in the guise of regulating commercial speech"). Cf. Arkansas

The city has asserted an interest in esthetics, but re-spondent publishers' newsracks are no greater an eyesore

than the newsracks permitted to remain on Cincinnati's sidewalks. Each newsrack, whether containing "newspapers"
or "commercial handbills," is equally unattractive. While
there was some testimony in the District Court that commercial publications are distinct from noncommercial publications in their capacity to proliferate, the evidence of such
was exceedingly weak, the Court of Appeals discounted it,
946 F. 2d, at 466-467, and n. 3, and Cincinnati does not
reassert that particular argument in this Court. As we

20 Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490 (1981), upon which the
city heavily relies, is not to the contrary. In that case, a plurality of
the Court found as a permissible restriction on commercial speech a city
ordinance that, for the most part, banned outdoor "offsite" advertising
billboards, but permitted "onsite" advertising signs identifying the owner
of the premises and the goods sold or manufactured on the site. Id., at
494, 503. Unlike this case, which involves discrimination between commercial and noncommercial speech, the "offsite-onsite" distinction involved disparate treatment of two types of commercial speech. Only the
onsite signs served both the commercial and public interest in guiding
potential visitors to their intended destinations; moreover, the plurality
concluded that a "city may believe that offsite advertising, with its periodically changing content, presents a more acute problem than does onsite
advertising," id., at 511-512. Neither of these bases has any application
to the disparate treatment of newsracks in this case.

The Chief Justice is correct that seven Justices in the Metromedia
case were of the view that San Diego could completely ban offsite commercial billboards for reasons unrelated to the content of those billboards.
Post, at 444. Those seven Justices did not say, however, that San Diego
could distinguish between commercial and noncommercial offsite billboards that cause the same esthetic and safety concerns. That question
was not presented in Metromedia, for the regulation at issue in that
case did not draw a distinction between commercial and noncommercial
offsite billboards; with a few exceptions, it essentially banned all offsite
billboards.

Opinion of the Court
have explained, the city's primary concern, as argued to us,is with the aggregate number of newsracks on its streets.

On that score, however, all newsracks, regardless of whetherthey contain commercial or noncommercial publications, are
equally at fault. In fact, the newspapers are arguably thegreater culprit because of their superior number.

Cincinnati has not asserted an interest in preventingcommercial harms by regulating the information distributed
by respondent publishers' newsracks, which is, of course,the typical reason why commercial speech can be subject
to greater governmental regulation than noncommercialspeech. See,

e. g., Bolger, 463 U. S., at 81 (Stevens, J.,concurring in judgment) ("[T]he commercial aspects of a

message may provide a justification for regulation that is notpresent when the communication has no commercial character"); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S., at 455-456(commercial speech, unlike other varieties of speech, "occurs
in an area traditionally subject to government regulation").21A closer examination of one of the cases we have mentioned, Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products, demonstrates thefallacy of the city's argument that a reasonable fit is established by the mere fact that the entire burden imposed oncommercial speech by its newsrack policy may in some small
way limit the total number of newsracks on Cincinnati's side-walks. Here, the city contends that safety concerns and
visual blight may be addressed by a prohibition that distin21 Moreover, the principal reason for drawing a distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech has little, if any, application to a regulation of their distribution practices. As we explained in Bolger: "Advertisers should not be permitted to immunize false or misleading product
information from government regulation simply by including references
to public issues." 463 U. S., at 68. The interest in preventing commercial
harms justifies more intensive regulation of commercial speech than noncommercial speech even when they are intermingled in the same publications. On the other hand, the interest in protecting the free flow of
information and ideas is still present when such expression is found in a
commercial context.

Opinion of the Court
guishes between commercial and noncommercial publicationsthat are equally responsible for those problems. In

Bolger,
however, in rejecting the Government's reliance on its inter-est in protecting the public from "offensive" speech, "[we]

specifically declined to recognize a distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech that would render thisinterest a sufficient justification for a prohibition of commercial speech." 463 U. S., at 71-72 (citing Carey v. Population
Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 701, n. 28 (1977)).
Moreover, the fact that the regulation "provide[d] only themost limited incremental support for the interest asserted,"

463 U. S., at 73--that it achieved only a "marginal degree ofprotection,"

ibid., for that interest--supported our holding
that the prohibition was invalid. Finally, in Bolger, as in
this case, the burden on commercial speech was imposed bydenying the speaker access to one method of distribution--

there the United States mails, and here the placement ofnewsracks on public property--without interfering with alternative means of access to the audience. As then-Justice
Rehnquist explained in his separate opinion, that fact did
not minimize the significance of the burden:

"[T]he Postal Service argues that Youngs can communicate with the public otherwise than through the mail.[This argument falls] wide of the mark. A prohibition

on the use of the mails is a significant restriction ofFirst Amendment rights. We have noted that ` "[t]he
United States may give up the Post Office when it sees
fit, but while it carries it on the use of the mails is asmuch a part of free speech as the right to use our

tongues." ' Blount v. Rizzi, 400 U. S., at 416, quoting
Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Co. v. Burleson, 255 U. S. 407, 437 (1921) (Holmes, J., dissenting)."
Id., at 79-80 (footnote omitted).

In a similar vein, even if we assume, arguendo, that the
city might entirely prohibit the use of newsracks on public

Opinion of the Court
property, as long as this avenue of communication remains
open, these devices continue to play a significant role in the
dissemination of protected speech.

In the absence of some basis for distinguishing between
"newspapers" and "commercial handbills" that is relevant to
an interest asserted by the city, we are unwilling to recognize Cincinnati's bare assertion that the "low value" of commercial speech is a sufficient justification for its selective
and categorical ban on newsracks dispensing "commercial
handbills." Our holding, however, is narrow. As should
be clear from the above discussion, we do not reach the
question whether, given certain facts and under certain circumstances, a community might be able to justify differential treatment of commercial and noncommercial newsracks.
We simply hold that on this record Cincinnati has failed to
make such a showing. Because the distinction Cincinnati
has drawn has absolutely no bearing on the interests it has
asserted, we have no difficulty concluding, as did the two
courts below, that the city has not established the "fit" between its goals and its chosen means that is required by our
opinion in Fox. It remains to consider the city's argument
that its prohibition is a permissible time, place, and manner
regulation.

IV

The Court has held that government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of engaging
in protected speech provided that they are adequately justified " `without reference to the content of the regulated
speech.' " Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781,
791 (1989), quoting Clark v. Community for Creative NonViolence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984). Thus, a prohibition
against the use of sound trucks emitting "loud and raucous"
noise in residential neighborhoods is permissible if it applies
equally to music, political speech, and advertising. See gen507us2$47F 11-15-96 18:24:30 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
erally Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77 (1949). The city contends that its regulation of newsracks qualifies as such a restriction because the interests in safety and esthetics that
it serves are entirely unrelated to the content of respondents'
publications. Thus, the argument goes, the justification for
the regulation is content neutral.

The argument is unpersuasive because the very basis for
the regulation is the difference in content between ordinary
newspapers and commercial speech. True, there is no evidence that the city has acted with animus toward the ideas
contained within respondents' publications, but just last
Term we expressly rejected the argument that "discriminatory . . . treatment is suspect under the First Amendment
only when the legislature intends to suppress certain ideas."
Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U. S., at 117. Regardless of the mens rea
of the city, it has enacted a sweeping ban on the use of newsracks that distribute "commercial handbills," but not "newspapers." Under the city's newsrack policy, whether any
particular newsrack falls within the ban is determined by
the content of the publication resting inside that newsrack.
Thus, by any commonsense understanding of the term, the
ban in this case is "content based."

Nor are we persuaded that our statements that the test
for whether a regulation is content based turns on the "justification" for the regulation, see, e. g., Ward, 491 U. S., at
791; Clark, 468 U. S., at 293, compel a different conclusion.
We agree with the city that its desire to limit the total
number of newsracks is "justified" by its interests in safety
and esthetics. The city has not, however, limited the number of newsracks; it has limited (to zero) the number of
newsracks distributing commercial publications. As we
have explained, there is no justification for that particular
regulation other than the city's naked assertion that commercial speech has "low value." It is the absence of a neu507us2$47F 11-15-96 18:24:30 PAGES OPINPGT
430 CINCINNATI v. DISCOVERY NETWORK, INC.

Opinion of the Court
tral justification for its selective ban on newsracks thatprevents the city from defending its newsrack policy as

content neutral.By the same reasoning, the city's heavy reliance on

Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986), is misplaced. In Renton, a city ordinance imposed particular zon-ing regulations on movie theaters showing adult films. The

Court recognized that the ordinance did not fall neatly intothe "content-based" or "content-neutral" category in that
"the ordinance treats theaters that specialize in adult filmsdifferently from other kinds of theaters."

Id., at 47. We
upheld the regulation, however, largely because it was justified not by an interest in suppressing adult films, but by the
city's concern for the "secondary effects" of such theaters on
the surrounding neighborhoods. Id., at 47-49. In contrast
to the speech at issue in Renton, there are no secondary
effects attributable to respondent publishers' newsracks that
distinguish them from the newsracks Cincinnati permits to
remain on its sidewalks.

In sum, the city's newsrack policy is neither content
neutral nor, as demonstrated in Part III, supra, "narrowly
tailored." Thus, regardless of whether or not it leaves open
ample alternative channels of communication, it cannot be
justified as a legitimate time, place, or manner restriction
on protected speech.

Cincinnati has enacted a sweeping ban that bars from its
sidewalks a whole class of constitutionally protected speech.
As did the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we
conclude that Cincinnati has failed to justify that policy.
The regulation is not a permissible regulation of commercial
speech, for on this record it is clear that the interests that
Cincinnati has asserted are unrelated to any distinction
between "commercial handbills" and "newspapers." Moreover, because the ban is predicated on the content of the
publications distributed by the subject newsracks, it is not a
valid time, place, or manner restriction on protected speech.

For these reasons, Cincinnati's categorical ban on the dis-tribution, via newsrack, of "commercial handbills" cannot

be squared with the dictates of the First Amendment.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Blackmun, concurring.
I agree that Cincinnati's ban on commercial newsrackscannot withstand scrutiny under Central Hudson Gas &

Electric Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.557 (1980), and

Board of Trustees of State University of N. Y.v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469 (1989), and I therefore join the Court's

opinion. I write separately because I continue to believethat the analysis set forth in Central Hudson and refined
in Fox affords insufficient protection for truthful, noncoer-cive commercial speech concerning lawful activities. In
Central Hudson, I expressed the view that "intermediatescrutiny is appropriate for a restraint on commercial speech
designed to protect consumers from misleading or coercivespeech, or a regulation related to the time, place, or manner
of commercial speech," but not for a regulation that sup-presses truthful commercial speech to serve some other government purpose. 447 U. S., at 573 (opinion concurring injudgment). The present case demonstrates that there is no
reason to treat truthful commercial speech as a class thatis less "valuable" than noncommercial speech. Respondents'
publications, which respectively advertise the availability ofresidential properties and educational opportunities, are unquestionably "valuable" to those who choose to read them,and Cincinnati's ban on commercial newsracks should be subject to the same scrutiny we would apply to a regulationburdening noncommercial speech.

Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 385 (1973).In so holding, the Court focused principally on the First

Amendment interests of the listener. The Court noted that"the particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial information . . . may be as keen, if not keener by far,than his interest in the day's most urgent political debate,"
425 U. S., at 763, and that "the free flow of commercial in-formation is indispensable . . . to the proper allocation of
resources in a free enterprise system . . . [and] to the forma-tion of intelligent opinions as to how that system ought to be
regulated or altered," id., at 765. See also Bates v. State
Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S. 350, 364 (1977).The Court recognized, however, that government may

regulate commercial speech in ways that it may not regulateprotected noncommercial speech. See generally

VirginiaState Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 770-772. Government

may regulate commercial speech to ensure that it is notfalse, deceptive, or misleading, id., at 771-772, and to ensure
that it is not coercive, Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436U. S. 447, 457 (1978). Government also may prohibit commercial speech proposing unlawful activities. Pittsburgh
Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413U. S., at 388. See Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S.,

at 384.1 To permit government regulation on these groundsis consistent with this Court's emphasis on the First Amendment interests of the listener in the commercial speech con-text. A listener has little interest in receiving false, misleading, or deceptive commercial information. See id., at

1 In the context of noncommercial speech, by contrast, this Court has
adopted rules that protect certain false statements of fact and speech
advocating illegal activities. See, e. g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U. S. 254, 279-280 (1964) (liability for false statements regarding public officials may not be imposed without a showing of "actual malice");
Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969) (government may not proscribe advocacy of illegal action "except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to
incite or produce such action").

383 ("[T]he public and private benefits from commercialspeech derive from confidence in its accuracy and reliability"). A listener also has little interest in being coerced intoa purchasing decision. See Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,
436 U. S., at 457 ("[I]n-person solicitation may exert pres-sure and often demands an immediate response, without providing an opportunity for comparison or reflection"). Fur-thermore, to the extent it exists at all, a listener has only
a weak interest in learning about commercial opportuni-ties that the criminal law forbids. In sum, the commercial
speech that this Court had permitted government to regulate or proscribe was commercial speech that did not "serv[e]
individual and societal interests in assuring informed andreliable decisionmaking."

Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,
433 U. S., at 364.So the law stood in 1980 when this Court decided

Central
Hudson and held that all commercial speech was entitledonly to an intermediate level of constitutional protection.

The majority in Central Hudson reviewed the Court's ear-lier commercial speech cases and concluded that the Constitution "accords a lesser protection to commercial speech
than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression." 447U. S., at 563. As a descriptive matter, this statement was

correct, since our cases had recognized that commercialspeech could be regulated on grounds that protected noncommercial speech could not. See n. 1, supra. This "lesserprotection" did not rest, however, on the fact that commercial speech "is of less constitutional moment than other formsof speech," as the

Central Hudson majority asserted. 447
U. S., at 563, n. 5.2 Rather, it reflected the fact that the lis2 Central Hudson's conclusion that commercial speech is less valuable
than noncommercial speech seems to have its roots in an often-quoted
passage from Ohralik: "[W]e . . . have afforded commercial speech a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position

tener's First Amendment interests, from which the protec-tion of commercial speech largely derives, allow for certain

specific kinds of government regulation that would not bepermitted outside the context of commercial speech.

The Central Hudson majority went on to develop a four-part analysis commensurate with the supposed intermediate
status of commercial speech. Under that test, a court re-viewing restrictions on commercial speech must first determine whether the speech concerns a lawful activity and isnot misleading.

3 If the speech does not pass this preliminary threshold, then it is not protected by the First Amend-ment at all.

Id., at 566. If it does pass the preliminarythreshold, then the government is required to show (1) that

the asserted government interest is "substantial," (2) thatthe regulation at issue "directly advances" that interest, and
(3) that the regulation "is not more extensive than is neces-sary to serve that interest."

Ibid. The Court refined thistest in Board of Trustees of State University of N. Y. v. Fox,

492 U. S., at 480, to clarify that a regulation limiting com-mercial speech can, in fact, be more extensive than is necessary to serve the government's interest as long as it is notunreasonably so. This intermediate level of scrutiny is a
far cry from strict scrutiny, under which the governmentinterest must be "compelling" and the regulation "narrowly
tailored" to serve that interest. See, e. g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 657 (1990).In Central Hudson, I concurred only in the Court's judgment because I felt the majority's four-part analysis was
sion." Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978). As I
explain in the text, however, the "limited measure of protection" our cases
had afforded commercial speech reflected the fact that we had allowed
"modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression" and not that we had relegated commercial speech to
a "subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values."

3 Central Hudson's reference to "misleading" speech appears to include

speech that is inherently coercive, such as in-person solicitation. See 447
U. S., at 563, citing Ohralik, 436 U. S., at 464-465.

"not consistent with our prior cases and [did] not provideadequate protection for truthful, nonmisleading, noncoercive

commercial speech." 447 U. S., at 573. I noted: "Permissi-ble restraints on commercial speech have been limited to
measures designed to protect consumers from fraudulent,
misleading, or coercive sales techniques." Id., at 574.Under the analysis adopted by the

Central Hudson majority, misleading and coercive commercial speech and commer-cial speech proposing illegal activities are addressed in the

first prong of the four-part test. Yet commercial speechthat survives the first prong--

i. e., that is not misleading or
coercive and that concerns lawful activities--is entitled only
to an intermediate level of protection. Furthermore, the
"substantial" government interest that Central Hudson requires to justify restrictions on commercial speech does not
have to be related to protecting against deception or coercion, for Central Hudson itself left open the possibility that
the government's substantial interest in energy conservation
might justify a more narrowly drawn restriction on truthful
advertising that promotes energy consumption. See id., at
569-572.

Thus, it is little wonder that when the city of Cincinnati
wanted to remove some newsracks from its streets, it chose
to eliminate all the commercial newsracks first although its
reasons had nothing to do with either the deceptiveness of
particular commercial publications or the particular characteristics of commercial newsracks themselves. First, Cincinnati could rely on this Court's broad statements that commercial speech "is of less constitutional moment than other
forms of speech," id., at 563, n. 5, and occupies a "subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values,"
Ohralik, 436 U. S., at 456. Second, it knew that under Central Hudson its restrictions on commercial speech would be
examined with less enthusiasm and with less exacting scrutiny than any restrictions it might impose on other speech.

The Court wisely rejects Cincinnati's argument that itmay single out commercial speech simply because it is "low
value" speech, see ante, at 428, and on the facts of this caseit is unnecessary to do more. The Court expressly reserves
the question whether regulations not directed at the contentof commercial speech or adverse effects stemming from that
content should be evaluated under the standards applicableto regulations of fully protected speech. Ante, at 416,
n. 11. I believe the Court should answer that question inthe affirmative and hold that truthful, noncoercive commercial speech concerning lawful activities is entitled to fullFirst Amendment protection. As I wrote in

Central Hudson, "intermediate scrutiny is appropriate for a restraint
on commercial speech designed to protect consumers frommisleading or coercive speech, or a regulation related to the

time, place, or manner of commercial speech." 447 U. S., at573.

4 But none of the "commonsense differences," Virginia

State Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771, n. 24, between
commercial and other speech "justify relaxed scrutiny ofrestraints that suppress truthful, nondeceptive, noncoercive

commercial speech." Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 578
(opinion concurring in judgment).

4 I made no mention in Central Hudson of commercial speech proposing
illegal activities, but I do not quarrel with the proposition that government may suppress such speech altogether. See Pittsburgh Press Co. v.
Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 388 (1973). See
also Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S. 350, 384 (1977).

The commercial publications at issue in this case illustrate
the absurdity of treating all commercial speech as less valuable than all noncommercial speech. Respondent Harmon
Publishing Company, Inc., publishes and distributes a free
magazine containing listings and photographs of residential
properties. Like the "For Sale" signs this Court, in Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85 (1977),
held could not be banned, the information contained in Harmon's publication "bear[s] on one of the most important decisions [individuals] have a right to make: where to live and
raise their families." Id., at 96. Respondent Discovery
Network, Inc., advertises the availability of adult educational, recreational, and social programs. Our cases have
consistently recognized the importance of education to the
professional and personal development of the individual.
See, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 493
(1954). The "value" of respondents' commercial speech, at
least to those who receive it, certainly exceeds the value
of the offensive, though political, slogan displayed on the
petitioner's jacket in Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15
(1971).

I think it highly unlikely that according truthful, noncoercive commercial speech the full protection of the First
Amendment will erode the level of that protection. See
post, at 439 (dissenting opinion); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar

Assn., 436 U. S., at 456. I have predicted that "the Court
will never provide child pornography or cigarette advertising the level of protection customarily granted political
speech." See R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 415 (1992)
(opinion concurring in judgment). Yet I do not believe that
protecting truthful advertising will test this Nation's commitment to the First Amendment to any greater extent than
protecting offensive political speech. See, e. g., Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989) (flag burning); National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (Nazi

march through Jewish neighborhood); Cohen v. California,403 U. S. 15 (1971) (profane antiwar slogan). The very fact

that government remains free, in my view, to ensure thatcommercial speech is not deceptive or coercive, to prohibit
commercial speech proposing illegal activities, and to impose
reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on commercialspeech greatly reduces the risk that protecting truthful commercial speech will dilute the level of First Amendment pro-tection for speech generally.

I am heartened by the Court's decision today to reject theextreme extension of

Central Hudson's logic, and I hope the
Court ultimately will come to abandon Central Hudson'sanalysis entirely in favor of one that affords full protection

for truthful, noncoercive commercial speech about lawful
activities.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White
and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Concerned about the safety and esthetics of its streets and
sidewalks, the city of Cincinnati decided to do something
about the proliferation of newsracks on its street corners.
Pursuant to an existing ordinance prohibiting the distribution of "commercial handbills" on public property, the city
ordered respondents Discovery Network, Inc., and Harmon
Publishing Company, Inc., to remove their newsracks from
its sidewalks within 30 days. Respondents publish and distribute free of charge magazines that consist principally of
commercial speech. Together their publications account for
62 of the 1,500-2,000 newsracks that clutter Cincinnati's
street corners. Because the city chose to address its newsrack problem by banning only those newsracks that disseminate commercial handbills, rather than regulating all
newsracks (including those that disseminate traditional
newspapers) alike, the Court holds that its actions violate
the First Amendment to the Constitution. I believe this
result is inconsistent with prior precedent.

"Our jurisprudence has emphasized that `commercialspeech [enjoys] a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale of FirstAmendment values,' and is subject to `modes of regulation

(1983). We have advanced several reasons for this treat-ment, among which is that commercial speech is more durable than other types of speech, since it is "the offspring ofeconomic self-interest."

such as political expression. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.

of speech." Ohralik, supra, at 456.In

Central Hudson, we set forth the test for analyzingthe permissibility of restrictions on commercial speech as

follows:

"At the outset, we must determine whether the expres-sion is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at leastmust concern lawful activity and not be misleading.
Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental in-terest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive
answers, we must determine whether the regulation

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary

to serve that interest." 447 U. S., at 566.
I agree with the Court that the city's prohibition againstrespondents' newsracks is properly analyzed under

CentralHudson, see ante, at 416, but differ as to the result this analysis should produce.As the Court points out, "respondents do not challenge
their characterization as `commercial speech,' " and "[t]hereis no claim in this case that there is anything unlawful or
misleading about the contents of respondents' publications."
Ibid. "Nor do respondents question the substantiality ofthe city's interest in safety and esthetics." Ibid. This case

turns, then, on the application of the last part of the CentralHudson analysis. Although the Court does not say so,
there can be no question that Cincinnati's prohibition againstrespondents' newsracks "directly advances" its safety and
esthetic interests because, if enforced, the city's policy willdecrease the number of newsracks on its street corners.
This leaves the question whether the city's prohibition is"more extensive than necessary" to serve its interests, or,
as we elaborated in Fox, whether there is a "reasonable fit"between the city's desired ends and the means it has chosen
to accomplish those ends. See 492 U. S., at 480. Becausethe city's "commercial handbill" ordinance was not enacted
specifically to address the problems caused by newsracks,and, if enforced, the city's prohibition against respondents'
newsracks would result in the removal of only 62 newsracksfrom its street corners, the Court finds "ample support in
the record for the conclusion that the city did not establish[a] reasonable fit."

Ante, at 417 (internal quotation marksomitted). I disagree.

According to the Court, the city's decision to invoke anexisting ordinance "to address its recently developed concern about newsracks" indicates that "it has not `carefullycalculated' the costs and benefits associated with the burden

441Cite as: 507 U. S. 410 (1993)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
on speech imposed by its prohibition." Ibid. The im-plication being that, if Cincinnati had studied the problem in greater detail, it would have discovered that it couldhave accomplished its desired ends by regulating the "size,
shape, appearance, or number" of all newsracks, rather than
categorically banning only those newsracks that dissemi-nate commercial speech.

Ibid. Despite its protestations
to the contrary, see ante, at 417, n. 13, this argument restson the discredited notion that the availability of "less restrictive means" to accomplish the city's objectives rendersits regulation of commercial speech unconstitutional. As
we observed in Fox, "almost all of the restrictions disallowed under Central Hudson's fourth prong have been
substantially excessive, disregarding far less restrictive
and more precise means." 492 U. S., at 479 (internal quotation marks omitted). That there may be other--less
restrictive--means by which Cincinnati could have gone
about addressing its safety and esthetic concerns, then, does
not render its prohibition against respondents' newsracks
unconstitutional.

Nor does the fact that, if enforced, the city's prohibition
would result in the removal of only 62 newsracks from its
street corners. The Court attaches significance to the
lower courts' findings that any benefit that would be derived
from the removal of respondents' newsracks would be " `minute' " or " `paltry.' " Ante, at 418. The relevant inquiry,
though, is not the degree to which the locality's interests
are furthered in a particular case, but rather the relation
that the challenged regulation of commercial speech bears to
the "overall problem" the locality is seeking to alleviate.
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 801 (1989).
This follows from our test for reviewing the validity of
"time, place, or manner" restrictions on noncommercial
speech, which we have said is "substantially similar" to the
Central Hudson analysis. Board of Trustees of State University of N. Y. v. Fox, supra, at 477 (internal quotation

marks omitted). Properly viewed, then, the city's prohibition against respondents' newsracks is directly related to its
efforts to alleviate the problems caused by newsracks, since
every newsrack that is removed from the city's sidewalks
marginally enhances the safety of its streets and esthetics of
its cityscape. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that
the city has chosen to address its problem by banning only
those newsracks that disseminate commercial speech, rather
than regulating all newsracks alike.

Our commercial speech cases establish that localities may
stop short of fully accomplishing their objectives without
running afoul of the First Amendment. In Posadas de
Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478
U. S. 328, 342 (1986), where we upheld Puerto Rico's ban on
promotional advertising of casino gambling aimed at Puerto
Rico residents, we rejected the appellant's argument that
the ban was invalid under Central Hudson because other
types of gambling (e. g., horse racing) were permitted to be
advertised to local residents. More to the point, in Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490 (1981) (plurality
opinion), where we upheld San Diego's ban of offsite billboard advertising, we rejected the appellants' argument
that the ban was invalid under Central Hudson because it
did not extend to onsite billboard advertising. See 453
U. S., at 511 ("[W]hether onsite advertising is permitted or
not, the prohibition of offsite advertising is directly related
to the stated objectives of traffic safety and esthetics. This
is not altered by the fact that the ordinance is underinclusive because it permits onsite advertising"). See also City
Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S.
789, 810-811 (1984) (rejecting the argument that the city's
prohibition against the posting of signs on public property
could not be justified on esthetic grounds because it did not
extend to the posting of signs on private property). Thus,
the fact that Cincinnati's regulatory scheme is underin507us2$47F 11-15-96 18:24:30 PAGES OPINPGT

443Cite as: 507 U. S. 410 (1993)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
clusive does not render its ban on respondents' newsracksunconstitutional.

The Court offers an alternative rationale for invalidatingthe city's policy: viz., the distinction Cincinnati has drawn
(between commercial and noncommercial speech) in deciding
which newsracks to regulate "bears no relationship whatsoever to the particular interests that the city has asserted."
Ante, at 424 (emphasis in original). That is, because news-racks that disseminate noncommercial speech have the same

physical characteristics as newsracks that disseminate com-mercial speech, and therefore undermine the city's safety
and esthetic interests to the same degree, the city's decision
to ban only those newsracks that disseminate commercial
speech has nothing to do with its interests in regulating
newsracks in the first place. The city does not contend otherwise; instead, it asserts that its policy is grounded in the
distinction we have drawn between commercial and noncommercial speech. "In the absence of some basis for distinguishing between `newspapers' and `commercial handbills'
that is relevant to an interest asserted by the city," however,
the Court refuses "to recognize Cincinnati's bare assertion
that the `low value' of commercial speech is a sufficient justification for its selective and categorical ban on newsracks
dispensing `commercial handbills.' " Ante, at 428.

Thus, despite the fact that we have consistently distinguished between commercial and noncommercial speech for
the purpose of determining whether the regulation of speech
is permissible, the Court holds that in attempting to alleviate
its newsrack problem Cincinnati may not choose to proceed
incrementally by burdening only commercial speech first.
Based on the different levels of protection we have accorded
commercial and noncommercial speech, we have previously
said that localities may not favor commercial over noncommercial speech in addressing similar urban problems, see
Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, supra, at 513 (plurality opinion), but before today we have never even suggested that

444 CINCINNATI v. DISCOVERY NETWORK, INC.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
the converse holds true. It is not surprising, then, that theCourt offers little in the way of precedent supporting its new

rule. The cases it does cite involve challenges to the restric-tion of noncommercial speech in which we have refused to
accept distinctions drawn between restricted and nonrestricted speech on the ground that they bore no relationshipto the interests asserted for regulating the speech in the first

place. See ante, at 424-425, citing Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.
Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 120
(1991); Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 465 (1980). Neither ofthese cases involved the regulation of commercial speech; nor

did they involve a challenge to the permissibility of distinctions drawn between categories of speech that we have accorded different degrees of First Amendment protection.

The Court's reliance on Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products
Corp., see ante, at 426-428, is also misplaced. In that case we
said that the Government's interest in "shield[ing] recipients
of mail from materials that they are likely to find offensive"
was invalid regardless of the type of speech--commercial or
noncommercial--involved. See 463 U. S., at 71-72. By contrast, there can be no question here that the city's safety and
esthetic interests justify its prohibition against respondents'
newsracks. This at least is the teaching of Metromedia.
There, seven Justices were of the view that San Diego's
safety and esthetic interests were sufficient to justify its ban
on offsite billboard advertising, even though the city's reason
for regulating these billboards had nothing to do with the
content of the advertisements they displayed. See 453 U. S.,
507-510 (opinion of White, J., joined by Stewart, Marshall,
and Powell, JJ.); id., at 552-553 (Stevens, J., dissenting in
part); id., at 559-561, 563 (Burger, C. J., dissenting); id., at
569-570 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Without even attempting to reconcile Metromedia, the Court now suggests that
commercial speech is only subject to lesser protection when
it is being regulated because of its content (or adverse effects stemming therefrom). See ante, at 416, n. 11, 425-426,

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
and n. 21. This holding, I fear, will unduly hamper ourcities' efforts to come to grips with the unique problems

posed by the dissemination of commercial speech.If (as I am certain) Cincinnati may regulate newsracks
that disseminate commercial speech based on the interests
it has asserted, I am at a loss as to why its scheme is un-constitutional because it does not also regulate newsracks

that disseminate noncommercial speech. One would havethought that the city, perhaps even following the teachings
of our commercial speech jurisprudence, could have decidedto place the burden of its regulatory scheme on less protected speech (i. e., commercial handbills) without running
afoul of the First Amendment. Today's decision, though,
places the city in the position of having to decide between
restricting more speech--fully protected speech--and allowing the proliferation of newsracks on its street corners to
continue unabated. It scarcely seems logical that the First
Amendment compels such a result. In my view, the city
may order the removal of all newsracks from its public rightof-ways if it so chooses. See Lakewood v. Plain Dealer
Publishing Co., 486 U. S. 750, 780-781 (1988) (White, J.,
joined by Stevens and O'Connor, JJ., dissenting). But
however it decides to address its newsrack problem, it should
be allowed to proceed in the manner and scope it sees fit
so long as it does not violate established First Amendment
principles, such as the rule against discrimination on the
basis of content. "[L]ittle can be gained in the area of constitutional law, and much lost in the process of democratic
decisionmaking, by allowing individual judges in city after
city to second-guess . . . legislative . . . determinations" on
such matters as esthetics. Metromedia, 453 U. S., at 570
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting).

Cincinnati has burdened less speech than necessary to
fully accomplish its objective of alleviating the problems
caused by the proliferation of newsracks on its street corners. Because I believe the city has established a "reason507us2$47F 11-15-96 18:24:30 PAGES OPINPGT

able fit" between its substantial safety and esthetic interestsand its prohibition against respondents' newsracks, I would

hold that the city's actions are permissible under CentralHudson. I see no reason to engage in a "time, place, or
manner" analysis of the city's prohibition, which in anyevent strikes me as duplicative of the

Central Hudson analy-sis. Cf. Board of Trustees of State University of N. Y. v.

Fox, 492 U. S., at 477. Nor do I think it necessary or wise,on the record before us, to reach the question whether the
city's regulatory scheme vests too much discretion in cityofficials to determine whether a particular publication constitutes a "commercial handbill." See ante, at 423, n. 13. Itis undisputed, by the parties at least, that respondents' magazines constitute commercial speech. I dissent.

UNITED STATES by and through INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE v. McDERMOTT et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 91-1229. Argued December 7, 1992--Decided March 24, 1993
The United States' federal tax lien on respondent McDermotts' property

applied to after-acquired property, Glass City Bank v. United States,
326 U. S. 265, but could "not be valid as against any . . . judgment lien
creditor until notice thereof . . . has been filed," 26 U. S. C. $ 6323(a).
Before that lien was filed with the Salt Lake County Clerk, a bank
docketed a state-court judgment it had won against the McDermotts,
thereby creating a state-law judgment lien on all of their existing or
after-acquired real property in the county. After both liens were filed,
the McDermotts acquired certain real property in the county and
brought this interpleader action. The District Court awarded priority
in that property to the bank's lien. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: A federal tax lien filed before a delinquent taxpayer acquires real

property must be given priority in that property over a private creditor's previously filed judgment lien. Priority for purposes of federal
law is governed by the common-law principle that " `the first in time is
the first in right.' " United States v. New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 85. A
state lien that competes with a federal lien is deemed to be in existence
for "first in time" purposes only when it has been "perfected" in the
sense that, inter alia, "the property subject to the lien [is] established."
Id., at 84. Because the bank's judgment lien did not actually attach to
the property at issue until the McDermotts acquired rights in that property, which occurred after the United States filed its tax lien, the bank's
lien was not perfected before the federal filing. See id., at 84-86.
United States v. Vermont, 377 U. S. 351, distinguished. It is irrelevant
that the federal lien similarly did not attach and become perfected until
the McDermotts acquired the property, since $ 6323(c)(1) demonstrates
that such a lien is ordinarily dated, for purposes of "first in time" priority against $ 6323(a) competing interests, from the time of its filing.

We granted certiorari to resolve the competing priorities
of a federal tax lien and a private creditor's judgment lienas to a delinquent taxpayer's after-acquired real property.

I
On December 9, 1986, the United States assessed Mr. and
Mrs. McDermott for unpaid federal taxes due for the tax
years 1977 through 1981. Upon that assessment, the lawcreated a lien in favor of the United States on all real and

personal property belonging to the McDermotts, 26 U. S. C.$$ 6321 and 6322, including after-acquired property,

Glass
City Bank v. United States, 326 U. S. 265 (1945). Pursuantto 26 U. S. C. $ 6323(a), however, that lien could "not be valid

as against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, me-chanic's lienor, or

judgment lien creditor until notice thereof
. . . has been filed." (Emphasis added.) The United States
did not file this lien in the Salt Lake County Recorder'sOffice until September 9, 1987. Before that occurred,

however--specifically, on July 6, 1987--Zions First NationalBank, N. A. (Bank), docketed with the Salt Lake County
Clerk a state-court judgment it had won against the McDer-motts. Under Utah law, that created a judgment lien on all
of the McDermotts' real property in Salt Lake County,"owned . . . at the time or . . . thereafter acquired during the
existence of said lien." Utah Code Ann. $ 78-22-1 (1953).

Opinion of the Court
On September 23, 1987, the McDermotts acquired title to
certain real property in Salt Lake County. To facilitate
later sale of that property, the parties entered into an escrow
agreement whereby the United States and the Bank released
their claims to the real property itself but reserved their
rights to the cash proceeds of the sale, based on their priorities in the property as of September 23, 1987. Pursuant to
the escrow agreement, the McDermotts brought this interpleader action in state court to establish which lien was entitled to priority; the United States removed to the United
States District Court for the District of Utah.

On cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the District Court awarded priority to the Bank's judgment lien.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
affirmed. McDermott v. Zions First Nat. Bank, N. A., 945
F. 2d 1475 (1991). We granted certiorari. 504 U. S. 939

II

Federal tax liens do not automatically have priority over
all other liens. Absent provision to the contrary, priority
for purposes of federal law is governed by the common-law
principle that " `the first in time is the first in right.' "
United States v. New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 85 (1954); cf. Rankin v. Scott, 12 Wheat. 177, 179 (1827) (Marshall, C. J.). For
purposes of applying that doctrine in the present case--in
which the competing state lien (that of a judgment creditor)
benefits from the provision of $ 6323(a) that the federal lien
shall "not be valid . . . until notice thereof . . . has been
filed"--we must deem the United States' lien to have commenced no sooner than the filing of notice. As for the
Bank's lien: Our cases deem a competing state lien to be in
existence for "first in time" purposes only when it has been
"perfected" in the sense that "the identity of the lienor, the
property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are
established." United States v. New Britain, 347 U. S., at 84

450 UNITED STATES v. McDERMOTT

Opinion of the Court
(emphasis added); see also id., at 86; United States v. PioneerAmerican Ins. Co., 374 U. S. 84 (1963).

The first question we must answer, then, is whether theBank's judgment lien was perfected in this sense before the
United States filed its tax lien on September 9, 1987. If so,that is the end of the matter; the Bank's lien prevails. The
Court of Appeals was of the view that this question wasanswered (or rendered irrelevant) by our decision in

UnitedStates v. Vermont, 377 U. S. 351 (1964), which it took to

"stan[d] for the proposition that a non-contingent . . . lien onall of a person's real property, perfected prior to the federal
tax lien, will take priority over the federal lien, regardlessof whether after-acquired property is involved."

at 1480. That is too expansive a reading. Our opinion inVermont gives no indication that the property at issue had

become subject to the state lien only by application of anafter-acquired-property clause to property that the debtor
acquired after the federal lien arose. To the contrary, theopinion says that the state lien met (presumably at the critical time when the federal lien arose) "the test laid down in
New Britain that . . . `the property subject to the lien . . .[be] established.' " 377 U. S., at 358 (citation omitted).

1 As our later discussion will show, we think it contradictory to say that
the state lien was "perfected" before the federal lien was filed, insofar as
it applies to after-acquired property not acquired by the debtor until after
the federal lien was filed. The Court of Appeals was evidently using the
term "perfected" (as the Bank would) in a sense not requiring attachment
of the lien to the property in question; our discussion of the Court of
Appeals' opinion assumes that usage.

2 The dissent cannot both grant the assumption "that the debtor in Vermont acquired its interest in the bank account before the federal lien
arose," post, at 459, n. 2, and contend that "the debtor's interest in the
bank account . . . could have been uncertain or indefinite from the creditors' perspective," ibid. In the same footnote, the dissent misdescribes
the "critical argument that we rejected" in Vermont. Ibid. It was not
that "the State's claim could not be superior unless the account had
been `specifically identified' as property subject to the State's lien," ibid.,
but rather that the State's claim could not be superior unless it had

Opinion of the Court
The argument of the United States that we rejected in Ver-mont was the contention that a state lien is not perfected

within the meaning of New Britain if it "attach[es] to all ofthe taxpayer's property," rather than "to specifically identified portions of that property." 377 U. S., at 355 (empha-sis added).

3 We did not consider, and the facts as recited

did not implicate, the quite different argument made bythe United States in the present case: that a lien in afteracquired property is not "perfected" as to property yet tobe acquired.

The Bank argues that, as of July 6, 1987, the date itdocketed its judgment lien, the lien was "perfected as to all
real property then and thereafter owned by" the McDer-motts, since "[n]othing further was required of [the Bank] to
attach the non-contingent lien on after-acquired property."Brief for Respondent 21. That reflects an unusual notion
of what it takes to "perfect" a lien.4 Under the Uniform
"attach[ed] to specifically identified portions of that property," United
States v. Vermont, 377 U. S., at 355 (emphasis added).

3 The dissent claims that "the Government's `specificity' claim rejected

in Vermont is analytically indistinguishable from the `attachment' argument the Court accepts today," since "[i]f specific attachment is not required for the state lien to be `sufficiently choate,' then neither is specific
acquisition." Post, at 459 (citation omitted). But the two are not comparable. Until the debtor has acquired the subject property, it is impossible
to say that "the property subject to the lien [has been] . . . established,"
United States v. New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 84 (1954). Judicial attachment,
on the other hand (and it is important to note that judicial attachment of
the property, rather than attachment of the lien to the property, was what
the Government's argument in Vermont involved), merely brings into the
custody of a court property that is already--prior to judicial attachment--
known to be subject to the lien.

4 The dissent accepts the Bank's central argument that perfection occurred when "there was `nothing more to be done' by the Bank `to have a
choate lien' on any real property the McDermotts might acquire." Post,
at 457-458 (quoting United States v. New Britain, supra, at 84); see also
post, at 461. This unusual definition of perfection has been achieved by
making a small but substantively important addition to the language of
New Britain. " `[N]othing more to be done . . . to have a choate lien' "

452 UNITED STATES v. McDERMOTT

Opinion of the Court
Commercial Code, for example, a security interest in after-acquired property is generally not considered perfected

when the financing statement is filed, but only when the se-curity interest has attached to particular property upon the
debtor's acquisition of that property. $$ 9-203(1) and (2), 3
U. L. A. 363 (1992); $ 9-303(1), 3A U. L. A. 117 (1992). Andattachment to particular property was also an element of

what we meant by "perfection" in New Britain. See 347U. S., at 84 ("when . . . the property subject to the lien . . .
[is] established"); id., at 86 ("[T]he priority of each statutorylien contested here must depend on the time it attached to
the property in question and became [no longer inchoate]").5The Bank concedes that its lien did not actually attach to the
property at issue here until the McDermotts acquired rights
(the language of New Britain) becomes "nothing more to be done by the
Bank to have a choate lien." Once one recognizes that the dissent's concept of a lien's "becom[ing] certain as to the property subject thereto,"
see post, at 457, 461, is meaningless, see n. 5, infra, it becomes apparent
that the dissent, like the Bank, would simply have us substitute the concept of "best efforts" for the concept of perfection.

5 The dissent refuses to acknowledge the unavoidable realities that the

property subject to a lien is not "established" until one knows what specific
property that is, and that a lien cannot be anything other than "inchoate"
with respect to property that is not yet subject to the lien. Hence the
dissent says that, upon its filing, the lien at issue here "was perfected,
even as to the real property later acquired by the McDermotts, in the
sense that it was definite as to the property in question, noncontingent,
and summarily enforceable." Post, at 457. But how could it have been,
at that time, "definite" as to this property, when the identity of this property (established by the McDermotts' later acquisition) was yet unknown?
Or "noncontingent" as to this property, when the property would have
remained entirely free of the judgment lien had the McDermotts not later
decided to buy it? Or "summarily enforceable" against this property
when the McDermotts did not own, and had never owned, it? The dissent
also says that "[t]he lien was immediately enforceable through levy and
execution against all the debtors' property, whenever acquired." Ibid.
(emphases added). But of course it was not "immediately enforceable"
(as of its filing date, which is the relevant time) against property that the
McDermotts had not yet acquired.

Opinion of the Court
in that property. Brief for Respondent 16, 21. Since thatoccurred

after filing of the federal tax lien, the state lien was
not first in time.6But that does not complete our inquiry: Though the state

lien was not first in time, the federal tax lien was notnecessarily first in time either. Like the state lien, it applied to the property at issue here by virtue of a ( judicially
inferred) after-acquired-property provision, which meansthat it did not attach until the same instant the state lien

attached, viz., when the McDermotts acquired the property;and, like the state lien, it did not become "perfected" until
that time. We think, however, that under the languageof $ 6323(a) ("shall not be valid as against any . . . judgment
lien creditor until notice . . . has been filed"), the filing ofnotice renders the federal tax lien extant for "first in time"
priority purposes regardless of whether it has yet attached
to identifiable property. That result is also indicated by
the provision, two subsections later, which accords priority,
even against filed federal tax liens, to security interests
arising out of certain agreements, including "commercial
transactions financing agreement[s]," entered into before
filing of the tax lien. 26 U. S. C. $ 6323(c)(1). That provision protects certain security interests that, like the afteracquired-property judgment lien here, will have been recorded before the filing of the tax lien, and will attach to the
encumbered property after the filing of the tax lien,
and simultaneously with the attachment of the tax lien (i. e.,
upon the debtor's acquisition of the subject property).
According special priority to certain state security interests

6 The dissent suggests, post, at 458, n. 1, that the Treasury Department
regulation defining "judgment lien creditor," 26 CFR $ 301.6323(h)-1(g)
(1992), contradicts our analysis. It would, if it contained only the three
requirements that the dissent describes. In fact, however, it says that to
prevail the judgment lien must be perfected, and that "[a] judgment lien
is not perfected until the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the
lien, and the amount of the lien are established." Ibid. (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
in these circumstances obviously presumes that otherwisethe federal tax lien would prevail--i. e., that the federal

tax lien is ordinarily dated, for purposes of "first in time"priority against $ 6323(a) competing interests, from the time
of its filing, regardless of when it attaches to the subject
property.7The Bank argues that "[b]y common law, the first lien of

record against a debtor's property has priority over thosesubsequently filed unless a lien-creating statute clearly
shows or declares an intention to cause the statutory lien tooverride." Brief for Respondent Zions First National Bank,
N. A., 11.8 Such a strong "first-to-record" presumption maybe appropriate for simultaneously perfected liens under ordinary statutes creating private liens, which ordinarily arise

7 The dissent contends that "there is no persuasive reason for not adopting as a matter of federal law the well-recognized common-law rule of
parity and giving the Bank an equal interest in the property." Post, at
461, n. 4. As we have explained, the persuasive reason is the existence
of $ 6323(c), which displays the assumption that all perfected security interests are defeated by the federal tax lien. There is no reason why this
assumption should not extend to judgment liens as well. A "security interest," as defined in $ 6323, is not an insignificant creditor's preference.
The term includes only interests protected against subsequent judgment
liens. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 6323(h)(1) and 6323(c)(1)(B). Moreover, the text
of $ 6323(a) ("The lien . . . shall not be valid as against any purchaser,
holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor, or judgment lien creditor")
treats security interests and judgment liens alike. Parity may be, as the
dissent says, a "well-recognized common-law rule," post, at 461, n. 4, but
we have not hitherto adopted it as the federal law of tax liens in 127 years
of tax lien enforcement.

8 The dissent notes that "[n]othing in the law of judgment liens suggests

that the possibility, which existed at the time the Bank docketed its
judgment, that the McDermotts would not acquire the specific property
here at issue was a `contingency' that rendered the Bank's otherwise perfected general judgment lien subordinate to intervening liens." Post, at
460. Perhaps. But priorities here are determined, not by "the law of
judgment liens," but by $ 6323(a), as our case law has interpreted it. The
requirement that competing state liens be perfected is part of that
jurisprudence.

out of voluntary transactions. When two private lendersboth exact from the same debtor security agreements with

after-acquired-property clauses, the second lender knows, byreason of the earlier recording, that that category of property will be subject to another claim, and if the remaining
security is inadequate he may avoid the difficulty by declin-ing to extend credit. The Government, by contrast, cannot

indulge the luxury of declining to hold the taxpayer liablefor his taxes; notice of a previously filed security agreement
covering after-acquired property does not enable the Gov-ernment to protect itself. A strong "first-to-record" presumption is particularly out of place under the present tax-lien statute, whose

general rule is that the tax collector
prevails even if he has not recorded at all. 26 U. S. C.

meaning we have discerned in this opinion to be "clear," it
is evident enough for the purpose at hand. The federal tax
lien must be given priority.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

I agree with the Court that under 26 U. S. C. $ 6323(a) we
generally look to the filing of notice of the federal tax lien to
determine the federal lien's priority as against a competing
state-law judgment lien. I cannot agree, however, that a
federal tax lien trumps a judgment creditor's claim to afteracquired property whenever notice of the federal lien is filed
before the judgment lien has "attached" to the property.

ha[d] become so perfected," with respect to the McDermotts'

after-acquired real property, "as to defeat [the] later-filedfederal tax lien."

United States v. Pioneer American Ins.
Co., 374 U. S. 84, 88 (1963).Applying the governing "first in time" rule, the Court recognizes--as it must--that if the Bank's interest in the property was "perfected in the sense that there [was] nothingmore to be done to have a choate lien" before September 9,

1987 (the date the federal notice was filed), United States v.
New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 84 (1954), "that is the end of the
matter; the Bank's lien prevails," ante, at 450. Because theBank's identity as lienor and the amount of its judgment lien

are undisputed, the choateness question here reduces to
whether "the property subject to the lien" was sufficiently
"established" as of that date. New Britain, supra, at 84.
Accord, Pioneer American, supra, at 89. See 26 CFR

$ 301.6323(h)-1(g) (1992). The majority is quick to conclude
that "establish[ment]" cannot precede attachment, and that
a lien in after-acquired property therefore cannot be sufficiently perfected until the debtor has acquired rights in
the property. See ante, at 451-453. That holding does not
follow from, and I believe it is inconsistent with, our
precedents.

We have not (before today) prescribed any rigid criteria
for "establish[ing]" the property subject to a competing lien;
we have required only that the lien "become certain as to . . .
the property subject thereto." New Britain, supra, at 86
(emphasis added). Our cases indicate that "certain" means
nothing more than "[d]etermined and [d]efinite," Pioneer
American, supra, at 90, and that the proper focus is on
whether the lien is free from "contingencies" that stand in
the way of its execution, United States v. Security Trust &
Savings Bank, 340 U. S. 47, 50 (1950). In Security Trust,
for example, we refused to accord priority to a mere attachment lien that "had not ripened into a judgment," New
Britain, supra, at 86, and was therefore "contingent upon
taking subsequent steps for enforcing it," 340 U. S., at 51.

And in United States v. Vermont, 377 U. S. 351 (1964), werecognized the complete superiority of a general tax lien

held by the State of Vermont upon all property rights be-longing to the debtor, even though the lien had not
"attach[ed] to [the] specifically identified portions of that
property" in which the Federal Government claimed a com-peting tax lien.

Id., at 355. With or without specific attachment, Vermont's general lien was "sufficiently choate toobtain priority over the later federal lien," because it was

"summarily enforceable" upon assessment and demand. Id.,at 359, and n. 12.

Although the choateness of a state-law lien under $ 6323(a)
is a federal question, that question is answered in part by
reference to state law, and we therefore give due weight to
the State's " `classification of [its] lien as specific and perfected.' " Pioneer American, supra, at 88, n. 7 (quoting
Security Trust, supra, at 49). Here, state law establishes
that upon filing, the Bank's judgment lien was perfected,
even as to the real property later acquired by the McDermotts, in the sense that it was definite as to the property in
question, noncontingent, and summarily enforceable. Pursuant to Utah statute, from the moment the Bank had docketed
and filed its judgment with the Clerk of the state court on
July 6, 1987, it held an enforceable lien upon all nonexempt
real property owned by the McDermotts or thereafter acquired by them during the existence of the lien. See Utah
Code Ann. $ 78-22-1 (1953). The lien was immediately enforceable through levy and execution against all the debtors'
property, whenever acquired. See Belnap v. Blain, 575
P. 2d 696, 700 (Utah 1978). See also Utah Rule Civ. Proc.

by a court on equitable grounds." Taylor National, Inc. v.
Jensen Brothers Constr. Co., 641 P. 2d 150, 155 (Utah 1982).
Thus, the Bank's lien had become certain as to the property
subject thereto, whether then existing or thereafter acquired, and all competing creditors were on notice that there

The Court brushes aside the relevance of our Vermontopinion with the simple observation that that case did not

involve a lien in after-acquired property. Ante, at 450-451.This is a wooden distinction. In truth, the Government's
"specificity" claim rejected in Vermont is analytically indis-tinguishable from the "attachment" argument the Court accepts today. Vermont's general lien applied to all of thedebtor's rights in property, with no limitation on when those
rights were acquired, and remained valid until the debt wassatisfied or became unenforceable. See 377 U. S., at 352.
The United States claimed that its later-filed tax lien tookpriority over Vermont's as to the debtor's interest in a
particular bank account, because the State had not taken"steps to perfect its lien by attaching the bank account in
question" until after the federal lien had been recorded.Brief for United States in United States v. Vermont, O. T.
1963, No. 509, p. 12. "Thus," the Government asserted,"when the federal lien arose, the State lien did not meet one

1 The Department of Treasury regulations defining "judgment lien creditor" for purposes of $ 6323(a) set forth only three specific requirements for
a choate lien (corresponding to the three "establish[ment]" criteria of New
Britain). The judgment creditor must "obtai[n] a valid judgment" (thus
establishing the lienor) for the recovery of "specifically designated property or for a certain sum of money" (thus establishing the amount of the
lien), and if recording or docketing is "necessary under local law" for the
lien to be effective against third parties, the judgment lien "is not perfected with respect to real property until the time of such recordation or
docketing." 26 CFR $ 301.6323(h)-1(g) (1992). The last requirement--
recording or docketing--is the only specific requirement recognized in the
regulations for establishing the real property subject to the judgment lien.
The regulations in no way suggest that $ 6323(a) imposes any "attachment"
condition for after-acquired property. Such a condition would be, in effect, an additional recordation requirement that is not otherwise imposed
by local law.

of the three essential elements of a choate lien: that it attach
to specific property." Ibid. In rejecting the federal claim
of priority, we found no need even to mention whether the
debtor had acquired its property interest in the deposited
funds before or after notice of the federal lien. If specific
attachment is not required for the state lien to be "sufficiently choate," 377 U. S., at 359, then neither is specific
acquisition.2

Like the majority's reasoning today, see ante, at 452, the
Government's argument in Vermont rested in part on dicta
from New Britain suggesting that "attachment to specific
property [is] a condition for choateness of a State-created
lien." Brief for United States in United States v. Vermont,
supra, at 19. See New Britain, 347 U. S., at 86 ("[T]he priority of each statutory lien contested here must depend on
the time it attached to the property in question and became
choate") (emphasis added). New Britain, however, involved
competing statutory liens that had concededly "attached
to the same real estate." Id., at 87. The only issue was
whether the liens were otherwise sufficiently choate. Thus,
like Security Trust (and, in fact, like all of our cases before
Vermont), New Britain provided no occasion to consider the
necessity of attachment to property that was not specifically
identified at the time the state lien arose.

2 Even assuming, as the majority does, that the debtor in Vermont acquired its interest in the bank account before the federal lien arose, the
critical argument that we rejected in that case was the contention that
the State's claim could not be superior unless the account had been "specifically identified" as property subject to the State's lien. 377 U. S., at
355. At the time of the federal filing, the debtor's interest in the bank
account, like the McDermotts' interest in the property at issue here, could
have been uncertain or indefinite from the creditors' perspective. Nevertheless, in both cases, the particular property was "known to be subject
to the [state] lien," ante, at 451, n. 3, simply because that lien, by its
terms, applied without limitation to all property acquired at any time by
the debtor.

Thomas, J., dissenting
Nothing in the law of judgment liens suggests that thepossibility, which existed at the time the Bank docketed its

judgment, that the McDermotts would not acquire thespecific property here at issue was a "contingency" that
rendered the Bank's otherwise perfected general judgmentlien subordinate to intervening liens. Under the relevant
background rules of state law, the Bank's interest in after-acquired real property generally could not be defeated by an
intervening statutory lien. In some States, the priority ofjudgment liens in after-acquired property is determined
by the order of their docketing. 3 R. Powell, Law of RealProperty || 481[1], p. 38-36 (P. Rohan rev. 1991) (hereinafter
Powell). See, e. g., Lowe v. Reierson, 201 Minn. 280,287, 276 N. W. 224, 227 (1937). In others, the rule is that
"[w]hen two (or more) judgments are successively perfectedagainst a debtor and thereafter the debtor acquires a
land interest[,] these liens, attaching simultaneously at thetime of the land's acquisition by the debtor, are regarded as
on a parity and no priority exists." 3 Powell || 481[1],pp. 38-35 to 38-36. See,

e. g., Bank of Boston v. Haufler,20 Mass. App. 668, 674, 482 N. E. 2d 542, 547 (1985);

McAllen State Bank v. Saenz, 561 F. Supp. 636, 639 (SD Tex.1982). Thus, under state common law, the Bank would
either retain its full priority in the property by virtue of itsearlier filing or, at a minimum, share an equal interest with
the competing lienor.3 The fact that the prior judgment lienremains effective against third parties without further efforts by the judgment creditor is enough for purposes of

3 Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code is inapposite, and the
Court's reliance on it misplaced. See ante, at 451-452. The technical
rules governing the perfection and priority of the special security interests in personal property created by Article 9 have no application to traditional judgment liens in real property, see $ 9-102, 3 U. L. A. 73 (1992),
and should have no bearing on the federal doctrine of "choateness." In
the context of determining the relative priority of a competing statutory
judgment lien, it is Article 9's notion of perfection that is the more "unusual." Ante, at 451.

$ 6323(a), since the point of our choateness doctrine is to re-spect the validity of a competing lien where the lien has become certain as to the property subject thereto and thelienor need take no further action to secure his claim.
Under this federal-law principle, the Bank's lien was sufficiently choate to be first in time.4I acknowledge that our precedents do not provide the

clearest answer to the question of after-acquired property.See

ante, at 455. But the Court's parsimonious reading of
Vermont undercuts the congressional purpose--expressedthrough repeated amendments to the tax lien provisions in

the century since United States v. Snyder, 149 U. S. 210(1893)--of "protect[ing] third persons against harsh application of the federal tax lien," Kennedy, The Relative Priorityof the Federal Government: The Pernicious Career of the
Inchoate and General Lien, 63 Yale L. J. 905, 922 (1954).
The attachment requirement erodes the "preferred status"
granted to judgment creditors by $ 6323(a), and renders a
choate judgment lien in after-acquired property subordinate

4 Even if the Court were correct that attachment is the determinative
criterion of choateness, we would have a tie, since the federal lien "did not
attach [to the after-acquired property] until the same instant the state lien
attached." Ante, at 453. That being so, there is no persuasive reason
for not adopting as a matter of federal law the well-recognized commonlaw rule of parity and giving the Bank an equal interest in the property.
See 3 Powell || 481[1]. Section 6323(a)'s requirement that the federal lien
be "filed" to be effective may determine when the lien arises for general
priority purposes, but the word "filed" provides no textual basis for concluding that a tie goes to the Government, and simply declaring that it
does, see ante, at 453, does not make it so. The special exception in

$ 6323(c), which protects later-arising security interests that are based on
certain preferred financing agreements, see ibid., does not imply that
judgment creditors lose out. Indeed, $ 6323(c) demonstrates that Congress has considered the question of later-arising property, and the absence of an analogous provision in $ 6323(a) suggests that Congress was
content to let the courts apply one of the existing background rules to
determine the relative priority (or parity) of the federal lien as against
competing judgment liens in after-acquired property.

ARAVE, WARDEN v. CREECH
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1160. Argued November 10, 1992--Decided March 30, 1993
After respondent Creech pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for the

brutal slaying of a fellow Idaho prison inmate, the state trial judge
sentenced him to death based, in part, on the statutory aggravating
circumstance that "[b]y the murder, or circumstances surrounding its
commission, the defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life."
In affirming, the Idaho Supreme Court, among other things, rejected
Creech's argument that this aggravating circumstance is unconstitutionally vague and reaffirmed the limiting construction it had placed on the
statutory language in State v. Osborn, 102 Idaho 405, 418-419, 631 P. 2d
187, 200-201, whereby, inter alia, " `the phrase "utter disregard" . . . is
meant to be reflective of . . . the cold-blooded, pitiless slayer.' " Although the Federal District Court denied habeas corpus relief, the
Court of Appeals found the "utter disregard" circumstance facially invalid, holding, among other things, that the circumstance is unconstitutionally vague and that the Osborn narrowing construction is inadequate to cure the defect under this Court's precedents.

Held:

1. In light of the consistent narrowing definition given the "utter disregard" circumstance by the Idaho Supreme Court, the circumstance,
on its face, meets constitutional standards. Pp. 470-478.

(a) To satisfy the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, a capital
sentencing scheme must channel the sentencer's discretion by " `clear
and objective standards' " that provide specific and detailed guidance
and make rationally reviewable the death sentencing process. See,
e. g., Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 774. In order to decide whether a
particular aggravating circumstance meets these requirements, a federal court must determine whether the statutory language defining the
circumstance is itself too vague to guide the sentencer; if so, whether
the state courts have further defined the vague terms; and, if so,
whether those definitions are constitutionally sufficient, i. e., whether
they provide some guidance. Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 654.
However, it is not necessary to decide here whether the statutory
phrase "utter disregard for human life" itself passes constitutional muster. The Idaho Supreme Court has adopted a limiting construction, and
that construction meets constitutional requirements. Pp. 470-471.

Syllabus
(b) The Osborn construction is sufficiently "clear and objective."
In ordinary usage, the phrase "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" refers to a
killer who kills without feeling or sympathy. Thus, the phrase describes the defendant's state of mind: not his mens rea, but his attitude
toward his conduct and his victim. The law has long recognized that
such state of mind is not a "subjective" matter, but a fact to be inferred
from the surrounding circumstances. Although determining whether a
capital defendant killed without feeling or sympathy may be difficult,
that does not mean that a State cannot, consistent with the Constitution,
authorize sentencing judges to make the inquiry and to take their findings into account when deciding whether capital punishment is warranted. Cf. Walton, supra, at 655. Pp. 471-474.

(c) Although the question is close, the Osborn construction satisfies
the requirement that a State's capital sentencing scheme "genuinely
narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty." Zant v.
Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877. The class of persons so eligible under
Idaho law is defined broadly to include all first-degree murderers, a category which is itself broad because it includes a sizable number of seconddegree murderers under specified circumstances. Even within these
broad definitions, the word "pitiless," standing alone, might not narrow
the class of death eligible defendants, since a sentencing judge might
conclude that every first-degree murderer is "pitiless." Given the statutory scheme, however, a sentencing judge reasonably could find that
not all Idaho capital defendants are "cold-blooded," since some within
the broad class of first-degree murderers do exhibit feeling, for example,
anger, jealousy, or revenge. Pp. 474-476.

(d) This Court rejects the suggestion of the parties and the dissent
that the facial constitutionality of the "utter disregard" circumstance, as
construed in Osborn, should be determined by examining for consistency the applications of the circumstance by the state courts in other
cases. Although the Court's facial challenge precedents authorize a
federal court to consider state court formulations of a limiting construction to ensure that they are consistent, see, e. g., Proffitt v. Florida, 428
U. S. 242, 255, n. 12, those precedents have not authorized review of
state court cases to determine whether a limiting construction has been
applied consistently. A comparative analysis of state court cases,
moreover, would be particularly inappropriate here. None of the cases
on which Creech or the dissent relies influenced either his trial judge or
the Idaho Supreme Court, which upheld his death sentence before it had
applied Osborn to any other set of facts, and thereafter has repeatedly
reaffirmed its Osborn interpretation. Pp. 476-478.

2. The Court decides only the foregoing question. The Court of Appeals had no occasion to reach the Jeffers issue--whether the state

courts' application of the "utter disregard" circumstance to the facts of
this case violated the Constitution. See 497 U. S., at 783. Because
Creech is already entitled to resentencing in state court on the basis of
another of the Court of Appeals' rulings, the posture of the case makes
it unnecessary for this Court to reach his remaining arguments.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1981 Thomas Eugene Creech beat and kicked to deatha fellow inmate at the Idaho State Penitentiary. He pleaded

guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to death.The sentence was based in part on the statutory aggravating
circumstance that "[b]y the murder, or circumstancessurrounding its commission, the defendant exhibited utter
disregard for human life." Idaho Code $ 19-2515(g)(6) (1987).The sole question we must decide is whether the "utter disregard" circumstance, as interpreted by the Idaho SupremeCourt, adequately channels sentencing discretion as required
by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.

I
The facts underlying this case could not be more chilling.Thomas Creech has admitted to killing or participating in

the killing of at least 26 people. The bodies of 11 of hisvictims--who were shot, stabbed, beaten, or strangled to
death--have been recovered in seven States. Creech has

466 ARAVE v. CREECH

Opinion of the Court
said repeatedly that, unless he is completely isolated fromhumanity, he likely will continue killing. And he has identified by name three people outside prison walls he intends tokill if given the opportunity.

Creech's most recent victim was David Dale Jensen, a fel-low inmate in the maximum security unit of the Idaho State
Penitentiary. When he killed Jensen, Creech was alreadyserving life sentences for other first-degree murders. Jensen, about seven years Creech's junior, was a nonviolent carthief. He was also physically handicapped. Part of Jensen's brain had been removed prior to his incarceration, andhe had a plastic plate in his skull.

The circumstances surrounding Jensen's death remain un-clear, primarily because Creech has given conflicting accounts of them. In one version, Creech killed Jensen in self-defense. In another--the version that Creech gave at his
sentencing hearing--other inmates offered to pay Creech orhelp him escape if he killed Jensen. Creech, through an intermediary, provided Jensen with makeshift weapons andthen arranged for Jensen to attack him, in order to create an
excuse for the killing. Whichever of these accounts (ifeither) is true, the Idaho Supreme Court found that the record supported the following facts:

"Jensen approached Creech and swung a weapon at himwhich consisted of a sock containing batteries. Creech

took the weapon away from Jensen, who returned to hiscell but emerged with a toothbrush to which had been
taped a razor blade. When the two men again met, Jen-sen made some movement toward Creech, who then
struck Jensen between the eyes with the battery ladensock, knocking Jensen to the floor. The fight continued,
according to Creech's version, with Jensen swinging therazor blade at Creech and Creech hitting Jensen with
the battery filled sock. The plate imbedded in Jensen'sskull shattered, and blood from Jensen's skull was
splashed on the floor and walls. Finally, the sock broke

and the batteries fell out, and by that time Jensen washelpless. Creech then commenced kicking Jensen about

the throat and head. Sometime later a guard noticedblood, and Jensen was taken to the hospital, where he
died the same day." State v. Creech, 105 Idaho 362, 364,670 P. 2d 463, 465 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U. S. 1051
(1984).
Creech pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The trialjudge held a sentencing hearing in accordance with Idaho

Code $ 19-2515(d) (1987). After the hearing, the judge is-sued written findings in the format prescribed by Rule 33.1
of the Idaho Criminal Rules. Under the heading "Facts andArgument Found in Mitigation," he listed that Creech "did
not instigate the fight with the victim, but the victim, with-out provocation, attacked him. [Creech] was initially justified in protecting himself." App. 32. Under the heading"Facts and Argumen[t] Found in Aggravation," the judge
stated:

"[T]he victim, once the attack commenced, was underthe complete domination and control of the defendant.

The murder itself was extremely gruesome evidencingan excessive violent rage. With the victim's attack as
an excuse, the . . . murder then took on many of theaspects of an assassination. These violent actions . . .
went well beyond self-defense.. . . . .

". . . The murder, once commenced, appears to havebeen an intentional, calculated act."

Id., at 32-33.

The judge then found beyond a reasonable doubt five statu-tory aggravating circumstances, including that Creech, "[b]y

the murder, or circumstances surrounding its commission, . . .exhibited utter disregard for human life."

Id., at 34. Heobserved in this context that "[a]fter the victim was helpless

[Creech] killed him." Ibid. Next, the judge concluded thatthe mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the aggravat507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:54 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ing circumstances. Reiterating that Creech "intentionallydestroyed another human being at a time when he was completely helpless," ibid., the judge sentenced Creech to death.After temporarily remanding for the trial judge to impose
sentence in open court in Creech's presence, the Idaho Su-preme Court affirmed. The court rejected Creech's argument that the "utter disregard" circumstance is unconstitu-tionally vague, reaffirming the limiting construction it had
placed on the statutory language in State v. Osborn, 102Idaho 405, 631 P. 2d 187 (1981):

" `A . . . limiting construction must be placed upon theaggravating circumstances in I. C. $ 19-2515[g](6), that
"[b]y the murder, or the circumstances surrounding itscommission, the defendant exhibited utter disregard for
human life." To properly define this circumstance, it isimportant to note the other aggravating circumstances
with which this provision overlaps. The second aggra-vating circumstance, I. C. $ 19-2515[g](2), that the defendant committed another murder at the time thismurder was committed, obviously could show an utter
disregard for human life, as could the third aggravatingcircumstance, I. C. $ 19-2515[g](3), that the defendant
knowingly created a great risk of death to many per-sons. The same can be said for the fourth aggravating
circumstance, I. C. $ 19-2515[g](4), that the murder wascommitted for remuneration. Since we will not presume that the legislative intent was to duplicate any al-ready enumerated circumstance, thus making [the "utter
disregard" circumstance] mere surplusage, we hold thatthe phrase "utter disregard" must be viewed in reference to acts other than those set forth in I. C. $$ 19-2515[g](2), (3), and (4). We conclude instead that the
phrase is meant to be reflective of acts or circumstancessurrounding the crime which exhibit the highest, the
utmost, callous disregard for human life, i. e., thecold-blooded, pitiless slayer.' " Creech, supra, at 370,

670 P. 2d, at 471 (quoting Osborn, supra, at 418-419,631 P. 2d, at 200-201) (citation omitted).

After independently reviewing the record, the Idaho Su-preme Court also held that the evidence clearly supported
the trial judge's findings of aggravating and mitigating cir-cumstances, including the finding that Creech had exhibited
"utter disregard for human life." 105 Idaho, at 369, 670P. 2d, at 470. Then, as required by Idaho law, see Idaho
Code $ 19-2827(c)(3) (1987), the court compared Creech's caseto similar cases in order to determine whether his sentence
was excessive or disproportionate. The court emphaticallyconcluded that it was not: "We have examined cases dating
back more than 50 years and our examination fails to disclosethat any such remorseless, calculating, cold-blooded multiple
murderer has . . . ever been before this Court." 105 Idaho,at 375, 670 P. 2d, at 476 (footnote omitted).

Creech filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus inthe United States District Court for the District of Idaho.
The District Court denied relief. See Creech v. Arave,No. 86-1042 (June 18, 1986). The Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, however, agreed with Creech that the "utterdisregard" circumstance is unconstitutionally vague. 947
F. 2d 873 (1991). The court first considered the statutorylanguage itself and concluded that the phrase "utter disregard" does not adequately channel sentencing discretion.
Id., at 882-883. The court then considered the Osbornnarrowing construction and found it unsatisfactory as well.

Explaining what "utter disregard" does not mean, the Courtof Appeals reasoned, does not give the phrase content. 947
F. 2d, at 883, n. 12. Nor do the words " `the highest, theutmost, callous disregard for human life' " clarify the statutory language; they merely emphasize it. Id., at 883-884(citing

Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, 364 (1988)).The phrase "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" also was deemed

inadequate. The Court of Appeals construed our prece-dents, including Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), to

Opinion of the Court
require that a limiting construction "defin[e] the terms of thestatutory aggravating circumstance through objective standards." 947 F. 2d, at 884. "[C]old-blooded, pitiless slayer"fails, the court said, because it calls for a "subjective determination." Ibid. The court found further evidence of the
Osborn construction's infirmity in its application to this case.In the Court of Appeals' view, the trial judge's findings that

Jensen attacked Creech "without provocation" and that themurder " `evidenc[ed] an excessive violent rage' " could not
be reconciled with the conclusion that Creech was a "cold-blooded, pitiless" killer. 947 F. 2d, at 884. The Court of
Appeals therefore found the "utter disregard" circumstancefacially invalid.

Id., at 884-885.Three judges dissented from an order denying rehearing

en banc. The dissenters argued that the panel had miscon-strued both the "utter disregard" factor and this Court's
prior decisions. Whether a defendant is a "cold-blooded,pitiless slayer," they said, is not a subjective inquiry; it is an
evidentiary question to be determined from facts and circum-stances.

Id., at 890 (opinion of Trott, J.). The dissentersfound the Osborn limiting construction indistinguishable

from the construction this Court approved in Walton. 947F. 2d, at 890. We granted certiorari, limited to the narrow
question whether the "utter disregard" circumstance, as in-terpreted by the Idaho Supreme Court in Osborn, is unconstitutionally vague. See 504 U. S. 984 (1992).

II
This case is governed by the standards we articulated in
Walton, supra, and Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764 (1990). In
Jeffers we reaffirmed the fundamental principle that, to sat-isfy the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, a capital sentencing scheme must " `suitably direc[t] and limi[t]' " the sen-tencer's discretion " `so as to minimize the risk of wholly
arbitrary and capricious action.' " Id., at 774 (quoting Greggv. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 189 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart,

507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)). The State must " `channel thesentencer's discretion by clear and objective standards that

provide specific and detailed guidance, and that make ration-ally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of
death.' " 497 U. S., at 774 (quoting Godfrey v. Georgia, 446
U. S. 420, 428 (1980) (plurality opinion) (internal quotationmarks omitted)).

In Walton we set forth the inquiry that a federal courtmust undertake when asked to decide whether a particular
aggravating circumstance meets these standards:

"[The] federal court . . . must first determine whether
the statutory language defining the circumstance is itselftoo vague to provide any guidance to the sentencer. If

so, then the federal court must attempt to determinewhether the state courts have further defined the vague
terms and, if they have done so, whether those defini-tions are constitutionally sufficient,

i. e., whether they
provide some guidance to the sentencer." 497 U. S., at
654 (emphasis in original).

Where, as in Idaho, the sentencer is a judge rather than ajury, the federal court must presume that the judge knew

and applied any existing narrowing construction. Id., at653.

Unlike the Court of Appeals, we do not believe it is necessary to decide whether the statutory phrase "utter disregardfor human life" itself passes constitutional muster. The

Idaho Supreme Court has adopted a limiting construction,and we believe that construction meets constitutional
requirements.

Contrary to the dissent's assertions, see post, at 481-485,
the phrase "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" is not without
content. Webster's Dictionary defines "pitiless" to mean
devoid of, or unmoved by, mercy or compassion. Webster's
Third New International Dictionary 1726 (1986). The lead
entry for "cold-blooded" gives coordinate definitions. One,

507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT
472 ARAVE v. CREECH

Opinion of the Court
"marked by absence of warm feelings: without consideration,compunction, or clemency,"

id., at 442, mirrors the definition
of "pitiless." The other defines "cold-blooded" to mean"matter of fact, emotionless."

Ibid. It is true that "coldblooded" is sometimes also used to describe "premedita[tion]," Black's Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990)--amental state that may coincide with, but is distinct from, a

lack of feeling or compassion. But premeditation is clearlynot the sense in which the Idaho Supreme Court used the
word "cold-blooded" in Osborn. Other terms in the limit-ing construction--"callous" and "pitiless"--indicate that
the court used the word "cold-blooded" in its first sense.
"Premedita[tion]," moreover, is specifically addressed elsewhere in the Idaho homicide statutes, Idaho Code $ 18-
4003(a) (1987) (amended version at Supp. 1992); had the
Osborn court meant premeditation, it likely would have used
the statutory language.

In ordinary usage, then, the phrase "cold-blooded, pitiless
slayer" refers to a killer who kills without feeling or sympathy. We assume that legislators use words in their ordinary,
everyday senses, see, e. g., INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U. S. 183,
189 (1984), and there is no reason to suppose that judges do
otherwise. The dissent questions our resort to dictionaries
for the common meaning of the word "cold-blooded," post, at
482, but offers no persuasive authority to suggest that the
word, in its present context, means anything else.

The Court of Appeals thought the Osborn limiting construction inadequate not because the phrase "cold-blooded,
pitiless slayer" lacks meaning, but because it requires the
sentencer to make a "subjective determination." We disagree. We are not faced with pejorative adjectives such as
"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" or "outrageously or
wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman"--terms that describe a
crime as a whole and that this Court has held to be unconstitutionally vague. See, e. g., Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1
(1990) (per curiam); Cartwright, 486 U. S., at 363-364; God507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT

473Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
frey, supra, at 428-429. The terms "cold-blooded" and "piti-less" describe the defendant's state of mind: not his

mens
rea, but his attitude toward his conduct and his victim. Thelaw has long recognized that a defendant's state of mind is

not a "subjective" matter, but a fact to be inferred from the
surrounding circumstances. See United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716-717 (1983)
(" `The state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state ofhis digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove . . . ,

but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anythingelse' " (quoting

Edgington v. Fitzmaurice, 29 Ch. Div. 459,
483 (1885))).

Determining whether a capital defendant killed without
feeling or sympathy is undoubtedly more difficult than, for
example, determining whether he "was previously convicted
of another murder," Idaho Code $ 19-2515(g)(1) (1987). But
that does not mean that a State cannot, consistent with the
Federal Constitution, authorize sentencing judges to make
the inquiry and to take their findings into account when deciding whether capital punishment is warranted. This is the
import of Walton. In that case we considered Arizona's "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved" circumstance. The Arizona Supreme Court had held that a crime is committed in
a "depraved" manner when the perpetrator " `relishes the
murder, evidencing debasement or perversion,' or `shows an
indifference to the suffering of the victim and evidences a
sense of pleasure' in the killing." Walton, supra, at 655
(quoting State v. Walton, 159 Ariz. 571, 587, 769 P. 2d 1017,
1033 (1989)). We concluded that this construction adequately guided sentencing discretion, even though "the
proper degree of definition of an aggravating factor of this
nature is not susceptible of mathematical precision." 497
U. S., at 655; accord, Jeffers, 497 U. S., at 777; cf. Proffitt v.
Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 260 (1976) (White, J., concurring in
judgment) (approving Florida statutory aggravating circumstances that, "although . . . not susceptible of mechanical ap507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT
474 ARAVE v. CREECH

Opinion of the Court
plication . . . are by no means so vague and overbroad as to
leave the discretion of the sentencing authority unfettered").

The language at issue here is no less "clear and objective"
than the language sustained in Walton. Whether a defendant "relishes" or derives "pleasure" from his crime arguably
may be easier to determine than whether he acts without
feeling or sympathy, since enjoyment is an affirmative mental state, whereas the cold-bloodedness inquiry in a sense
requires the sentencer to find a negative. But we do not
think so subtle a distinction has constitutional significance.
The Osborn limiting construction, like the one upheld in
Walton, defines a state of mind that is ascertainable from
surrounding facts. Accordingly, we decline to invalidate
the "utter disregard" circumstance on the ground that the
Idaho Supreme Court's limiting construction is insufficiently "objective."

Of course, it is not enough for an aggravating circumstance, as construed by the state courts, to be determinate.
Our precedents make clear that a State's capital sentencing
scheme also must "genuinely narrow the class of persons
eligible for the death penalty." Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.
862, 877 (1983). When the purpose of a statutory aggravating circumstance is to enable the sentencer to distinguish
those who deserve capital punishment from those who do
not, the circumstance must provide a principled basis for
doing so. See Jeffers, supra, at 776; Godfrey, 446 U. S., at
433. If the sentencer fairly could conclude that an aggravating circumstance applies to every defendant eligible for the
death penalty, the circumstance is constitutionally infirm.
See Cartwright, supra, at 364 (invalidating aggravating circumstance that "an ordinary person could honestly believe"
described every murder); Godfrey, supra, at 428-429 ("A
person of ordinary sensibility could fairly characterize almost every murder as `outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman' ").

475Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Although the question is close, we believe the Osborn con-struction satisfies this narrowing requirement. The class of

murderers eligible for capital punishment under Idaho law isdefined broadly to include all first-degree murderers. Idaho
Code $ 18-4004 (1987). And the category of first-degree
murderers is also broad. It includes premeditated murdersand those carried out by means of poison, lying in wait, or

certain kinds of torture. $ 18-4003(a). In addition, mur-ders that otherwise would be classified as second degree,

$ 18-4003(g)--including homicides committed without "con-siderable provocation" or under circumstances demonstrating "an abandoned and malignant heart" (a term of art that
refers to unintentional homicide committed with extreme
recklessness, see American Law Institute, Model Penal Code

$ 210.2(1)(b) Comment, n. 4 (1980)), Idaho Code $$ 18-4001,
18-4002 (1987)--become first degree if they are accompanied
by one of a number of enumerated circumstances. For example, murders are classified as first degree when the victim
is a fellow prison inmate, $ 18-4003(e), or a law enforcement
or judicial officer performing official duties, $ 18-4003(b);
when the defendant is already serving a sentence for murder,

$ 18-4003(c); and when the murder occurs during a prison
escape, $ 18-4003(f), or the commission or attempted commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary, kidnaping, or mayhem, $ 18-4003(d). In other words, a sizable class of even
those murderers who kill with some provocation or without
specific intent may receive the death penalty under Idaho
law.

We acknowledge that, even within these broad categories,
the word "pitiless," standing alone, might not narrow the
class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. A sentencing judge might conclude that every first-degree murderer is "pitiless," because it is difficult to imagine how a
person with any mercy or compassion could kill another
human being without justification. Given the statutory
scheme, however, we believe that a sentencing judge reason507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT
476 ARAVE v. CREECH

Opinion of the Court
ably could find that not all Idaho capital defendants are "cold-blooded." That is because some within the broad class of

first-degree murderers do exhibit feeling. Some, for exam-ple, kill with anger, jealousy, revenge, or a variety of other
emotions. In Walton we held that Arizona could treat capital defendants who take pleasure in killing as more deserv-ing of the death penalty than those who do not. Idaho similarly has identified the subclass of defendants who killwithout feeling or sympathy as more deserving of death.
By doing so, it has narrowed in a meaningful way the cate-gory of defendants upon whom capital punishment may be
imposed.

Creech argues that the Idaho courts have not applied the
"utter disregard" circumstance consistently. He points out
that the courts have found defendants to exhibit "utter disregard" in a wide range of cases. This, he claims, demonstrates that the circumstance is nothing more than a catchall. The dissent apparently agrees. See post, at 485-487.
The State, in turn, offers its own review of the cases and
contends that they are consistent. In essence, the parties
and the dissent would have us determine the facial constitutionality of the "utter disregard" circumstance, as construed
in Osborn, by examining applications of the circumstance in
cases not before us.

As an initial matter, we do not think the fact that "[a]ll
kinds of . . . factors," post, at 486, may demonstrate the requisite state of mind renders the Osborn construction facially
invalid. That the Idaho courts may find first-degree murderers to be "cold-blooded" and "pitiless" in a wide range of
circumstances is unsurprising. It also is irrelevant to the
question before us. We did not undertake a comparative

challenge to the state court's proportionality review). And

Opinion of the Court
courts properly have applied an aggravating circumstanceis separate from the question whether the circumstance, as

narrowed, is facially valid. See 497 U. S., at 778-780. Tobe sure, we previously have examined other state decisions
when the construction of an aggravating circumstance has
been unclear. In Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527 (1992), forexample, the argument was that the state courts had not

adhered to a single limiting construction of Florida's "hei-nous, atrocious, or cruel" circumstance.

Id., at 536-537; see
also Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S., at 255, n. 12 ( joint opinionof Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.) (reviewing other cases
to establish that the state courts had construed an aggravating circumstance consistently). Under our precedents, a
federal court may consider state court formulations of a limiting construction to ensure that they are consistent. But
our decisions do not authorize review of state court cases to
determine whether a limiting construction has been applied consistently.

A comparative analysis of state court cases, moreover,
would be particularly inappropriate here. The Idaho Supreme Court upheld Creech's death sentence in 1983--before
it had applied Osborn to any other set of facts. None of the
decisions on which the dissent relies, or upon which Creech
asks us to invalidate his death sentence, influenced either the
trial judge who sentenced Creech or the appellate judges
who upheld the sentence. And there is no question that Idaho's formulation of its limiting construction has been consistent. The Idaho Supreme Court has reaffirmed its original
interpretation of "utter disregard" repeatedly, often reciting
the definition given in Osborn verbatim. See, e. g., State v.
Card, 121 Idaho 425, 435-436, 825 P. 2d 1081, 1091-1092
(1991) (citing cases), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 915 (1992). It
also has explained that "utter disregard" differs from Idaho's
"heinous, atrocious or cruel" aggravating circumstance,
Idaho Code $ 19-2515(g)(5) (1987), because the Osborn construction focuses on the defendant's state of mind. State v.

denied, 493 U. S. 917 (1989). In light of the consistent nar-rowing definition given the "utter disregard" circumstance

Creech argues alternatively that the "utter disregard" cir-cumstance, even if facially valid, does not apply to him. He

suggests--as did the Court of Appeals and as does the dis-sent,

post, at 488--that the trial judge's findings that he wasprovoked and that he exhibited an "excessive violent rage"

are irreconcilable with a finding of "utter disregard." TheIdaho Supreme Court, Creech claims, did not cure the error
on appeal. There also appears to be some question whetherthe other murders that Creech has committed, and the selfdefense explanations he has offered for some of them, bearon the "utter disregard" determination. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 5-7, 18-21; cf. post, at 488, n. 15.These are primarily questions of state law. As we said
in Jeffers, a state court's application of a valid aggravatingcircumstance violates the Constitution only if "no reasonable
sentencer" could find the circumstance to exist. 497 U. S.,at 783. The Court of Appeals had no occasion to decide the
Jeffers issue in this case, since it found the "utter disregard"circumstance facially vague. The posture of the case, moreover, makes it unnecessary for us to reach the remainingarguments. The Court of Appeals granted Creech relief on
two other claims: that the trial judge improperly refused toallow him to present new mitigating evidence when he was
resentenced in open court, and that the judge applied twoaggravating circumstances without making a finding required under state law. See 947 F. 2d, at 881-882. On the

basis of the first claim, Creech is entitled to resentencing instate trial court. Id., at 882. Accordingly, we hold today

only that the "utter disregard" circumstance, as defined inOsborn, on its face meets constitutional requirements. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed inpart, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

Confronted with an insupportable limiting construction ofan unconstitutionally vague statute, the majority in turn concocts its own limiting construction of the state court's formu-lation. Like "nonsense upon stilts,"

1 however, the majority's reconstruction only highlights the deficient character ofthe nebulous formulation that it seeks to advance. Because

the metaphor "cold-blooded" by which Idaho defines its"utter disregard" circumstance is both vague and unenlightening, and because the majority's recasting of that metaphoris not dictated by common usage, legal usage, or the usage
of the Idaho courts, the statute fails to provide meaningfulguidance to the sentencer as required by the Constitution.
Accordingly, I dissent. I

I discuss the applicable legal standards only briefly, be-cause, for the most part, I agree with the majority about
what is required in a case of this kind. As the majorityacknowledges,

ante, at 474, "an aggravating circumstance
must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for thedeath penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of

a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to othersfound guilty of murder."

877 (1983). A state court's limiting construction can save aflawed statute from unconstitutional vagueness, and where

the sentencer is a judge there is nothing wrong with "pre-sum[ing] that the judge knew and applied any existing narrowing construction." Ante, at 471. "The trial judge's fa-miliarity with the State Supreme Court's opinions, however,
will serve to narrow his discretion only if that body of caselaw articulates a construction of the aggravating circumstance that is coherent and consistent, and that meaningfullylimits the range of homicides to which the aggravating factor
will apply." Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 692 (1990)(dissenting opinion). We have "plainly rejected the submission that a particular set of facts surrounding a murder, how-ever shocking they might be, were enough in themselves,
and without some narrowing principle to apply to those facts,to warrant the imposition of the death penalty." Maynard

in some indeterminate way the circumstances of each case.

cause to believe that some murders somehow demonstrateonly partial, rather than "utter" disregard. Nor is there any

evidence that the phrase is intended to have a specializedmeaning--other than that presented by the Idaho Supreme
Court in its limiting constructions--that might successfullynarrow the eligible class. The question is whether

Osborn'slimiting construction saves the statute.

Under Osborn, an offense demonstrates "utter disregardfor human life" when the "acts or circumstances surrounding

the crime . . . exhibit the highest, the utmost, callous disre-gard for human life, i. e., the cold-blooded, pitiless slayer."
102 Idaho, at 419, 631 P. 2d, at 201. Jettisoning all but theterm, "cold-blooded," the majority contends that this cumbersome construction clearly singles out the killing com-mitted "without feeling or sympathy."

Ante, at 476. As aninitial matter, I fail to see how "without feeling or sympathy"

is meaningfully different from "devoid of . . . mercy or com-passion"--the definition of "pitiless" that the majority concedes to be constitutionally inadequate. See ante, at 471.Even if there is a distinction, however, the "without feeling
or sympathy" test, which never has been articulated by anyIdaho court, does not flow ineluctably from the phrase at
issue in this case: "cold-blooded." I must stress in this re-gard the rather obvious point that a "facial" challenge of this
nature--one alleging that a limiting construction providesinadequate guidance--cannot be defeated merely by a dem2 Of course, even if the phrase "utter disregard" were narrowing and
clear, a purported limiting construction from the State's high court that
actually undid any narrowing or clarity would render the statute unconstitutional. For example, if the statute allowed the death sentence where
the murder was committed for pay, but an authoritative construction from
the State Supreme Court told trial courts that the statute covered every
murder committed for "bad reasons," the state scheme would be unconstitutional. In the present case, any clarity that may be imparted, and any
channeling that may be done by the phrase, "utter disregard for human
life," is destroyed by the boundless and vague Osborn construction
adopted as the authoritative interpretation of the statute.

onstration that there exists a narrowing way to apply thecontested language. The entire point of the challenge is

that the language's susceptibility to a variety of interpreta-tions is what makes it (facially) unconstitutional. To save
the statute, the State must provide a construction that, onits face, reasonably can be expected to be applied in a consistent and meaningful way so as to provide the sentencerwith adequate guidance. The metaphor "cold-blooded" does
not do this.I begin with "ordinary usage." The majority points out
that the first definition in Webster's Dictionary underthe entry "cold-blooded" is " `marked by absence of warm
feelings: without consideration, compunction, or clemency.' "Ante, at 472, quoting Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 442 (1986). If Webster's' rendition of the term'sordinary meaning is to be credited, then Idaho has singled
out murderers who act without warm feelings: those whoact without consideration, compunction, or clemency. Obviously that definition is no more illuminating than the adjec-tive "pitiless" as defined by the majority. What murderer
does act with consideration or compunction or clemency? 3In its eagerness to boil the phrase down to a serviceable
core, the majority virtually ignores the very definition itcites. Instead, the majority comes up with a hybrid all its
own--"without feeling or sympathy"--and then goes onestep further, asserting that because the term "cold-blooded"
so obviously means "without feeling," it cannot refer as ordi-narily understood to murderers who "kill with anger, jealousy, revenge, or a variety of other emotions." Ante, at 476.That is incorrect. In everyday parlance, the term "coldblooded" routinely is used to describe killings that fall out-side the majority's definition. In the first nine weeks of this

priately, all murders.12 All these killings occurred with"feelings" of one kind or another. All were described as

cold-blooded. The majority's assertion that the Idaho con-struction narrows the class of capital defendants because it
rules out those who "kill with anger, jealousy, revenge, or a
variety of other emotions" clearly is erroneous, because inordinary usage the nebulous description "cold-blooded" simply is not limited to defendants who kill without emotion.In legal usage, the metaphor "cold blood" does have a specific meaning. "Cold blood" is used "to designate a willful,deliberate, and premeditated homicide." Black's Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990). As such, the term is used to dif-ferentiate between first- and second-degree murders.

13 For

example, in United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152 (1982), Jus12 See Longenecker, Penalizing Convicts, Chicago Tribune, Mar. 4, 1993,
p. 28 (letter) ("[L]egislation to expand the death penalty to include all
convicted murderers is long needed. . . . [I]f an individual commits coldblooded murder he should be removed from our society").

13 The line between the "ordinary" and the "legal" meaning of coldblooded, however, is not always obvious. On the one hand, judges sometimes casually use the phrase in a variety of senses. In those circumstances, contrary to the majority's assumptions, the term regularly is
applied to crimes committed "with anger, jealousy, revenge, or a variety
of other emotions." See, e. g., McWilliams v. Estelle, 378 F. Supp. 1380,
1383 (SD Tex. 1974) ("It was the theory of the prosecution that the store
owner refused to serve petitioner, that he became angry, went to his hotel
room, returned with a pistol, and shot the owner in cold blood"), appeal
dism'd, 507 F. 2d 1278 (CA5 1975); People v. Sullivan, 183 Ill. App. 3d 175,
180, 538 N. E. 2d 1376, 1380 (1989) (the defendant "exhibited repeatedly a
very jealous, violent nature. . . . The trial court concluded that if the situation were to arise again, defendant in all probability would kill in cold
blood again"); People v. Yates, 65 Ill. App. 3d 319, 325, 382 N. E. 2d 505,
510 (1978) ("This record reveals a concerted, deliberate attack by Shirley
and Emma Yates against their victim, motivated . . . by cold-blooded revenge"). On the other hand, in ordinary parlance the term "cold-blooded"
sometimes is used to mean "premeditated." See, e. g., Reward Offered in
Slaying of 2 Women in Shadow Park, Los Angeles Times, Jan. 21, 1993,
p. J2 (quoting mayor's statement: " `This was one of those in-cold-blood
killings, not just a drive-by or random shooting. It was premeditated' ").

tice O'Connor, writing for the Court, described the Districtof Columbia's homicide statute: " `In homespun terminology,

intentional murder is in the first degree if committed in coldblood, and is murder in the second degree if committed on
impulse or in the sudden heat of passion.' " Id., at 170, n. 18,
quoting Austin v. United States, 127 U. S. App. D. C. 180,188, 382 F. 2d 129, 137 (1967). Murder in cold blood is, in

this sense, the opposite of murder in "hot blood." Arguably,then, the

Osborn formulation covers every intentional or
first-degree murder. An aggravating circumstance so con-strued would clearly be unconstitutional under

Godfrey.
Finally, I examine the construction's application by the
Idaho courts. The majority acknowledges the appropriateness of examining "other state decisions when the construction of an aggravating circumstance has been unclear," such
as where state courts have not adhered to a single limiting
construction. Ante, at 477. Here, however, the majority
believes such an inquiry is "irrelevant," ante, at 476, because
"there is no question that Idaho's formulation of its limiting
construction has been consistent," ante, at 477. The majority misses the point. Idaho's application of the Osborn
formulation is relevant not because that formulation has
been inconsistently invoked, but because the construction
has never meant what the majority says it does. In other
words, it is the majority's reconstruction of the (unconstitutional) construction that has not been applied consistently
(or ever, for that matter). If, for example, a State declared
that "jaberwocky" was an aggravating circumstance, and
then carefully invoked "jaberwocky" in every one of its capital cases, this Court could not simply decide that "jaberwocky" means "killing a police officer" and then dispense
with any inquiry into whether the term ever had been understood in that way by the State's courts, simply because the
"jaberwocky" construction consistently had been reaffirmed.

An examination of the Idaho cases reveals that the Osborn
formulation is not much better than "jaberwocky." As

noted above, the Idaho courts never have articulated any-thing remotely approaching the majority's novel "those who

kill without feeling or sympathy" interpretation. All kindsof other factors, however, have been invoked by Idaho courts
applying the circumstance. For example, in State v. Aragon, 107 Idaho 358, 690 P. 2d 293 (1984), the killer's cold-bloodedness supposedly was demonstrated by his refusal to

render aid to his victim and the fact that "[h]is only concernwas to cover up his own participation in the incident."

Id.,
at 367, 690 P. 2d, at 302. In State v. Pizzuto, 119 Idaho 742,774, 810 P. 2d 680, 712 (1991), a finding of "utter disregard"

was held to be supported by evidence that the defendant
"approached Mr. Herndon with a gun, then made him drop
his pants and crawl into the cabin where he proceeded to
bludgeon the skulls of both of his victims with a hammer.
He then left them lying on the floor to die and Mr. Herndon
was left lying on the floor of the cabin convulsing." And, in
the present case, the trial judge's determination that Creech
exhibited utter disregard for human life appears to have
been based primarily on the fact that Creech had "intentionally destroyed another human being at a time when he was
completely helpless." App. 34. Each of these characteristics is frightfully deplorable, but what they have to do with
a lack of emotion--or with each other, for that matter--
eludes me. Without some rationalizing principle to connect
them, the findings of "cold-bloodedness" stand as nothing
more than fact-specific, "gut-reaction" conclusions that are
unconstitutional under Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S.
356 (1988).

The futility of the Idaho courts' attempt to bring some
rationality to the "utter disregard" circumstance is glaringly
evident in the sole post-Osborn case that endeavors to explain the construction in any depth. In State v. Fain, 116
Idaho 82, 774 P. 2d 252, cert. denied, 493 U. S. 917 (1989), the
court declared that the "utter disregard" factor refers to
"the defendant's lack of conscientious scruples against killing

another human being." Id., at 99, 744 P. 2d, at 269. Accord,State v. Card, 121 Idaho 425, 436, 825 P. 2d 1081, 1092 (1991).

Thus, the latest statement from the Idaho Supreme Courton the issue says nothing about emotionless crimes, but,
instead, sweepingly includes every murder committedthat is without " `conscientious scruples against killing.' "
I can imagine no crime that would not fall within thatconstruction.

Petitioner in his brief embraces Fain's broad construction."In every case in which the Idaho Supreme Court has upheld
a death sentence based wholly or in part on a finding of utterdisregard for human life, the defendant had acted without
conscientious scruple against killing." Brief for Petitioner25. Petitioner cites this reassuring fact as the "best evidence that Idaho's utter disregard factor is not so broad thatit operates simply as a catch-all for murders not covered by
other aggravating circumstances." Id., at 24. This "bestevidence" is not very good evidence, especially when viewed
against the fact that the Idaho Supreme Court never has
reversed a finding of utter disregard.14 Equally unsettlingis petitioner's frank admission that the

Osborn construction"does not make findings of the aggravating factors depend

on the presence of particular facts. Instead Idaho has cho-sen to rely on the ability of the sentencing judge to make
principled distinctions between capital and non-capital cases

14 The State suggests in its brief that on one occasion the Idaho Supreme
Court found that the evidence did not support an utter disregard finding.
Brief for Petitioner 27, citing State v. Charboneau, 116 Idaho 129, 774 P. 2d
299 (1989). It is not at all clear, however, that that is what occurred in
Charboneau. The court there vacated a sentence because it was "unclear
from the [trial court's] Findings whether the trial court would have imposed the death penalty without having [mistakenly] concluded that [the
victim] was not mortally wounded until the second volley of shots was
fired." Id., at 151, 774 P. 2d, at 321. There is no mention in this part of
the opinion of the "utter disregard" factor, nor any suggestion that the
erroneous finding tainted the "utter disregard" factor rather than the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" circumstance that was at issue in that case.

with guidance that is somewhat subjective . . . ." Brief forPetitioner 9. That kind of gestalt approach to capital sentencing is precisely what Cartwright and Godfrey forbid.Ultimately, it hardly seems necessary to look beyond the
record of this case to determine that either the majority'sconstruction is inadequate, or that there was insufficient evidence to support the "utter disregard" factor here. The rec-ord, which the majority takes pains to assure us "could not
be more chilling," ante, at 465,15 includes an explicit findingby the trial judge that Creech was the subject of an unprovoked attack and that the killing took place in an "excessiveviolent rage." App. 52. If Creech somehow is covered by
the "utter disregard" factor as understood by the majority(one who kills not with anger, but indifference,

ante, at 476),then there can be no doubt that the factor is so broad as to

cover any case. If Creech is not covered, then his sentencewas wrongly imposed.

III
Let me be clear about what the majority would have toshow in order to save the Idaho statute: that, on its face,

the Osborn construction--"the highest, the utmost, callousdisregard for human life, i. e., the cold-blooded, pitiless
slayer"--refers clearly and exclusively to crimes that occur"without feeling or sympathy," that is, to those that occur

15 I note that much of the majority's discussion of the "facts underlying
this case" centers on Creech's other crimes--which obviously do not bear
on whether "[b]y the murder, or circumstances surrounding its commission, the defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life"--and on the
argument, repeatedly rejected by the state courts, that Creech engineered
the fight with Jensen in order to create a pretext for killing him. The
Idaho Supreme Court explicitly noted that the trial court did not "find
that the murder had been performed on contract or by plan." State v.
Creech, 105 Idaho 362, 364, 670 P. 2d 463, 465 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U. S.
1051 (1984). In fact, the trial court not only found that Jensen's attack
was "unprovoked," but it went further and found that the unprovoked
nature of the attack actually constituted a mitigating factor. See App.
52.

without "anger, jealousy, revenge, or a variety of otheremotions." No such showing has been made.

There is, of course, something distasteful and absurd inthe very project of parsing this lexicon of death. But as

DELAWARE v. NEW YORK
on exceptions to report of special master
No. 111, Orig. Argued December 9, 1992--Decided March 30, 1993
Most of the funds at issue are unclaimed dividends, interest, and other

securities distributions held by intermediary banks, brokers, and depositories in their own names for beneficial owners who cannot be identified
or located. New York escheated $360 million in such funds held by
intermediaries doing business in that State, without regard to the beneficial owner's last known address or the intermediary's State of incorporation. After Delaware initiated this original action against New York,
alleging that certain of the securities were wrongfully escheated, the
Special Master filed a report recommending that this Court award the
right to escheat to the State in which the principal executive offices of
the securities issuer are located. Both Delaware and New York lodged
exceptions to the report.

Held: The State in which the intermediary is incorporated has the right

to escheat funds belonging to beneficial owners who cannot be identified
or located. Pp. 497-510.

(a) Under the primary and secondary rules adopted in Texas v. New
Jersey, 379 U. S. 674, 680-682, reaffirmed in Pennsylvania v. New York,
407 U. S. 206, and reaffirmed in this case, the Court resolves disputes
among States over the right to escheat abandoned intangible personal
property in three steps. First, the Court must determine the precise
debtor-creditor relationship, as defined by the law that created the property at issue. Second, because the property interest in any debt belongs to the creditor rather than the debtor, the primary rule gives the
first opportunity to escheat to the State of the creditor's last known
address, as shown by the debtor's books and records. Third, if the primary rule fails because the debtor's records disclose no address or because the creditor's last known address is in a State whose laws do not
provide for escheat, the secondary rule awards the right to escheat to
the State in which the debtor is incorporated. Pp. 497-500.

(b) Because the bulk of the abandoned distributions at issue cannot
be traced to any identifiable beneficial owner, much less one with a last
known address, these funds fall out of the primary rule and into the
secondary rule. P. 500.

(c) Intermediaries who hold unclaimed securities distributions in their
own names are the relevant "debtors." Issuers cannot be considered
"debtors" once they make distributions to intermediaries that are record

Syllabus
owners, since payment to a record owner discharges all of an issuer's
obligations to the beneficial owner under the Uniform Commercial Code,
which is the law in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Instead,
an intermediary serving as the record owner is the "debtor" insofar as it
has a contractual duty to transmit distributions to the beneficial owner.
Unlike an issuer, it remains liable should a "lost" beneficial owner reappear to collect distributions due under such a contract. The Master
thus erred in concluding that the issuer is the relevant "debtor," and
Delaware's and New York's exceptions in this regard are sustained.
Pp. 500-505.

(d) Precedent, efficiency, and equity dictate rejection of the second
major premise underlying the Master's recommendation: his proposal to
locate a corporate debtor in the jurisdiction of its principal domestic
executive offices rather than in the State of its incorporation. This sua
sponte proposal would change the Court's longstanding practice under
Texas and Pennsylvania. Moreover, as the Court recognized in Texas,
supra, at 680, the proposal would leave too much for decision on a caseby-case basis. The mere introduction of any factual controversy over
the location of a debtor's principal executive offices needlessly complicates an inquiry made irreducibly simple by Texas' adoption of a test
based on the State of incorporation. Finally, the proposal cannot survive independent of the Master's erroneous decision to treat the issuers
as the relevant "debtors." The arguably arbitrary decision to incorporate in one jurisdiction bears no less on a company's business activities
than the equally arbitrary decision to locate its principal offices in another jurisdiction, and there is no inequity in rewarding a State whose
laws prove more attractive to firms that wish to incorporate. Thus,
Delaware's exception to the Master's proposal in this regard is sustained. Pp. 505-507.

(e) New York's exception to the Master's application of the primary
rule is overruled. New York contends that many of the disputed funds
need not be escheated under the secondary rule because a statistical
analysis of the relevant transactions on the books of the debtor brokers
reveals creditor brokers, virtually all of whom have New York addresses. This proposal rests on the dubious supposition that the relevant "creditors" under the primary rule are other brokers, whereas this
Court has already held that "creditors" are the parties to whom the
intermediaries are contractually obligated to deliver unclaimed securities distributions. Moreover, the exception must fail because the Court
rejected a practically identical proposal in Pennsylvania, supra, at 214-
215. On remand, however, if New York or one of the other claimant
States can prove on a transaction-by-transaction basis that the creditors
who were owed particular distributions had last known addresses within

its borders or can provide some other proper mechanism for ascertaining those addresses, that State will prevail under the primary rule, and
the secondary rule will not control. Pp. 507-509.

(f) To depart from the Court's interstate escheat precedent by crafting different rules for the novel facts of each case would generate much
uncertainty and threaten much expensive litigation. If the States are
dissatisfied with the outcome of a particular case, they may air their
grievances before Congress, which may reallocate abandoned property
among them without regard to the Court's rules. P. 510.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this original action, we resolve another dispute amongStates that assert competing claims to abandoned intangible

personal property. Most of the funds at issue are unclaimedsecurities distributions held by intermediary banks, brokers,
and depositories for beneficial owners who cannot be identi-fied or located. The Special Master proposed awarding the
right to escheat such funds to the State in which the princi-pal executive offices of the securities issuer are located. Adhering to the rules announced in Texas v. New Jersey, 379U. S. 674 (1965), and Pennsylvania v. New York, 407 U. S.
206 (1972), we hold that the State in which the intermediaryis incorporated has the right to escheat funds belonging to
beneficial owners who cannot be identified or located.

Opinion of the Court

I
This case involves unclaimed dividends, interest, and otherdistributions made by issuers of securities. Such payments

are often channeled through financial intermediaries such asbanks, brokers, and depositories before they reach their beneficial owners. By arrangement with the beneficial owners,these intermediaries frequently hold securities in their own
names rather than in the names of the beneficial owners; as"record owners," the intermediaries are fully entitled to receive distributions based on those securities.1 This practiceof holding securities in "nominee name" or "street name" facilitates the offering of customized financial services such ascash management accounts,

2 brokerage margin accounts,3

discretionary trusts,4 and dividend reinvestment programs.5Street name accounts also permit changes in beneficial ownership to be effected through book entries rather than theunwieldy physical transfer of securities certificates. See
Brown, The Shareholder Communication Rules and the Secu-rities and Exchange Commission: An Exercise in Regulatory

1 An individual investor who opts to retain record ownership of a security will receive distributions directly from the issuer. This case does not
concern transactions of this sort.

2 In a cash management account, the broker holds, rather than distributes, dividends and interest paid on a customer's securities. The
customer withdraws funds through a check-like negotiable instrument
and receives interest on held funds, typically at a rate higher than that
offered on passbook savings accounts and negotiable-order-of-withdrawal
accounts.

3 In a brokerage margin account, the broker holds the customer's securities as collateral against any margin debt generated by the customer's
stock market transactions. Dividends and other distributions may be
credited against a customer's margin debt to the broker.

4 In a discretionary trust, the financial institution as trustee enjoys the

discretion not to distribute current income but rather to accumulate it for
further investment.

5 In a dividend reinvestment program, the beneficial owner authorizes

the broker to use dividends to purchase additional shares and fractional
shares.

Opinion of the Court
Utility or Futility?, 13 J. Corp. L. 683, 688-691 (1988). Theeconomies of scale attained in the modern financial services

industry are epitomized by the securities depository, a largeinstitution that holds only the accounts of "participant" brokers and banks and serves as a clearinghouse for its partici-pants' securities transactions. Because a depository retains
record ownership of securities, it effectively "immobilizes"the certificates in its possession by allowing its participants
to trade securities without the physical transfer of certifi-cates. Most of the equity securities traded on the New York
Stock Exchange are immobilized in this fashion. See App.to Report of the Special Master B-2. Cf. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Division of Market Regulation,Progress and Prospects: Depository Immobilization of Securities and Use of Book-Entry Systems 4 (1985).The intermediaries are unable to distribute a small portion
of the securities to their beneficial owners.6 When an inter-mediary claims no property interest in funds so held, they
become escheatable.7 Between 1985 and 1989, New York es-cheated $360 million in funds of abandoned securities held
for more than three years by intermediaries doing businessin New York, without regard to the last known address of the
beneficial owner or the intermediary's State of incorporation.N. Y. Aband. Prop. Law $ 511 (McKinney 1991). See Report
of Special Master 10, n. 9. Alleging that certain of thesesecurities were wrongfully escheated, Delaware sought leave
in 1988 to initiate an original action in this Court against

6 Approximately 0.02% of funds distributed through intermediaries cannot be traced to their beneficial owners. This low percentage nevertheless accounts for a very substantial amount of escheatable property. See
Report of Special Master 10, n. 9.

States as sovereigns may take custody of or assume titleto abandoned personal property as bona vacantia, a process

commonly (though somewhat erroneously) called escheat.9See, e. g., Christianson v. King County, 239 U. S. 356, 365-
366 (1915); Cunnius v. Reading School Dist., 198 U. S. 458,469-476 (1905); Hamilton v. Brown, 161 U. S. 256, 263-264
(1896). No serious controversy can arise between Statesseeking to escheat "tangible property, real or personal," for
"it has always been the unquestioned rule in all jurisdictionsthat only the State in which the property is located may es8 In a joint brief, Michigan, Maryland, Nebraska, and the District of
Columbia filed two exceptions to the Master's report.

escheat, but was subject only to the right of appropriation by the sovereign as bona vacantia." Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, 321 U. S. 233,
240 (1944). See generally 7 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law
495-496 (2d ed. 1937). Our opinions, however, have understood "escheat"
as encompassing the appropriation of both real and personal property, and
we use the term in that broad sense.

Opinion of the Court
cheat." Texas v. New Jersey, 379 U. S., at 677. On the
other hand, intangible property "is not physical matter
which can be located on a map," ibid., and frequently no single State can claim an uncontested right to escheat such
property.

In Texas v. New Jersey, we discharged "our responsibility
in the exercise of our original jurisdiction" to resolve escheat
disputes that "the States separately are without constitutional power . . . to settle." Ibid.10 We adopted two rules
intended to "settle the question of which State will be allowed to escheat [abandoned] intangible property." Ibid.
"[S]ince a debt is property of the creditor, not of the debtor,"
we reasoned, "fairness among the States requires that the
right and power to escheat the debt should be accorded to
the State of the creditor's last known address as shown by
the debtor's books and records." Id., at 680-681 (footnote
omitted). This primary rule had the virtue of "involv[ing]
a factual issue simple and easy to resolve," made even simpler by the Court's resort to "last known address, rather
than technical legal concepts of residence and domicile."
Id., at 681. It also achieved rough equity in that it "tend[ed]
to distribute escheats among the States in the proportion
of the commercial activities of their residents." Ibid. We
recognized, however, that the primary rule could not resolve
escheat claims over "property owed persons (1) as to whom
there is no record of any address at all, or (2) whose last
known address is in a State which does not provide for escheat of the property owed them." Id., at 682. For these
situations, we adopted a secondary rule awarding the right
to escheat to the debtor's "State of corporate domicile," subject to the claims of the State with "a superior right to escheat" under the primary rule. Ibid. We characterized the
Texas scheme as "the fairest, . . . easy to apply, and in the

Opinion of the Court
long run . . . the most generally acceptable to all the States."
Id., at 683.

We reaffirmed Texas in Pennsylvania v. New York, 407U. S. 206 (1972).

Texas had involved the relatively simple
case of a debtor that "disclaimed any interest" in "various
small debts . . . owed to . . . small creditors who ha[d] neverappeared to collect them."

Texas, supra, at 676, 675. In
Pennsylvania, by contrast, the Western Union Companyheld proceeds left unclaimed because Western Union was unable to locate the payee of a money order or to make a refundto the sender or because drafts issued by Western Union
were not negotiated. See 407 U. S., at 208-209; Western
Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania, 368 U. S. 71, 72-73
(1961). Because Western Union did not "regularly record
the addresses of its money order creditors," the primary rule
would rarely apply, and the debtor's State of incorporation--
Western Union's "corporate domicile"--would "receive a
much larger share of the unclaimed funds" under the secondary rule. Pennsylvania, 407 U. S., at 214. In response to
this perceived injustice, other States advocated a rule allowing the State of "the place of purchase" to escheat under the
primary rule. We nevertheless adhered to our decision in
Texas. The "only arguable" difference between money orders and the obligations at issue in Texas lay in the fact that
money orders "involve a higher percentage of unknown addresses." 407 U. S., at 214. We reasoned that neither this
distinction nor the resulting "likelihood of a `windfall' " for
the debtor's State of incorporation would justify the "carving
out [of an] exception to the Texas rule." Ibid.

We therefore resolve disputes among States over the right
to escheat intangible personal property in the following
three steps. First, we must determine the precise debtorcreditor relationship as defined by the law that creates the
property at issue. Second, because the property interest in
any debt belongs to the creditor rather than the debtor, the
primary rule gives the first opportunity to escheat to the

500 DELAWARE v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
State of "the creditor's last known address as shown by thedebtor's books and records." Texas, supra, at 680-681. Finally, if the primary rule fails because the debtor's recordsdisclose no address for a creditor or because the creditor's
last known address is in a State whose laws do not providefor escheat, the secondary rule awards the right to escheat
to the State in which the debtor is incorporated. Theserules arise from our "authority and duty to determine for
[ourselves] all questions that pertain" to a controversy be-tween States,

Kentucky v. Indiana, 281 U. S. 163, 176 (1930),and no State may supersede them by purporting to prescribe

a different priority under state law.

III
None of the parties contests the primary rule or the Mas-ter's recommendation that "where the state of domicile of an

unlocatable entitled recipient is known, through finding a lastknown address, that state may take custody of the unclaimed
distributions." Report of Special Master 56-57 (footnoteomitted).

11 The bulk of the abandoned distributions at

issue, however, cannot be traced to any identifiable beneficialowner, much less one with a last known address. These

funds thus fall out of the primary rule and into the secondaryrule. Consequently, under Texas and Pennsylvania, the
debtor's State of incorporation should be entitled to escheatthis unclaimed property. The Master's report concludes,
first, that the issuer of securities is the relevant "debtor"and, second, that the State in which the debtor's "principal
executive offices" are located should be considered the debt-or's State. We reject both of these recommendations.

A
"[W]here the entitled recipient's domicile is undetermin-able (no last known address), but the state of domicile of the

originator of the distribution is known," the Master recom-mended that the originator's State be awarded the right to

escheat, "whether or not the originator would have beenentitled to receive the funds back in its own right." Report
of Special Master 57. Because he construed the use of the
terms "debtor" and "creditor" in Texas and Pennsylvaniaas a merely "descriptive . . . attempt to identify the relevant

parties" rather than "prescriptive legal commands," Reportof Special Master 29, the Master defined "debtor" as "the
last owner of the funds, in the sense of the last person whohad a claim to the funds as an asset that would appropriately
be reflected in the net worth of the entity in question," id.,
at 32. In its first exception, Delaware argues that "the Report's recommendation in this regard does not comport with
the ordinary meaning of the words `debtor' and `creditor,' is
inconsistent with universally-accepted state and common law
and with the principles underlying the Texas rule, and
changes the law in an area where the law should be settled."
Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Delaware E-4. Delaware
also objects to the Master's failure to "ascrib[e] . . . legal
relevance to [intermediaries'] status as record security holders," a "fundamental factual error" that effectively treats
record owners "as if they were paying agents." Id., at E-5.
New York's first exception likewise objects to the Master's
use of "the term `debtor' as `shorthand' to identify parties
with `debtor attributes' rather than the obligor of the debt."
Exceptions of Defendant New York 52. We agree with both
States and sustain their exceptions.

We have not relied on legal definitions of "creditor" and
"debtor" merely for descriptive convenience. Rather, we
have grounded the concepts of "creditor" and "debtor" in
the positive law that gives rise to the property at issue. In
framing a State's power of escheat, we must first look to the
law that creates property and binds persons to honor property rights. "Property interests, of course, are not created
by the Constitution," but rather "by existing rules or under507us2$50N 11-30-95 08:44:24 PAGES OPINPGT

standings that stem from an independent source such as
state law." Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408
U. S. 564, 577 (1972). Accord, e. g., Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S.
341, 344-347 (1976); Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 710-712
(1976). See also Barnhill v. Johnson, 503 U. S. 393, 398
(1992) ("In the absence of any controlling federal law, `property' and `interests in property' are creatures of state law").
Furthermore, law that creates property necessarily defines
the legal relationships under which certain parties ("debtors") must discharge obligations to others ("creditors").

To define "debtor" as "the last person who ha[s] a claim to
the funds as an asset that would appropriately be reflected
in [his] net worth," Report of Special Master 32, would convert a term rich with prescriptive legal content into little
more than a description of bookkeeping phenomena. Funds
held by a debtor become subject to escheat because the
debtor has no interest in the funds--precisely the opposite
of having "a claim to the funds as an asset." We have recognized as much in cases upholding a State's power to escheat
neglected bank deposits. Charters, bylaws, and contracts of
deposit do not give a bank the right to retain abandoned
deposits, and a law requiring the delivery of such deposits to
the State affects no property interest belonging to the bank.
Security Savings Bank v. California, 263 U. S. 282, 285-286
(1923); Provident Institution for Savings v. Malone, 221
U. S. 660, 665-666 (1911). Thus, "deposits are debtor obligations of the bank," and a State may "protect the interests of
depositors" as creditors by assuming custody over accounts
"inactive so long as to be presumptively abandoned." Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, 321 U. S. 233, 241 (1944) (emphasis
added). Such "disposition of abandoned property is a function of the state," a sovereign "exercise of a regulatory
power" over property and the private legal obligations inherent in property. Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, 341
U. S. 428, 436 (1951).

Opinion of the Court
Our rules regarding interstate disputes over competing es-cheat claims cannot be severed from the law that creates

the underlying creditor-debtor relationships. In Texas and
Pennsylvania, our examination of the holder's legal obligations not only defined the escheatable property at issue but
also carefully identified the relevant "debtors" and "credi-tors." See

Texas, 379 U. S., at 675-676, n. 4; Pennsylvania,
407 U. S., at 208-209, 213. In Pennsylvania, we noted thatWestern Union was a "debtor" insofar as it owed contractual

duties to two separate creditors. Western Union was obli-gated not merely to deliver a negotiable draft to the sender's
payee; if Western Union could not locate the payee or if the
payee failed to claim his money order, the company was
bound to make a refund to the sender. Id., at 208-209. Correspondingly, we recognized that the relevant "creditor"
might be either a payee or a sender: "the payee of an unpaid
draft, the sender of a money order entitled to a refund," or
a payee or sender "whose claim has been underpaid through
error." Id., at 213 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Moreover, the rules developed in Texas and Pennsylvania
reflect the traditional view of escheat as an exercise of sovereignty over persons and property owned by persons. The
primary rule flowed from the common-law "concept of `mobilia sequuntur personam,' according to which intangible personal property is found at the domicile of its owner." Texas,
supra, at 680, n. 10. Accord, Pennsylvania, supra, at 217-
218 (Powell, J., dissenting). See also Blodgett v. Silberman,
277 U. S. 1, 10 (1928) ("[I]ntangible personalty has . . . a situs
at the domicil of the owner"). In recognizing that "a debt
is property of the creditor," Texas, supra, at 680, the primary
rule permits the escheating State to protect the interest of
a creditor last known to have resided there. Reasoning that
"debts owed by" a holder of unclaimed funds "are not property to it, but rather a liability," we concluded that "it would
be strange to convert a liability into an asset when the State
decides to escheat." 379 U. S., at 680. Cognizant of the

Opinion of the Court
creditor's status as owner of intangible personal property,we awarded the primary right to escheat to the creditor's

State. Conversely, when a creditor's last known addresscannot be determined or the laws of the creditor's State do
not provide for escheat, the secondary rule protects the interests of the debtor's State as sovereign over the remainingparty to the underlying transaction. Unless we define the

terms "creditor" and "debtor" according to positive law, wemight "permit intangible property rights to be cut off or adversely affected by state action . . . in a forum having nocontinuing relationship to any of the parties to the proceedings." Pennsylvania, supra, at 213 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Cf. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.
Moore, 333 U. S. 541, 549-550 (1948) (upholding New York's
escheat of unclaimed insurance benefits only "as to policies
issued for delivery in New York upon the lives of persons
then resident therein where the insured continues to be a
resident and the beneficiary is a resident at . . . maturity").
Texas and Pennsylvania avoided this conundrum by resolving escheat disputes according to the law that creates debtorcreditor relationships; only a State with a clear connection to
the creditor or the debtor may escheat. Because the Master
failed to identify the relevant "creditors" and "debtors" by
reference to that law, we now perform this task.

We hold that intermediaries who hold unclaimed securities
distributions in their own name are the relevant "debtors"
under the secondary rule of Texas and Pennsylvania.
From an issuer's perspective, the only creditors are registered shareholders, those whose names appear on the issuer's records. Issuers cannot be considered debtors once
they pay dividends, interest, or other distributions to record
owners; payment to a record owner discharges all of an issuer's obligations. Under $ 8-207(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code, which is the law of all 50 States and the District
of Columbia, "the issuer . . . may treat the registered owner
as the person exclusively . . . to exercise all the rights and

Opinion of the Court
powers of an owner." Payment to an intermediary that isthe record owner of securities extinguishes any liability the

issuer might have to the beneficial owner. U. C. C. $ 8-207,comment 1, 2C U. L. A. 341 (1991). The Master acknowledged as much, see Report of Special Master 25, and none ofthe parties contends otherwise. Instead, an intermediary
serving as the record owner of securities is the "debtor" in-sofar as the intermediary has a contractual duty to transmit
distributions to the beneficial owner. Unlike an issuer,which discharges all liabilities upon payment to a record
owner, an intermediary remains liable should a "lost" bene-ficial owner reappear to collect distributions due under a
contract with the intermediary. The Master thus erred inequating intermediary banks, brokers, and depositories with
the issuers' paying agents, who owe no duty to beneficialowners but rather bear the contractual obligation to "return
. . . unclaimed distributions to the issuer after a certainperiod of time." App. to Report of Special Master B-6.
Intermediaries who hold securities in street name or nom-inee name are the relevant "debtors" because they alone, and
not the issuers, are legally obligated to deliver unclaimedsecurities distributions to the beneficial owners.

B
The Master's recommended disposition of this case restedon a second major premise: his proposal to locate a corporate

debtor in "the jurisdiction of the entity's principal domesticexecutive offices rather than the state of incorporation."
Report of Special Master 49 (footnote omitted). In Texasand

Pennsylvania, however, we explicitly granted the rightto escheat under the secondary rule to the State in which

the debtor was incorporated. Texas, supra, at 682; Pennsylvania, supra, at 210-211, 212, 223-224. By the Master'sown admission, relying on the location of a debtor's principal

executive offices "change[s] [this Court's] longstanding prac-tice." Report of Special Master 50. The Master proposed

507us2$50N 11-30-95 08:44:24 PAGES OPINPGT
506 DELAWARE v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
this innovation sua sponte; no party sought this alterationof our settled law. Delaware excepts to this "[d]epart[ure]

from the rule of corporate domicile" as "inconsistent not onlywith this Court's precedents, but with fundamental principles of jurisprudence defining the relationship between the
sovereign and its corporate citizens." Exceptions and Brieffor Plaintiff Delaware E-4 to E-5. Finding that the "heavy

burden" that attends a request "to reconsider not one buttwo prior decisions" has not been borne,

Walker v. Armco
Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749 (1980), we sustain Delaware'sexception.

In Texas, we considered and rejected a proposal to award
the primary right to escheat to the State "where [the debtor's] principal offices are located." 379 U. S., at 680. Although we recognized that "this State is probably foremost
in giving the benefits of its economy and laws to the company
whose business activities made the intangible property come
into existence," we rejected the rule because its application
"would raise in every case the sometimes difficult question
of where a company's `main office' or `principal place of business' or whatever it might be designated is located." Ibid.
Even when we formulated the secondary rule, we looked instead to the debtor's State of incorporation. Id., at 682. As
in Texas, we find that determining the State of incorporation
is the most efficient way to locate a corporate debtor. Exclusive reliance on incorporation permits the disposition of
claims under the secondary rule upon the taking of judicial
notice. Although "a general inquiry into where the principal executive office is located [may] see[m] neither burdensome [n]or complex," Report of Special Master 49, we cannot
embrace a "rule leaving so much for decision on a case-bycase basis," Texas, supra, at 680. The mere introduction of
any factual controversy over the location of a debtor's principal executive offices needlessly complicates an inquiry made
irreducibly simple by Texas' adoption of a test based on the
State of incorporation.

Opinion of the Court
Even if we were to endorse the Master's redefinition of adebtor's location, we doubt that his proposal could fulfill its

promise "to distribute the funds [more] fairly among the var-ious jurisdictions." Report of Special Master 50. The Master sought to counteract the inequity he perceived in thehappenstance that "the larger, publicly-traded, enterprises
that generate the lion's share of the securities distributions. . . are by any standard disproportionately incorporated in
one state." Id., at 47. His "principal executive offices" ini-tiative, however, cannot survive independent of his erroneous decision to treat the issuers as the relevant "debtors."Because we have already decided that the intermediaries are
the proper debtors under the secondary rule, this changewould simply transfer the bulk of the disputed funds from
Delaware, where many intermediaries are incorporated, toNew York, where many intermediaries have located their
principal executive offices. A company's arguably arbitrarydecision to incorporate in one State bears no less on its business activities than its officers' equally arbitrary decision tolocate their principal executive offices in another State. It
must be remembered that we refer to a debtor's State ofincorporation only when the creditor's last address is unknown or when the creditor's State does not provide for es-cheat. When the creditor's State cannot assert its predominant interest, we detect no inequity in rewarding a Statewhose laws prove more attractive to firms that wish to
incorporate.Precedent, efficiency, and equity all dictate the rejection
of the Master's "principal executive offices" proposal. Weaccordingly adhere to Texas and Pennsylvania and award
the right to escheat under the secondary rule to the State inwhich the debtor is incorporated.

IV
We turn, finally, to New York's contention that many ofthe disputed funds need not be escheated under the second507us2$50N 11-30-95 08:44:24 PAGES OPINPGT
508 DELAWARE v. NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
ary rule at all. New York concedes that "the creditors ofunclaimed distributions" held by depositories and custodian

banks "are always unknown." Exceptions of DefendantNew York 81. It argues, however, that "reconstruct[ion]"
of "the debtor brokers' transactions" will lead to "creditor
brokers that purchased the underlying securities and wereunderpaid the distributions."

Id., at 80 (emphasis added).
Because "the amount of time and resources that would berequired to reconstruct the overpayment transactions would

be very considerable," however, New York "has suggestedthe use of statistical sampling to prove that virtually all of
the creditor brokers and banks recorded on the books of
debtor brokers in New York have New York addresses."
Ibid.

We overrule New York's exception. As an initial matter,
New York's proposal rests on the dubious supposition that
the relevant "creditors" under the primary rule are other
brokers. We have already held that "creditors" are the parties to whom the intermediaries are contractually obligated
to deliver unclaimed securities distributions. Accordingly,
to the extent that beneficial owners are the relevant "creditors," New York's exception is inapposite.

Even if we indulge New York's premise that most creditors of New York brokers are in fact other New York
brokers, the exception must fail. As the Master correctly
observed: "[N]othing in the Court's jurisprudence . . .
suggest[s] that New York can prevail by making a statistical
showing that `most' [creditor-brokers'] addresses are in New
York." Report of Special Master 67. In Pennsylvania, we
rejected a proposal practically identical to New York's. In
that case, because Western Union's records frequently did
not disclose a creditor's identity or last known address, the
debtor's State of incorporation stood to "receive a much
larger share of the unclaimed funds" under the secondary
rule. 407 U. S., at 214. The plaintiff States urged us to
define the creditor's residence according to a "presumption

Opinion of the Court
based on the place of purchase." Ibid. Like New York'sproposal, the rule advocated in Pennsylvania would use a

statistical surrogate instead of the debtor's records to locatethe last known addresses of creditors. That much is clear
from the Pennsylvania dissent's description of the rejectedrule as "a reasonable approximation."

Id., at 221 (opinion ofPowell, J.). New York may object to the cost and difficulty

of culling creditors' last known addresses from brokers' rec-ords,

12 but in Pennsylvania, we expressly refused "to vary

the application of the [primary] rule according to the ade-quacy of the debtor's records." Id., at 215. And we decline

to do so here.Despite our refusal to adopt New York's proposal for statistical analysis of creditors' addresses under the primaryrule, we decline Delaware's invitation to enter judgment
against New York on the basis of the Master's findings. Ex-ceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Delaware 85. On remand, if
New York can establish by reference to debtors' records thatthe creditors who were owed particular securities distributions had last known addresses in New York, New York'sright to escheat under the primary rule will supersede Delaware's right under the secondary rule. As we noted inTexas, "the State of corporate domicile should be allowed to
. . . retai[n] the property for itself only until some other Statecomes forward with proof that it has a superior right to escheat." 379 U. S., at 682. Accord, Pennsylvania, 407 U. S.,at 210-211. If New York or any other claimant State fails
to offer such proof on a transaction-by-transaction basis orto provide some other proper mechanism for ascertaining
creditors' last known addresses, the creditor's State will notprevail under the primary rule, and the secondary rule will
control. Id., at 215.

12 New York and other States could have anticipated and prevented some
of the difficulties stemming from incomplete debtor records, for nothing in
our decisions "prohibits the States from requiring [debtors] to keep adequate address records." Pennsylvania, 407 U. S., at 215.

Only by adhering to our precedent can we resolve escheatdisputes between States in a fair and efficient manner. We

devise new rules of law to apply to ever-developing new cate-gories of facts."

Texas, supra, at 679. Accord, Pennsylvania, supra, at 215. To craft different rules for the novelfacts of each case would generate "so much uncertainty and

they might gain in escheats." Texas, supra, at 679. If theStates are dissatisfied with the outcome of a particular case,
they may air their grievances before Congress. That bodymay reallocate abandoned property among the States without regard to this Court's interstate escheat rules. Con-gress overrode

511OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

CONROY v. ANISKOFF et al.
certiorari to the supreme judicial court of maine

No. 91-1353. Argued January 11, 1993--Decided March 31, 1993
When petitioner Conroy, an officer in the United States Army, failed to

pay local real estate taxes on property he owned in Danforth, Maine,
the town acquired the property and sold it. In his suit against the town
and the property's purchasers, Conroy claimed that $ 525 of the Soldiers'
and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940--which provides that the "period
of military service" shall not "be included in computing any period . . .
provided by any law for the redemption of real property sold or forfeited
to enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment"--tolled the redemption
period while he was in military service, and federal law therefore prevented the town from acquiring good title to the property. The Maine
District Court rejected his claim, holding that the redemption period
could not be tolled unless the taxpayer could show that military service
resulted in hardship excusing timely legal action, and that it would be
absurd and illogical to toll limitations periods for career service personnel who had not been handicapped by their military status. The State
Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.

Held: A member of the Armed Services need not show that his military

service prejudiced his ability to redeem title to property before he can
qualify for the statutory suspension of time. The statutory command
in $ 525 is unambiguous, unequivocal, and unlimited. There is no support for respondents' argument that when $ 525 is read in the context
of the entire statute, it implicitly conditions its protection on a demonstration of hardship or prejudice resulting from military service. The
statute's complete legislative history confirms a congressional intent to
protect all military personnel on active duty, not just those whose lives
have been temporarily disrupted by the service. In addition, the statute's comprehensive character indicates that Congress included a prejudice requirement whenever it considered it appropriate to do so, and
that its omission of any such requirement in $ 525 was deliberate. Finally, both the history of this carefully reticulated statute, and this
Court's history of interpreting it, refute any argument that a literal
construction of $ 525 is so absurd or illogical that Congress could not
have intended it. Pp. 514-518.

whether a member of the Armed Services must show thathis military service prejudiced his ability to redeem title to

property before he can qualify for the statutory suspensionof time.

I
Petitioner is an officer in the United States Army. Hewas on active duty continuously from 1966 until the time of

trial. In 1973, he purchased a parcel of vacant land in thetown of Danforth, Maine. He paid taxes on the property for
10 years, but failed to pay the 1984, 1985, and 1986 local realestate taxes.

2 In 1986, following the Maine statutory procedures that authorize it to acquire tax-delinquent real estate,the town sold the property.

3

In 1987, petitioner brought suit in the Maine DistrictCourt against the town and the two purchasers. He claimed

that $ 525 of the Act tolled the redemption period while hewas in military service, and federal law therefore prevented
the town from acquiring good title to the property eventhough the State's statutory procedures had been followed.
The trial court rejected the claim. In an unreported opin-ion, it noted that some courts had construed $ 525 literally,
but it elected to follow a line of decisions that refused to tollthe redemption period unless the taxpayer could show that

forfeited to enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment." 50 U. S. C. App.

$ 525 (1988 ed., Supp. III).

2 He testified that he did not receive tax bills for those years and that

his letters asking for tax bills were not answered by the town.

3 Under Maine law a taxing authority has a lien against real estate until

properly assessed taxes are paid. If taxes remain unpaid for 30 days
after a notice of lien and demand for payment has been sent to the owner,
the tax collector may record a tax lien certificate to create a tax lien
mortgage. The taxpayer then has an 18-month period of redemption in
which he may recover his property by paying the overdue taxes plus interest and costs. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $$ 552, 942, 943 (1990). It
is stipulated that the required procedures were followed in this case and
that the town's title was perfected, unless petitioner's objection based on

$ 525 requires a different result.

Opinion of the Court
"military service resulted in hardship excusing timely legalaction."

4 It agreed with those courts that it would be

"absurd and illogical" to toll limitations periods for careerservice personnel who had not been "handicapped by their

military status." 5 The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine af-firmed by an equally divided court.

6 We granted certiorari

to resolve the conflict in the interpretation of $ 525. 505U. S. 1203 (1992).

II
The statutory command in $ 525 is unambiguous, unequivo-cal, and unlimited. It states that the period of military

service "shall not be included" in the computation of "anyperiod now or hereafter provided by any law for the redemption of real property . . . ." Respondents do not dispute theplain meaning of this text. Rather, they argue that when

$ 525 is read in the context of the entire statute, it implicitlyconditions its protection on a demonstration of hardship or
prejudice resulting from military service. They make threepoints in support of this argument: that the history of the
Act reveals an intent to provide protection only to thosewhose lives have been temporarily disrupted by military
service; that other provisions of the Act are expressly condi-tioned on a showing of prejudice; and that a literal interpretation produces illogical and absurd results. Neither sepa-rately nor in combination do these points justify a departure
from the unambiguous statutory text.Respondents correctly describe the immediate cause for
the statute's enactment in 1940, the year before our entryinto World War II. Congress stated its purpose to "expedite the national defense under the emergent conditionswhich are threatening the peace and security of the United

States . . . ." 50 U. S. C. App. $ 510. That purpose undoubtedly contemplated the special hardship that military duty
imposed on those suddenly drafted into service by the national emergency.7 Neither that emergency, nor a particular
legislative interest in easing sudden transfers from civilian
to military status, however, justifies the conclusion that
Congress did not intend all members of the Armed Forces,
including career personnel, to receive the Act's protections.
Indeed, because Congress extended the life of the Act indefinitely in 1948,8 well after the end of World War II, the
complete legislative history confirms a congressional intent
to protect all military personnel on active duty, just as the
statutory language provides.

Respondents also correctly remind us to "follow the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole, see Massachusetts v. Morash, 490 U. S. 107, 115 (1989), since the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context."
King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991). But
as in King, the context of this statute actually supports the
conclusion that Congress meant what $ 525 says. Several
provisions of the statute condition the protection they offer
on a showing that military service adversely affected the
ability to assert or protect a legal right. To choose one of
many examples, $ 532(2) authorizes a stay of enforcement of
secured obligations unless "the ability of the defendant to
comply with the terms of the obligation is not materially

" `temporary suspension of legal proceedings and transactions.' " Brief

that the 1940 Act "shall be applicable to all persons in the armed forces of

affected by reason of his military service." 9 The compre-hensive character of the entire statute indicates that Congress included a prejudice requirement whenever it consid-ered it appropriate to do so, and that its omission of any such
requirement in $ 525 was deliberate.Finally, both the history of this carefully reticulated statute, and our history of interpreting it, refute any argumentthat a literal construction of $ 525 is so absurd or illogical
that Congress could not have intended it. In many respectsthe 1940 Act was a reenactment of World War I legislation
that had, in turn, been modeled after legislation that severalStates adopted during the Civil War. See

Boone v. Lightner, 319 U. S. 561, 565-569 (1943). The Court had empha-sized the comprehensive character and carefully segregated

arrangement of the various provisions of the World War Istatute in Ebert v. Poston, 266 U. S. 548, 554 (1925), and it
had considered the consequences of requiring a showing ofprejudice when it construed the World War II statute in
Boone, supra. Since we presume that Congress was famil-iar with those cases,

10 we also assume that Congress considered the decision in Ebert to interpret and apply each provi-sion of the Act separately when it temporarily reestablished

the law as a whole in 1940, and then considered Boone's anal-ysis of a prejudice requirement when it permanently extended the Act in 1948.Legislative history confirms that assumption. Since the
enactment of the 1918 Act, Congress has expressed its un-derstanding that absolute exemptions might save time or

it presumably required a showing of prejudice only when itseemed necessary to confer on the service member a genuine

benefit. By distinguishing sharply between the two typesof protections, Congress unquestionably contemplated the
ways that either type of protection would affect both mili-tary debtors and their civilian creditors.

The long and consistent history and the structure of thislegislation therefore lead us to conclude that--just as the
language of $ 525 suggests--Congress made a deliberate pol-icy judgment placing a higher value on firmly protecting the
service member's redemption rights than on occasionallyburdening the tax collection process. Given the limited
number of situations in which this precisely structured stat-ute offers such absolute protection, we cannot say that Con11 The House Report on the suspension of suits in the 1918 Act, for example, provided in part:

"The lesson of the stay laws of the Civil War teaches that an arbitrary
and rigid protection against suits is as much a mistaken kindness to the
soldier as it is unnecessary. A total suspension for the period of the war
of all rights against a soldier defeats its own purpose. In time of war
credit is of even more importance than in time of peace, and if there were
a total prohibition upon enforcing obligations against one in military service, the credit of a soldier and his family would be utterly cut off. No one
could be found who would extend them credit." H. R. Rep. No. 181, 65th
Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1917).

And Congressman Webb, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
stated:

"Manifestly, if this Congress should undertake to pass an arbitrary stay
law providing that no creditor should ever sue or bring proceedings
against any soldier while in the military service of his country, that would
upset business very largely in many parts of the country. In the next
place, it would be unfair to the creditor as well as to the soldier. It would
disturb the soldier's credit probably in many cases and would deny the
right of the creditor to his just debts from a person who was amply able
to pay and whose military service did not in the least impair his ability to
meet the obligation." 55 Cong. Rec. 7787 (1917). See Boone v. Lightner,
319 U. S. 561, 566, 567, 568 (1943).

gress would have found our straightforward interpretation
and application of its words either absurd or illogical.12 If
the consequences of that interpretation had been--or prove
to be--as unjust as respondents contend, we are confident
that Congress would have corrected the injustice--or will do
so in the future.

The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine is
reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
The Court begins its analysis with the observation: "The
statutory command in $ 525 is unambiguous, unequivocal, and
unlimited." Ante, at 514. In my view, discussion of that
point is where the remainder of the analysis should have
ended. Instead, however, the Court feels compelled to demonstrate that its holding is consonant with legislative history,
including some dating back to 1917--a full quarter century

12 In his 11-page opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia
suggests that our response to respondents' reliance on legislative history
"is not merely a waste of research time and ink," but also "a false and
disruptive lesson in the law." Post, at 519. His "hapless law clerk," post,
at 527, has found a good deal of evidence in the legislative history that
many provisions of this statute were intended to confer discretion on trial
judges. That, of course, is precisely our point: It is reasonable to conclude
that Congress intended to authorize such discretion when it expressly provided for it and to deny such discretion when it did not. A jurisprudence
that confines a court's inquiry to the "law as it is passed," and is wholly
unconcerned about "the intentions of legislators," post, at 519, would enforce an unambiguous statutory text even when it produces manifestly
unintended and profoundly unwise consequences. Respondents have argued that this is such a case. We disagree. Justice Scalia, however,
is apparently willing to assume that this is such a case, but would nevertheless conclude that we have a duty to enforce the statute as written
even if fully convinced that every Member of the enacting Congress, as
well as the President who signed the Act, intended a different result.
Again, we disagree. See Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501
U. S. 597, 610, n. 4 (1991).

before the provision at issue was enacted. That is notmerely a waste of research time and ink; it is a false and

disruptive lesson in the law. It says to the bar that even an"unambiguous [and] unequivocal" statute can never be dispositive; that, presumably under penalty of malpractice lia-bility, the oracles of legislative history, far into the dimmy
past, must always be consulted. This undermines the clar-ity of law, and condemns litigants (who, unlike us, must pay
for it out of their own pockets) to subsidizing historical re-search by lawyers.

The greatest defect of legislative history is its illegitimacy.We are governed by laws, not by the intentions of legislators.
As the Court said in 1844: "The law as it passed is the willof the majority of both houses, and the only mode in which
that will is spoken is in the act itself . . . ." Aldridge v.Williams, 3 How. 9, 24 (emphasis added). But not the least
of the defects of legislative history is its indeterminacy. Ifone were to search for an interpretive technique that, on the
whole, was more likely to confuse than to clarify, one couldhardly find a more promising candidate than legislative history. And the present case nicely proves that point.Judge Harold Leventhal used to describe the use of legislative history as the equivalent of entering a crowded cocktailparty and looking over the heads of the guests for one's
friends. If I may pursue that metaphor: The legislative his-tory of $ 205 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act

1

contains a variety of diverse personages, a selected few ofwhom--its "friends"--the Court has introduced to us in support of its result. But there are many other faces in thecrowd, most of which, I think, are set against today's result.

I will limit my exposition of the legislative history to theenactment of four statutes:

1 The Court refers to this section as "$ 525," which corresponds to the
unofficial codification of the section in the United States Code, 50 U. S. C.
App. $ 525. I find it more convenient to use the actual statutory section
number--"$ 205"--in discussing the history of the provision.

That, of course, cannot be said to be the "complete legislativehistory" relevant to this provision. Cf.

ante, at 515. Oneof the problems with legislative history is that it is inherently open ended. In this case, for example, one could goback further in time to examine the Civil War-era relief
Acts, many of which are in fact set forth in an appendix tothe House Report on the 1918 Act, see App. A, H. R. Rep.
No. 181, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., 18-32 (1917) (hereinafter 1917House Report). Or one could extend the search abroad and
consider the various foreign statutes that were mentioned inthat same House Report. See

id., at 4, 13-14 (discussingEnglish and French enactments). Those additional statutes

might be of questionable relevance, but then so too are the1918 Act and the 1940 Act, neither of which contained a provision governing redemption periods. Nevertheless, I willlimit my legislative history inquiry to those four statutes for
the simple reason that that is the scope chosen by the Court.The 1918 Act appears to have been the first comprehensive
national soldiers' relief Act. See 55 Cong. Rec. 7787 (1917).The legislative history reveals that Congress intended

into legislative history, I am speaking as legislative historians speak, attributing to all Members of both Houses of Congress (or at least to a
majority of the Members of each House), and to the President (or, if the
President did not sign the bill in question, then to at least two-thirds of the
Members of both Houses of Congress) views expressed by the particular
personage, or committee of personages, whose statements are being described--in the case of the citation at issue in this sentence, a committee
of the House of Representatives. It is to be assumed--by a sort of sus507us2$51I 11-26-96 17:00:24 PAGES OPINPGT

it serve the same vital purpose--providing "protectionagainst suit to men in military service"--as various state

statutes had served during the Civil War. 1917 House Re-port 3; see also id., at 18-32 (App. A) (setting forth text of
numerous state soldiers' relief Acts from the Civil War era).Congress intended, however, that the 1918 Act should differ
from the Civil War statutes "in two material respects." 55Cong. Rec. 7787 (1917) (statement of Rep. Webb). The first
was that, being a national statute, it would produce a disposi-tion "uniform throughout the Nation." 1917 House Report
3; see also 55 Cong. Rec. 7787 (1917) (statement of Rep.Webb). But it is the second difference which has particular
relevance to the Court's ruling today:

"The next material difference between this law and thevarious State laws is this, and in this I think you will

find the chief excellence of the bill which we propose:Instead of the bill we are now considering being arbitrary, inelastic, inflexible, the discretion as to dealing outeven-handed justice between the creditor and the soldier, taking into consideration the fact that the soldierhas been called to his country's cause, rests largely, and
in some cases entirely, in the breast of the judge whotries the case." Id., at 7787 (statement of Rep. Webb).

3

This comment cannot be dismissed as the passing remark ofan insignificant Member, since the speaker was the Chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, the committee that repension of disbelief--that two-thirds of the Members of both Houses of
Congress (or a majority plus the President) were aware of those statements and must have agreed with them; or perhaps it is to be assumed--
by a sort of suspension of the Constitution--that Congress delegated to
that personage or personages the authority to say what its laws mean.

3 In quoting this floor statement, I follow the convention of legislative

history, which is to assume conclusively that statements recorded in the
Congressional Record were in fact made. That assumption of course does
not accord with reality. See 117 Cong. Rec. 36506-36507 (1971) (supposed
floor statement shown by internal evidence never to have been delivered).

ported the bill to the House floor. Moreover, his remarksmerely echoed the House Report, which barely a page into

its text stated: "We cannot point out too soon, or too emphat-ically, that the bill is not an inflexible stay of all claims
against persons in military service." 1917 House Report 2.Congress intended to depart from the "arbitrary and rigid
protection" that had been provided under the Civil War-erastay laws,

ibid., which could give protection to men "who canand should pay their obligations in full," id., at 3. It is clear,

therefore, that in the 1918 Act Congress intended to createflexible rules that would permit denial of protection to members of the military who could show no hardship.The 1918 Act expired by its own terms six months after
the end of the First World War. See 1918 Act, $ 603, 40 Stat.449. The 1940 Act was adopted as the Nation prepared for
its coming participation in the Second World War. Both theHouse and Senate Reports described it as being, "in substance, identical with the [1918 Act]." H. R. Rep. No. 3001,76th Cong., 3d Sess., 3 (1940); S. Rep. No. 2109, 76 Cong., 3d
Sess., 4 (1940). Moreover, in Boone v. Lightner, 319 U. S.561, 565 (1943), we acknowledged that the 1940 Act was "a
substantial reenactment" of the 1918 Act, and looked to thelegislative history of the 1918 Act for indications of congressional intent with respect to the 1940 Act. Relying on thatlegislative history, we found that "the very heart of the policy of the Act" was to provide "judicial discretion . . . insteadof rigid and undiscriminating suspension of civil proceedings." Ibid.Although the Court never mentions this fact, it is clear
that under the 1918 and 1940 Acts a redemption periodwould not be tolled during the period of military service. In
both enactments, $ 205 governed only statutes of limitationsand did not mention redemption periods.

4 Moreover, in

4 Section 205 of the 1918 Act provided:
"That the period of military service shall not be included in computing
any period now or hereafter to be limited by any law for the bringing of

Ebert v. Poston, 266 U. S. 548 (1925), this Court held thatneither $ 205 nor $ 302, which provides protection from foreclosures, conferred on a court any power to extend a statu-tory redemption period. Congress overturned the rule of
Ebert in the 1942 Amendments, a central part of the legisla-tive history that the Court curiously fails to discuss. Section 5 of those amendments rewrote $ 205 of the Act to placeit in its current form, which directly addresses the redemption periods. See 56 Stat. 770-771; ante, at 512-513, n. 1(setting forth current version of $ 205). The crucial question
in the present case (if one believes in legislative history) iswhether Congress intended this amendment to be consistent
with the "heart of the policy of the Act"--conferring judicialdiscretion--or rather intended it to confer an unqualified
right to extend the period of redemption. Both the Houseand Senate Reports state that, under the amended $ 205,
"[t]he running of the statutory period during which realproperty may be redeemed after sale to enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment is likewise tolled during the part ofsuch period which occurs after the enactment of the [1942
Amendments]." H. R. Rep. No. 2198, 77th Cong., 2d Sess.,3-4 (1942) (emphasis added); S. Rep. No. 1558, 77th Cong., 2d
Sess., 4 (1942) (emphasis added). The Reports also statethat "[a]lthough the tolling of such periods is now within the
spirit of the law, it has not been held to be within the letterthereof " (citing

Ebert). H. R. Rep. No. 2198, supra, at 4;S. Rep. No. 1558,

supra, at 4. These statements surely indi-cate an intention to provide a tolling period for redemptions

similar to that already provided for statutes of limitations--which, on the basis of the legislative history I have deany action by or against any person in military service or by or against
his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, whether such cause of action shall have accrued prior to or during the period of such service." 40
Stat. 443.

Section 205 of the 1940 Act was identical, except that the word "That" at
the beginning of the section was omitted.

scribed, can be considered discretionary rather than rigid.The existence of discretionary authority to suspend the tolling is also suggested by the House floor debates. Respond-ing to questions, Representative Sparkman (who submitted
the Report on behalf of the House Committee on Military
Affairs) agreed that, while the bill "pertains to all personsin the armed forces," a man "serving in the armed forces for

more money than he got in civil life . . . is not entitled to anyof the benefits of the provisions of this bill." 88 Cong. Rec.
5364, 5365 (1942). In response to that last comment, anotherRepresentative inquired further whether "[t]his is to take
care of the men who are handicapped because of their military service." Id., at 5365. Representative Sparkman answered affirmatively. Ibid. He confirmed that Congress
did not intend to abandon the discretionary nature of the
scheme: "With reference to all these matters we have tried
to make the law flexible by lodging discretion within the
courts to do or not to do as justice and equity may require."
Ibid. And finally, at a later point in the debates, Representative Brooks made clear that the Act was intended to
remedy the prejudice resulting from compelled military
service: "We feel that the normal obligations of the man contracted prior to service induction should be suspended as far
as practicable during this tour of duty, and that the soldier
should be protected from default in his obligations due to his
inability to pay caused by reduction in income due to service." Id., at 5369.

The final component of the legislative history that I shall
treat is the extension of the 1940 Act in the Selective Service
Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 604. The Court misconstrues Congress's intent in this enactment in two respects. First, it
asserts that "because Congress extended the life of the Act
indefinitely in 1948, well after the end of World War II, the
complete legislative history confirms a congressional intent
to protect all military personnel on active duty, just as the
statutory language provides." Ante, at 515 (footnote omit507us2$51I 11-26-96 17:00:24 PAGES OPINPGT

ted). It is true enough that the War was over; but the draftwas not. The extension of the 1940 Act was contained in

the Selective Service Act of 1948, which required militaryservice from citizens. And it would appear to have been
contemplated that the "life of the Act" would be extended
not "indefinitely," as the Court says, ibid., but for the dura-tion of the draft. See H. R. Rep. No. 1881, 80th Cong., 2d

Sess., 12 (1948) (extension was intended to "continu[e] theSoldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 in its application to the personnel inducted or entering the armed forcesduring the life of this act"). The legislative history states
that Congress intended to extend the provisions of the 1940
Act "to persons serving in the armed forces pursuant to this
act." S. Rep. No. 1268, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., 21 (1948) (emphasis added). Career members of the military such as petitioner would not have been serving "pursuant to" the Selective Service Act, since they were expressly excepted from
its service requirement. See Selective Service Act of 1948

$ 6(a), 62 Stat. 609. In this focus upon draftees, the legislative history of the 1948 extension merely replicates that of
the 1940 Act and the 1942 Amendments. The former was
enacted on the heels of the Selective Training and Service
Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 885, and was introduced on the Senate
floor with the explanation that it would provide "relief . . .
to those who are to be inducted into the military service
for training under [the Selective Training and Service Act
of 1940]." 86 Cong. Rec. 10292 (1940) (statement of Rep.
Overton) (emphasis added). In the debate on the 1942
Amendments, Representative Sparkman noted that "hundreds of thousands, and even millions, have been called" into
military service since the enactment of the 1940 Act, and
admonished his colleagues to "keep uppermost in your mind
at all times the fact that the primary purpose of this legislation is to give relief to the boy that is called into service."
88 Cong. Rec. 5364 (1942). In other words, the legislative
history of the 1948 extension, like that of the Act itself and

526 CONROY v. ANISKOFF

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
of the 1942 Amendments, suggests an intent to protect thosewho were

prejudiced by military service, as many who were
drafted would be.The Court also errs in mistaking the probable effect of

Congress's presumed awareness of our earlier opinions in
Ebert and Boone. See ante, at 516. In Boone, we statedthat the Act "is always to be liberally construed to protect

those who have been obliged to drop their own affairs to takeup the burdens of the nation," 319 U. S., at 575 (emphasis
added), but that discretion was vested in the courts to ensurethat the immunities of the Act are not put to "unworthy use,"
ibid., since "the very heart of the policy of the Act" was to
provide "judicial discretion . . . instead of rigid and undiscriminating suspension of civil proceedings," id., at 565.
Awareness of Boone would likely have caused Congress to

assume that the courts would vindicate "the very heart of
the policy of the Act" by requiring a showing of prejudice.
The Court argues, however, that Congress would also have
been aware that Ebert recognized the "carefully segregated
arrangement of the various provisions" of the Act, ante, at
516. It is already an extension of the normal convention to
assume that Congress was aware of the precise reasoning (as
opposed to the holding) of earlier judicial opinions; but it
goes much further to assume that Congress not only knew,
but expected the courts would continue to follow, the reasoning of a case (Ebert) whose holding Congress had repudiated
six years earlier. See supra, at 523. In any event, the
Court seeks to use Ebert only to establish that Congress was
aware that this Court was aware of the "carefully segregated
arrangement" of the Act. That adds little, if anything, to
direct reliance upon the plain language of the statute.

After reading the above described legislative history, one
might well conclude that the result reached by the Court
today, though faithful to law, betrays the congressional intent. Many have done so. Indeed, as far as I am aware,
every court that has chosen to interpret $ 205 in light of its

527Cite as: 507 U. S. 511 (1993)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
legislative history rather than on the basis of its plain texthas found that Congress did not intend $ 205 to apply to career members of the military who cannot show prejudice orhardship. See, in addition to the court below,

Pannell v.
Continental Can Co., 554 F. 2d 216, 224-225 (CA5 1977); Bailey v. Barranca, 83 N. M. 90, 94-95, 488 P. 2d 725, 729-730(1971);

King v. Zagorski, 207 So. 2d 61, 66-67 (Fla. App.
1968). The only scholarly commentary I am aware of ad-dressing this issue concludes: "An examination of the legislative history of the Act shows that the prevailing interpreta-tion of section 205 [

i. e., the Court's interpretation] is not
consistent with congressional intent." Folk, Tolling of Statutes of Limitations under Section 205 of the Soldiers' and
Sailors' Civil Relief Act, 102 Mil. L. Rev. 157, 168 (1983). Finally, even the Government itself, which successfully urged
in this case the position we have adopted, until recently believed, on the basis of legislative history, the contrary. See
Townsend v. Secretary of Air Force, No. 90-1168, 1991 U. S.
App. LEXIS 26578, *5-*7 (CA4, Nov. 12, 1991); Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 17, n. 19 (filed June 2, 1992)
(noting Government's position in Townsend that $ 205 requires a showing of prejudice); see also Bickford v. United
States, 656 F. 2d 636, 640 (Ct. Cl. 1981) ("The Government
argues that the statute does not mean what it says because
the legislative history evinces Congress' intent to limit the
applicability of [$ 205] to those servicemen engaged in battle
or who are otherwise handicapped from asserting their
legal claims").

I confess that I have not personally investigated the entire
legislative history--or even that portion of it which relates
to the four statutes listed above. The excerpts I have examined and quoted were unearthed by a hapless law clerk to
whom I assigned the task. The other Justices have, in the
aggregate, many more law clerks than I, and it is quite possible that if they all were unleashed upon this enterprise they
would discover, in the legislative materials dating back to

1917 or earlier, many faces friendly to the Court's holding.Whether they would or not makes no difference to me--and

evidently makes no difference to the Court, which gives lip-service to legislative history but does not trouble to set forth
and discuss the foregoing material that others found so per-suasive. In my view, that is as it should be, except for the
lipservice. The language of the statute is entirely clear, andif that is not what Congress meant then Congress has made
a mistake and Congress will have to correct it. We shouldnot pretend to care about legislative intent (as opposed to
the meaning of the law), lest we impose upon the practicingbar and their clients obligations that we do not ourselves
take seriously.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES et al. v. TEXAS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-1729. Argued March 1, 1993--Decided April 5, 1993
States participating in the Food Stamp Program receive from the United

States Department of Agriculture coupons that they distribute to qualified individuals and households. If they distribute the coupons through
the mail, they must reimburse the Federal Government for part of the
replacement cost for any coupons that are lost or stolen. Texas, which
contractually bound itself to comply with all federal regulations governing the program, incurred substantial mail issuance losses and was informed that prejudgment interest would begin to accrue on its debt
unless payment was made within 30 days. After being denied administrative relief, Texas filed suit against the United States, arguing, inter
alia, that the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act) abrogated the United
States' common-law right to collect prejudgment interest on debts owed
to it by the States. The District Court granted summary judgment in
favor of the United States, but the Court of Appeals reversed.

Held: The Act left in place the States' federal common-law obligation to

pay prejudgment interest on debts owed to the Federal Government.
Pp. 533-539.

(a) It is a longstanding rule that a party owing debts to the Federal
Government must pay prejudgment interest where the underlying claim
is a contractual obligation to pay money. Also longstanding is the principle that statutes invading the common law are to be read with a presumption favoring retention of existing law except when a statutory
purpose to the contrary is evident. This presumption is not limited to
state common law or federal maritime law. Pp. 533-534.

(b) The Act is silent as to the States' obligations to pay prejudgment
interest. That the Act applies only to debts owed by a "person" establishes only Congress' intent to exempt the States from the obligation to
pay interest in accordance with the Act's mandatory provisions, not an
intent to relieve them of their common-law obligation. Given the differences between the Act--which requires federal agencies to collect
prejudgment interest at a preestablished rate--and the common law--
which gives federal courts flexibility in determining whether to impose
interest and the appropriate rate--it is logical to conclude that the Act
was intended to reach only private debtors and to leave the States alone.
The Act's purpose--to enhance the Government's debt collection abil507us2$52H 11-15-96 19:18:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ity--reinforces this reading of its plain language. Texas' proposed
reading, however, would give delinquent States less incentive to pay
their debts. Neither the fact that the Food Stamp Act has a mechanism
to collect debts nor the fact that Congress did not see the States as the
root of the debt collection problem when it passed the Debt Collection
Act indicates that Congress meant to relieve the States of their
common-law obligation. Texas incorrectly argues that the reimbursement requirement is not subject to prejudgment interest because it is a
penalty rather than a contractual obligation. Rodgers v. United States,

In this case we decide the question left open in West Vir-ginia v. United States, 479 U. S. 305, 312-313, n. 5 (1987):
whether Congress intended the Debt Collection Act of 1982to abrogate the United States' federal common-law right to
collect prejudgment interest on debts owed to it by theStates. We hold that it did not.

this case was 0.5% of each reporting area's total mail issuances for each

2 Title 7 CFR $ 272.2(a)(2) (1992) provides in pertinent part:

"The basic components of the State Plan of Operation are the Federal/
State Agreement, the Budget Projection Statement, and the Program Activity Statement. . . . The Federal/State Agreement is the legal agreement

losses, in part because United States Postal employees stolefood stamps that had been mailed by the Texas Department

of Human Services to qualified households. Because thoselosses exceeded the applicable tolerance level, Texas was
bound to reimburse the Federal Government for the excesslosses. The FNS notified Texas of its debt in the amount of
$412,385, and informed it that prejudgment interest wouldbegin to accrue on the balance unless payment was made
within 30 days.Texas sought administrative relief in the form of a waiver
of liability. After the Food Stamp Appeals Board denied therequested relief, Texas sued the United States in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Inaddition to challenging the Appeals Board's refusal to grant
a waiver of liability, Texas argued that the Debt CollectionAct precluded the imposition of prejudgment interest on any
amount it owed the Federal Government. The DistrictCourt granted summary judgment in favor of the United
States on both issues. With respect to the prejudgment in-terest issue, the District Court adopted the approach taken
by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Gallegos v.
Lyng, 891 F. 2d 788 (1989), which held that the Government'scommon-law right to prejudgment interest on debts owed to

it by the States survived enactment of the Debt CollectionAct. See Civ. Action Nos. A-87-CA-774, A-88-CA-820
(WD Tex., Nov. 13, 1990).The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the
District Court's decision concerning waiver, but reversed its
and FNS (USDA) further agree to fully comply with any changes in Federal law and regulations. This agreement may be modified with the mutual written consent of both parties.. . . . .

decision concerning prejudgment interest. 951 F. 2d 645(1992). Relying on the language of the Debt Collection Act,

the court held that the "Act is not silent concerning whetheror not state obligations should be subject to prejudgment
interest. The Act specifically excludes states from the payment of interest." Id., at 651. Because Congress did notimpose interest through the specific provisions of the Food

Stamp Act "during the time period relevant in this case, theCourts are not free to `supplement' Congress' enactment."
Ibid. (quoting Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S.618, 625 (1978)). The court rejected the argument that abrogation is inconsistent with the Act's purpose of enhancingthe Government's ability to collect its debts. In the court's
view, the Federal Government could enforce its claims for
unpaid mail issuance losses through the offset proceduresbuilt into the Food Stamp Act. Because of a split among the

Courts of Appeals on this question, we granted certiorari,
506 U. S. 813 (1992), and now reverse.3

Federal Government must pay prejudgment interest where
the underlying claim is a contractual obligation to pay

favoring the retention of long-established and familiar princi-ples, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 783 (1952);
Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501

abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak
directly" to the question addressed by the common law.
Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, supra, at 625; Milwaukee
v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).

Texas argues that this presumption favoring retention of
existing law is appropriate only with respect to state common law or federal maritime law. Although a different
standard applies when analyzing the effect of federal legislation on state law, id., at 316-317, there is no support in our
cases for the proposition that the presumption has no application to federal common law, or for a distinction between
general federal common law and federal maritime law in this
regard. We agree with Texas that Congress need not "affirmatively proscribe" the common-law doctrine at issue.
Brief for Respondents 3-4; see Milwaukee, supra, at 315.
But as we stated in Astoria, supra, "courts may take it as a
given that Congress has legislated with an expectation that
the [common law] principle will apply except `when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.' " 501 U. S., at 108
(quoting Isbrandtsen, supra, at 783).

The Debt Collection Act does not speak directly to the
Federal Government's right to collect prejudgment interest
on debts owed to it by the States. The Act states that "[t]he

turn, provides that the term " `person' does not include anagency of the United States Government, of a State government, or of a unit of general local government." $ 3701(c).Texas argues that this exemption clearly establishes Congress' intent to relieve the States of their common-law obli-gation to pay prejudgment interest. We disagree.

The only obligation from which $ 3701 exempts the Statesis the obligation to pay prejudgment interest in accordance
with the mandatory provisions of the Act. These impose astringent minimum interest requirement upon private persons owing money to the Federal Government. The statuteis silent as to the obligation of the States to pay prejudgment
interest on such debts. We agree with the Solicitor Generalthat "Congress's mere refusal to legislate with respect to the
prejudgment-interest obligations of state and local govern-ments falls far short of an expression of legislative intent to
supplant the existing common law in that area." Brief forPetitioners 16.

4 Both Texas and the Court of Appeals rely on Congress' authority to
impose interest obligations on the States through specific statutes, such
as the Medicaid Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1396b(d)(5), and the Social Security Act,
42 U. S. C. $ 418(j) (1982 ed.), to support the proposition that the Debt
Collection Act extinguished the Federal Government's common-law right
to collect prejudgment interest. Both statutes, however, codified and
made mandatory the common-law right to collect prejudgment interest at
a specified interest rate. Like the Debt Collection Act, these statutes
changed the common law. Congress' obvious desire to enhance the common law in specific, well-defined situations does not signal its desire to
extinguish the common law in other situations.

Texas also relies on the recent amendment to 7 U. S. C. $ 2022 adding a
provision requiring prejudgment interest on specific obligations arising
under the Food Stamp Act of 1977. Pub. L. 100-435, $ 602, 102 Stat. 1674

Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960)). Texas' argument also fails because, like

536 UNITED STATES v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
Our conclusion that the States remain subject to commonlaw prejudgment interest liability is supported by the fact
that the Debt Collection Act is more onerous than the common law. Section 3717(a) requires federal agencies to collect
prejudgment interest against persons and specifies the interest rate.5 The duty to pay prejudgment interest under the
common law, however, is by no means automatic. Before
imposing prejudgment interest, the courts must weigh the
competing federal and state interests. West Virginia, 479
U. S., at 309-311; Board of Comm'rs, 308 U. S., at 350. And
instead of imposing a preestablished rate of interest, the district courts retain discretion to choose the appropriate rate
in a given case. Unlike the common law, $ 3717 also imposes
processing fees and penalty charges, 31 U. S. C. $$ 3717(e)(1),
(e)(2). Given these differences, it is logical to conclude that
the Act was intended to reach only one subset of potential
debtors--persons--and to leave the other subset alone. It
is reasonable to apply more stringent requirements to debts
owed by private persons and to keep the more flexible common law in place for debts owed by state and local
governments.

The evident purpose of the Debt Collection Act reinforces
our reading of the plain language. The Act was designed
"[t]o increase the efficiency of Government-wide efforts to
collect debts owed the United States and to provide additional procedures for the collection of debts owed the United
States." 96 Stat. 1749; S. Rep. No. 97-378, p. 2 (1982) (the
Act responded to "increasing concern . . . expressed in Conthe Medicaid Act and the Social Security Act provisions, the Food Stamp
Act of 1977 did not merely codify the common law without change.
Rather, it contains a mandatory provision requiring prejudgment interest
at a specified rate.

5 The interest rate required under $ 3717 is "the average investment rate

for the Treasury tax and loan accounts for the 12-month period ending on
September 30 of each year, rounded to the nearest whole percentage
point." 31 U. S. C. $ 3717(a)(1).

Opinion of the Court
gress and elsewhere over the increasing backlog of unpaiddebts owed the federal government"). This suggests that

Congress passed the Act in order to strengthen the Govern-ment's hand in collecting its debts. Yet under the reading
proposed by Texas and the Court of Appeals, the Act would
have the anomalous effect of placing delinquent States in aposition where they had less incentive to pay their debts to

the Federal Government than they had prior to its passage.The Court of Appeals reasoned that the States would not
have an incentive to delay payment of their debts becausethe Food Stamp Act makes state agencies liable for actual
losses caused by coupon shortages or unauthorized issuances,
and permits the Federal Government to recover these debts
through an administrative offset procedure. 951 F. 2d, at
650. But the Debt Collection Act applies to all federal agencies, not just the FNS. Thus, the existence of a mechanism
in the Food Stamp Act allowing the FNS to collect its debts
does nothing to encourage prompt payment of debts governmentwide. That the FNS may have already possessed adequate sanctions to compel payment is not a reason to conclude that the generic language in the Debt Collection Act
was meant to abrogate the existing common-law obligation
of the States generally.

Texas concedes that Congress intended to enhance the
Government's debt collection efforts by passing the Act. It
argues, however, that Congress was concerned primarily
with debts owed by private persons. Accordingly, runs the
argument, Congress meant to relieve the States of their duty
to pay interest because the States were not the root of the
debt collection problem.

Part of this argument persuades; Congress in the Act
tightened the screws, so to speak, on the prejudgment interest obligations of private debtors to the Government, and
not on the States. It may be inferred from this fact that
the former were the root of the Government's debt collection
problems which inspired the Act. But it does not at all fol507us2$52H 11-15-96 19:18:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
low that because Congress did not tighten the screws on theStates, it therefore intended that the screws be entirely removed. The more logical conclusion is that it left the screwsin place, untightened.

As a last-ditch argument, Texas contends that its liabilityfor losses in the mail is not a contractual debt for which it
owes prejudgment interest, but rather a penalty unilaterallyimposed by Congress. See

Rodgers v. United States, 332U. S. 371, 374-376 (1947) (penalties are not normally subject

to prejudgment interest). This argument fails because theobligation of Texas to reimburse the Government for a portion of the stamps lost in the mail is quite different from thatinvolved in

Rodgers. There the penalties in question wereunilaterally imposed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act on

farmers who exceeded their production quotas; there wasno suggestion that the farmers ever consented to such penalties. Here, on the other hand, Texas signed a Federal/StateAgreement, the express terms of which bound the State to
act in accordance with the implementing regulations. 7CFR $ 272.2(a)(2) (1986); see also n. 2,

supra. Thus, 7 CFR$ 274.3(c)(4) (1986), which imposed liability for mail issuance

losses above a specified tolerance level, was incorporated intoTexas' Federal/State Agreement. The requirement that the
States reimburse the Federal Government for a certain por-tion of mail issuance losses is not a penalty, but a contractual
obligation which the State assumed.6

6 Both Texas and the Court of Appeals rely upon our decision in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1 (1981), for the
proposition that the Federal Government may not collect prejudgment
interest because neither the Debt Collection Act nor the Food Stamp Act
expressly require prejudgment interest. This reliance is misplaced. In
Pennhurst, we held that in order to impose conditions on the receipt of
federal funds, Congress must speak unambiguously. Id., at 17. This
makes sense because the States cannot voluntarily and knowingly agree
to a condition that is not clearly expressed. Ibid. Because the duty to
pay prejudgment interest on debts owed to the United States existed long

The judgment of the Court of Appeals to the contrary isaccordingly

Reversed.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
As the Court correctly notes, the requirement that privateparties must pay prejudgment interest on contractual debts

owed to the United States is a common-law rule of longstanding.

Ante, at 533. Over a century ago we recognizedan equally well-established exception to that rule: The

United States is not entitled to recover interest from a Stateunless the State's consent to pay such interest has been expressed in a statute or binding contract. United States v.North Carolina, 136 U. S. 211 (1890).

1 The reason for this

exception is not any sovereign immunity attributable to aState,

2 but the venerable presumption that a sovereign State

is always ready, willing, and able to discharge its obliga-tions promptly.

created, the rule in Pennhurst does not apply. See Bell v. New Jersey,
461 U. S. 773, 790, n. 17 (1983).

1 "Interest, when not stipulated for by contract, or authorized by statute,

is allowed by the courts as damages for the detention of money or of
property, or of compensation, to which the plaintiff is entitled; and, as has
been settled on grounds of public convenience, is not to be awarded against
a sovereign government, unless its consent to pay interest has been manifested by an act of its legislature, or by a lawful contract of its executive
officers. United States v. Sherman, 98 U. S. 565; Angarica v. Bayard, 127
U. S. 251, 260, and authorities there collected; In re Gosman, 17 Ch. D.
771." United States v. North Carolina, 136 U. S., at 216.

2 The individual States retain no sovereign immunity against the Federal Government. United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892).

3 "Judgments, it is true, are by the law of South Carolina, as well as by

Federal legislation, declared to bear interest. Such legislation, however,
has no application to the government. And the interest is no part of the

Stevens, J., dissenting
The presumption that a sovereign State is "always readyto pay what it owes"

4 may well have been just as fictional

as the presumption that the King could do no wrong, butit nevertheless was firmly embedded in the common law.

5

Moreover, even today the tradition of according special re-spect to a sovereign State whenever it is subjected to the

coercive powers of judicial tribunals is very much alive.See,

e. g., Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v.Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 146 (1993). The ancient

common-law presumption and a continuing recognition of"the importance of ensuring that the State's dignitary interests can be fully vindicated," ibid., best explain why Con-gress deliberately omitted any provision for the collection of
interest from a sovereign State when it enacted the DebtCollection Act in 1982.

6

The Court is also correct in noting that we are reluctantto infer a legislative abrogation of the common law. Ante,

at 534. We presume that Congress understands the legalterrain in which it operates, see

Cannon v. Universityof Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 698-699 (1979), and we therefore

amount recovered. It accrues only after the recovery has been had. Moreover, whenever interest is allowed either by statute or by common law,
except in cases where there has been a contract to pay interest, it is allowed for delay or default of the debtor. But delay or default cannot be
attributed to the government. It is presumed to be always ready to pay
what it owes." United States v. Sherman, 98 U. S. 565, 567-568 (1879)
(emphasis added). See also United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., 253 U. S. 330, 336 (1920).

4 See n. 3, supra.

5 See, e. g., Attorney General v. Cape Fear Navigation Co., 37 N. C. 444,

454 (1843) ("[T]he general rule is, that the State never pays interest, unless she expressly engages to do so"); State v. Thompson, 10 Ark. 61 (1849).

6 Title 31 U. S. C. $ 3717(a) requires the appropriate government official

to charge interest "on an outstanding debt on a United States Government
claim owed by a person," but 31 U. S. C. $ 3701(c) provides that for purposes of this section the term " `person' does not include an agency of the
United States Government, of a State government, or of a unit of general
local government."

expect Congress to state clearly any intent to reshape thatterrain. Before we can apply this reluctance to infer legislative abrogations of the common law, however, we must deter-mine what that terrain was--or at least how it might have
been perceived--when Congress acted; Congress cannotthink it necessary, and we should not expect it, to state
clearly an intent to abrogate a common-law rule that doesnot exist.

When Congress enacted the Debt Collection Act of 1982,the question whether interest might ever be collected from
a sovereign State unless explicitly authorized was undecidedby this Court. We had never held that the United States
could demand prejudgment interest on a debt owed to it by aState. Not until five years later, in West Virginia v. United
States, 479 U. S. 305 (1987), did we hold for the first timethat in some circumstances the United States may demand
prejudgment interest from the States themselves. TheCourt therefore rewrites the history of our common law
when it predicates its entire analysis of this case on what itcreatively describes as "the United States' federal commonlaw right to collect prejudgment interest on debts owed toit by the States."

Ante, at 530. Only through hindsight--or by crediting Congress with a prescience as to what the

common law would become--can the Court find that the 97thCongress did not intend to abrogate a rule that did not then
exist.7 Congress had every reason to think it was writing

7 So long as we are going to credit the Congress with a post hoc understanding of the common law, we might as well refer to the post hoc comments of the author of the amendment, Senator Percy:

"Prior to September 27, 1982, neither Senate bill 1249 nor House bill
4613 contained a provision exempting any entity from the Act. Several
interest groups, however, presented the view that sections 10 and 11 of
the Act, except in cases where fraud was evident, should not be applied
to states or local governments because they constituted a different class
of debtor than did private individuals and would suffer great harm if the
federal government attempted to assess interest or apply administrative
offsets against them. These same concerns had been presented in hear507us2$52H 11-15-96 19:18:06 PAGES OPINPGT

on a "clean slate," ante, at 534, when it decided to excludethe State from its definition of the class of persons who must

pay interest on debts to the United States. There was nooccasion for Congress to specifically abrogate a principle that
it had no reason to think stood in its way.In

Board of Comm'rs of Jackson County v. United States,308 U. S. 343 (1939), the Court held that the United States,

suing on behalf of a Native American, could not recover pre-judgment interest from a county even though the county had
improperly collected those taxes. While noting that "inter-est in inter-governmental litigation has no . . . roots in history," id., at 351, the Court did not rule out the possibilitythat in an unusual case, considerations of fairness might
make it appropriate to collect such interest from a stateagency, see

id., at 352. Only to that small extent, therefore,

ings before the House Committee on the Judiciary during the House's consideration of the Debt Collection Act of 1981, H. R. 4614.

"In response to these concerns, on September 27, 1982, I proposed an
amendment to S. 1249. This amendment, UP amendment 1299, amended
provisions in Sections 10 and 11 of the Act, stating that `the term "person"
does not include any agency of the United States, or any state or local
government.' This provision effectively took federal agencies, states and
local governments out of the Act, but retained sufficient flexibility to permit Congress to legislatively pick and choose according to circumstances,
those situations in which the government might assess interest against
those entities exempted by the Act. As enacted, the Debt Collection Act
of 1982 appears clear on this point. It was not anticipated that federal
agencies would attempt to invoke common law authority, which, if it exists
with respect to interest assessment and administrative offset against
states and local governments, was abrogated by sections 10(e)(2) and
11(e)(8) of the Act." Letter of Nov. 21, 1983, from Senator Charles H.
Percy to the Comptroller General (emphasis added). See Texas v. United
States, 951 F. 2d 645, 649-650 (CA5 1992); Pennsylvania Dept. of Public
Welfare v. United States, 781 F. 2d 334, 341, n. 10 (CA3 1986). Of course,
the significance of a comment by an individual legislator is discounted
when made " `after passage of the Act,' " see Bread Political Action Committee v. FEC, 455 U. S. 577, 582, n. 3 (1982). This Court's use of the 1987
opinion in the West Virginia case to describe the state of the common law
in 1982 should be similarly discounted.

In fact, in West Virginia, we rejected the balancing of eq-uities that Board of Comm'rs had suggested might be the

the Federal Government for costs advanced to it under theDisaster Relief Act of 1970. The Court held that "any rule
exempting a sovereign from the payment of prejudgmentinterest not only does not apply of its own force to the State's

U. S., at 311-312 (footnotes omitted). This was the firststatement by this Court suggesting that the States might be
generally liable for prejudgment interest on the contractualclaims brought by the Federal Government. And, even
though we came close to saying in West Virginia that suchinterest is generally available, we did not go that far. Even
in 1987--five years after the Debt Collection Act waspassed--it was not clear to us, to Congress, or to the States
that the obligation of a State to pay prejudgment interest tothe Government would extend to a typical contract claim.

Thus, even though the Court today suggests that its deci-sion is merely an application of Board of Comm'rs and West
Virginia, it actually takes a significant and independent steptoward equating the Government's right to collect prejudgment interest from the States with the Government's right

8 "The cases teach that interest is not recovered according to a rigid
theory of compensation for money withheld, but is given in response to
considerations of fairness. It is denied when its exaction would be inequitable. United States v. Sanborn, 135 U. S. 271, 281; Billings v. United
States, 232 U. S. 261." Board of Commr's of Jackson County v. United
States, 308 U. S. 343, 352 (1939). In 1987 the Court rejected the argument
that "whether interest had to be paid depended on a balancing of equities
between the parties." West Virginia v. United States, 479 U. S., at 311,

9 Even if such an equation were well advised,

which it may well be, it would say nothing about whetherCongress had any reason to know in 1982 that the common

law was moving in that direction, much less that it had al-ready arrived there. Yet the Court supports today's decision because the 97th Congress did not clearly state its inten-tion to abrogate a rule that we now make clear for the first
time.My point, in sum, is not that the States had an absolute
common-law immunity from a claim for prejudgment interestin 1982; it is only that the State's

obligation to pay suchinterest was so much
less than a confirmed rule that we can-not say that the 1982 enactment "left [it] in place," ante, at

should be imposed, and at what rate, ante, at 536, the Court has tacitly
authorized an extension of the rule on which we relied in West Virginia

NEWARK MORNING LEDGER CO., as successor to

THE HERALD CO. v. UNITED STATES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 91-1135. Argued November 10, 1992--Decided April 20, 1993
Petitioner newspaper publisher is the successor to The Herald Company.

When, in 1976, Herald purchased substantially all the outstanding
shares of Booth Newspapers, Inc., it allocated its adjusted income tax
basis in the Booth shares among the assets it acquired in its merger
with Booth. Among other things, it allocated $67.8 million to an intangible asset denominated "paid subscribers," a figure that was petitioner's estimate of future profits to be derived from identified subscribers
to Booth's eight newspapers on the date of merger. On its federal income tax returns for 1977-1980, Herald claimed depreciation deductions
for the $67.8 million, which were disallowed by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) on the ground that the concept of "paid subscribers" was
indistinguishable from goodwill and, therefore, was nondepreciable.
Herald paid the taxes, and petitioner filed refund claims and ultimately
brought suit in the District Court to recover taxes and interest paid.
At trial, the Government did not contest petitioner's expert evidence on
the methodology used to calculate its figure and stipulated to the useful
life of "paid subscribers" for each newspaper. Instead, it estimated the
asset's value at $3 million, the cost of generating new subscriptions, and
its principal argument remained that the asset was indistinguishable
from goodwill. The court ruled in petitioner's favor, finding that the
asset was not self-regenerating--i. e., it had a limited useful life, the
duration of which could be calculated with reasonable accuracy--that
petitioner properly calculated its value, and that it was separate and
distinct from goodwill. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
even though the asset may have a limited useful life that can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy, its value is not separate and distinct
from goodwill.

Held:

1. A taxpayer able to prove that a particular asset can be valued and
that it has a limited useful life may depreciate its value over its useful
life regardless of how much the asset appears to reflect the expectancy
of continued patronage. Pp. 553-566.

(a) While the depreciation allowance of $ 167(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code applies to intangible assets, the IRS has consistently
taken the position that goodwill is nondepreciable. Since the value
of customer-based intangibles, such as customer and subscriber lists, obviously depends on continued and voluntary customer patronage, the
question has been whether these intangibles can be depreciated notwithstanding their relationship to such patronage. The "mass asset"
rule that courts often resort to in considering this question prohibits
depreciation when the assets constitute self-regenerating assets that
may change but never waste. Pp. 553-560.

(b) Whether or not taxpayers have been successful in separating
depreciable intangible assets from goodwill in any particular case is a
question of fact. The question is not whether an asset falls within the
core of the concept of goodwill, but whether it is capable of being valued
and whether that value diminishes over time. Pp. 560-566.

2. Petitioner has borne successfully its substantial burden of proving
that "paid subscribers" constitutes an intangible asset with an ascertainable value and a limited useful life, the duration of which can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. It has proved that the asset is not
self-regenerating but rather wastes as a finite number of component
subscriptions are canceled over a reasonably predictable period of time.
The Government presented no evidence to refute the methodology petitioner used to estimate the asset's fair market value, and the uncontroverted evidence presented at trial revealed that "paid subscribers" had
substantial value over and above that of a mere list of customers, as it
was mistakenly characterized by the Government. Pp. 566-570.

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the issue whether, under $ 167 of the

asset proved to have an ascertainable value and a limited
useful life, the duration of which can be ascertained with

asset to be goodwill as a matter of law.1

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioner Newark Morning Ledger Co., a New Jersey cor-poration, is a newspaper publisher. It is the successor to

The Herald Company with which it merged in 1987. Elevenyears earlier, in 1976, Herald had purchased substantially
all the outstanding shares of Booth Newspapers, Inc., thepublisher of daily and Sunday newspapers in eight Michigan
communities.2 Herald and Booth merged on May 31, 1977,and Herald continued to publish the eight papers under their
old names. Tax code provisions in effect in 1977 requiredthat Herald allocate its adjusted income tax basis in the
Booth shares among the assets acquired in proportion totheir respective fair market values at the time of the merger.
See 26 U. S. C. $$ 332 and 334(b)(2) (1976 ed.).3Prior to the merger, Herald's adjusted basis in the Booth
shares was approximately $328 million. Herald allocated$234 million of this to various financial assets (cash, securities, accounts and notes receivable, the shares of its whollyowned subsidiary that published Parade Magazine, etc.) and
tangible assets (land, buildings, inventories, production

"(2) of property held for the production of income."
Treasury Regulations $ 1.167(a)-(3) interprets $ 167(a) and states:
"If an intangible asset is known from experience or other factors to be
of use in the business or in the production of income for only a limited
period, the length of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy,
such an intangible asset may be the subject of a depreciation allowance.
Examples are patents and copyrights. An intangible asset, the useful life
of which is not limited, is not subject to the allowance for depreciation.
No allowance will be permitted merely because, in the unsupported opinion of the taxpayer, the intangible asset has a limited useful life. No
deduction for depreciation is allowable with respect to goodwill." 26
CFR $ 1.167(a)-3 (1992).

2 The eight Michigan papers were The Ann Arbor News, The Bay City

Times, The Flint Journal, The Grand Rapids Press, The Jackson Citizen
Patriot, Kalamazoo Gazette, The Muskegon Chronicle, and The Saginaw
News.

3 Section 334(b)(2) was repealed in 1982 and replaced by the somewhat

different provisions of the present $ 338 of the Code.

550 NEWARK MORNING LEDGER CO. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
equipment, computer hardware, etc.). Herald also allocated
$67.8 million to an intangible asset denominated "paid subscribers." 4 This consisted of 460,000 identified subscribers
to the eight Booth newspapers as of May 31, 1977, the date
of merger. These subscribers were customers each of whom
had requested that the paper be delivered regularly to a
specified address in return for payment of the subscription
price. The $67.8 million figure was petitioner's estimate of
future profits to be derived from these at-will subscribers,
all or most of whom were expected to continue to subscribe
after the Herald acquisition. The number of "paid subscribers" was apparently an important factor in Herald's decision
to purchase Booth and in its determination of the appropriate purchase price for the Booth shares. See Brief for
Petitioner 4-5. After these allocations, the approximately
$26.2 million remaining was allocated to going-concern value
and goodwill.

On its federal income tax returns for the calendar years
1977-1980, inclusive, Herald claimed depreciation deductions
on a straight-line basis for the $67.8 million allocated to "paid
subscribers." The IRS disallowed these deductions on the
ground that the concept of "paid subscribers" was indistinguishable from goodwill and, therefore, was nondepreciable
under the applicable regulations. Herald paid the resulting
additional taxes. After the 1987 merger, petitioner filed
timely claims for refund. The IRS took no action on the
claims, and, upon the expiration of the prescribed 6-month
period, see 26 U. S. C. $ 6532(a)(1), petitioner brought suit in

4 According to petitioner, the term " `paid subscribers' is intended to reflect the fact that the customers in question paid for their newspapers,
rather than receiving them for free, and that they subscribed to the newspaper, requesting regular delivery, rather than purchasing it on a single
copy basis." Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 5. The term does not connote subscription payments in advance; indeed, the customer relationship was terminable at will.

Opinion of the Court
the District of New Jersey to recover taxes and interest thatit claimed had been assessed and collected erroneously.

The case was tried to the court. Petitioner presented fi-nancial and statistical experts who testified that, using generally accepted statistical techniques, they were able to estimate how long the average at-will subscriber of each Boothnewspaper as of May 31, 1977, would continue to subscribe.

The estimates ranged from 14.7 years for a daily subscriberto The Ann Arbor News to 23.4 years for a subscriber to the
Sunday edition of The Bay City Times. This was so despitethe fact that the total number of subscribers remained
almost constant during the tax years in question. The experts based their estimates on actuarial factors such as
death, relocation, changing tastes, and competition from
other media. The experts also testified that the value of
"paid subscribers" was appropriately calculated using the
"income approach." Under this, petitioner's experts first
calculated the present value of the gross-revenue stream
that would be generated by these subscriptions over their
estimated useful lives. From that amount they subtracted
projected costs of collecting the subscription revenue. Petitioner contended that the resulting estimated net-revenue
stream--calculated as $67,773,000 by one of its experts--was
a reasonable estimate of the value of "paid subscribers."

The Government did not contest petitioner's expert evidence at all. In fact, it stipulated to the estimates of the
useful life of "paid subscribers" for each newspaper. Also,
on valuation, the Government presented little or no evidence
challenging petitioner's calculations. Instead, it argued
that the only value attributable to the asset in question was
the cost of generating 460,000 new subscribers through a
subscription drive. Under this "cost approach," the Government estimated the value of the asset to be approximately
$3 million.

The Government's principal argument throughout the litigation has been that "paid subscribers" represents an asset

552 NEWARK MORNING LEDGER CO. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
indistinguishable from the goodwill of the Booth newspapers.According to the Government, the future stream of revenue

expected to be generated by the 460,000 "paid subscribers"represented the very essence of the goodwill value of the
newspapers. It argued that because goodwill is nondepreciable, the value of "paid subscribers" cannot be depreciatedbut must be added to basis so that, when the business is

disposed of, the cost of the asset will be deducted from theproceeds in computing capital gain or loss.

The District Court (Judge H. Lee Sarokin) ruled in peti-tioner's favor. 734 F. Supp. 176 (NJ 1990). It found as
a fact that the "paid subscribers" asset was not self-regenerating--it had a limited useful life the duration of
which could be calculated with reasonable accuracy. Id., at
180. The court further found that the value of "paid sub-scribers" was properly calculated using the "income approach" and that the asset itself was separate and distinctfrom goodwill. "[O]ne must distinguish between a galaxy of
customers who may or may not return, whose frequency isunknown, and whose quantity and future purchases cannot
be predicted, against subscribers who can be predicted topurchase the same item, for the same price on a daily basis."
Id., at 176-177.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 945
F. 2d 555 (1991). It concluded that the District Court had
erred in defining goodwill as that which remains after all
assets with determinable useful lives and ascertainable
values have been accounted for. Id., at 568. The court concluded that goodwill has a substantive meaning--the expectancy that " `old customers will resort to the old place' of
business," id., at 567--and that "paid subscribers" is the essence of goodwill. Even though the "paid subscribers" asset
may have a limited useful life that can be ascertained with
reasonable accuracy, the court held that its value is not separate and distinct from goodwill. Id., at 568.

The Court of Appeals denied petitioner's suggestion for
rehearing in banc, with two judges dissenting. See App. to

Section 167(a) of the Code allows as a deduction for depreciation a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion and wear
and tear, including obsolescence, of property used in a trade
or business or of property held for the production of income.
See n. 1, supra. This Court has held that "the primary purpose" of an annual depreciation deduction is "to further the
integrity of periodic income statements by making a meaningful allocation of the cost entailed in the use (excluding
maintenance expense) of the asset to the periods to which it
contributes." Massey Motors, Inc. v. United States, 364
U. S. 92, 104 (1960). The depreciation deduction has been a
part of the federal tax system at least since 1909, when Congress recognized that a corporation should calculate its annual net income by deducting from gross income "all losses
actually sustained within the year and not compensated by
insurance or otherwise, including a reasonable allowance for
depreciation of property, if any." Tariff of 1909, $ 38 Second,
36 Stat. 113. Nothing in the text of the 1909 statute or
in the implementing Treasury Decision precluded a depreciation allowance for intangible property.6 This changed in

5 Compare the Third Circuit's ruling in the present case with Donrey,
Inc. v. United States, 809 F. 2d 534 (CA8 1987). See also Citizens &
Southern Corp. v. Commissioner, 91 T. C. 463 (1988), aff'd, 919 F. 2d 1492
(CA11 1990).

6 According to the Treasury Department, the depreciation deduction

"should be the estimated amount of the loss, accrued during the year to
which the return relates, in the value of the property in respect of which
such deduction is claimed that arises from exhaustion, wear and tear, or
obsolescence out of the uses to which the property is put . . . . This
estimate should be formed upon the assumed life of the property, its cost
value, and its use." Treas. Regs. 31, Art. 4, p. 11 (1909).

554 NEWARK MORNING LEDGER CO. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
1914 with the promulgation of Treas. Regs. 33 (1914) issued
under the 1913 Income Tax Law.7

The Revenue Act of 1918, $ 234(a)(7), authorized a "reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property
used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence." 40 Stat. 1078 (1919). Treasury
Regs. 45 (1919), promulgated under the 1918 Act, explicitly
recognized that intangible assets "may be the subject of a
depreciation allowance." Art. 163. Thereafter, the regulations governing the depreciation of intangible assets have
remained essentially unchanged. The current version is set
forth in n. 1, supra.

Since 1927, the IRS consistently has taken the position
that "goodwill" is nondepreciable.8 One court has said specifically: "Indeed, this proposition is so well settled that the
only question litigated in recent years regarding this area of
the law is whether a particular asset is `goodwill.' " Hous7 Treasury Regs. 33 provided explicitly that the depreciation deduction
should be "estimated on the cost of the physical property with respect to
which such deduction is claimed, which loss results from wear and tear
due to the use to which the property is put" (emphasis added). Art. 159.
Furthermore, "[a]ssets of any character whatever which are not affected
by use, wear and tear (except patents, copyrights, etc.) are not subject to
the depreciation allowance authorized by this act." Art. 162.

8 Between 1919 and 1927, the IRS recognized that the goodwill of distillers and dealers might be depreciable as a result of the passage of the
Eighteenth Amendment prohibiting the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors. See T. B. R. 44, 1 Cum. Bull. 133 (1919). But
in 1926, the Eighth Circuit, in Red Wing Malting Co. v. Willcuts, 15 F. 2d
626, cert. denied, 273 U. S. 763 (1927), ruled that, under the plain language
of the Revenue Act of 1918, goodwill could not be depreciated, for the
depreciation provision "limits the allowance for obsolescence to such property as is susceptible to exhaustion, wear, and tear by use in the business,
and good will is not such property." 15 F. 2d, at 633. Following Red
Wing Malting, the Treasury Department amended its regulations to provide: "No deduction for depreciation, including obsolescence, is allowable
in respect of good will." T. D. 4055, VI-2 Cum. Bull. 63 (1927). That has
been the position of the IRS ever since.

A

"Goodwill" is not defined in the Code or in any TreasuryDepartment Regulations. There have been attempts, however, to devise workable definitions of the term. In Metropolitan Bank v. St. Louis Dispatch Co., 149 U. S. 436 (1893),for example, this Court considered whether a newspaper's

goodwill survived after it was purchased and ceased publish-ing under its old name. It ruled that the goodwill did not
survive, relying on Justice Story's notable description of"goodwill" as

" `the advantage or benefit, which is acquired by an es-tablishment, beyond the mere value of the capital, stock,
funds, or property employed therein, in consequence ofthe general public patronage and encouragement which
it receives from constant or habitual customers, on ac-count of its local position, or common celebrity, or reputation for skill or affluence, or punctuality, or from otheraccidental circumstances or necessity, or even from
ancient partialities or prejudices.' " Id., at 446, quotingJ. Story, Partnerships $ 99 (1841).

In Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U. S. 153 (1915),the Court described goodwill as "that element of value which
inheres in the fixed and favorable consideration of custom-ers, arising from an established and well-known and wellconducted business." Id., at 165. See also Los AngelesGas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Comm'n of California, 289
U. S. 287, 313 (1933) (distinguishing "going concern" from"good will" when fixing rates for public utilities).

Although the definition of goodwill has taken differentforms over the years, the shorthand description of goodwill
as "the expectancy of continued patronage," Boe v. Commis507us2$54M 11-15-96 19:23:18 PAGES OPINPGT
556 NEWARK MORNING LEDGER CO. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
sioner, 307 F. 2d 339, 343 (CA9 1962), provides a useful label
with which to identify the total of all the imponderable qualities that attract customers to the business. See Houston
Chronicle Publishing Co. v. United States, 481 F. 2d, at 1248,
n. 5. This definition, however, is of little assistance to a
taxpayer trying to evaluate which of its intangible assets
is subject to a depreciation allowance. The value of every
intangible asset is related, to a greater or lesser degree, to
the expectation that customers will continue their patronage.9 But since 1918, at least some intangible assets have
been depreciable. Because intangible assets do not exhaust
or waste away in the same manner as tangible assets, taxpayers must establish that public taste or other socioeconomic forces will cause the intangible asset to be retired
from service, and they must estimate a reasonable date by
which this event will occur. See B. Bittker & M. McMahon,
Federal Income Taxation of Individuals ||12.4, p. 12-10
(1988). Intangibles such as patents and copyrights are depreciable over their "legal lives," which are specified by statute. Covenants not to compete, leaseholds, and life estates,
for example, are depreciable over their useful lives that are
expressly limited by contract.

9 We emphasize that while the "expectancy of continued patronage" is a
serviceable description of what we generally mean when we describe an
intangible asset that has no useful life and no ascertainable value, this
shibboleth tells us nothing about whether the asset in question is depreciable. The dissent concedes that "the law concerning the depreciation of
intangible assets related to goodwill has developed on a case-by-case
basis," post, at 576, n. 4, yet, inexplicably, it suggests that "[s]uch matters
are not at issue in this case, however, because the asset that Ledger seeks
to depreciate is indistinguishable from goodwill," ibid. As we demonstrate below, an intangible asset with an ascertainable value and a limited
useful life, the duration of which can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy, is depreciable under $ 167 of the Code. The fact that it may also be

Opinion of the Court
The category of intangibles that has given the IRS andthe courts difficulty is that group of assets sometimes denominated "customer-based intangibles." This group includescustomer lists, insurance expirations, subscriber lists, bank
deposits, cleaning-service accounts, drugstore-prescriptionfiles, and any other identifiable asset the value of which obviously depends on the continued and voluntary patronage ofcustomers. The question has been whether these intangibles can be depreciated notwithstanding their relationship to"the expectancy of continued patronage."

B
When considering whether a particular customer-based in-tangible asset may be depreciated, courts often have turned

to a "mass asset" or "indivisible asset" rule. The rule pro-vides that certain kinds of intangible assets are properly
grouped and considered as a single entity; even though theindividual components of the asset may expire or terminate
over time, they are replaced by new components, therebycausing only minimal fluctuations and no measurable loss in
the value of the whole. The following is the usually ac-cepted description of a mass asset:

"[A] purchased terminable-at-will type of customer listis an indivisible business property with an indefinite,
nondepreciable life, indistinguishable from--and theprincipal element of--goodwill, whose ultimate value
lies in the expectancy of continued patronage throughpublic acceptance. It is subject to temporary attrition
as well as expansion through departure of some custom-ers, acquisition of others, and increase or decrease in the
requirements of individual customers. A normal turn-over of customers represents merely the ebb and flow of
a continuing property status in this species, and does notwithin ordinary limits give rise to the right to deduct
for tax purposes the loss of individual customers. Thewhole is equal to the sum of its fluctuating parts at any

given time, but each individual part enjoys no separatecapital standing independent of the whole, for its disappearance affects but does not interrupt or destroythe continued existence of the whole." Golden State
Towel & Linen Service, Ltd. v. United States, 179 Ct.Cl. 300, 310, 373 F. 2d 938, 944 (1967).

The mass-asset rule prohibits the depreciation of certaincustomer-based intangibles because they constitute selfregenerating assets that may change but never waste. Al-though there may have been some doubt prior to 1973 as to
whether the mass-asset rule required that any asset relatedto the expectancy of continued patronage always be treated
as nondepreciable goodwill as a matter of law, that doubt wasput to rest by the Fifth Circuit in the

Houston Chroniclecase. The court there considered whether subscription lists,

acquired as part of the taxpayer's purchase of The HoustonPress, were depreciable. The taxpayer had no intention of
continuing publication of the purchased paper, so there wasno question of the lists' being self-regenerating; they had
value only to the extent that they furnished names and ad-dresses of prospective subscribers to the taxpayer's newspaper. After reviewing the history of the mass-asset rule, thecourt concluded that there was no

per se rule that an intangi-ble asset is nondepreciable whenever it is related to goodwill. On the contrary, the rule does not prevent taking adepreciation allowance "if the taxpayer properly carries his
dual burden of proving that the intangible asset involved (1)has an ascertainable value separate and distinct from goodwill, and (2) has a limited useful life, the duration of whichcan be ascertained with reasonable accuracy."

Houston
Chronicle, 481 F. 2d, at 1250.Following the decision in Houston Chronicle, the IRS issued a new ruling, modifying prior rulings "to remove anyimplication that customer and subscription lists, location contracts, insurance expirations, etc., are, as a matter of law,indistinguishable from goodwill possessing no determinable

useful life." Rev. Rul. 74-456, 1974-2 Cum. Bull. 65, 66.The IRS continued to claim that customer-based intangibles

generally are in the nature of goodwill, representing "thecustomer structure of a business, their value lasting until an
indeterminate time in the future." Nonetheless, it acknowl-edged that, "in an unusual case," the taxpayer may prove
that the "asset or a portion thereof does not possess the char-acteristics of goodwill, is susceptible of valuation, and is of
use to the taxpayer in its trade or business for only a limitedperiod of time."

Ibid. Under these circumstances, the IRSrecognized the possibility that the customer-based intangible

asset could be depreciated over its useful life.Despite the suggestion by the Court of Appeals in this
case that the mass-asset rule is "now outdated," 945 F. 2d,at 561, it continues to guide the decisions of the Tax Court
with respect to certain intangible assets. In Ithaca Industries, Inc. v. Commissioner, 97 T. C. 253 (1991), for example,the Tax Court recently considered whether a taxpayer could

depreciate the value allocated to the trained work force of apurchased going concern over the length of time each employee remained with the purchasing company. The courtacknowledged that "whether the assembled work force is an
intangible asset with an ascertainable value and a limiteduseful life separate from goodwill or going-concern value is
a question of fact." Id., at 263-264. After reviewing therecord, it concluded that the mass-asset rule applied to prohibit the depreciation of the cost of acquiring the assembledwork force:

"Although the assembled work force is used to produceincome, this record fails to show that its value diminishes as a result of the passing of time or through use.As an employee terminated his or her employment, another would be hired and trained to take his or her place.While the assembled work force might be subject to
temporary attrition as well as expansion through depar-ture of some employees and the hiring of others, it

would not be depleted due to the passage of time or asa result of use. The turnover rate of employees represents merely the ebb and flow of a continuing work force.An employee's leaving does not interrupt or destroy the
continued existence of the whole." Id., at 267.
As a factual matter, the Tax Court found that the taxpayerhired a new worker only so it could replace a worker "who

resigned, retired, or was fired." Id., at 268. The courtfound that the "assembled work force" was a nondiminishing
asset; new employees were trained in order to keep the "as-sembled work force" unchanged, and the cost of the training
was a deductible expense. Id., at 271.

IV
Since 1973, when Houston Chronicle clarified that theavailability of the depreciation allowance was primarily a

question of fact, taxpayers have sought to depreciate a widevariety of customer-based intangibles. The courts that
have found these assets depreciable have based their conclu-sions on carefully developed factual records. In

Richard S.
Miller & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 210 Ct. Cl. 431, 537F. 2d 446 (1976), for example, the court considered whether

a taxpayer was entitled to a depreciation deduction for 1,383insurance expirations that it had purchased from another insurer.10 The court concluded that the taxpayer had carriedits heavy burden of proving that the expirations had an ascertainable value separate and distinct from goodwill andhad a limited useful life, the duration of which could be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. The court acknowledged

10 An "expiration" is a copy of the face of an insurance policy made when
the policy is issued. It shows the name of the insured, the type of insurance, the premium, the covered property, and the expiration date. "Its
principal value in the insurance business is its indication of the most advantageous time to solicit a renewal." Richard S. Miller & Sons, Inc. v.
United States, 210 Ct. Cl., at 436, 537 F. 2d, at 450.

Opinion of the Court
that the insurance expirations constituted a "mass asset" theuseful life of which had to be "determined from facts relative

to the whole, and not from experience with any particularpolicy or account involved."

Id., at 443, 537 F. 2d, at 454.
The court also noted, however, that the mass-asset rule does
not prevent a depreciation deduction "where the expirationsas a single asset can be valued separately and the requisite

showing made that the useful life of the information con-tained in the intangible asset as a whole is of limited duration." Id., at 439, 537 F. 2d, at 452. All the policies werescheduled to expire within three years, but their continuing
value lay in their being renewable. Based on statistics gath-ered over a 5-year period, the taxpayer was able to estimate
that the mass asset had a useful life of not more than 10
years from the date of purchase. Any renewals after thattime would be attributable to the skill, integrity, and reputation of the taxpayer rather than to the value of the original
expirations. "The package of expirations demonstrably was
a wasting asset." Id., at 444, 537 F. 2d, at 455. The court
ruled that the taxpayer could depreciate the cost of the collection of insurance expirations over the useful life of the
mass asset.

In Citizens & Southern Corp. v. Commissioner, 91 T. C.
463 (1988), aff 'd, 919 F. 2d 1492 (CA11 1990), the taxpayer
argued that it was entitled to depreciate the bank-deposit
base acquired in the purchase of nine separate banks.11 The
taxpayer sought to depreciate the present value of the income it expected to derive from the use of the balances of
deposit accounts existing at the time of the bank purchases.

11 The term "deposit base" describes "the intangible asset that arises in
a purchase transaction representing the present value of the future stream
of income to be derived from employing the purchased core deposits of a
bank." Citizens & Southern Corp. v. Commissioner, 91 T. C., at 465.
The value of the deposit base rests upon the "ascertainable probability
that inertia will cause depositors to leave their funds on deposit for predictable periods of time." Id., at 500.

507us2$54M 11-15-96 19:23:19 PAGES OPINPGT
562 NEWARK MORNING LEDGER CO. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The Commissioner argued that the value of the core deposits
was inextricably related to the value of the overall customer
relationship, that is, to goodwill. The Commissioner also
argued that the deposit base consisted of purchased,
terminable-at-will customer relationships that are equivalent
to goodwill as a matter of law. The Tax Court rejected the
Commissioner's position, concluding that the taxpayer had
demonstrated with sufficient evidence that the economic
value attributable to the opportunity to invest the core
deposits could be (and, indeed, was) valued and that the
fact that new accounts were opened as old accounts closed
did not make the original purchased deposit base selfregenerating. 91 T. C., at 499.

The court also concluded that, based on "lifing studies"
estimating the percentage of accounts that would close over
a given period of time, the taxpayer established that the deposit base had a limited useful life, the duration of which
could be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. The taxpayer had established the value of the intangible asset using
the cost-savings method, entitling it to depreciate that portion of the purchase price attributable to the present value
of the difference between the ongoing costs associated with
maintaining the core deposits and the cost of the market alternative for funding its loans and other investments. Id.,
at 510.

The Tax Court reached the same result in Colorado National Bankshares, Inc. v. Commissioner, 60 TCM 771
(1990), || 90,495 P-H Memo TC, aff 'd, 984 F. 2d 383 (CA10
1993). The Tax Court concluded that

"the value of the deposit base does not depend upon a
vague hope that customers will patronize the bank for
some unspecified length of time in the future. The
value of the deposit base rests upon the ascertainable
probability that inertia will cause depositors to leave
their funds on deposit for predictable periods of time."

The court specifically found that the deposit accounts couldbe identified; that they had limited lives that could be estimated with reasonable accuracy; and that they could bevalued with a fair degree of accuracy. They were also not
self-regenerating. "It is these characteristics which sepa-rate them from general goodwill and permits separate valuation." Ibid. See also IT&S of Iowa, Inc. v. Commissioner,97 T. C. 496, 509 (1991);

Northern Natural Gas Co. v. O'Mal-ley, 277 F. 2d 128, 139 (CA8 1960) (concurring opinion).

The Eighth Circuit has considered a factual situationnearly identical to the case now before us. In Donrey, Inc.
v. United States, 809 F. 2d 534 (1987), the taxpayer soughtto depreciate the subscription list of a newspaper it had purchased as a going concern. The taxpayer asserted that thesubscription list was not simply a list of customers but
"a machine to generate advertising revenue." Id., at 536.There was expert testimony that the value of the subscription list was "the present value of the difference in advertis-ing revenues generated by the subscription list as compared
to the revenues of an equivalent paper without a subscriptionlist."

Ibid. A jury found that the list had a limited usefullife, the duration of which could be ascertained with reasonable accuracy; that the useful life was 23 years; and that ithad an ascertainable value of $559,406 separate and distinct
from goodwill. The District Court denied a motion for judg-ment notwithstanding the verdict after concluding that, although reasonable minds could have differed as to the cor-rect result, there was evidence from which the jury could
properly find for the taxpayer. The Court of Appeals im-plicitly rejected the Government's argument that the subscription list was necessarily inseparable from the value ofgoodwill when it deferred to the jury's finding that the subscription list was depreciable because it had a determinableuseful life and an ascertainable value.

Opinion of the Court

V
A

Although acknowledging the "analytic force" of cases suchas those discussed above, the Court of Appeals in the present

case characterized them as "no more than a minority strandamid the phalanx of cases" that have adopted the Government's position on the meaning of goodwill. 945 F. 2d, at565.

12 "In any case, consistent with the prevailing case law,

we believe that the [IRS] is correct in asserting that, fortax purposes, there are some intangible assets which,

notwithstanding that they have wasting lives that can beestimated with reasonable accuracy and ascertainable values, are nonetheless goodwill and nondepreciable." Id., at
568. The Court of Appeals concluded further that in "thecontext of the sale of a going concern, it is simply often too

difficult for the taxpayer and the court to separate the valueof the list

qua list from the goodwill value of the customer
relationships/structure." Ibid. We agree with that generalobservation. It is often too difficult for taxpayers to separate depreciable intangible assets from goodwill. But sometimes they manage to do it. And whether or not they have
been successful in any particular case is a question of fact.

The Government concedes: "The premise of the regulatory prohibition against the depreciation of goodwill is that,
like stock in a corporation, a work of art, or raw land, good12 At least one commentator has taken issue with the Court of Appeals'
characterization of the recent cases as nothing but a "minority strand."
See Avi-Yonah, Newark Morning Ledger: A Threat to the Amortizability
of Acquired Intangibles, 55 Tax Notes 981, 984 (1992) (of the 14 cases cited
by the Third Circuit that were decided after Houston Chronicle in 1973,
the IRS has prevailed in only 6 of them; "hardly an `overwhelming weight
of authority' in the IRS' favor, especially given that two of the IRS victories, but none of the taxpayers,' were only at the district court level").
Regardless of whether the cases discussed in Part IV, supra, are characterized as a "minority strand" or as a "modern trend," we find their reasoning and approach persuasive.

will has no determinate useful life of specific duration."
Brief for United States 13. See also Richard S. Miller &
Sons, Inc. v. United States, 210 Ct. Cl., at 437, 537 F. 2d, at
450 ("Goodwill is a concept that embraces many intangible
elements and is presumed to have a useful life of indefinite
duration"). The entire justification for refusing to permit
the depreciation of goodwill evaporates, however, when the
taxpayer demonstrates that the asset in question wastes
over an ascertainable period of time. It is more faithful to
the purposes of the Code to allow the depreciation deduction
under these circumstances, for "the Code endeavors to match
expenses with the revenues of the taxable period to which
they are properly attributable, thereby resulting in a more
accurate calculation of net income for tax purposes,"
INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U. S. 79, 84 (1992).13

In the case that first established the principle that goodwill was not depreciable, the Eighth Circuit recognized that
the reason for treating goodwill differently was simple and
direct: " `As good will does not suffer wear and tear, does not
become obsolescent, is not used up in the operation of the
business, depreciation, as such, cannot be charged against
it.' " Red Wing Malting Co. v. Willcuts, 15 F. 2d 626, 633
(1926), cert. denied, 273 U. S. 763 (1927). See also 5 J. Mer13 The dissent suggests that we are usurping the proper role of Congress
by seeking to "modify the per se ban on depreciating goodwill," post, at
582, n. 10. But we are doing nothing of the kind. We simply have determined that, in light of the factual record in this case, the "paid subscribers"
asset is depreciable. The dissent's mistake is to assume that because the
"paid subscribers" asset looks and smells like the "expectancy of continued
patronage," it is, ipso facto, nondepreciable. In our view, however,
whether or not an asset is depreciable is not a question to be settled by
definition. "Goodwill" remains nondepreciable under applicable regulations, and we do not purport to change that fact. In interpreting those
regulations, however, we have concluded that because the "paid subscribers" is an asset found to have a limited useful life and an ascertainable
value which may be determined with reasonable accuracy, it is depreciable.
By definition, therefore, it is not "goodwill."

Opinion of the Court
tens, Law of Federal Income Taxation $ 23A.01, p. 7 (1990)
("Goodwill is not amortizable intangible property because its
useful life cannot be ascertained with reasonable accuracy"
(emphasis added)). It must follow that if a taxpayer can
prove with reasonable accuracy that an asset used in the
trade or business or held for the production of income has a
value that wastes over an ascertainable period of time, that
asset is depreciable under $ 167, regardless of the fact that
its value is related to the expectancy of continued patronage.
The significant question for purposes of depreciation is not
whether the asset falls "within the core of the concept of
goodwill," Brief for United States 19, but whether the asset
is capable of being valued and whether that value diminishes
over time. In a different context, the IRS itself succinctly
articulated the relevant principle: "Whether or not an intangible asset, or a tangible asset, is depreciable for Federal
income tax purposes depends upon the determination that
the asset is actually exhausting, and that such exhaustion is
susceptible of measurement." Rev. Rul. 68-483, 1968-2
Cum. Bull. 91-92.

B

Although we now hold that a taxpayer able to prove that
a particular asset can be valued and that it has a limited
useful life may depreciate its value over its useful life regardless of how much the asset appears to reflect the expectancy of continued patronage, we do not mean to imply that
the taxpayer's burden of proof is insignificant. On the contrary, that burden often will prove too great to bear. See,
e. g., Brief for Coopers & Lybrand as Amicus Curiae 11
("For example, customer relationships arising from newsstand sales cannot be specifically identified. In [our] experience, customers were identified but their purchases were too
sporadic and unpredictable to reasonably ascertain either the

Opinion of the Court
duration of the relationships or the value of the relationships
(based on their net income stream)" (emphasis in original)).

Petitioner's burden in this case was made significantly
lighter by virtue of the Government's litigation strategy:

"[B]ecause of the stipulation reached by the parties,
Morning Ledger need not prove either the specific useful lives of the paid subscribers of the Booth newspapers
as of May 31, 1977, or that Dr. Glasser [its statistical
expert] has correctly estimated those lives. In light of
the stipulation, [the Government's] argument with regard to Dr. Glasser's estimation of the specific useful
lives of the Booth subscribers is wholly irrelevant. Instead, Dr. Glasser's testimony establishes that qualified
experts could estimate with reasonable accuracy the remaining useful lives of the paid subscribers of the Booth
newspapers as of May 31, 1977." 734 F. Supp., at 181.

Petitioner also proved to the satisfaction of the District
Court that the "paid subscribers" asset was not selfregenerating, thereby distinguishing it for purposes of
applying the mass-asset rule:

"[T]here is no automatic replacement for a subscriber
who terminates his or her subscription. Although the
total number of subscribers may have or has remained
relatively constant, the individual subscribers will not
and have not remained the same, and those that may or
have discontinued their subscriptions can be or have
been replaced only through the substantial efforts of the
Booth newspapers." Id., at 180.

The 460,000 "paid subscribers" constituted a finite set of subscriptions, existing on a particular date--May 31, 1977. The
asset was not composed of constantly fluctuating components; rather, it consisted of identifiable subscriptions each

Opinion of the Court
of which had a limited useful life that could be estimatedwith reasonable accuracy according to generally accepted

statistical principles. Petitioner proved as a matter of factthat the value of the "paid subscribers" diminished over an
ascertainable period of time.14

C
Petitioner estimated the fair market value of the "paid
subscribers" at approximately $67.8 million. This figurewas found by computing the present value of the after-tax

subscription revenues to be derived from the "paid subscribers," less the cost of collecting those revenues, and addingthe present value of the tax savings resulting from the depreciation of the "paid subscribers." As the District Courtexplained, the taxpayer's experts "utilized this method because they each independently concluded that this method
best determined the additional value of the Booth newspapers attributable to the existence of the paid subscribers as
of May 31, 1977, and, thus, the fair market value of those
subscribers." Id., at 183. The Government presented no
evidence challenging the accuracy of this methodology. It

14 The dissent spends a substantial amount of time worrying about the
sufficiency of petitioner's evidence. See post, at 576-582. The problem
with petitioner's expert, according to the dissent, is that he predicted only
how long a subscriber is likely to subscribe, and this "tells us nothing
about how long date-of-sale subscriber habit or inertia will remain a cause
of predicted subscriber faithfulness." Post, at 581. The dissent concludes that "Ledger's expert on his own terms has not even claimed to
make the showing of definite duration necessary to depreciate an asset
under $ 167(a)." Post, at 582. We have little doubt that had the Government presented credible evidence challenging the relevance of this testimony, the District Court would have had a more difficult time deciding
this case. As it happened, however, petitioner's evidence of the useful
life of the "paid subscribers" was the only evidence the District Court had
before it. The dissent skillfully demonstrates certain vulnerabilities in
petitioner's proof, but the Government chose, rather, to rest its entire case
on a legal argument that we now reject. This case was lost at trial.

Opinion of the Court
took the view that the only value attributable to the "paidsubscribers" was equivalent to the cost of generating a similar list of new subscribers, and it estimated that cost to beapproximately $3 million. The Court of Appeals agreed
with the Government that this "cost approach" was the onlyappropriate method for valuing the list of subscribers. "The
fact is that, when employed in the context of the sale of anongoing concern, the income approach to valuing a list of
customers inherently includes much or all of the value of theexpectancy that those customers will continue their patronage--i. e., the goodwill of the acquired concern." 945 F. 2d,at 568.

Both the Government and the Court of Appeals mischarac-terized the asset at issue as a mere list of names and
addresses. The uncontroverted evidence presented at trialrevealed that the "paid subscribers" had substantial value
over and above that of a mere list of customers. App. 67(Price Waterhouse's Fair Market Value Study of Paid Newspaper Subscribers to Booth Newspapers as of May 31, 1977);
id., at 108-111 (testimony of Roger J. Grabowski, Principaland National Director, Price Waterhouse Valuation Services). These subscribers were "seasoned"; they had sub-scribed to the paper for lengthy periods of time and represented a reliable and measurable source of revenue. Incontrast to new subscribers, who have no subscription history and who might not last beyond the expiration of somepromotional incentive, the "paid subscribers" at issue here
provided a regular and predictable source of income over anestimable period of time. The cost of generating a list of
new subscribers is irrelevant, for it represents the value ofan entirely different asset. We agree with the District
Court when it concluded:

"Although it was possible to estimate the direct costof soliciting additional subscribers to the Booth newspapers, those subscribers if obtained were not and wouldnot have been comparable, in terms of life characteris507us2$54M 11-15-96 19:23:19 PAGES OPINPGT

tics or value, to the paid subscribers of the Booth news-papers as of May 31, 1977. . . . The cost of generating

such marginal subscribers would not reflect the fairmarket value of the existing subscribers of the Booth
newspapers as of May 31, 1977." 734 F. Supp., at 181.
Because it continued to insist that petitioner had used the
wrong valuation methodology, the Government failed to offerany evidence to challenge the accuracy of petitioner's application of the "income approach." The District Court foundthat the aggregate fair market value of the "paid subscribers" of the Booth newspapers as of May 31, 1977--i. e., "the
price at which the asset would change hands between a hypo-thetical willing buyer and willing seller, neither being under

any compulsion to buy or sell, both parties having rea-sonable knowledge of relevant facts,"

id., at 185--was
$67,773,000, with a corresponding adjusted income tax basisof $71,201,395. Petitioner was entitled to depreciate this adjusted basis using a straight-line method over the stipulateduseful lives.

VI
Petitioner has borne successfully its substantial burden of
proving that "paid subscribers" constitutes an intangibleasset with an ascertainable value and a limited useful life,

the duration of which can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. It has proved that the asset is not self-regeneratingbut rather wastes as the finite number of component subscriptions are canceled over a reasonably predictable periodof time. The relationship this asset may have to the expectancy of continued patronage is irrelevant, for it satisfies all
the necessary conditions to qualify for the depreciation allowance under $ 167 of the Code.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Newark Morning Ledger seeks a depreciation 1 deductionunder 26 U. S. C. $ 167(a) for an intangible asset it variously

refers to as "paid subscribers," see Brief for Petitioner 4-5,or "subscriber relationships," see Tr. of Oral Arg. 3. The
Court of Appeals rejected Ledger's claim on the authorityof a Treasury regulation providing (a) that an intangible
asset may be depreciated only if it has a limited useful life"the length of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy," and (b) that "[n]o deduction for depreciation is allow-able with respect to goodwill." 26 CFR $ 1.167(a)-3 (1992);
see 945 F. 2d 555, 558, 567-569 (CA3 1991). Ledger claimsthe regulation raises no bar to a deduction, arguing that (1)
the asset is not goodwill, because (2) it has a limited usefullife actually estimated with reasonable accuracy. Ledger is
wrong on both counts. Ledger's asset is unmistakably a di-rect measurement of goodwill, and Ledger's expert testimony failed to show any particular lifespan for the goodwillLedger acquired.

I
When The Herald Company (now merged with NewarkMorning Ledger) bought and liquidated the stock of Booth

as will appear, this label is misdescriptive, it need not con-fuse anyone about the true nature of the asset, since Ledger
has explained clearly how it determined the asset's value.Ledger got to the $67.8 million figure by predicting the fu1 Black's Law Dictionary tells us that intangible assets are amortized,

however, use only the term depreciation.

ture net revenues to be generated by the 460,000 people whosubscribed to the eight Booth newspapers as of the date of

sale, May 31, 1977. Because these customers had neitherpaid in advance nor agreed to subscribe for any set term, see
Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 5; ante, at 550, n. 4, they were
merely at-will subscribers; the value of their expected fu-ture custom was capitalized as the asset Ledger seeks to

depreciate.However much Ledger claims this asset to be something
different from "goodwill," the settled meaning of the term isflatly at odds with Ledger's contention. Since the days of
Justice Story, we have understood the concept of "goodwill"
to be anchored in the patronage a business receives from
"constant or habitual" customers. See, e. g., Metropolitan
Bank v. St. Louis Dispatch Co., 149 U. S. 436, 446 (1893); Des
Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U. S. 153 (1915); see also
Cruttwell v. Lye, 17 Ves. Jr. 335, 346, 34 Eng. Rep. 129, 134
(Ch. 1810) (opinion of Lord Eldon) (goodwill is "nothing more
than the probability, that the old customers will resort to the
old place"). Although this Court has not had occasion to
provide a precise definition of the term as it appears in the
depreciation regulation, the Courts of Appeals have consistently held that "goodwill," in this context, refers to "the expectancy of continued patronage" from existing customers
or, alternatively, to the prospect that "the old customers will
resort to the old place." See, e. g., Winn-Dixie Montgomery, Inc. v. United States, 444 F. 2d 677, 681 (CA5 1971);
Commissioner v. Seaboard Finance Co., 367 F. 2d 646, 649
(CA9 1966); Boe v. Commissioner, 307 F. 2d 339, 343 (CA9
1962); Dodge Brothers, Inc. v. United States, 118 F. 2d 95,

306 (CA7 1963) (goodwill denotes an expectancy that a customer relationship will continue "without contractual compulsion"). Thus, the Government justifiably concludes that

"goodwill," as used in its own regulation, refers to the expectation of continued patronage by existing customers. See
Brief for United States 16-19.

Under this accepted definition of "goodwill," there can be
no doubt that the asset Ledger calls "paid subscribers" or
"subscriber relationships" is simply the goodwill associated
with those subscribers. Once this is clear, it becomes
equally clear that Ledger should lose, since the intangible
asset regulation expressly and categorically bars depreciation of goodwill, and courts have uniformly relied on that
regulation's plain language to conclude that goodwill is
nondepreciable as a matter of law. See Houston Chronicle
Publishing Co. v. United States, 481 F. 2d 1240, 1247 (CA5
1973) (the proposition that goodwill is nondepreciable as
a matter of law "is so well settled that the only question
litigated in recent years regarding this area of the law is
whether a particular asset is `goodwill' "), cert. denied, 414
U. S. 1129 (1974); see also Donrey, Inc. v. United States, 809
F. 2d 534, 536 (CA8 1987) (goodwill "is ineligible per se for
the depreciation deduction"); Richard S. Miller & Sons, Inc.
v. United States, 210 Ct. Cl. 431, 437, 537 F. 2d 446, 450 (1976)
("the presumption that [goodwill] is a nondepreciable capital
asset is conclusive"); Boe v. Commissioner, supra, at 343
("good will is not a depreciable asset").

II
Ledger tries to slip out of this predicament by two separate steps. It argues first that the Court ought to adopt a
new definition of "goodwill" that would not cover any expectation of future custom with a lifespan subject to definite
advance estimate; then it claims that the asset here falls outside the new definition because Ledger's expert has predicted the length of the asset's wasting life with reasonable
accuracy. See Brief for Petitioner 12-13. The Court makes
a serious mistake in taking the first step; Ledger should lose

Souter, J., dissenting
in any event, however, since its expert has failed to furnishthe basis for taking the second.

A
Ledger would have us scrap the accepted and substantivedefinition of "goodwill" as an expectation of continued patronage, in favor of a concept of goodwill as a residual assetof ineffable quality, whose existence and value would be represented by any portion of a business's purchase price notattributable to identifiable assets with determinate lives.
Goodwill would shrink to an accounting leftover. See id., at19, 29-30 (relying on accounting standards).

In accommodating Ledger on this point, see ante, at 565,n. 13, the Court abandons the settled construction of a regulation more than 65 years old,2 see T. D. 4055, VI-2 Cum.

2 The current intangible asset regulation can be traced back to Treasury
Regulation 45, issued in 1919, which provided that there could be no deduction "in respect of good will" under the general depreciation provision
of the Revenue Act of 1918 because goodwill was an example of an asset
that did not have a useful life "definitely limited in duration." T. D. 2831,
21 Treas. Dec. 214, Art. 163. The Commissioner dropped the reference
to goodwill for a few years, in response to attempts by distillers and brewers to depreciate goodwill made obsolete by the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment. See T. D. 2929, 1 Cum. Bull. 133 (1919); see also T. D.
3146, 23 Treas. Dec. 402, Art. 163 (1920) (reflecting this change). The first
Court of Appeals to address the subject, however, held that goodwill could
not be depreciated under the Revenue Act of 1918 because it was not
susceptible to exhaustion or wear and tear, as required by the statute.
Red Wing Malting Co. v. Willcuts, 15 F. 2d 626 (CA8 1926), cert. denied,
273 U. S. 763 (1927). Shortly after that decision, the Commissioner
amended the intangible asset regulation by adding the following prohibition: "No deduction for depreciation, including obsolescence, is allowable
in respect of good will." T. D. 4055, VI-2 Cum. Bull. 63 (1927). It has
remained there ever since. See, e. g., Treas. Regs. 77, Art. 203 (Revenue
Act of 1932); Treas. Regs. 86, Art. 23(l)-3 (Revenue Act of 1934); Treas.
Regs. 94, Art. 23(l)-3 (Revenue Act of 1936); Treas. Regs. 103, $ 19.23(l)-3
(Internal Revenue Code of 1939); 26 CFR $ 1.167(a)-3 (1961) (Internal
Revenue Code of 1954).

Although Red Wing Malting provoked a Circuit split, this Court resolved the conflict a few years later by deciding, in line with the Commis507us2$54M 11-15-96 19:23:19 PAGES OPINPGT

Bull. 63 (1927), and repudiates the equally settled interpreta-tion of the corresponding section of the tax code itself. We

are, after all, dealing with a statute reenacted without sub-stantial change not less than six times since 1919, see Revenue Act of 1918, $ 234(a)(7), 40 Stat. 1078 (1919); Revenue Actof 1932, $ 23(k), 47 Stat. 181; Revenue Act of 1934, $ 23(

The consequences, therefore, of acceding to Ledger's argu-ment are at once a rejection of statutory interpretation settled by Congress itself through reenactment of the tax codeand a further invasion of the political domain to rewrite a
Treasury regulation.4 See Correll, supra, at 307 (this Court
sioner's amended regulation, that a brewery could not deduct for the "exhaustion" or "obsolescence" of goodwill as a result of Prohibition. See
Clarke v. Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing Co., 280 U. S. 384 (1930); Renziehausen v. Lucas, 280 U. S. 387 (1930); see also V. Loewers Gambrinus
Brewery Co. v. Anderson, 282 U. S. 638 (1931) (distinguishing Haberle
Springs and allowing a brewery to claim a depreciation deduction for
buildings made obsolete by Prohibition).

3 Legislative materials indicate that Congress is, in fact, aware of the

accepted definition of "goodwill." See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-495,
p. 937 (1987) ("Goodwill has been defined as the expectancy of continued
patronage, for whatever reason, or as the probability that old customers
will resort to the old place").

4 The majority discounts these consequences by claiming that the utility

of the accepted definition of "goodwill" is limited because "[t]he value of
every intangible asset is related, to a greater or lesser degree, to the
expectation that customers will continue their patronage." Ante, at 556.
But the regulation does not provide that every intangible asset related to
goodwill is nondepreciable; rather, it simply states that goodwill itself is

will defer to a tax regulation so long as it "implement[s] the
congressional mandate in some reasonable manner"); National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States, 440
U. S. 472, 477 (1979) (listing historical considerations that
may give a regulation "particular force"); see also Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837, 843-845 (1984) (reasonable agency interpretations
of statutory provisions will be upheld).

I cannot deny, however, that the regulation would suffer
real internal tension between its specific, categorical treatment of goodwill and its general analytical test (turning on
the existence of a limited life of ascertainable duration), if
modern accounting techniques were to develop a subtlety
sufficient to make an accurate estimate of goodwill's useful
life. Fortunately or not, however, the record in this case
raises no such tension.

B

Even under Ledger's revision of the regulation, a depreciation deduction would depend on showing the Booth newspapers' goodwill to have a useful life both limited and measurable with some reasonable degree of certainty. The further
step needed for victory is thus evidentiary in nature, and

nondepreciable. Subject to this prohibition, the law concerning the depreciation of intangible assets related to goodwill has developed on a caseby-case basis, and the Government has accepted some of the distinctions
that courts have drawn, including the principle that customer lists sold
separately from a going business may be depreciable. See Brief for
United States 36, n. 34; Rev. Rul. 74-456, 1974-2 Cum. Bull. 65, 66 (modifying earlier rulings "to remove any implication that customer and subscription lists, location contracts, insurance expirations, etc., are, as a matter
of law, indistinguishable from goodwill"). Such matters are not at issue
in this case, however, because the asset that Ledger seeks to depreciate
is indistinguishable from goodwill. See 945 F. 2d 555, 568 (CA3 1991)
(Newark Morning Ledger did not attempt, in this case, to claim a separate
depreciation allowance for the subscriber lists it acquired).

Ledger's success or failure is solely a function of the evidentiary record. Ledger has failed.

Here, it is helpful to recall one defining characteristic of
the only kind of asset Ledger claims to be entitled to depreciate: it must be an asset acquired from Booth Newspapers,
Inc., upon the sale of its stock to Ledger's predecessor, Herald. If the goodwill is to be depreciated at all, in other
words, it must be goodwill purchased, not goodwill attributable to anything occurring after the purchase date. It must
be an expectation of continued patronage as it existed when
the old Booth newspapers changed hands.

Assuming that there is a variety of goodwill that may be
separately identified as an asset on the date of sale, some
limitation on its useful life may be presumed. Whatever
may be the force of habit, or inertia, that is valued as goodwill attributable to events occurring before the date of sale,
the influence of those events wanes over time, and so must
the habit or inertia by which that influence is made manifest
and valued as goodwill. On the outside, the economically
inert subscribers will prove to be physically mortal.5

5 While some courts have viewed goodwill as having an indefinite useful
life, others have concluded that although goodwill does waste, its useful
life cannot be determined with reasonable accuracy. Compare, e. g., Red
Wing Malting, 15 F. 2d, at 633 (goodwill is not depreciable because it "does
not suffer wear and tear, does not become obsolescent, [and] is not used
up in the operation of the business"); Patterson v. Commissioner, 810 F. 2d
562, 569 (CA6 1987) (goodwill "does not waste"); Houston Chronicle Publishing Co. v. United States, 481 F. 2d 1240, 1248 (CA5 1973) (goodwill
is "an ongoing asset that fluctuates but does not necessarily diminish");
Landsberger v. McLaughlin, 26 F. 2d 77, 78 (CA9 1928) (goodwill is not
subject to exhaustion, wear or tear), with, e. g., Dodge Brothers, Inc. v.
United States, 118 F. 2d 95, 100 (CA4 1941) (goodwill is not depreciable
because of "manifest difficulties" inherent in estimating its life span);
Illinois Cereal Mills, Inc. v. Commissioner, 46 TCM 1001, 1023 (1983),
|| 83,469 P-H Memo TC (goodwill is not subject to depreciation "because
[its] useful life is not susceptible of reasonable estimation").

What the Government does not concede,6 however, and
what Ledger has not proven, is the duration of that date-ofsale influence and consequent goodwill. Ledger, indeed, has
not even purported to show that. Instead, its expert has
estimated the quite different periods over which subscribers
on the date of sale will continue to subscribe to the various
papers.7 In the District Court, Ledger offered a single witness for its claim to have estimated the useful life of each
newspaper's "subscriber relationships" with reasonable accuracy. Herald had originally hired that witness, Dr. Gerald
Glasser, to predict the average remaining lives of existing
subscriptions to the eight Booth newspapers. See App. in

6 In an effort to insulate the case from review, Ledger asserts a concession by the Government below that the asset Ledger wants to depreciate
did have a limited useful life that was estimated with reasonable accuracy.
Brief for Petitioner 17, and n. 18. The majority does not go quite so far
when it observes that "[p]etitioner's burden in this case was made significantly lighter by virtue of the Government's litigation strategy." Ante,
at 567. In any event, the District Court's description of the Government's
strategy makes it clear that the Government has not conceded this case
away:

"The parties have agreed that, if the Court determines that the paid
subscribers constitute assets which were separate and apart from goodwill
and which can be valued separate and apart from goodwill, and if the
Court determines that the paid subscribers had useful lives which can be
estimated with reasonable accuracy, then the paid subscribers of the Booth
newspapers can be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the . . . useful
lives [shown in the accompanying chart]." 734 F. Supp. 176, 180 (NJ 1990).

Thus, the factual concession by the Government came into play only after
the District Court rejected two crucial legal arguments: (1) the "paid subscribers" asset is not an asset separate and distinct from goodwill, and (2)
the asset did not have a useful life that could be estimated with reasonable
accuracy. I find, for the reasons set out in the text, that the District
Court erred in rejecting each argument. I also note that a similar litigating strategy did not prevent the Government from prevailing in Haberle
Springs. See 280 U. S., at 386 ("The amount of the deduction to be made
is agreed upon if any deduction is to be allowed").

7 The estimates vary from paper to paper, but I refer to them in the

singular, consistently with Ledger's claim to a singular "asset."

No. 90-5637 (CA3), p. 1010. Dr. Glasser testified that hefirst compiled statistics on the length of time existing subscribers had received each newspaper, by directing a surveythat asked a selection of those subscribers one central question: "For how long has the [newspaper] been delivered to
your present address?" Id., at 157, 166, 182-183, 1012. Hethen made a crucial assumption, that the total number of

subscriptions to each newspaper would remain stable overtime.

Id., at 170-172, 187, 194-195. Finally, by subjecting
the survey results to techniques of statistical analysis basedon this crucial assumption, Dr. Glasser produced a series of

figures that, he said, represented the average remaining life
of existing subscriptions to each newspaper. Solely on the
basis of Dr. Glasser's testimony, the District Court held that
"the remaining useful lives of the paid subscribers of the
Booth newspapers as of May 31, 1977, could be estimated
with reasonable accuracy." 734 F. Supp. 176, 181 (NJ 1990).

Dr. Glasser's assumption is the key not only to the results
he derived, but to the irrelevance of those results to the predictable life on the date of sale of the goodwill (or "paid subscribers") actually purchased from Booth. The key, in turn,
to that irrelevance lies not in Dr. Glasser's explicit statement
of his assumption, but in what the assumption itself presupposes. Since the District Court was not concerned with
predicting the value that any given Booth newspaper might
have in the future (as distinct from predicting the useful life
of pre-existing subscriber goodwill), an assumption that the
level of a paper's subscriptions would remain constant was
useful only insofar as it had a bearing on predicting the behavior of the old subscribers. For this purpose, assuming a
constant subscription level was a way of supposing that a
given newspaper would remain as attractive to subscribers
in the future as it had been during the period prior to the
newspaper's sale. The assumption was thus a surrogate for
the supposition that the new owners would not rock the boat
and would succeed in acting intelligently to keep the paper,

580 NEWARK MORNING LEDGER CO. v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., dissenting
if not exactly as it had always been, at least as relatively
attractive as it had been in relation to its various competitors
on the date of sale.

What is significant about this assumption for present purposes is not its doubtful validity,8 but the very fact of its
being an assumption about the behavior of the paper's man8 No matter how much presale satisfaction subscribers have, it seems
intuitively obvious that a high enough level of postsale dissatisfaction with
a paper would drive subscribers away, as might other postsale events,
such as successful competition and demographic changes. The District
Court, relying on Ledger's own witnesses, noted several of the many possible reasons that lead subscribers to cancel their subscriptions:

"Subscribers are lost because of death, relocation, lack of reader time or
interest, changing lifestyles, and other factors that are beyond the control
of the newspapers. Also, subscribers are lost due to dissatisfaction with
the product or service and for various other reasons, including competition
from other media sources, such as radio, television, magazines and other
paid-circulation and/or free-distribution newspapers." 734 F. Supp., at
180.

Ledger's statistician, in effect, made an assumption regarding Ledger's
ability to manage the innumerable factors that keep current customers
coming back for more, as well as its ability to attract new customers as the
old ones leave. Such discretionary decisions may turn out to be foolish or
wise: if foolish, the subscriber base as of the date of sale could be destroyed rapidly; if wise, it would be maintained. The simple recognition
that some papers increase their subscriber base over time, while others
lose it (and some actually fold), underscores the arbitrariness of the assumption made by Ledger's expert witness. In any event, Ledger has
provided no evidence to support this assumption.

I do not, of course, suggest that a buyer's treatment of a depreciable
asset does not affect the asset's actual useful life. A machine's less durable parts must be replaced; it must be oiled, kept from the weather, given
fuel, and so on. But there is an identifiable object that endures through
time and does not just disappear from inadequate maintenance. Goodwill,
on the other hand, can be destroyed rapidly by everything from the nasty
personality of a new proprietor to distaste for his publishing policies. Prediction of goodwill's endurance must always be fraught with a relatively
high degree of chance, for discretionary decisions, rather than just ministerial acts (like oiling the gears), must be taken into account.

agement after the date of sale. And since this assumptionis the basis for a prediction about the life of subscriptions

existing on the date of sale, that prediction is by definitionnot simply about the duration of subscriber goodwill (or habit
or inertia) as it existed on the date the paper changed hands.On the contrary, it is a prediction about the combined effect
of presale goodwill and postsale satisfaction with the paperas Ledger presumably continues to produce it. Nowhere in
Dr. Glasser's testimony do we find an opinion that the pre-sale goodwill has a life coextensive with the predicted life of
the subscriptions, and nowhere do we find an opinion aboutthe point at which the old goodwill finally peters out as a
measurable, and hence valuable, influence on the old sub-scribers' behavior. It is not, of course, important for present purposes whether such an opinion would be possible,though I am skeptical that it would be.

9 But it is important

that no such evidence exists in this case. In place of evi-dence showing the depreciable lifespan of date-of-sale goodwill with a reasonable degree of accuracy, Ledger has pre-sented evidence of how long an old subscriber will remain
one, on the assumption that the subscriber's prior satisfac-tion is confirmed, and (for all we know) replaced, with satisfaction resulting from Ledger's publishing performance overthe years following its acquisition of a given newspaper.

This, of course, misses the point entirely. In telling us
merely how long a subscriber is likely to subscribe, Ledgertells us nothing about how long date-of-sale subscriber habit

or inertia will remain a cause of predicted subscriber faith-fulness. Since, however, only the date-of-sale probability
of faithfulness could be entitled to depreciation as a pur9 Goodwill results from such a mix of influences over time that it seems
unlikely that the skein of them all could be untangled to identify the degree to which even present custom results from the goodwill purchased,
as distinct from goodwill subsequently cultivated. Ledger has not even
attempted such a disentanglement.

chased asset, Ledger's expert on his own terms has not even
claimed to make the showing of definite duration necessary
to depreciate an asset under $ 167(a). Indeed, once duration
of subscriptions and purchased goodwill are seen to be conceptually different, Ledger's claim to have satisfied the
requirements for depreciating an intangible asset simply
vanishes. Ledger's entire case thus rests on the confusion
of subscription duration with goodwill on the date of sale,
and only that confusion could suggest that Ledger has shouldered its burden of estimating the lifespan of the asset
purchased from Booth. It is not surprising, then, that the
Commissioner has stood by her categorical judgment that
goodwill is not depreciable, that Congress has not disturbed
this judgment,10 and that lower courts have consistently
agreed that goodwill is nondepreciable as a matter of law.

III
Because the Court of Appeals correctly reversed on the
basis that Newark Morning Ledger failed to demonstrate
that the asset it sought to depreciate was not goodwill, which

of the Code," in allowing taxpayers to make a better match of expenses
with revenues. Ante, at 565 (citing INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503

which can modify the per se ban on depreciating goodwill at any time.
Despite several recent opportunities to do so, Congress has so far refused
to alter the tax treatment of goodwill and other intangibles. See, e. g.,

by the upstream States, Colorado and Wyoming; establishing priorities among federal reservoirs and certain Nebraska canals; and apportioning 75% of the natural flow of the river's so-called "pivotal reach"
during the irrigation season to Nebraska and 25% to Wyoming. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589. Initiating this original action in
1986, Nebraska petitioned the Court for an enforcement order and injunctive relief under the decree's "reopener" provision, alleging that
Wyoming was violating or threatening to violate the decree by virtue
of developments on two North Platte tributaries, Deer Creek and the
Laramie River, and objecting to certain of Wyoming's actions with respect to the Inland Lakes in Nebraska. Wyoming answered and counterclaimed, arguing, essentially, that Nebraska was circumventing the
decree by demanding and diverting water from above the Tri-State
Dam for uses below Tri-State that are not recognized in the decree.
All four parties have moved for summary judgment on one or more
issues, and the Special Master has filed his First and Second Interim
Reports recommending disposition of those motions and the intervention motions of certain amici. Exceptions have been filed by, inter
alios, the three States.

Held:

1. No exceptions having been filed to the Master's recommendation
that the Court deny the intervention motions, that recommendation is
adopted. Pp. 589-590.

2. The Master's recommended dispositions of the summary judgment motions are adopted, and the parties' exceptions are overruled.
Pp. 590-603.

(a) Although not strictly applicable, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) and this Court's precedents construing it serve as useful
guides to the summary judgment principles governing the case. Such
judgment is appropriate under the Rule's terms when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law. In determining whether a material factual dispute
exists, the evidence is viewed through the prism of the controlling legal

Syllabus
standard, which will be markedly different depending on the type of
proceedings. To the extent that the proceedings involve an application
for enforcement of rights already recognized in a decree, as is the case
here with respect to the Inland Lakes question, the plaintiff need not
show injury. See, e. g., Wyoming v. Colorado, 309 U. S. 572, 581. However, if the plaintiff seeks modification of the decree to cover questions
not decided in the original proceedings, as is the case with regard to
Nebraska's tributary development claims, a showing of substantial injury must be made to warrant relief. Cf., e. g., Idaho ex rel. Evans v.
Oregon, 462 U. S. 1017, 1027. Pp. 590-593.

(b) Summary judgment is granted to Nebraska and the United
States on their requests for determinations that the decree entitles the
Federal Bureau of Reclamation to continue its longstanding diversion
and storage practices with respect to the Inland Lakes, and that the
lakes have the same December 6, 1904, priority date as other original
components of the Bureau's North Platte Project. The Court implicitly
settled the lakes' priority in the prior litigation. See, e. g., 325 U. S., at
646, 649, and n. 2. And even if the issue was not previously determined,
Wyoming's arguments are foreclosed by its postdecree acquiescence in
the Bureau's administration of the lakes. Cf. Ohio v. Kentucky, 410
U. S. 641, 648. Thus, Wyoming's motion for partial summary judgment
that the Inland Lakes do not have storage rights under either state law
or the decree is denied. Pp. 593-595.

(c) Wyoming's and Nebraska's motions for summary judgment with
respect to their rights to Laramie River waters are denied. The Court
rejects Wyoming's contention that those waters were completely apportioned between itself and Colorado by this Court's 1922 Laramie River
decree. Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 496. Although Paragraph XII(d) of the 1945 decree expressly left undisturbed "[t]he apportionment heretofore made," the 1922 decree did not apportion all
the Laramie's waters; it dealt only with flows down to and including a
facility upstream of the new Laramie developments that Nebraska's
petition challenges. Also rejected is Nebraska's claim that the 1945
decree's apportionment of pivotal reach waters includes Laramie flows
that historically reached the North Platte. That decree did not restrict
Wyoming's use of the Laramie or require it regularly to deliver a specified amount of Laramie water to the North Platte confluence, and, since
1945, neither Nebraska nor the United States has requested that Wyoming account for diversions above the confluence. Because the 1945
decree therefore did not decide the fate of the excess Laramie waters,
affording Nebraska injunctive relief would constitute a modification of
the decree. Unless Nebraska comes forward with evidence sufficient
to establish that some project on the Laramie poses a threat of injury

586 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Syllabus
serious enough to warrant such a modification, summary judgment
should be granted to Wyoming. Pp. 596-598.

(d) Wyoming's motion for summary judgment on Nebraska's challenge to a proposed new storage reservoir on Deer Creek is denied. It
is unclear whether decree Paragraph X exempts from further review
Wyoming's diversion of North Platte water for ordinary and usual municipal use. The Court need not adopt a definitive interpretation of
Paragraph X, because the Deer Creek Project may not qualify as such
a use. Furthermore, proof that the project will cause Nebraska substantial injury--which is necessary because the decree does not currently restrict Wyoming's use of Deer Creek, and a new injunction
would constitute a modification of the decree--may depend on the way
Wyoming administers the project, particularly with regard to its priority with the Inland Lakes. Pp. 599-601.

(e) Although most of Wyoming's, Nebraska's, and Colorado's requested rulings with respect to the below Tri-State issues are too theoretical and insufficiently developed to be susceptible of summary resolution at this time, partial summary judgment is granted to Nebraska on
its request for a determination that the decree does not impose absolute
ceilings on diversions by canals taking in the pivotal reach. Decree
Paragraph V, which sets forth the apportionment of the pivotal reach,
makes no mention of diversion ceilings and expressly states that Nebraska is free to allocate its share among its canals as it sees fit. Similarly, although Paragraph IV limits the extent to which Nebraska canals
diverting in the pivotal reach may stop federal reservoirs in Wyoming
from storing water, it does not place any restrictions on the quantities
of water those canals may actually divert. Pp. 602-603.

Motions for leave to intervene denied, motions for summary judgment

granted in part and denied in part, and exceptions to Special Master's
Interim Reports overruled.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this original action we revisit the dispute among Ne-braska, Wyoming, Colorado, and the United States over

water rights to the North Platte River. In 1945, this Courtentered a decree establishing interstate priorities on the
North Platte and apportioning the natural flow of one criticalportion of the river during the irrigation season. Nebraska
returned to the Court in 1986 seeking an order for enforce-ment of the decree and injunctive relief. A Special Master,
appointed by the Court, has supervised pretrial proceedingsand discovery since 1987. Before us now are the Special
Master's recommended dispositions of several summaryjudgment motions, together with exceptions filed to the
Special Master's reports. I

The North Platte River rises in northern Colorado andflows through Wyoming into Nebraska, where it joins the
South Platte River. The topology of the river and the his-tory of its early development are described at length in the
Court's 1945 opinion. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S.

588 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
589, 592-599. In 1934, Nebraska, invoking this Court's original jurisdiction under Article III, $ 2, of the Constitution,
brought an action against Wyoming seeking an equitable apportionment of the North Platte. Colorado was impleaded
as a defendant, and the United States intervened. After 11
years of litigation, the Court imposed restrictions on storage
and diversion by the upstream States, 325 U. S., at 621-625,
established priorities among federal storage reservoirs and
certain canals, id., at 625-637, and apportioned the so-called
"pivotal" reach of the North Platte between Whalen, Wyoming, and the Tri-State Dam. The natural irrigation-season
flows in that section of the river were apportioned 75% to
Nebraska and 25% to Wyoming. Id., at 637-654.

The Court directed the parties to formulate a decree to
implement its decision. See id., at 657. The resulting decree included a "reopener" provision, Paragraph XIII, that
states, in relevant part:

"Any of the parties may apply at the foot of this decree for its amendment or for further relief. The Court
retains jurisdiction of this suit for the purpose of any
order, direction, or modification of the decree, or any
supplementary decree, that may at any time be deemed
proper in relation to the subject matter in controversy.
Matters with reference to which further relief may hereafter be sought shall include, but shall not be limited to,
the following:. . . . .

"(c) The question of the effect of the construction or
threatened construction of storage capacity not now existing on tributaries entering the North Platte River
between Pathfinder Reservoir and Guernsey Reservoir;. . . . .

"(f) Any change in conditions making modification of
the decree or the granting of further relief necessary or
appropriate." Id., at 671-672.

Opinion of the Court
Paragraph XIII reflects the Court's observation that the de-cree is designed to "deal with conditions as they obtain

today" and that it "can be adjusted to meet . . . new condi-tions."

Id., at 620. The Court noted in more than one place
in its opinion the need to retain jurisdiction to modify the
decree in light of substantial changes in supply, threatenedfuture development, or circumvention of the decree. See,

e. g., id., at 622, 625, 628-629. Since it was entered, the de-cree already has been modified once, pursuant to the parties'
stipulation, to account for construction of a new reservoir.See

Nebraska v. Wyoming, 345 U. S. 981 (1953).
In 1986, Nebraska petitioned the Court for relief under
Paragraph XIII. Nebraska alleged that Wyoming was violating or threatening to violate the decree by virtue of developments on two North Platte tributaries, Deer Creek and
the Laramie River. Nebraska also objected to certain actions taken by Wyoming with respect to the Inland Lakes in
Nebraska. We granted Nebraska leave to file the petition.
Wyoming answered and counterclaimed, arguing, essentially,
that Nebraska was circumventing the decree by demanding
and diverting water from above the Tri-State Dam for uses
below Tri-State that are not recognized in the decree.

After we referred the matter to Special Master Owen
Olpin, Wyoming moved for summary judgment. In his First
Interim Report, the Master explained his decision to deny
the motion but leave open the possibility of summary adjudication following further factual findings. See First Interim Report (June 14, 1989). An intensive period of discovery followed. All four parties then moved for summary
judgment on one or more issues. A year later, the Special
Master filed a Second Interim Report. See Second Interim Report on Motions for Summary Judgment and Renewed Motions for Intervention (Apr. 9, 1992) (hereinafter
Second Interim Report). The Master recommended that
the Court deny the intervention motions of certain amici.
No exceptions have been filed to this recommendation, and

590 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
we adopt it. The Master also recommended that the Courtgrant summary judgment to Nebraska and the United States

on the Inland Lakes issue, grant partial summary judgmentto Nebraska on a discrete question related to the below TriState issues, and deny summary judgment on the remainingissues. Exceptions have been filed by Nebraska, Wyoming,
Colorado, and amicus Basin Electric Power Cooperative(Basin). The United States has filed a brief opposing the
exceptions. We agree with the Master's recommended dis-positions of the summary judgment motions and accordingly
overrule the exceptions. II

At the outset we consider the legal principles governingthe case. The parties do not challenge the summary judgment standards applied by the Special Master. The Mastercorrectly observed that, although not strictly applicable,
Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and ourprecedents construing that Rule serve as useful guides.
See this Court's Rule 17.2. Summary judgment is appro-priate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c). When the nonmoving party
bears the burden of proof at trial, summary judgment is war-ranted if the nonmovant fails to "make a showing sufficient to
establish the existence of an element essential to [its] case."
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 322 (1986). In deter-mining whether a material factual dispute exists, the Court

views the evidence through the prism of the controlling legalstandard. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242,
248 (1986).The disagreement in this case centers on the applicable
legal standards. The question is whether these proceedingsinvolve an application for

enforcement of rights already rec-ognized in the decree, or whether Nebraska seeks a modification of the decree. According to Wyoming, although theCourt has jurisdiction to modify the decree under Paragraph

507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT

591Cite as: 507 U. S. 584 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
XIII, Nebraska obtained leave to file its petition on the as-surance that the case would involve only enforcement of existing rights. In Wyoming's view, Nebraska subsequently,and improperly, transformed the case into a request for recognition of new rights--in essence, into a request for another
equitable apportionment. If Nebraska is allowed to arguefor modification of the decree, Wyoming and

amicus Basin
maintain, the same high evidentiary threshold applicable toclaims for new apportionments applies. Under that standard, Nebraska can prevail only upon proof "by clear and con-vincing evidence" of "some real and substantial injury or
damage." Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U. S. 1017,
1027 (1983). Accord, Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S. 383, 393
(1943); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U. S. 660, 669
(1931).

We do not read the pleadings as narrowly as does Wyoming. Nebraska's petition and supporting briefs do contain
ambiguous language. See, e. g., Petition for an Order Enforcing Decree and for Injunctive Relief 2 (Oct. 6, 1986)
(hereinafter Petition) (alleging that Wyoming's actions violate the apportionment already "established in the Decree");
Reply to Wyoming's Brief in Opposition to Motion for Leave
to File Petition 2 (Jan. 14, 1987) ("We do not propose to litigate anything new, but simply to protect what the Court has
already decided"). But Nebraska also expressly invoked
Paragraph XIII, and particularly subparagraphs (c) and (f).
See Petition 3. As we have said, the Court in those sections retained jurisdiction to modify the decree to answer
unresolved questions and to accommodate "change[s] in conditions"--a phrase sufficiently broad to encompass not only
changes in water supply, see, e. g., Nebraska v. Wyoming,
325 U. S., at 620, but also new development that threatens
a party's interests. Furthermore, nothing would prevent
Nebraska from submitting a new petition if we deemed the
original one deficient. We therefore decline the invitation,
at this late date, to restrict the scope of the litigation

507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT
592 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
solely to enforcement of rights determined in the prior
proceedings.

At the same time, we find merit in Wyoming's contention
that, to the extent Nebraska seeks modification of the decree
rather than enforcement, a higher standard of proof applies.
The two types of proceeding are markedly different. In an
enforcement action, the plaintiff need not show injury. See,
e. g., Wyoming v. Colorado, 309 U. S. 572, 581 (1940). When
the alleged conduct is admitted, the only question is whether
that conduct violates a right established by the decree. To
be sure, the right need not be stated explicitly in the decree.
As the Master recognized, when the decree is silent or unclear, it is appropriate to consider the underlying opinion,
the Master's Report, and the record in the prior proceedings
to determine whether the Court previously resolved the
issue. See, e. g., Wyoming v. Colorado, 286 U. S. 494, 506-
508 (1932). The parties' course of conduct under the decree
also may be relevant. But the underlying issue primarily
remains one of interpretation. In a modification proceeding,
by contrast, there is by definition no pre-existing right to
interpret or enforce. At least where the case concerns the
impact of new development, the inquiry may well entail the
same sort of balancing of equities that occurs in an initial
proceeding to establish an equitable apportionment. See
Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at 618 (listing equitable
considerations).

As discussed below, we believe that the Inland Lakes question is fairly characterized as an enforcement issue. The
claims regarding tributary development, however, raise
questions not decided in the original proceedings and therefore may be best understood as requests for modification of
the decree. The question remains what evidentiary standard applies to such claims. The Master evidently thought
the high standard advocated by Wyoming inapplicable because this is not a case in which the Court is asked to inter507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT

593Cite as: 507 U. S. 584 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
fere with state sovereign interests "in the first instance."Second Interim Report 13.

We disagree with the Master to this extent. ParagraphXIII perhaps eases a plaintiff 's burden of establishing, as an
initial matter, that a claim falling within its purview is "ofthat character and dignity which makes the controversy a
justiciable one under our original jurisdiction." Nebraska v.
Wyoming, 325 U. S., at 610. After all, a variety of changedconditions may "promis[e] to disturb the delicate balance of

the river" created by the decree. Id., at 625. But whenthe plaintiff essentially seeks a reweighing of equities and
an injunction declaring new rights and responsibilities, wethink the plaintiff still must make a showing of substantial
injury to be entitled to relief. That is so not only because anew injunction would work a new infringement on sovereign
prerogatives, but also because the interests of certainty andstability counsel strongly against reopening an apportionment of interstate water rights absent considerable justifi-cation. Cf.

Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 615-628(1983).

III
With these principles in mind, we turn to the summaryjudgment motions. To the extent that we agree with the

Master, we have found it unnecessary to repeat in detail hiscareful evaluation of the voluminous evidence.

A
The Inland Lakes are four off-channel reservoirs in Ne-braska served by the Interstate Canal, which diverts from

the North Platte at Whalen, Wyoming. Both the InlandLakes and the Interstate Canal are part of the North Platte
Project, a series of reservoirs and canals operated by theUnited States Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau). Since 1913,
the Bureau has diverted water through the Interstate Canalfor storage in the Inland Lakes during nonirrigation months

507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT
594 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
for release to Nebraska users during the irrigation season.Due to icing conditions on the Interstate Canal during the

winter, the Bureau also temporarily has stored water des-tined for the Inland Lakes in the Guernsey and Glendo
Reservoirs.

It appears that the Inland Lakes always have been oper-ated with the December 6, 1904, priority date that Wyoming

recognizes for other original components of the North PlatteProject, even though the Bureau never obtained a separate
Wyoming storage permit for the Inland Lakes. In 1986,however, Wyoming sued the Bureau in Wyoming state court,
seeking to enjoin the Bureau from storing water in the Inland Lakes without a state permit and out of priority with
other Wyoming users. (The action was subsequently removed to Federal District Court and dismissed without prejudice.) As the Master indicated, there is some reason to
think that Wyoming wished to establish a post-1986 priority
date for the Inland Lakes in order to increase the amount of
North Platte water available for the new project on Deer
Creek. At any rate, Nebraska (which was not a party to
the Wyoming lawsuit) challenged Wyoming's actions in its
petition to this Court.

Nebraska and the United States moved for summary judgment, seeking determinations that the decree entitles the
Bureau to continue its longstanding diversion and storage
practices and that the Inland Lakes have a priority date of
December 6, 1904. Wyoming moved for partial summary
judgment that the Inland Lakes do not have storage rights
under either state law or the decree. The Special Master
recommended that we grant the motions of Nebraska and
the United States and deny Wyoming's motion. That the
Bureau lacks a separate Wyoming permit for the Inland
Lakes, he reasoned, is immaterial because the question of
the Inland Lakes' priority was determined in the original
proceedings. The decree did not explicitly establish the Inland Lakes' priority. But it is undisputed that the Court

507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT

595Cite as: 507 U. S. 584 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
recognized a right to store 46,000 acre-feet of water in theInland Lakes and, at Wyoming's suggestion, counted that

amount to reduce Nebraska's requirement of natural flows inthe pivotal reach. See Report of Michael J. Doherty, Special
Master in Nebraska v. Wyoming, O. T. 1944, No. 4, pp. 60-61
(hereinafter Doherty Report); 325 U. S., at 646, 649, and n. 2.The Master therefore concluded that the Inland Lakes' priority was a necessary predicate of the apportionment andshould not be disturbed. He also suggested that Wyoming's
postdecree acquiescence in the Bureau's administration ofthe Inland Lakes should prevent Wyoming from challenging
the 1904 priority date now.

We think the evidence from the prior litigation supports
the conclusion that the Inland Lakes' priority was settled
there. And even if the issue was not previously determined,
we would agree with the Special Master that Wyoming's arguments are foreclosed by its postdecree acquiescence. Cf.
Ohio v. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 648 (1973) ("[P]roceedings under this Court's original jurisdiction are basically
equitable in nature, and a claim not technically precluded nonetheless may be foreclosed by acquiescence" (citation omitted)). Accordingly, we clarify today that the Inland
Lakes share a December 6, 1904, priority date with other
original components of the North Platte Project. Pursuant to that priority, the Bureau has a right to divert 46,000
acre-feet of water during the nonirrigation season months of
October, November, and April for storage in the Inland
Lakes. Although the practice of storing Inland Lakes water
temporarily in the Guernsey and Glendo Reservoirs was not
established in 1945, the United States contends, and Wyoming apparently does not dispute, that the practice is necessary to ensure the delivery of the 46,000 acre-feet of water
envisioned in the apportionment. For that reason we hold
that the temporary storage practice also is protected. Our
conclusion does not otherwise affect the rights of the Guernsey and Glendo Reservoirs under the decree.

596 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court

B
The Laramie River originates in Colorado and meets theNorth Platte in Wyoming in the pivotal reach. In its petition, Nebraska challenged two new developments on the Lar-amie near the North Platte confluence. The first, Grayrocks
Project, was completed in 1980. Operated by amicus Basin,it consists of Grayrocks Reservoir and an electric power generating plant. The second, Corn Creek Project, is a pro-posed irrigation system for Wyoming farmland.

Wyoming and Nebraska both moved for summary judg-ment, taking diametrically opposed positions with respect to
their rights to Laramie waters. Nebraska claimed that theequitable apportionment of the water in the pivotal reach
includes Laramie flows that historically have reached theNorth Platte. Wyoming contended that the waters of the
Laramie are completely apportioned between Colorado andWyoming by virtue of this Court's 1922 Laramie River decree, Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 496, modified, 260U. S. 1, vacated and new decree entered, 353 U. S. 953 (1957),
which the North Platte decree expressly left undisturbed.Paragraph XII(d) of the North Platte decree does state
that the decree "shall not affect . . . [t]he apportionment here-tofore made by this Court between the States of Wyoming
and Colorado of the waters of the Laramie River." 325U. S., at 671; see also id., at 592, n. 1 (Laramie decree "in no
way affected" by North Platte decree). But we think theMaster correctly concluded that Wyoming was not granted
the right entirely to dewater the Laramie. The 1922 Lara-mie decree to which Paragraph XII(d) refers did not apportion all the waters of the Laramie; it dealt only with flowsdown to and including the Wheatland Project, a facility upstream of Grayrocks and Corn Creek. See Wyoming v.
Colorado, 259 U. S., at 488.There is a statement arguably to the contrary in a subsequent decision interpreting the 1922 decree. See Wyomingv. Colorado, 298 U. S. 573, 578 (1936) (decree establishes

507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT

597Cite as: 507 U. S. 584 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Wyoming's right "to receive and divert . . . the remainingwaters of the stream and its tributaries"). But we read that

language to refer only to the waters actually apportionedin the earlier proceedings--that is, the waters down to and
including Wheatland. There is also contrary language in
the new Laramie decree entered on the joint motion of Wyo-ming and Colorado in 1957. See

Wyoming v. Colorado, 353
U. S., at 953 (Wyoming "shall have the right to divert anduse all water flowing and remaining in the Laramie river

and its tributaries"). But the 1957 decree, entered withoutNebraska's participation, cannot affect our interpretation
of the 1945 North Platte decree, since Paragraph XII(d)
addresses only the Laramie apportionment "heretofore
made"--in other words, the 1922 decree.

Further, the Court apparently expected that some Laramie water would contribute to the natural flows available
for apportionment in the pivotal reach. See, e. g., Doherty
Report 67, Table III (including Laramie inflows in calculation of natural flow in pivotal reach). But the Court did not
affirmatively apportion Laramie flows to Nebraska, either.
The decree did not restrict Wyoming's use of the Laramie or
require Wyoming regularly to deliver a specified amount of
Laramie water to the North Platte confluence. Since 1945,
Laramie flows that actually have reached the North Platte
have been included in the equitable apportionment, but
neither Nebraska nor the United States has requested that
Wyoming account for diversions above the confluence. For
these and other reasons given by the Special Master, we
agree that the evidence, most fairly read, indicates that the
Court did not decide the fate of the excess Laramie waters
in 1945.

Because the North Platte decree gives Nebraska no rights
to Laramie waters, affording Nebraska injunctive relief
would constitute a modification of the decree. We turn,
then, to the question of injury. In 1978, Nebraska entered
into a settlement agreement with Basin and other parties

507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT
598 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
(but not Wyoming) that limits Grayrocks' consumption of
water and requires Basin to release certain minimum flows.
The agreement also provides for further depletions in the
event that Corn Creek is constructed. See Wyoming's App.
to Brief in Opposition A-24 to A-32. At this juncture,
Nebraska's argument seems to be that it will be injured
if Wyoming interferes with Basin's mandatory minimum
releases by allowing new Wyoming appropriators to divert
from the Laramie between Grayrocks and the North Platte
confluence.

Although Wyoming has declined to assure the Special Master that it will support Basin's obligation to maintain the
minimum flows, see Second Interim Report 66-68, it is undisputed that Wyoming is not currently interfering with those
flows. Other than Corn Creek, Nebraska points to no proposed development that might deplete releases from Grayrocks. Nor does Nebraska seem to argue that Grayrocks
otherwise threatens its interests. The Master recommends
that Paragraph XIII of the decree be amended expressly
to indicate that Nebraska or the United States may apply
for relief if Wyoming, in the future, threatens to interfere
with the releases provided for in the settlement agreement.
Because we do not believe such an amendment would add
to our authority under subparagraph (f ), we do not adopt
this proposal. The Master also proposes to hold a status
conference concerning Corn Creek. We have no objection
to such a conference. We emphasize, however, that unless
Nebraska comes forward with evidence sufficient to establish
that Corn Creek (or some other project on the Laramie)
poses a threat of injury serious enough to warrant modification of the decree, summary judgment should be entered
in favor of Wyoming. We express no view as to whether,
upon a proper showing of injury, incorporation of the settlement agreement into the North Platte decree would be
appropriate.

Deer Creek enters the mainstem of the North Platte inWyoming between the Pathfinder and Guernsey Reservoirs,

upstream of the pivotal reach. Nebraska's petition chal-lenged Wyoming's proposed construction of a new storage
reservoir on Deer Creek. As we have said, in ParagraphXIII(c) of the decree the Court expressly retained jurisdiction to consider requests for further relief with respect tothe effect of threatened construction of new storage capacity
on tributaries entering the North Platte between Pathfinderand Guernsey. See 325 U. S., at 671.

Wyoming moved for summary judgment on alternativegrounds. It asserted that the primary function of the Deer
Creek Project will be to furnish municipal water supplies(by exchange) to Wyoming communities. Accordingly, Wyoming claimed that, Paragraph XIII(c) notwithstanding, theproject is exempt from challenge by virtue of Paragraph X
of the decree, which provides:

"This decree shall not affect or restrict the use or di-version of water from the North Platte River and its

tributaries in Colorado or Wyoming for ordinary andusual domestic, municipal and stock watering purposes
and consumption." Id., at 670.
Wyoming also contended that Nebraska had failed to makean adequate showing of injury.

Although admitting that Paragraph X "poses some mys-teries," Second Interim Report 79, the Special Master evidently agreed with Wyoming that the plain language of thatprovision permits Wyoming freely to divert North Platte
water for ordinary and usual municipal uses and that theother provisions of the decree act only upon the water remaining after such diversions. The Master declined to rec-ommend summary judgment on this ground, however, due to
factual questions concerning the Deer Creek Project's mu-nicipal character. The Master also recommended against

600 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
summary judgment on the injury issue, based on an affidavit
by H. Lee Becker, former state hydrologist for Nebraska.
See Affidavit of H. Lee Becker || 2 (Apr. 25, 1991) (stating
that the project would cause reductions in the average yearend carryover storage of federal reservoirs on the North
Platte and that "[s]uch reductions . . . could limit diversions
in the [pivotal] reach in a series of dry years"), attached to
Nebraska's Response to Wyoming's and Colorado's Motions
for Summary Judgment and to Basin Electric's Memorandum in Support Thereof (Apr. 25, 1991).

Nebraska objects strenuously to the Master's interpretation of Paragraph X. The United States has not filed exceptions but agrees that the Master's interpretation is "problematic." Brief for United States Opposing Exceptions 35
(Aug. 17, 1992) (hereinafter U. S. Brief). We, too, are troubled by Paragraph X. As the Master pointed out, the parties to the original proceedings fought mightily over small
quantities of water. It is therefore unclear why they and
the Court would have meant that the upstream States could
make municipal diversions of any magnitude, in derogation
of the careful system of interstate priorities established
under the decree, without the opportunity for further review.

We nonetheless think it unnecessary to settle upon a definitive interpretation of Paragraph X at this time. The
Special Master rightly observed that the Deer Creek Project
may not qualify as an ordinary and usual municipal use. Although Wyoming recently has promised to operate the project solely for municipal purposes, both the Final Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the project--which
describes a plan of operation that the project may be obliged
to follow--and the state permit identify nonmunicipal uses.
Nebraska also has presented evidence that the communities
that the Deer Creek Project is to serve do not need additional municipal supplies, and that, even if they did, there are
more cost-effective alternatives than the proposed reservoir.

Opinion of the Court
In addition, Nebraska may be unable to prove that operation of the Deer Creek Project will cause it substantial injury. Such proof is necessary, as we have indicated, because
the decree does not currently restrict Wyoming's use of Deer
Creek, and a new injunction would constitute a modification
of the decree. Whether the project will injure Nebraska
may depend on the way it is administered.

Wyoming has conceded that the Deer Creek Project will
be operated in accordance with state law and in priority with
the Glendo and Guernsey Reservoirs. It has not agreed,
however, to operate the project junior to the Inland Lakes,
perhaps because its position throughout the litigation has
been that the Inland Lakes lack a priority date. In light of
our recognition today that the decree establishes a 1904 priority date for the Inland Lakes, it is unclear whether Wyoming will persist in seeking to operate the Deer Creek Project out of priority. If the project is operated junior to the
Inland Lakes, the evidence of injury to Nebraska appears
to be diminished. See Affidavit of H. Lee Becker |||| 4-6
(Aug. 12, 1988) (demonstrating that anticipated reductions
in federal reservoirs' carryover storage would be smaller if
Inland Lakes' priority were recognized), attached to Nebraska's Response to Wyoming's Motion for Summary Judgment (Aug. 22, 1988); Affidavit of David G. Wilde || 89(b)
(Aug. 15, 1988) (stating that, although Deer Creek would
"substantially impac[t]" federal projects during an extended
dry period, impacts would be "minimized" if Deer Creek
were administered junior to the Inland Lakes), attached to
Response of United States to Wyoming's Motion for Summary Judgment (Aug. 23, 1988). But Wyoming still may assert that Paragraph X permits it to divert for municipal uses
out of priority with the Inland Lakes. In that event, we
think the Wilde and Becker affidavits raise a genuine issue
of material fact sufficient to defeat Wyoming's summary
judgment motion.

602 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court

D
In its counterclaim, Wyoming alleged that Nebraska wasviolating the decree by demanding natural flows and storage

water from sources above the Tri-State Dam and divertingthose waters to uses below Tri-State that are not recognized
in the decree. Wyoming also alleged that Nebraska was im-properly demanding North Platte flows for diversion by canals at and above Tri-State Dam in excess of the irrigationrequirements of the Nebraska lands entitled to water under
the decree. Increased diversions by the Nebraska canalsabove Tri-State evidently benefit users below Tri-State because they create increased return flows.Neither Wyoming nor Nebraska sought summary judgment on Wyoming's counterclaim. Rather, both States andColorado have sought a number of more limited rulings with
respect to the below Tri-State issues. We agree with theMaster that most of these claims are " `too theoretical and
not sufficiently anchored to concrete pleadings or an ade-quately developed factual [r]ecord' " to be susceptible of
summary resolution at this time. Second Interim Report92 (quoting Post-Argument Comments of United States 6
(July 29, 1991)). We further agree that one issue is suffi-ciently crystallized to warrant partial summary judgment
for Nebraska.Nebraska requested a determination that the decree does
not impose absolute ceilings on diversions by canals takingin the pivotal reach. As the Master explained, the irrigation
requirements of the lands the canals serve were calculatedin the prior proceedings. But the requirements were calculated for the purpose of determining the appropriate appor-tionment of the pivotal reach, not to impose a cap on the
canals' total diversions, either individually or cumulatively.See Doherty Report 161 ("[T]he findings herein as to

re-quirements cannot, I think, be deemed a limitation upon individual canals or groups, in actual administration, either as tonatural flow or storage water, nor do I think any such limita507us2$55J 11-15-96 19:26:54 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tions can properly be imposed by the decree" (emphasis inoriginal)). Paragraph V of the decree, which sets forth the

apportionment, makes no mention of diversion ceilings andexpressly states that Nebraska is free to allocate its share
among its canals as it sees fit. See 325 U. S., at 667.In Wyoming's view, Paragraph IV of the decree requires
a different result. The Master properly rejected this argu-ment. Paragraph IV establishes the priority of Nebraska
canals diverting in the pivotal reach relative to federal proj-ects in Wyoming. See

id., at 666-667. We agree with theUnited States that, although Paragraph IV "limits the extent to which the Nebraska canals may stop federal reser-voirs from storing water, [it] does not place any `absolute
ceilings' or other restrictions on the quantities of water thosecanals may actually divert." U. S. Brief 40, n. 21. Wyoming asks us to clarify that the federal reservoirs have noobligation to bypass natural flow to a senior Nebraska canal
when the canal is making excessive calls for federal storagewater. Because there is as yet inadequate factual development on the question whether Nebraska canals have in factmade excessive calls, we decline to do so.

IV
For the foregoing reasons, all of the exceptions filed tothe Special Master's reports are overruled. The summary

judgment motions of Nebraska and the United States re-garding the Inland Lakes' priority date are granted, as is
Nebraska's partial summary judgment motion with respectto the issue of canal diversion limitations. All other summary judgment motions are denied.

It is so ordered.

HAZEN PAPER CO. et al. v. BIGGINS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 91-1600. Argued January 13, 1993--Decided April 20, 1993
Petitioners fired respondent Biggins when he was 62 years old and apparently a few weeks short of the years of service he needed for his pension
to vest. In his ensuing lawsuit, a jury found, inter alia, a willful violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),
which gave rise to liquidated damages. The District Court granted
petitioners' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the
"willfulness" finding, but the Court of Appeals reversed, giving considerable emphasis to evidence of pension interference in upholding ADEA
liability and finding that petitioners' conduct was willful because, under
the standard of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111,
128, they knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether
their conduct contravened the ADEA.

Held:

1. An employer does not violate the ADEA by interfering with an
older employee's pension benefits that would have vested by virtue of
the employee's years of service. In a disparate treatment case, liability
depends on whether the protected trait--under the ADEA, age--actually motivated the employer's decision. When that decision is wholly
motivated by factors other than age, the problem that prompted the
ADEA's passage--inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes about older
workers' productivity and competence--disappears. Thus, it would
be incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service--which is
analytically distinct from age--is necessarily age based. None of this
Court's prior decisions should be read to mean that an employer violates
the ADEA whenever its reason for firing an employee is improper in
any respect. The foregoing holding does not preclude the possibility of
liability where an employer uses pension status as a proxy for age, of
dual liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 and the ADEA, or of liability where vesting is based on age rather
than years of service. Because the Court of Appeals cited additional
evidentiary support for ADEA liability, this case is remanded for that
court to reconsider whether the jury had sufficient evidence to find such
liability. Pp. 608-614.

2. The Thurston "knowledge or reckless disregard" standard for liquidated damages applies not only where the predicate ADEA violation is
a formal, facially discriminatory policy, as in Thurston, but also where
it is an informal decision by the employer that was motivated by the
employee's age. Petitioners have not persuaded this Court that Thurston was wrongly decided or that the Court should part from the rule
of stare decisis. Applying the Thurston standard to cases of individual
discrimination will not defeat the two-tiered system of liability intended
by Congress. Since the ADEA affords an employer a "bona fide occupational qualification" defense, and exempts certain subject matters and
persons, an employer could incorrectly but in good faith and nonrecklessly believe that the statute permits a particular age-based decision.
Nor is there some inherent difference between this case and Thurston
to cause a shift in the meaning of the word "willful." The distinction
between the formal, publicized policy in Thurston and the undisclosed
factor here is not such a difference, since an employer's reluctance to
acknowledge its reliance on the forbidden factor should not cut against
imposing a penalty. Once a "willful" violation has been shown, the employee need not additionally demonstrate that the employer's conduct
was outrageous, provide direct evidence of the employer's motivation,
or prove that age was the predominant, rather than a determinative,
factor in the employment decision. Pp. 614-617.

Petitioner Hazen Paper Company manufactures coated,laminated, and printed paper and paperboard. The company is owned and operated by two cousins, petitionersRobert Hazen and Thomas N. Hazen. The Hazens hired
respondent Walter F. Biggins as their technical director in1977. They fired him in 1986, when he was 62 years old.

Respondent brought suit against petitioners in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging a violation of the ADEA. He claimed that age hadbeen a determinative factor in petitioners' decision to fire
him. Petitioners contested this claim, asserting insteadthat respondent had been fired for doing business with competitors of Hazen Paper. The case was tried before a jury,which rendered a verdict for respondent on his ADEA claim
and also found violations of the Employee Retirement In-come Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 895, $ 510, 29
U. S. C. $ 1140, and state law. On the ADEA count, thejury specifically found that petitioners "willfully" violated
the statute. Under $ 7(b) of the ADEA, 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b),a "willful" violation gives rise to liquidated damages.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners moved for judgment notwithstanding the ver-dict. The District Court granted the motion with respect

to a state-law claim and the finding of "willfulness" but oth-erwise denied it. An appeal ensued. 953 F. 2d 1405 (CA1
1992). The United States Court of Appeals for the FirstCircuit affirmed judgment for respondent on both the ADEA
and ERISA counts, and reversed judgment notwithstandingthe verdict for petitioners as to "willfulness."

In affirming the judgments of liability, the Court of Ap-peals relied heavily on the evidence that petitioners had
fired respondent in order to prevent his pension benefitsfrom vesting. That evidence, as construed most favorably
to respondent by the court, showed that the Hazen Paperpension plan had a 10-year vesting period and that respondent would have reached the 10-year mark had he worked"a few more weeks" after being fired. Id., at 1411. There
was also testimony that petitioners had offered to retain re-spondent as a consultant to Hazen Paper, in which capacity
he would not have been entitled to receive pension benefits.
Id., at 1412. The Court of Appeals found this evidence ofpension interference to be sufficient for ERISA liability,

id., at 1416, and also gave it considerable emphasis in up-holding ADEA liability. After summarizing all the testimony tending to show age discrimination, the court stated:

"Based on the foregoing evidence, the jury could rea-sonably have found that Thomas Hazen decided to fire

[respondent] before his pension rights vested and usedthe confidentiality agreement [that petitioners had asked
respondent to sign] as a means to that end. The jurycould also have reasonably found that age was inextricably intertwined with the decision to fire [respondent].If it were not for [respondent's] age, sixty-two, his pension rights would not have been within a hairbreadthof vesting. [Respondent] was fifty-two years old when
he was hired; his pension rights vested in ten years."Id., at 1412.

608 HAZEN PAPER CO. v. BIGGINS

Opinion of the Court
As to the issue of "willfulness" under $ 7(b) of the ADEA,
the Court of Appeals adopted and applied the definition set
out in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111
(1985). In Thurston, we held that the airline's facially discriminatory job-transfer policy was not a "willful" ADEA
violation because the airline neither "knew [nor] showed
reckless disregard for the matter of whether" the policy contravened the statute. Id., at 128 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The Court of Appeals found sufficient evidence
to satisfy the Thurston standard, and ordered that respondent be awarded liquidated damages equal to and in addition
to the underlying damages of $419,454.38. 953 F. 2d, at
1415-1416.

We granted certiorari to decide two questions. 505 U. S.
1203 (1992). First, does an employer's interference with the
vesting of pension benefits violate the ADEA? Second,
does the Thurston standard for liquidated damages apply to
the case where the predicate ADEA violation is not a formal,
facially discriminatory policy, as in Thurston, but rather an
informal decision by the employer that was motivated by the
employee's age?

II

A

The Courts of Appeals repeatedly have faced the question
whether an employer violates the ADEA by acting on the
basis of a factor, such as an employee's pension status or
seniority, that is empirically correlated with age. Compare
White v. Westinghouse Electric Co., 862 F. 2d 56, 62 (CA3
1988) (firing of older employee to prevent vesting of pension
benefits violates ADEA); Metz v. Transit Mix, Inc., 828
F. 2d 1202 (CA7 1987) (firing of older employee to save salary
costs resulting from seniority violates ADEA), with Williams v. General Motors Corp., 656 F. 2d 120, 130, n. 17 (CA5
1981) ("[S]eniority and age discrimination are unrelated. . . .
We state without equivocation that the seniority a given

plaintiff has accumulated entitles him to no better or worsetreatment in an age discrimination suit"), cert. denied, 455

U. S. 943 (1982); EEOC v. Clay Printing Co., 955 F. 2d 936,942 (CA4 1992) (emphasizing distinction between employee's
age and years of service). We now clarify that there is no
disparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor moti-vating the employer is some feature other than the employee's age.We long have distinguished between "disparate treatment" and "disparate impact" theories of employmentdiscrimination.

" `Disparate treatment' . . . is the most easily under-stood type of discrimination. The employer simply
treats some people less favorably than others becauseof their race, color, religion [or other protected characteristics.] Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, al-though it can in some situations be inferred from the
mere fact of differences in treatment. . . .

"[C]laims that stress `disparate impact' [by contrast]involve employment practices that are facially neutral

in their treatment of different groups but that in factfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot
be justified by business necessity. Proof of discrimina-tory motive . . . is not required under a disparate-impact
theory." Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 335-336, n. 15 (1977) (citation omitted) (construing Title VII
of Civil Rights Act of 1964).
The disparate treatment theory is of course available under
the ADEA, as the language of that statute makes clear.
"It shall be unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to
hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate
against any individual with respect to his compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of
such individual's age." 29 U. S. C. $ 623(a)(1) (emphasis
added). See Thurston, supra, at 120-125 (affirming ADEA

Opinion of the Court
liability under disparate treatment theory). By contrast,we have never decided whether a disparate impact theory of

liability is available under the ADEA, see Markham v. Gel-ler, 451 U. S. 945 (1981) (

Rehnquist, J., dissenting from de-nial of certiorari), and we need not do so here. Respondent

claims only that he received disparate treatment.In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether
the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually moti-vated the employer's decision. See, e. g., United States
Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711(1983); Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450
U. S. 248, 252-256 (1981); Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters,438 U. S. 567, 576-578 (1978). The employer may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiringadverse treatment of employees with that trait. See,

e. g.,Thurston, supra; Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v.

Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 704-718 (1978). Or the employermay have been motivated by the protected trait on an ad
hoc, informal basis. See, e. g., Anderson v. Bessemer City,470 U. S. 564 (1985);

Teamsters, supra, at 334-343. What-ever the employer's decisionmaking process, a disparate

treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee's pro-tected trait actually played a role in that process and had a
determinative influence on the outcome.Disparate treatment, thus defined, captures the essence
of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA. It isthe very essence of age discrimination for an older employee
to be fired because the employer believes that productivityand competence decline with old age. As we explained in
EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983), Congress' promul-gation of the ADEA was prompted by its concern that older
workers were being deprived of employment on the basis ofinaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.

"Although age discrimination rarely was based on thesort of animus motivating some other forms of discrimination, it was based in large part on stereotypes unsup507us2$56J 11-15-96 19:29:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ported by objective fact . . . . Moreover, the availableempirical evidence demonstrated that arbitrary age

lines were in fact generally unfounded and that, as anoverall matter, the performance of older workers was at
least as good as that of younger workers." Id., at 231.
Thus the ADEA commands that "employers are to evaluate[older] employees . . . on their merits and not their age."

Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472 U. S. 400, 422 (1985).The employer cannot rely on age as a proxy for an employee's
remaining characteristics, such as productivity, but mustinstead focus on those factors directly.

When the employer's decision is wholly motivated by fac-tors other than age, the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes disappears. This is true even if the moti-vating factor is correlated with age, as pension status
typically is. Pension plans typically provide that an employ-ee's accrued benefits will become nonforfeitable, or "vested,"
once the employee completes a certain number of years ofservice with the employer. See 1 J. Mamorsky, Employee
Benefits Law $ 5.03 (1992). On average, an older employeehas had more years in the work force than a younger employee, and thus may well have accumulated more yearsof service with a particular employer. Yet an employee's
age is analytically distinct from his years of service. Anemployee who is younger than 40, and therefore outside the
class of older workers as defined by the ADEA, see 29U. S. C. $ 631(a), may have worked for a particular employer
his entire career, while an older worker may have beennewly hired. Because age and years of service are analytically distinct, an employer can take account of one whileignoring the other, and thus it is incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily "age based."The instant case is illustrative. Under the Hazen Paper
pension plan, as construed by the Court of Appeals, an em-ployee's pension benefits vest after the employee completes
10 years of service with the company. Perhaps it is true

507us2$56J 11-15-96 19:29:57 PAGES OPINPGT
612 HAZEN PAPER CO. v. BIGGINS

Opinion of the Court
that older employees of Hazen Paper are more likely to be"close to vesting" than younger employees. Yet a decision

by the company to fire an older employee solely because hehas nine-plus years of service and therefore is "close to vesting" would not constitute discriminatory treatment on the
basis of age. The prohibited stereotype ("Older employeesare likely to be ---") would not have figured in this decision,

and the attendant stigma would not ensue. The decisionwould not be the result of an inaccurate and denigrating
generalization about age, but would rather represent an
accurate judgment about the employee--that he indeed is
"close to vesting."

We do not mean to suggest that an employer lawfully
could fire an employee in order to prevent his pension benefits from vesting. Such conduct is actionable under $ 510 of
ERISA, as the Court of Appeals rightly found in affirming
judgment for respondent under that statute. See IngersollRand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 142-143 (1990). But
it would not, without more, violate the ADEA. That law
requires the employer to ignore an employee's age (absent
a statutory exemption or defense); it does not specify further characteristics that an employer must also ignore. Although some language in our prior decisions might be read
to mean that an employer violates the ADEA whenever its
reason for firing an employee is improper in any respect,
see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802
(1973) (creating proof framework applicable to ADEA) (employer must have "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for
action against employee), this reading is obviously incorrect.
For example, it cannot be true that an employer who fires
an older black worker because the worker is black thereby
violates the ADEA. The employee's race is an improper
reason, but it is improper under Title VII, not the ADEA.

We do not preclude the possibility that an employer who
targets employees with a particular pension status on the
assumption that these employees are likely to be older

507us2$56J 11-15-96 19:29:57 PAGES OPINPGT

613Cite as: 507 U. S. 604 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
thereby engages in age discrimination. Pension status maybe a proxy for age, not in the sense that the ADEA makes

the two factors equivalent, cf. Metz, 828 F. 2d, at 1208 (using"proxy" to mean statutory equivalence), but in the sense that
the employer may suppose a correlation between the two
factors and act accordingly. Nor do we rule out the possibil-ity of dual liability under ERISA and the ADEA where the

decision to fire the employee was motivated both by the em-ployee's age and by his pension status. Finally, we do not
consider the special case where an employee is about to vestin pension benefits as a result of his

age, rather than years
of service, see 1 Mamorsky, supra, at $ 5.02[2], and the employer fires the employee in order to prevent vesting. That
case is not presented here. Our holding is simply that an
employer does not violate the ADEA just by interfering
with an older employee's pension benefits that would have
vested by virtue of the employee's years of service.

Besides the evidence of pension interference, the Court
of Appeals cited some additional evidentiary support for
ADEA liability. Although there was no direct evidence of
petitioners' motivation, except for two isolated comments by
the Hazens, the Court of Appeals did note the following indirect evidence: Respondent was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, even though no other employee had been
required to do so, and his replacement was a younger man
who was given a less onerous agreement. 953 F. 2d, at 1411.
In the ordinary ADEA case, indirect evidence of this kind
may well suffice to support liability if the plaintiff also shows
that the employer's explanation for its decision--here, that
respondent had been disloyal to Hazen Paper by doing business with its competitors--is " `unworthy of credence.' " Aikens, 460 U. S., at 716 (quoting Burdine, 450 U. S., at 256).
But inferring age motivation from the implausibility of the
employer's explanation may be problematic in cases where
other unsavory motives, such as pension interference, were
present. This issue is now before us in the Title VII con507us2$56J 11-15-96 19:29:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
text, see Hicks v. St. Mary's Honor Center, 970 F. 2d 487(CA8 1992), cert. granted, 506 U. S. 1042 (1993), and we will

not address it prematurely. We therefore remand the casefor the Court of Appeals to reconsider whether the jury had
sufficient evidence to find an ADEA violation.

B
Because we remand for further proceedings, we also ad-dress the second question upon which certiorari was granted:

the meaning of "willful" in $ 7(b) of the ADEA, which pro-vides for liquidated damages in the case of a "willful"
violation.In Thurston, we thoroughly analyzed $ 7(b) and concluded
that "a violation of the Act [would be] `willful' if the employerknew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether
its conduct was prohibited by the ADEA." 469 U. S., at 126(internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). We sifted
through the legislative history of $ 7(b), which had derivedfrom $ 16(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA),
52 Stat. 1069, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 216(a), and deter-mined that the accepted judicial interpretation of $ 16(a) at
the time of the passage of the ADEA supported the "knowl-edge or reckless disregard" standard. See 469 U. S., at 126.
We found that this standard was consistent with the mean-ing of "willful" in other criminal and civil statutes. See id.,
at 126-127. Finally, we observed that Congress aimed tocreate a "two-tiered liability scheme," under which some,
but not all, ADEA violations would give rise to liquidateddamages. We therefore rejected a broader definition of
"willful" providing for liquidated damages whenever theemployer knew that the ADEA was "in the picture." See
id., at 127-128.

In McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128 (1988),an FLSA case, we reaffirmed the

Thurston standard. The
question in Richland Shoe was whether the limitations pro507us2$56J 11-15-96 19:29:57 PAGES OPINPGT

615Cite as: 507 U. S. 604 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
vision of the FLSA, creating a 3-year period for "willful"violations, should be interpreted consistently with Thurston.

We answered that question in the affirmative.

"The word `willful' is widely used in the law, and, al-though it has not by any means been given a perfectly

consistent interpretation, it is generally understood torefer to conduct that is not merely negligent. The
standard of willfulness that was adopted in Thurston--that the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohib-ited by the statute--is surely a fair reading of the plain
language of the Act." 486 U. S., at 133.
Once again we rejected the "in the picture standard" be-cause it would "virtually obliterat[e] any distinction between

willful and nonwillful violations." Id., at 132-133.Surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals continue to be confused about the meaning of the term "willful" in $ 7(b) of theADEA. A number of Circuits have declined to apply Thurston to what might be called an informal disparate treatmentcase--where age has entered into the employment decision
on an ad hoc, informal basis rather than through a formalpolicy. At least one Circuit refuses to impose liquidated
damages in such a case unless the employer's conduct was"outrageous." See,

e. g., Lockhart v. Westinghouse CreditCorp., 879 F. 2d 43, 57-58 (CA3 1989). Another requires

that the underlying evidence of liability be direct rather thancircumstantial. See, e. g., Neufeld v. Searle Laboratories,
884 F. 2d 335, 340 (CA8 1989). Still others have insisted thatage be the "predominant," rather than simply a determinative, factor. See, e. g., Spulak v. K Mart Corp., 894 F. 2d1150, 1159 (CA10 1990);

Schrand v. Federal Pacific Elec. Co.,851 F. 2d 152, 158 (CA6 1988). The chief concern of these

Circuits has been that the application of Thurston woulddefeat the two-tiered system of liability intended by Congress, because every employer that engages in informal age

616 HAZEN PAPER CO. v. BIGGINS

Opinion of the Court
discrimination knows or recklessly disregards the illegalityof its conduct.

We believe that this concern is misplaced. The ADEAdoes not provide for liquidated damages "where consistent
with the principle of a two-tiered liability scheme." It provides for liquidated damages where the violation was "will-ful." That definition must be applied here unless we overrule Thurston, or unless there is some inherent differencebetween this case and

Thurston to cause a shift in the meaning of the word "willful."As for the first possibility, petitioners have not persuaded

us that Thurston was wrongly decided, let alone that we
should depart from the rule of stare decisis. The two-tiered
liability principle was simply one interpretive tool among
several that we used in Thurston to decide what Congress
meant by the word "willful," and in any event we continue
to believe that the "knowledge or reckless disregard" standard will create two tiers of liability across the range of
ADEA cases. It is not true that an employer who knowingly relies on age in reaching its decision invariably commits a knowing or reckless violation of the ADEA. The
ADEA is not an unqualified prohibition on the use of age in
employment decisions, but affords the employer a "bona fide
occupational qualification" defense, see 29 U. S. C. $ 623(f)(1),
and exempts certain subject matters and persons, see, e. g.,

$ 623(f)(2) (exemption for bona fide seniority systems and employee benefit plans); $ 631(c) (exemption for bona fide executives and high policymakers). If an employer incorrectly
but in good faith and nonrecklessly believes that the statute
permits a particular age-based decision, then liquidated damages should not be imposed. See Richland Shoe, supra, at
135, n. 13. Indeed, in Thurston itself we upheld liability but
reversed an award of liquidated damages because the employer "acted [nonrecklessly] and in good faith in attempting
to determine whether [its] plan would violate the ADEA."

Kennedy, J., concurring
Nor do we see how the instant case can be distinguishedfrom

Thurston, assuming that petitioners did indeed fire respondent because of his age. The only distinction between
Thurston and the case before us is the existence of formal
discrimination. Age entered into the employment decision
there through a formal and publicized policy, and not as anundisclosed factor motivating the employer on an ad hoc

basis, which is what respondent alleges occurred here. Butsurely an employer's reluctance to acknowledge its reliance
on the forbidden factor should not cut against imposing apenalty. It would be a wholly circular and self-defeating
interpretation of the ADEA to hold that, in cases where anemployer more likely knows its conduct to be illegal, knowledge alone does not suffice for liquidated damages. We
therefore reaffirm that the Thurston definition of "willful"--
that the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard
for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the
statute--applies to all disparate treatment cases under the
ADEA. Once a "willful" violation has been shown, the employee need not additionally demonstrate that the employer's
conduct was outrageous, or provide direct evidence of the
employer's motivation, or prove that age was the predominant, rather than a determinative, factor in the employment
decision.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, concurring.

I agree with the Court that the Court of Appeals placed
improper reliance on respondent's evidence of pension interference and that the standard for determining willfulness announced in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S.
111 (1985), applies to individual acts of age discrimination as

well as age discrimination manifested in formal, company-wide policy. I write to underscore that the only claim based

upon the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA),29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq., asserted by respondent in this litigation is that petitioners discriminated against him becauseof his age. He has advanced no claim that petitioners' use
of an employment practice that has a disproportionate effecton older workers violates the ADEA. See App. 29-30
(amended complaint); 5 Record 71-76 ( jury instructions).As a result, nothing in the Court's opinion should be read as
incorporating in the ADEA context the so-called "disparateimpact" theory of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
42 U. S. C. $$ 2000e to 2000e-17. As the Court acknowl-edges, ante, at 610, we have not yet addressed the question
whether such a claim is cognizable under the ADEA, andthere are substantial arguments that it is improper to carry
over disparate impact analysis from Title VII to the ADEA.See Markham v. Geller, 451 U. S. 945 (1981) (

619OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSON, SUPERINTENDENT,DODGE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 91-7358. Argued December 1, 1992--Decided April 21, 1993
At his first-degree murder trial in Wisconsin state court, petitioner Brecht

admitted shooting the victim, but claimed it was an accident. In order
to impeach this testimony, the State, inter alia, made several references
to the fact that, before he was given his Miranda warnings at an arraignment, Brecht failed to tell anyone with whom he came in contact
that the shooting was accidental. The State also made several references to his post-Miranda-warning silence in this regard. The jury
returned a guilty verdict and Brecht was sentenced to life in prison, but
the State Court of Appeals set the conviction aside on the grounds that
the State's references to his post-Miranda silence violated due process
under Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, and this error was sufficiently "prejudicial" to require reversal. The State Supreme Court reinstated the
conviction, holding that the error was " `harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt' " under the standard set forth in Chapman v. California, 386
U. S. 18, 24. The Federal District Court disagreed and set aside the
conviction on habeas review. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held
that the proper standard of harmless-error review was that set forth in
Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 776, i. e., whether the Doyle
violation " `had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' " Applying this standard, the court concluded
that Brecht was not entitled to relief.

Held:

1. The Kotteakos harmless-error standard, rather than the Chapman
standard, applies in determining whether habeas relief must be granted
because of unconstitutional "trial error" such as the Doyle error at
issue. Pp. 627-638.

(a) The State's references to Brecht's post-Miranda silence violated
Doyle. The Doyle rule rests on the Miranda warnings' implicit assurance that a suspect's silence will not be used against him, and on the
fundamental unfairness of using postwarning silence to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial. It is conceivable that, once
Brecht was given his warnings, he decided to stand on his right to remain silent because he believed his silence would not be used against
him at trial. The prosecution's references to his pre-Miranda silence

507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:12 PAGES OPINPGT
620 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSON

Syllabus
were, however, entirely proper. Such silence is probative and does not
rest on any implied assurance by law enforcement authorities that it
will carry no penalty. Pp. 627-629.

(b) Doyle error fits squarely into the category of constitutional violations characterized by this Court as "trial error." See Arizona v.
Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 307. Such error occurs during the presentation of the case to the jury, and is amenable to harmless-error analysis
because it may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence to determine its effect on the trial. See id., at 307-308. This
Court has consistently applied the Chapman standard in reviewing
claims of constitutional error of the trial type on direct review of state
and federal criminal proceedings. Pp. 629-630.

(c) It is for the Court to determine what harmless-error standard
applies on collateral review of Brecht's Doyle claim. Although the
Court has applied the Chapman standard in a handful of federal habeas
cases, stare decisis does not preclude adoption of the Kotteakos standard
here, since the decisions in question never squarely addressed, but
merely assumed, Chapman's applicability on collateral review. Nor has
Congress provided express guidance on the question. The federal habeas statute is silent as to the applicable standard, and while the federal
harmless-error statute appears to echo the Kotteakos standard, it has
been limited in its application to claims of nonconstitutional error in
federal criminal cases. In line with the traditional rule, the Court finds
no reason to draw inferences from Congress' failure to enact postChapman proposals that would have provided a less stringent harmlesserror standard on collateral review of constitutional error. Pp. 630-633.

(d) The Kotteakos standard is better tailored to the nature and purpose of collateral review than the Chapman standard, and is more likely
to promote the considerations underlying this Court's recent habeas jurisprudence. In recognition of the historical distinction between direct
review as the principal way to challenge a conviction and collateral review as an extraordinary remedy whose role is secondary and limited,
the Court has often applied different standards on habeas than on direct
review. It scarcely seems logical to require federal habeas courts to
engage in the same approach that Chapman requires of state courts
on direct review, since the latter courts are fully qualified to identify
constitutional error and are often better situated to evaluate its prejudicial effect on the trial process. Absent affirmative evidence that statecourt judges are ignoring their oath, Brecht's argument is unpersuasive
that such courts will respond to the application of Kotteakos on federal
habeas by violating their Article VI duty to uphold the Constitution.
In any event, the additional deterrent effect, if any, of applying Chapman on federal habeas is outweighed by the costs of that application,

621Cite as: 507 U. S. 619 (1993)
Syllabus
which undermines the States' interest in finality and infringes upon
their sovereignty over criminal matters; is at odds with habeas' purpose
of affording relief only to those grievously wronged; imposes significant
"social costs," including the expenditure of additional time and resources
by all of the parties, the erosion of memory and the dispersion of witnesses, and the frustration of society's interest in the prompt administration of justice; and results in retrials that take place much later than
those following reversal on direct appeal. This imbalance of costs and
benefits counsels in favor of application of the less onerous Kotteakos
standard on collateral review, under which claimants are entitled to
relief for trial error only if they can establish that "actual prejudice"
resulted. See United States v. Lane, 474 U. S. 438, 449. Because the
Kotteakos standard is grounded in the federal harmless-error rule (28
U. S. C. $ 2111), federal courts may turn to an existing body of case law
and, thus, are unlikely to be confused in applying it. Pp. 633-638.

2. It is clear that the Doyle error at Brecht's trial did not "substantially influence" the jury's verdict within the meaning of Kotteakos,
since the record, considered as a whole, demonstrates that the State's
references to Brecht's post-Miranda silence were infrequent and were,
in effect, merely cumulative of the extensive and permissible references
to his pre-Miranda silence; that the evidence of his guilt was, if not
overwhelming, certainly weighty; and that circumstantial evidence also
pointed to his guilt. Thus, Brecht is not entitled to habeas relief.
Pp. 638-639.

Opinion of the Court
prosecution's use for impeachment purposes of petitioner'spostMiranda 1 silence, in violation of due process under
Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (1976), entitles petitioner to ha-beas corpus relief. We hold that it does not. Instead, the

standard for determining whether habeas relief must be
granted is whether the Doyle error "had substantial and in-jurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict."

Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 776 (1946). The
Kotteakos harmless-error standard is better tailored to the
nature and purpose of collateral review than the Chapmanstandard, and application of a less onerous harmless-error

standard on habeas promotes the considerations underlyingour habeas jurisprudence. Applying this standard, we conclude that petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief.

Petitioner Todd A. Brecht was serving time in a Georgiaprison for felony theft when his sister and her husband,

Molly and Roger Hartman, paid the restitution for petitioner's crime and assumed temporary custody of him. The
Hartmans brought petitioner home with them to Alma, Wisconsin, where he was to reside with them before entering a
halfway house. This caused some tension in the Hartman
household because Roger Hartman, a local district attorney, disapproved of petitioner's heavy drinking habits and
homosexual orientation, not to mention his previous criminal
exploits. To make the best of the situation, though, the
Hartmans told petitioner, on more than one occasion, that he
was not to drink alcohol or engage in homosexual activities
in their home. Just one week after his arrival, however,
petitioner violated this house rule.

While the Hartmans were away, petitioner broke into their
liquor cabinet and began drinking. He then found a rifle in
an upstairs room and began shooting cans in the backyard.
When Roger Hartman returned home from work, petitioner
shot him in the back and sped off in Mrs. Hartman's car.

Opinion of the Court
Hartman crawled to a neighbor's house to summon help.(The downstairs phone in the Hartmans' house was inoperable because petitioner had taken the receiver on the upstairsphone off the hook.) Help came, but Hartman's wound
proved fatal. Meanwhile, petitioner had driven Mrs. Hartman's car into a ditch in a nearby town. When a police offi-cer stopped to offer assistance, petitioner told him that his

sister knew about his car mishap and had called a tow truck.Petitioner then hitched a ride to Winona, Minnesota, where
he was stopped by police. At first he tried to conceal hisidentity, but he later identified himself and was arrested.
When he was told that he was being held for the shooting,
petitioner replied that "it was a big mistake" and asked to
talk with "somebody that would understand [him]." App.
39, 78. Petitioner was returned to Wisconsin, and thereafter was given his Miranda warnings at an arraignment.

Then petitioner was charged with first-degree murder.
At trial in the Circuit Court for Buffalo County, he took the
stand and admitted shooting Hartman, but claimed it was
an accident. According to petitioner, when he saw Hartman
pulling into the driveway on the evening of the shooting, he
ran to replace the gun in the upstairs room where he had
found it. But as he was running toward the stairs in the
downstairs hallway, he tripped, causing the rifle to discharge
the fatal shot. After the shooting, Hartman disappeared,
so petitioner drove off in Mrs. Hartman's car to find him.
Upon spotting Hartman at his neighbor's door, however,
petitioner panicked and drove away.

The State argued that petitioner's account was belied by
the fact that he had failed to get help for Hartman, fled the
Hartmans' home immediately after the shooting, and lied to
the police officer who came upon him in the ditch about having called Mrs. Hartman. In addition, the State pointed out
that petitioner had failed to mention anything about the
shooting being an accident to the officer who found him in
the ditch, the man who gave him a ride to Winona, or the

officers who eventually arrested him. Over the objectionsof defense counsel, the State also asked petitioner during

cross-examination whether he had told anyone at any timebefore trial that the shooting was an accident, to which petitioner replied "no," and made several references to petition-er's pretrial silence during closing argument.

2 Finally, the

State offered extrinsic evidence tending to contradict peti-tioner's story, including the path the bullet traveled through

Mr. Hartman's body (horizontal to slightly downward) andthe location where the rifle was found after the shooting
(outside), as well as evidence of motive (petitioner's hostilitytoward Mr. Hartman because of his disapproval of petitioner's sexual orientation).The jury returned a guilty verdict, and petitioner was
sentenced to life imprisonment. The Wisconsin Court of

2 The State's cross-examination of petitioner included the following
exchange:

"Q. In fact the first time you have ever told this story is when you
testified here today was it not?. . . . .

"A. You mean the story of actually what happened?
"Q. Yes.
"A. I knew what happened, I'm just telling it the way it happened, yes,
I didn't have a chance to talk to anyone, I didn't want to call somebody
from a phone and give up my rights, so I didn't want to talk about it, no
sir." App. 22-23.

Then on re-cross-examination, the State further inquired:
"Q. Did you tell anyone about what had happened in Alma?
"A. No I did not." Id., at 23.
During closing argument, the State urged the jury to "remember that
Mr. Brecht never volunteered until in this courtroom what happened in
the Hartman residence . . . ." Id., at 30. It also made the following
statement with regard to petitioner's pretrial silence: "He sits back here
and sees all of our evidence go in and then he comes out with this crazy
story . . . ." Id., at 31. Finally, during its closing rebuttal, the State
said: "I know what I'd say [had I been in petitioner's shoes], I'd say, `hold
on, this was a mistake, this was an accident, let me tell you what happened,' but he didn't say that did he. No, he waited until he hears our
story." Id., at 36.

Opinion of the Court
Appeals set the conviction aside on the ground that the
State's references to petitioner's post-Miranda silence, see
n. 2, supra, violated due process under Doyle v. Ohio, 426
U. S. 610 (1976), and that this error was sufficiently "prejudicial" to require reversal. State v. Brecht, 138 Wis. 2d 158,
168-169, 405 N. W. 2d 718, 723 (1987). The Wisconsin Supreme Court reinstated the conviction. Although it agreed
that the State's use of petitioner's post-Miranda silence was
impermissible, the court determined that this error " `was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.' " State v. Brecht, 143

Wis. 2d 297, 317, 421 N. W. 2d 96, 104 (1988) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967)). In finding the
Doyle violation harmless, the court noted that the State's
"improper references to Brecht's silence were infrequent,"
in that they "comprised less than two pages of a 900 page
transcript, or a few minutes in a four day trial in which
twenty-five witnesses testified," and that the State's evidence of guilt was compelling. 143 Wis. 2d, at 317, 421
N. W. 2d, at 104.

Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28
U. S. C. $ 2254, reasserting his Doyle claim. The District
Court agreed that the State's use of petitioner's postMiranda silence violated Doyle, but disagreed with the Wisconsin Supreme Court that this error was harmless beyond
a reasonable doubt, and set aside the conviction. 759
F. Supp. 500 (WD Wis. 1991). The District Court based its
harmless-error determination on its view that the State's evidence of guilt was not "overwhelming," and that the State's
references to petitioner's post-Miranda silence, though "not
extensive," were "crucial" because petitioner's defense
turned on his credibility. Id., at 508. The Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit reversed. It, too, concluded that the
State's references to petitioner's post-Miranda silence violated Doyle, but it disagreed with both the standard that the

inquiry and the result it reached. 944 F. 2d 1363, 1368,1375-1376 (1991).

The Court of Appeals held that the Chapman harmless-error standard does not apply in reviewing Doyle error on
federal habeas. Instead, because of the "prophylactic" na-ture of the

Doyle rule, 944 F. 2d, at 1370, as well as the costsattendant to reversing state convictions on collateral review,

id., at 1373, the Court of Appeals held that the standard fordetermining whether petitioner was entitled to habeas relief
was whether the Doyle violation " `had substantial and inju-rious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict,' "
944 F. 2d, at 1375 (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328U. S., at 776). Applying this standard, the Court of Appeals
concluded that petitioner was not entitled to relief because,"given the many more, and entirely proper, references to
[petitioner's] silence preceding arraignment," he could notcontend with a "straight face" that the State's use of his postMiranda silence had a "substantial and injurious effect" onthe jury's verdict. 944 F. 2d, at 1376.

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between Courtsof Appeals on the question whether the Chapman harmlesserror standard applies on collateral review of Doyle viola-tions, 504 U. S. 972 (1992),

3 and now affirm.

We are the sixth court to pass on the question whether theState's use for impeachment purposes of petitioner's postMiranda silence requires reversal of his murder conviction.Petitioner urges us to even the count, and decide matters in
his favor once and for all. He argues that the Chapmanharmless-error standard applies with equal force on collateral
review of Doyle error. According to petitioner, the need toprevent state courts from relaxing their standards on direct
review of Doyle claims, and the confusion which would ensuewere we to adopt the Kotteakos harmless-error standard on

Opinion of the Court
collateral review, require application of the Chapman stand-ard here. Before considering these arguments, however, we

must first characterize the nature of Doyle error itself.In

Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S., at 619, we held that "the use
for impeachment purposes of [a defendant's] silence, at the
time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, vio-late[s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." This rule "rests on `the fundamental unfairness ofimplicitly assuring a suspect that his silence will not be used
against him and then using his silence to impeach an explana-tion subsequently offered at trial.' "

Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U. S. 284, 291 (1986) (quoting South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 565 (1983)). The "implicit assurance"
upon which we have relied in our Doyle line of cases is the
right-to-remain-silent component of Miranda. Thus, the
Constitution does not prohibit the use for impeachment
purposes of a defendant's silence prior to arrest, Jenkins
v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 239 (1980), or after arrest if no
Miranda warnings are given, Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U. S.
603, 606-607 (1982) (per curiam). Such silence is probative
and does not rest on any implied assurance by law enforcement authorities that it will carry no penalty. See 447 U. S.,
at 239.

This case illustrates the point well. The first time petitioner claimed that the shooting was an accident was when
he took the stand at trial. It was entirely proper--and probative--for the State to impeach his testimony by pointing
out that petitioner had failed to tell anyone before the time
he received his Miranda warnings at his arraignment about
the shooting being an accident. Indeed, if the shooting was
an accident, petitioner had every reason--including to clear
his name and preserve evidence supporting his version of
the events--to offer his account immediately following the
shooting. On the other hand, the State's references to petitioner's silence after that point in time, or more generally
to petitioner's failure to come forward with his version of

Opinion of the Court
events at any time before trial, see n. 2, supra, crossed the
Doyle line. For it is conceivable that, once petitioner had
been given his Miranda warnings, he decided to stand on hisright to remain silent because he believed his silence would

not be used against him at trial.

The Court of Appeals characterized Doyle as "a prophylac-tic rule." 944 F. 2d, at 1370. It reasoned that, since the

need for Doyle stems from the implicit assurance that flowsfrom

Miranda warnings, and "the warnings required by Miranda are not themselves part of the Constitution," "Doyleis . . . a prophylactic rule designed to protect another prophylactic rule from erosion or misuse." Ibid. But Doyle wasnot simply a further extension of the

Miranda prophylactic
rule. Rather, as we have discussed, it is rooted in fundamental fairness and due process concerns. However realthese concerns,

Doyle does not " `overprotec[t]' " them.
Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 209 (1989) (O'Connor,
J., concurring). Under the rationale of Doyle, due process
is violated whenever the prosecution uses for impeachment
purposes a defendant's post-Miranda silence. Doyle thus
does not bear the hallmarks of a prophylactic rule.

Instead, we think Doyle error fits squarely into the category of constitutional violations which we have characterized
as " `trial error.' " See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S.
279, 307 (1991). Trial error "occur[s] during the presentation of the case to the jury," and is amenable to harmlesserror analysis because it "may . . . be quantitatively assessed
in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine [the effect it had on the trial]." Id., at 307-308. At
the other end of the spectrum of constitutional errors lie
"structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism,
which defy analysis by `harmless-error' standards." Id., at
309. The existence of such defects--deprivation of the right
to counsel,4 for example--requires automatic reversal of the

conviction because they infect the entire trial process. Seeid., at 309-310. Since our landmark decision in Chapman

v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), we have applied theharmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in reviewing
claims of constitutional error of the trial type.In

Chapman, we considered whether the prosecution'sreference to the defendants' failure to testify at trial, in

violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,

5 required reversal of their convictions. We

rejected the argument that the Constitution requires a blan-ket rule of automatic reversal in the case of constitutional

error, and concluded instead that "there may be some consti-tutional errors which in the setting of a particular case are
so unimportant and insignificant that they may, consistentwith the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless."

Id.,
at 22. After examining existing harmless-error rules,
including the federal rule (28 U. S. C. $ 2111), we held that"before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless,

the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harm-less beyond a reasonable doubt." 386 U. S., at 24. The
State bears the burden of proving that an error passes mus-ter under this standard.

Chapman reached this Court on direct review, as havemost of the cases in which we have applied its harmlesserror standard. Although we have applied the Chapman
standard in a handful of federal habeas cases, see, e. g., Yatesv.

Evatt, 500 U. S. 391 (1991); Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570
(1986); Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U. S. 371 (1972); Andersonv.

Nelson, 390 U. S. 523 (1968) (per curiam), we have yet
squarely to address its applicability on collateral review.6

6 In Greer v. Miller, 483 U. S. 756 (1987), we granted certiorari to consider the same question presented here but did not reach this question
because we concluded that no Doyle error had occurred in that case. See
483 U. S., at 761, n. 3, 765. But see id., at 768 (Stevens, J., concurring in

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner contends that we are bound by these habeas cases,by way of stare decisis, from holding that the Kotteakos

harmless-error standard applies on habeas review of Doyleerror. But since we have never squarely addressed the
issue, and have at most assumed the applicability of the
Chapman standard on habeas, we are free to addressthe issue on the merits. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S.

651, 670-671 (1974).The federal habeas corpus statute is silent on this point.
It permits federal courts to entertain a habeas petition onbehalf of a state prisoner "only on the ground that he is in
custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties ofthe United States," 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a), and directs simply
that the court "dispose of the matter as law and justice re-quire," $ 2243. The statute says nothing about the standard
for harmless-error review in habeas cases. Respondenturges us to fill this gap with the

Kotteakos standard, underwhich an error requires reversal only if it "had substantial

and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury'sverdict."

Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S., at 776.This standard is grounded in the federal harmless-error statute. 28 U. S. C. $ 2111 ("On the hearing of any appeal orwrit of certiorari in any case, the court shall give judgment
after an examination of the record without regard to errorsor defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the
parties").7 On its face $ 2111 might seem to address the situwhether a federal court should apply a different standard in reviewing
Doyle errors in a habeas corpus action--should be answered in the affirmative") (emphasis in original).

7 In Kotteakos, we construed $ 2111's statutory predecessor, 28 U. S. C.

$ 391 (1925-1926 ed.). Section 391 provided: "On the hearing of any
appeal, certiorari, writ of error, or motion for a new trial, in any case,
civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination of
the entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors,
defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the
parties." In formulating $ 391's harmless-error standard, we focused
on the phrase "affect the substantial rights of the parties," and held

ation at hand, but to date we have limited its application toclaims of nonconstitutional error in federal criminal cases.

See, e. g., United States v. Lane, 474 U. S. 438 (1986).Petitioner asserts that Congress' failure to enact various
proposals since Chapman was decided that would have lim-ited the availability of habeas relief amounts to legislative
disapproval of application of a less stringent harmless-errorstandard on collateral review of constitutional error. Only
one of these proposals merits discussion here. In 1972, a billwas proposed that would have amended 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 to
require habeas petitioners to show that " `a different resultwould probably have obtained if such constitutional violation
had not occurred.' " 118 Cong. Rec. 24936 (1972) (quotingS. 3833, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972)). In response, the Attorney General suggested that the above provision be modifiedto make habeas relief available only where the petitioner
" `suffered a substantial deprivation of his constitutionalrights at his trial.' " 118 Cong. Rec. 24939 (1972) (quoting
letter from Richard G. Kleindienst, Attorney General, toEmanuel Celler, Chairman of the House Committee on the
Judiciary (June 21, 1972)). This language of course parallelsthe federal harmless-error rule. But neither the Attorney
General's suggestion nor the proposed bill itself was everenacted into law.

As a general matter, we are "reluctant to draw inferencesfrom Congress' failure to act."

Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 306 (1988) (citing American TruckingAssns., Inc. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 387 U. S. 397,

that the test was whether the error "had substantial and injurious effect
or influence in determining the jury's verdict." 328 U. S., at 776. Although Congress tinkered with the language of $ 391 when it enacted

$ 2111 in its place in 1949, Congress left untouched the phrase "affect the
substantial rights of the parties." Thus, the enactment of $ 2111 did not
alter the basis for the harmless-error standard announced in Kotteakos.
If anything, Congress' deletion of the word "technical," makes $ 2111 more
amenable to harmless-error review of constitutional violations. Cf.
United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 509-510, n. 7 (1983).

416-418 (1967)); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S.367, 381, n. 11 (1969)). We find no reason to depart from

this rule here. In the absence of any express statutoryguidance from Congress, it remains for this Court to determine what harmless-error standard applies on collateral review of petitioner's Doyle claim. We have filled the gaps ofthe habeas corpus statute with respect to other matters, see,

e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 487 (1991); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81 (1977); Sanders v. United
States, 373 U. S. 1, 15 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293,312-313 (1963), and find it necessary to do so here. As always, in defining the scope of the writ, we look first to the
considerations underlying our habeas jurisprudence, and
then determine whether the proposed rule would advance or
inhibit these considerations by weighing the marginal costs
and benefits of its application on collateral review.

The principle that collateral review is different from direct
review resounds throughout our habeas jurisprudence. See,
e. g., Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 292-293 (1992) (opinion of
Thomas, J.); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 306 (1989) (opinion
of O'Connor, J.); Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 556-
557 (1987); Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 682 (1971)
(Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting
in part). Direct review is the principal avenue for challenging a conviction. "When the process of direct review--
which, if a federal question is involved, includes the right to
petition this Court for a writ of certiorari--comes to an end,
a presumption of finality and legality attaches to the conviction and sentence. The role of federal habeas proceedings,
while important in assuring that constitutional rights are
observed, is secondary and limited. Federal courts are not
forums in which to relitigate state trials." Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983).

In keeping with this distinction, the writ of habeas corpus
has historically been regarded as an extraordinary remedy,
"a bulwark against convictions that violate `fundamental fair507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT

ness.' " Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126 (1982) (quotingWainwright v. Sykes, supra, at 97 (

Stevens, J., concurring))."Those few who are ultimately successful [in obtaining

habeas relief] are persons whom society has grievouslywronged and for whom belated liberation is little enough
compensation." Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 440-441 (1963).See also Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 447 (1986) (plurality opinion) ("The Court uniformly has been guided by theproposition that the writ should be available to afford relief
to those `persons whom society has grievously wronged' inlight of modern concepts of justice") (quoting Fay v. Noia,
supra, at 440-441); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,n. 5 (1979) (

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (Habeascorpus "is designed to guard against extreme malfunctions in

the state criminal justice systems"). Accordingly, it hardlybears repeating that " `an error that may justify reversal on
direct appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attackon a final judgment.' " United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152,
165 (1982) (quoting United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178,184 (1979)).

8

Recognizing the distinction between direct and collateralreview, we have applied different standards on habeas than

would be applied on direct review with respect to mattersother than harmless-error analysis. Our recent retroactivity
jurisprudence is a prime example. Although new rules al-ways have retroactive application to criminal cases on direct
review, Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 320-328 (1987),we have held that they seldom have retroactive application
to criminal cases on federal habeas, Teague v. Lane, supra, at305-310 (opinion of

O'Connor, J.). Other examples aboundthroughout our habeas cases. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v.

8 For instance, we have held that an error of law does not provide a
basis for habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 unless it constitutes " `a
fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of
justice.' " United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 783 (1979) (quoting
Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962)).

Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555-556 (1987) (Although the Constitu-tion guarantees the right to counsel on direct appeal,

Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353, 355 (1963), there is no "rightto counsel when mounting collateral attacks");

United States
v. Frady, supra, at 162-169 (While the federal "plain error"
rule applies in determining whether a defendant may raise aclaim for the first time on direct appeal, the "cause and prejudice" standard applies in determining whether that sameclaim may be raised on habeas);

Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S.
465, 489-496 (1976) (Claims under Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.643 (1961), are not cognizable on habeas as long as the state

courts have provided a full and fair opportunity to litigate
them at trial or on direct review).

The reason most frequently advanced in our cases for distinguishing between direct and collateral review is the
State's interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system. See,
e. g., Wright v. West, supra, at 293 (opinion of Thomas, J.);
McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S., at 491; Wainwright v. Sykes,
433 U. S., at 90. We have also spoken of comity and federalism. "The States possess primary authority for defining
and enforcing the criminal law. In criminal trials they also
hold the initial responsibility for vindicating constitutional
rights. Federal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States' sovereign power to punish offenders
and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights."
Engle v. Isaac, supra, at 128. See also Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 748 (1991); McCleskey, supra, at 491. Finally, we have recognized that "[l]iberal allowance of the
writ . . . degrades the prominence of the trial itself," Engle,
supra, at 127, and at the same time encourages habeas
petitioners to relitigate their claims on collateral review,
see Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 547 (1982) (Stevens, J.,
dissenting).

In light of these considerations, we must decide whether
the same harmless-error standard that the state courts ap507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT
636 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSON

Opinion of the Court
plied on direct review of petitioner's Doyle claim also applies
in this habeas proceeding. We are the sixth court to pass
on the question whether the State's use for impeachment
purposes of petitioner's post-Miranda silence in this case
requires reversal of his conviction. Each court that has reviewed the record has disagreed with the court before it as
to whether the State's Doyle error was "harmless." State
courts are fully qualified to identify constitutional error and
evaluate its prejudicial effect on the trial process under
Chapman, and state courts often occupy a superior vantage
point from which to evaluate the effect of trial error. See
Rushen v. Spain, 464 U. S. 114, 120 (1983) (per curiam).
For these reasons, it scarcely seems logical to require federal habeas courts to engage in the identical approach to
harmless-error review that Chapman requires state courts
to engage in on direct review.

Petitioner argues that application of the Chapman
harmless-error standard on collateral review is necessary to
deter state courts from relaxing their own guard in reviewing constitutional error and to discourage prosecutors from
committing error in the first place. Absent affirmative evidence that state-court judges are ignoring their oath, we
discount petitioner's argument that courts will respond to
our ruling by violating their Article VI duty to uphold the
Constitution. See Robb v. Connolly, 111 U. S. 624, 637
(1884). Federalism, comity, and the constitutional obligation
of state and federal courts all counsel against any presumption that a decision of this Court will "deter" lower federal
or state courts from fully performing their sworn duty. See
Engle, supra, at 128; Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S.
218, 263-265 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring). In any event,
we think the costs of applying the Chapman standard on
federal habeas outweigh the additional deterrent effect, if
any, that would be derived from its application on collateral
review.

Opinion of the Court
Overturning final and presumptively correct convictionson collateral review because the State cannot prove that an

error is harmless under Chapman undermines the States'interest in finality and infringes upon their sovereignty over
criminal matters. Moreover, granting habeas relief merely
because there is a " `reasonable possibility' " that trial errorcontributed to the verdict, see

Chapman v. California, 386
U. S., at 24 (quoting Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U. S. 85, 86(1963)), is at odds with the historic meaning of habeas corpus--to afford relief to those whom society has "grievouslywronged." Retrying defendants whose convictions are set
aside also imposes significant "social costs," including the
expenditure of additional time and resources for all the parties involved, the "erosion of memory" and "dispersion of
witnesses" that accompany the passage of time and make
obtaining convictions on retrial more difficult, and the frustration of "society's interest in the prompt administration of
justice." United States v. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 72 (1986)
(internal quotation marks omitted). And since there is no
statute of limitations governing federal habeas, and the only
laches recognized is that which affects the State's ability to
defend against the claims raised on habeas, retrials following
the grant of habeas relief ordinarily take place much later
than do retrials following reversal on direct review.

The imbalance of the costs and benefits of applying the
Chapman harmless-error standard on collateral review counsels in favor of applying a less onerous standard on habeas
review of constitutional error. The Kotteakos standard, we
believe, fills the bill. The test under Kotteakos is whether
the error "had substantial and injurious effect or influence
in determining the jury's verdict." 328 U. S., at 776.
Under this standard, habeas petitioners may obtain plenary
review of their constitutional claims, but they are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in "actual prejudice." See United
States v. Lane, 474 U. S. 438, 449 (1986). The Kotteakos

507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT
638 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSON

Opinion of the Court
standard is thus better tailored to the nature and purpose of
collateral review and more likely to promote the considerations underlying our recent habeas cases. Moreover, because the Kotteakos standard is grounded in the federal
harmless-error rule, 28 U. S. C. $ 2111, federal courts may
turn to an existing body of case law in applying it. Therefore, contrary to the assertion of petitioner, application of
the Kotteakos standard on collateral review is unlikely to
confuse matters for habeas courts.

For the foregoing reasons, then, we hold that the Kotteakos harmless-error standard applies in determining
whether habeas relief must be granted because of constitutional error of the trial type.9 All that remains to be decided is whether petitioner is entitled to relief under this
standard based on the State's Doyle error. Because the
Court of Appeals applied the Kotteakos standard below, we
proceed to this question ourselves rather than remand the
case for a new harmless-error determination. Cf. Yates v.
Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 407 (1991). At trial, petitioner admitted shooting Hartman, but claimed it was an accident.
The principal question before the jury, therefore, was
whether the State met its burden in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooting was intentional. Our inquiry here is whether, in light of the record as a whole, the
State's improper use for impeachment purposes of petitioner's post-Miranda silence, see n. 2, supra, "had substantial
and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's
verdict." We think it clear that it did not.

9 Our holding does not foreclose the possibility that in an unusual case,
a deliberate and especially egregious error of the trial type, or one that is
combined with a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct, might so infect the
integrity of the proceeding as to warrant the grant of habeas relief, even
if it did not substantially influence the jury's verdict. Cf. Greer v. Miller,
483 U. S. 756, 769 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). We, of
course, are not presented with such a situation here.

The State's references to petitioner's post-Miranda silencewere infrequent, comprising less than two pages of the

900-page trial transcript in this case. And in view of theState's extensive and permissible references to petitioner's
pre-Miranda silence--i. e., his failure to mention anything
about the shooting being an accident to the officer who foundhim in the ditch, the man who gave him a ride to Winona, or

the officers who eventually arrested him--its referencesto petitioner's postMiranda silence were, in effect, cumulative. Moreover, the State's evidence of guilt was, if notoverwhelming, certainly weighty. The path of the bullet

through Mr. Hartman's body was inconsistent with petition-er's testimony that the rifle had discharged as he was falling.
The police officers who searched the Hartmans' home found
nothing in the downstairs hallway that could have caused
petitioner to trip. The rifle was found outside the house
(where Hartman was shot), not inside where petitioner
claimed it had accidently fired, and there was a live round
rammed in the gun's chamber, suggesting that petitioner
had tried to fire a second shot. Finally, other circumstantial
evidence, including the motive proffered by the State, also
pointed to petitioner's guilt.

In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the Doyle error
that occurred at petitioner's trial did not "substantial[ly] . . .
influence" the jury's verdict. Petitioner is therefore not
entitled to habeas relief, and the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Stevens, concurring.
The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the deprivation of
liberty "without due process of law"; that guarantee is the
source of the federal right to challenge state criminal convictions that result from fundamentally unfair trial proceedings.
Neither the term "due process," nor the concept of fundamental unfairness itself, is susceptible of precise and categor507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT

ical definition, and no single test can guarantee that a judgewill grant or deny habeas relief when faced with a similar

set of facts. Every allegation of due process denied dependson the specific process provided, and it is familiar learning
that all "claims of constitutional error are not fungible."
Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 543 (1982) (Stevens, J., dis-senting). As the Court correctly notes, constitutional due

process violations vary dramatically in significance; harmlesstrial errors are at one end of a broad spectrum, and what the
Court has characterized as "structural" defects--those thatmake a trial fundamentally unfair even if they do not affect
the outcome of the proceeding--are at "the other end of the
spectrum," ante, at 629. Although Members of the Court
have disagreed about the seriousness of the due process violation identified in Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (1976), in this
case we unanimously agree that a constitutional violation occurred; moreover, we also all agree that some version of
harmless-error analysis is appropriate.

We disagree, however, about whether the same form of
harmless-error analysis should apply in a collateral attack as
on a direct appeal, and, if not, what the collateral attack
standard should be for an error of this kind. The answer to
the first question follows from our long history of distinguishing between collateral and direct review, see, e. g.,
Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174, 178 (1947), and confining collateral relief to cases that involve fundamental defects or omissions inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure, see, e. g., United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780,
783 (1979), and cases cited therein. The Court answers the
second question by endorsing Justice Rutledge's thoughtful
opinion for the Court in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S.
750 (1946). Ante, at 623, 638. Because that standard accords
with the statutory rule for reviewing other trial errors that
affect substantial rights; places the burden on prosecutors to
explain why those errors were harmless; requires a habeas
court to review the entire record de novo in determining

whether the error influenced the jury's deliberations; and
leaves considerable latitude for the exercise of judgment by
federal courts, I am convinced that our answer is correct.
I write separately only to emphasize that the standard is
appropriately demanding.

As the Court notes, ante, at 631-632, n. 7, the Kotteakos
standard is grounded in the 1919 federal harmless-error statute. Congress had responded to the widespread concern
that federal appellate courts had become "impregnable citadels of technicality," Kotteakos, 328 U. S., at 759, by issuing
a general command to treat error as harmless unless it "is of
such a character that its natural effect is to prejudice a litigant's substantial rights," id., at 760-761. Kotteakos plainly
stated that unless an error is merely "technical," the burden
of sustaining a verdict by demonstrating that the error was
harmless rests on the prosecution.1 A constitutional violation, of course, would never fall in the "technical" category.

Of particular importance, the statutory command requires
the reviewing court to evaluate the error in the context of
the entire trial record. As the Court explained: "In the final
analysis judgment in each case must be influenced by conviction resulting from examination of the proceedings in their
entirety, tempered but not governed in any rigid sense of

1 "It is also important to note that the purpose of the bill in its final
form was stated authoritatively to be `to cast upon the party seeking a
new trial the burden of showing that any technical errors that he may
complain of have affected his substantial rights, otherwise they are to be
disregarded.' H. R. Rep. No. 913, 65th Cong., 3d Sess., 1. But that this
burden does not extend to all errors appears from the statement which
follows immediately. `The proposed legislation affects only technical errors. If the error is of such a character that its natural effect is to prejudice a litigant's substantial rights, the burden of sustaining a verdict will,
notwithstanding this legislation rest upon the one who claims under it.'

States, 323 U. S. 606, 611 [(1945)]." Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S.,

stare decisis by what has been done in similar situations."Id., at 762.

To apply the Kotteakos standard properly, the reviewingcourt must, therefore, make a de novo examination of the
trial record. The Court faithfully engages in such de novoreview today, see

ante, at 638-639, just as the plurality didin the dispositive portion of its analysis in Wright v. West,

505 U. S. 277, 295-297 (1992) (opinion of Thomas, J.). TheKotteakos requirement of de novo review of errors that prejudice substantial rights--as all constitutional errors surelydo--is thus entirely consistent with the Court's longstanding
commitment to the de novo standard of review of mixedquestions of law and fact in habeas corpus proceedings. See
Wright v. West, 505 U. S., at 299-303 (O'Connor, J., concur-ring in judgment).

The purpose of reviewing the entire record is, of course,to consider all the ways that error can infect the course of
a trial. Although The Chief Justice properly quotes thephrase applied to the errors in

Kotteakos (" `substantial andinjurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict' "), ante, at 623, 627, 637, 639, we would misread Kotteakos itself if we endorsed only a single-minded focus onhow the error may (or may not) have affected the jury's verdict. The habeas court cannot ask only whether it thinksthe petitioner would have been convicted even if the constitutional error had not taken place.2 Kotteakos is full ofwarnings to avoid that result. It requires a reviewing court
to decide that "the error did not influence the jury," 328U. S., at 764, and that "the judgment was not substantially
swayed by the error," id., at 765. In a passage that shouldbe kept in mind by all courts that review trial transcripts,
Justice Rutledge wrote that the question is not

"were they [the jurors] right in their judgment, regard-less of the error or its effect upon the verdict. It is

2 "The inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support
the result, apart from the phase affected by the error." Id., at 765.

rather what effect the error had or reasonably may be
taken to have had upon the jury's decision. The crucial
thing is the impact of the thing done wrong on the minds
of other men, not on one's own, in the total setting.

"This must take account of what the error meant to
them, not singled out and standing alone, but in relation
to all else that happened. And one must judge others'
reactions not by his own, but with allowance for how
others might react and not be regarded generally as
acting without reason. This is the important difference, but one easy to ignore when the sense of guilt
comes strongly from the record." Id., at 764 (citations
omitted).

The Kotteakos standard that will now apply on collateral
review is less stringent than the Chapman v. California, 386
U. S. 18 (1967), standard applied on direct review. Given the
critical importance of the faculty of judgment in administering either standard, however, that difference is less significant than it might seem--a point well illustrated by the
differing opinions expressed by The Chief Justice and by
Justice Kennedy in Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279,
302, 313 (1991). While The Chief Justice considered the
admission of the defendant's confession harmless error under
Chapman, see 499 U. S., at 312 (dissenting opinion), Justice
Kennedy's cogent analysis demonstrated that the error
could not reasonably have been viewed as harmless under a
standard even more relaxed than the one we announce today,
see id., at 313-314 (opinion concurring in judgment). In the
end, the way we phrase the governing standard is far less
important than the quality of the judgment with which it
is applied.

Although our adoption of Kotteakos does impose a new
standard in this context, it is a standard that will always
require "the discrimination . . . of judgment transcending
confinement by formula or precise rule. United States v.

U. S., at 761. 3 In my own judgment, for the reasons explained by The Chief Justice, the Doyle error that took
place in petitioner's trial did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.
Accordingly, I concur in the Court's opinion and judgment.

Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,
and with whom Justice Souter joins in part, dissenting.

Assuming that petitioner's conviction was in fact tainted
by a constitutional violation that, while not harmless beyond
a reasonable doubt, did not have "substantial and injurious
effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict," Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 776 (1946), it is undisputed that he would be entitled to reversal in the state
courts on appeal or in this Court on certiorari review. If,
however, the state courts erroneously concluded that no violation had occurred or (as is the case here) that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and supposing further that
certiorari was either not sought or not granted, the majority
would foreclose relief on federal habeas review. As a result
of today's decision, in short, the fate of one in state custody
turns on whether the state courts properly applied the Federal Constitution as then interpreted by decisions of this
Court, and on whether we choose to review his claim on certiorari. Because neither the federal habeas corpus statute
nor our own precedents can support such illogically disparate
treatment, I dissent.

3 Justice Rutledge continued: "That faculty cannot ever be wholly imprisoned in words, much less upon such a criterion as what are only technical, what substantial rights; and what really affects the latter hurtfully.
Judgment, the play of impression and conviction along with intelligence,
varies with judges and also with circumstance. What may be technical
for one is substantial for another; what minor and unimportant in one
setting crucial in another." Id., at 761.

I
A

Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), establishedthe federal nature of the harmless-error standard to be applied when constitutional rights are at stake. Such rights,we stated, are "rooted in the Bill of Rights, offered and
championed in the Congress by James Madison, who told theCongress that the `independent' federal courts would be the
`guardians of those rights.' " Id., at 21 (footnote omitted).Thus,

"[w]hether a conviction for crime should stand when aState has failed to accord federal constitutionally guaranteed rights is every bit as much of a federal question
as what particular federal constitutional provisionsthemselves mean, what they guarantee, and whether

they have been denied. With faithfulness to the consti-tutional union of the States, we cannot leave to the
States the formulation of the authoritative laws, rules,and remedies designed to protect people from infractions by the States of federally guaranteed rights."
Ibid. (emphasis added).

Chapman, it is true, never expressly identified the sourceof this harmless-error standard. But, whether the standard

be characterized as a "necessary rule" of federal law, ibid.,or criticized as a quasi-constitutional doctrine, see

id., at 46,51 (Harlan, J., dissenting), the Court clearly viewed it as

essential to the safeguard of federal constitutional rights.Otherwise, there would have been no justification for imposing the rule on state courts. Cf. id., at 48-51 (Harlan, J.,dissenting). As far as I can tell, the majority does not
question Chapman's vitality on direct review and, therefore,the federal and constitutional underpinnings on which it
rests.That being so, the majority's conclusion is untenable.
Under Chapman, federal law requires reversal of a state

White, J., dissenting
conviction involving a constitutional violation that is notharmless beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant whose

conviction has been upheld despite the occurrence of such aviolation certainly is "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws . . . of the United States," 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a),and therefore is entitled to habeas relief. Although we have
never explicitly held that this was the case, our practice be-fore this day plainly supports this view, as the majority itself
acknowledges. See, e. g., Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 584(1986); see also

ante, at 630. B

The Court justifies its decision by asserting that "collat-eral review is different from direct review," ante, at 633, and
that "we have applied different standards on habeas thanwould be applied on direct review with respect to matters
other than harmless-error analysis," ante, at 634. All told,however, it can only uncover a single example of a constitutional violation that would entitle a state prisoner to reliefon direct, but not on collateral, review. Thus, federal habeas
review is not available to a defendant claiming that the con-viction rests on evidence seized in violation of the Fourth
Amendment, even though such claims remain cognizable instate courts.

Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976). I haveelsewhere stated my reasons for disagreeing with that holding, id., at 536-537 (White, J., dissenting), but today's deci-sion cannot be supported even under

Stone's own terms.
Stone was premised on the view that the exclusionary rule
is not a "personal constitutional right," id., at 486, and thatit "does not exist to remedy any wrong committed against

the defendant, but rather to deter violations of the Fourth
Amendment by law enforcement personnel," Kimmelman v.
Morrison, 477 U. S. 365, 392 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring in
judgment). In other words, one whose conviction rests onevidence obtained in a search or seizure that violated the

Fourth Amendment is deemed not to be unconstitutionally

detained. It is no surprise, then, that the Court of Appealsin this case rested its decision on an analogy between the

rights guaranteed in Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (1976), andthose at issue in Stone. See 944 F. 2d 1363, 1371-1372 (CA7
1991). Doyle, it concluded, "is . . . a prophylactic rule de-signed to protect another prophylactic rule from erosion or
misuse." 944 F. 2d, at 1370.But the Court clearly and, in my view, properly rejects
that view. Indeed, it repeatedly emphasizes that Doyle "isrooted in fundamental fairness and due process concerns,"
that "due process is violated whenever the prosecution usesfor impeachment purposes a defendant's postMiranda si-lence," and that it "does not bear the hallmarks of a prophylactic rule." Ante, at 629. Because the Court likewiseleaves undisturbed the notion that

Chapman's harmless-error standard is required to protect constitutional rights,

see supra, at 645, its conclusion that a Doyle violation thatfails to meet that standard will not trigger federal habeas

relief is inexplicable. II

The majority's decision to adopt this novel approach is farfrom inconsequential. Under Chapman, the State must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the constitutionalerror "did not contribute to the verdict obtained." 386
U. S., at 24. In contrast, the Court now invokes Kotteakosv.

United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946)--a case involving a non-constitutional error of trial procedure--to impose on the defendant the burden of establishing that the error "resulted in`actual prejudice.' "

Ante, at 637. Moreover, although the
Court of Appeals limited its holding to Doyle and other socalled "prophylactic" rules, 944 F. 2d, at 1375, and althoughthe parties' arguments were similarly focused, see Brief for

Respondent 36-37; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16, 19, n. 11, the Court extends its holding to all "constitutional error[s] of the trial type," ante, at 638. Given that

White, J., dissenting
all such "trial errors" are now subject to harmless-erroranalysis, see Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 307-308

(1991), and that "most constitutional errors" are of this vari-ety, id., at 306, the Court effectively has ousted Chapman
from habeas review of state convictions.* In other words, astate court determination that a constitutional error--even
one as fundamental as the admission of a coerced confession,see

Fulminante, supra, at 308--is harmless beyond a rea-sonable doubt has in effect become unreviewable by lower

federal courts by way of habeas corpus.I believe this result to be at odds with the role Congress
has ascribed to habeas review, which is, at least in part, todeter both prosecutors and courts from disregarding their
constitutional responsibilities. "[T]he threat of habeasserves as a necessary additional incentive for trial and appellate courts throughout the land to conduct their proceed-ings in a manner consistent with established constitutional
standards." Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244, 262-263(1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting); see also

Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288, 306 (1989) (plurality opinion). In response, the

majority characterizes review of the Chapman determina-tion by a federal habeas court as "scarcely . . . logical,"

ante,at 636, and, in any event, sees no evidence that deterrence is

needed. Ibid. Yet the logic of such practice is not ours toassess for, as Justice Frankfurter explained:

"Congress could have left the enforcement of federalconstitutional rights governing the administration of
criminal justice in the States exclusively to the Statecourts. These tribunals are under the same duty as the
federal courts to respect rights under the United StatesConstitution. . . . But the wisdom of such a modification
in the law is for Congress to consider . . . ." Brown v.
*As I explained in Fulminante, I have serious doubt regarding the effort to classify in systematic fashion constitutional violations as either
"trial errors"--that are subject to harmlessness analysis--or "structural
defects"--that are not. See 499 U. S., at 290 (White, J., dissenting).

See also Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 10 (1984). As for the"empirical evidence" the majority apparently seeks, I cannot

understand its import. Either state courts are faithful tofederal law, in which case there is no cost in applying the
Chapman as opposed to the Kotteakos standard on collateralreview; or they are not, and it is precisely the role of habeas
corpus to rectify that situation.Ultimately, the central question is whether States may detain someone whose conviction was tarnished by a constitu-tional violation that is not harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt. Chapman dictates that they may not; the majoritysuggests that, so long as direct review has not corrected this
error in time, they may. If state courts remain obliged toapply

Chapman, and in light of the infrequency with whichwe grant certiorari, I fail to see how this decision can be

reconciled with Congress' intent.

III
Our habeas jurisprudence is taking on the appearance of aconfused patchwork in which different constitutional rights

are treated according to their status, and in which the sameconstitutional right is treated differently depending on
whether its vindication is sought on direct or collateral re-view. I believe this picture bears scant resemblance either
to Congress' design or to our own precedents. The Courtof Appeals having yet to apply

Chapman to the facts of thiscase, I would remand to that court for determination of

whether the Doyle violation was harmless beyond a reason-able doubt. I dissent.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
I have no dispute with the Court's observation that "collat-eral review is different from direct review." Ante, at 633.

Just as the federal courts may decline to adjudicate certainissues of federal law on habeas because of prudential concerns, see Withrow v. Williams, post, at 686; post, at 699-700(

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), sotoo may they resolve specific claims on habeas using different

and more lenient standards than those applicable on directreview, see, e. g., Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 299-310

(1989) (habeas claims adjudicated under the law prevailingat time conviction became final and not on the basis of intervening changes of law). But decisions concerning the GreatWrit "warrant restraint,"

Withrow, post, at 700 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), for we oughtnot take lightly alteration of that " `fundamental safeguard

against unlawful custody,' " post, at 697-698 (quoting Fay v.
Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 449 (1963) (Harlan, J., dissenting)).In my view, restraint should control our decision today.

The issue before us is not whether we should remove fromthe cognizance of the federal courts on habeas a discrete prophylactic rule unrelated to the truthfinding function of trial,
as was the case in Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976), andmore recently in

Withrow v. Williams, post, p. 680. Rather,
we are asked to alter a standard that not only finds application in virtually every case of error but that also may becritical to our faith in the reliability of the criminal process.

Because I am not convinced that the principles governingthe exercise of our habeas powers--federalism, finality, and
fairness--counsel against applying Chapman's harmless-error standard on collateral review, I would adhere to our

former practice of applying it to cases on habeas and directreview alike. See

ante, at 630. I therefore respectfully
dissent.The Court begins its analysis with the nature of the constitutional violation asserted, ante, at 628-630, and appropriately so. We long have recognized that the exercise of thefederal courts' habeas powers is governed by equitable principles. Fay v. Noia, supra, at 438; Withrow, post, at 699-700(

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
And the nature of the right at issue is an important equitableconsideration. When a prisoner asserts the violation of a

core constitutional privilege critical to the reliability of the
criminal process, he has a strong claim that fairness favors
review; but if the infringement concerns only a prophylactic
rule, divorced from the criminal trial's truthfinding function,
the prisoner's claim to the equities rests on far shakier
ground. Thus, in Withrow v. Williams, this Court declined
to bar relitigation of Miranda claims on habeas because Miranda is connected to the Fifth Amendment and the Fifth
Amendment, in turn, serves the interests of reliability. Withrow, post, at 691-692. I dissented because I believe that
Miranda is a prophylactic rule that actually impedes the
truthseeking function of criminal trials. Withrow, post, at
700, 701-708. See also Stone v. Powell, supra, at 486, 490
(precluding review of exclusionary rule violations in part because the rule is judicially fashioned and interferes with the
truthfinding function of trial).

Petitioner in this case alleged a violation of Doyle v. Ohio,
426 U. S. 610 (1976), an error the Court accurately characterizes as constitutional trial error. Ante, at 629-630. But the
Court's holding today, it turns out, has nothing to do with
Doyle error at all. Instead, the Court announces that the
harmless-error standard of Chapman v. California, 386 U. S.
18, 24 (1967), which requires the prosecution to prove constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, no longer
applies to any trial error asserted on habeas, whether it is a

Doyle error or not. In Chapman's place, the Court substi-tutes the less rigorous standard of

Kotteakos v. United
States, 328 U. S. 750, 776 (1946). Ante, at 638.A repudiation of the application of

Chapman to all trial
errors asserted on habeas should be justified, if at all, based
on the nature of the Chapman rule itself. Yet, as Justice
White observes, ante, at 645 (dissenting opinion), one
searches the majority opinion in vain for a discussion of thebasis for

Chapman's harmless-error standard. We are left
to speculate whether Chapman is the product of constitu-tional command or a judicial construct that may overprotect

constitutional rights. More important, the majority entirely
fails to discuss the effect of the Chapman rule. If there is
a unifying theme to this Court's habeas jurisprudence, it is
that the ultimate equity on the prisoner's side--the possibility that an error may have caused the conviction of an actually innocent person--is sufficient by itself to permit plenary
review of the prisoner's federal claim. Withrow, post, at 700
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(citing cases). Whatever the source of the Chapman standard, the equities may favor its application on habeas if it
substantially promotes the central goal of the criminal justice system--accurate determinations of guilt and innocence.
See Withrow, post, at 705-706 (reasoning that, although
Miranda may be a prophylactic rule, the fact that it is not
"divorced" from the truthfinding function of trial weighs in
favor of its application on habeas); Teague, supra, at 313 (if
absence of procedure seriously diminishes likelihood of accurate conviction, new rule requiring such procedure may be
retroactively applied on habeas).

In my view, the harmless-error standard often will be inextricably intertwined with the interest of reliability. By
now it goes without saying that harmless-error review is of
almost universal application; there are few errors that may
not be forgiven as harmless. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499
U. S. 279, 306-307 (1991). For example, we have recognized

that a defendant's right to confront the witnesses againsthim is central to the truthfinding function of the criminal

trial. See, e. g., Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845-847(1990);

Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 65 (1980); Mattox v.
United States, 156 U. S. 237, 242-243 (1895); see also 3 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries 373-374 (1768). But Confronta-tion Clause violations are subject to harmless-error review

nonetheless. See Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012, 1021-1022(1988). When such an error is detected, the harmless-error
standard is crucial to our faith in the accuracy of the out-come: The absence of full adversary testing, for example,
cannot help but erode our confidence in a verdict; a jury
easily may be misled by such an omission. Proof of harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt, however, sufficiently restores confidence in the verdict's reliability that the conviction may stand despite the potentially accuracy impairing
error. Such proof demonstrates that, even though the error
had the potential to induce the jury to err, in fact there is no
reasonable possibility that it did. Rather, we are confident
beyond a reasonable doubt that the error had no influence on
the jury's judgment at all. Cf. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,
363-364 (1970) (proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt indispensable to community's respect and confidence in criminal process).

At least where errors bearing on accuracy are at issue,
I am not persuaded that the Kotteakos standard offers an
adequate assurance of reliability. Under the Court's holding
today, federal courts on habeas are barred from offering
relief unless the error " `had substantial and injurious effect
or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' " Ante, at 637
(quoting Kotteakos, supra, at 776). By tolerating a greater
probability that an error with the potential to undermine
verdict accuracy was harmful, the Court increases the likelihood that a conviction will be preserved despite an error that
actually affected the reliability of the trial. Of course, the
Constitution does not require that every conceivable precau507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT
654 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSON

O'Connor, J., dissenting
tion in favor of reliability be taken; and certainly 28 U. S. C.$ 2254 does not impose such an obligation on its own. Indeed, I agree with the Court that habeas relief under $ 2254is reserved for those prisoners "whom society has `grievously
wronged.' " Ante, at 637. But prisoners who may have
been convicted mistakenly because of constitutional trialerror

have suffered a grievous wrong and ought not be required to bear the greater risk of uncertainty the Court nowimposes upon them. Instead, where constitutional error

may have affected the accuracy of the verdict, on habeas weshould insist on such proof as will restore our faith in the
verdict's accuracy to a reasonable certainty. Adherence to
the standard enunciated in Chapman requires no more; and
the equities require no less.

To be sure, the harmless-error inquiry will not always bear
on reliability. If the trial error being reviewed for harmlessness is not itself related to the interest of accuracy, neither is the harmless-error standard. Accordingly, in theory
it would be neither illogical nor grudging to reserve Chapman for errors related to the accuracy of the verdict, applying Kotteakos' more lenient rule whenever the error is of a
type that does not impair confidence in the trial's result.
But the Court draws no such distinction. On the contrary,
it holds Kotteakos applicable to all trial errors, whether related to reliability or not. The Court does offer a glimmer
of hope by reserving in a footnote the possibility of an exception: Chapman may remain applicable, it suggests, in
some "unusual" cases. But the Court's description of those
cases suggests that its potential exception would be both exceedingly narrow and unrelated to reliability concerns. See
ante, at 638, n. 9 (reserving the "possibility that in an unusual case, a deliberate and especially egregious error of the
trial type" or error "combined with a pattern of prosecutorial
misconduct, might so infect the integrity of the proceeding
as to warrant the grant of habeas relief, even it did not substantially influence the jury's verdict").

O'Connor, J., dissenting
But even if the Court's holding were limited to errors di-vorced from reliability concerns, the decision nevertheless

would be unwise from the standpoint of judicial administra-tion. Like

Justice White, I do not believe we should turn
our habeas jurisprudence into a "patchwork" of rules and exceptions without strong justification. Ante, at 649 (dissent-ing opinion). The interest of efficiency, always relevant to

the scope of habeas relief, see, e. g., Stone, 428 U. S., at 491,n. 31;

Withrow, post, at 693-694; post, at 708-713 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), favors simpli-fication of legal inquiries, not their multiplication. A rule requiring the courts to distinguish between errors that affect
accuracy and those that do not, however, would open up a
whole new frontier for litigation and decision. In each case,
the litigants would brief and federal judges would be required
to decide whether the particular error asserted relates to accuracy. Given the number of constitutional rules we have recognized and the virtually limitless ways in which they might
be transgressed, I cannot imagine that the benefits brought
by such litigation could outweigh the costs it would impose.

In fact, even on its own terms the Court's decision buys
the federal courts a lot of trouble. From here on out, prisoners undoubtedly will litigate--and judges will be forced to
decide--whether each error somehow might be wedged into
the narrow potential exception the Court mentions in a footnote today. Moreover, since the Court only mentions the
possibility of an exception, all concerned must also address
whether the exception exists at all. I see little justification
for imposing these novel and potentially difficult questions
on our already overburdened justice system.

Nor does the majority demonstrate that the Kotteakos
standard will ease the burden of conducting harmless-error
review in those cases to which it does apply. Indeed, as Justice Stevens demonstrates in his concurrence, Kotteakos is
unlikely to lighten the load of the federal judiciary at all.
The courts still must review the entire record in search of

507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT
656 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSON

O'Connor, J., dissenting
conceivable ways the error may have influenced the jury;they still must conduct their review

de novo; and they still
must decide whether they have sufficient confidence that theverdict would have remained unchanged even if the error

had not occurred. See ante, at 641-642. The only thing the
Court alters today is the degree of confidence that suffices.But

Kotteakos' threshold is no more precise than Chapman's;
each requires an exercise of judicial judgment that cannotbe captured by the naked words of verbal formulae.

Kotteakos, it is true, is somewhat more lenient; it will permitmore errors to pass uncorrected. But that simply reduces

the number of cases in which relief will be granted. It does
not decrease the burden of identifying those cases that warrant relief.

Finally, the majority considers the costs of habeas review
generally. Ante, at 637. Once again, I agree that those
costs--the effect on finality, the infringement on state sovereignty, and the social cost of requiring retrial, sometimes
years after trial and at a time when a new trial has become
difficult or impossible--are appropriate considerations. See
Withrow, post, at 703-704 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part); see also post, at 686-687, 708-709;
Stone, supra, at 489-491. But the Court does not explain
how those costs set the harmless-error inquiry apart from
any other question presented on habeas; such costs are inevitable whenever relief is awarded. Unless we are to accept
the proposition that denying relief whenever possible is an
unalloyed good, the costs the Court identifies cannot by
themselves justify the lowering of standards announced
today. The majority, of course, does not contend otherwise;
instead, it adheres to our traditional approach of distinguishing between those claims that are worthy of habeas relief
and those that, for prudential and equitable reasons, are not.
Nonetheless, it seems to me that the Court's decision cuts
too broadly and deeply to comport with the equitable and
remedial nature of the habeas writ; it is neither justified nor

CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. EASTERWOOD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-790. Argued January 12, 1993--Decided April 21, 1993*
After her husband was killed when a train owned and operated by CSX

Transportation, Inc., collided with his truck at a Georgia crossing, Lizzie
Easterwood brought this diversity wrongful-death action, alleging,
inter alia, that CSX was negligent under Georgia law for failing to
maintain adequate warning devices at the crossing and for operating
the train at an excessive speed. The District Court granted summary
judgment for CSX on the ground that both claims were pre-empted
under the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA). The Court of
Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the allegation based on the train's speed was pre-empted but that the claim based
on the absence of proper warning devices was not.

Held: Under the FRSA, federal regulations adopted by the Secretary of

Transportation pre-empt Easterwood's negligence action only insofar
as it asserts that CSX's train was traveling at an excessive speed.
Pp. 661-676.

(a) The FRSA permits the States to "adopt or continue in force any
law, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad safety until
such time as the Secretary has adopted a . . . regulation . . . covering
the subject matter of such State requirement," and, even thereafter, to
adopt safety standards more stringent than the federal requirements
"when necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety hazard," if those standards are compatible with federal law and do not
unduly burden interstate commerce. 45 U. S. C. $ 434. Legal duties
imposed on railroads by a State's common law of negligence fall within
the scope of $ 434's broad phrases describing matters "relating to railroad safety." The section's term "covering" indicates that pre-emption
will lie only if the federal regulations substantially subsume the subject
matter of the relevant state law. Pp. 661-665.

(b) The Secretary's grade crossing safety regulations do not "cove[r]
the subject matter" of Easterwood's warning devices claim. In light of
the relatively stringent standard set by $ 434's language and the pre*Together with No. 91-1206, Easterwood v. CSX Transportation, Inc.,
also on certiorari to the same court.

sumption against pre-emption, the regulations of 23 CFR pt. 924 cannot
be said to support pre-emption. They merely establish the general
terms under which States may use federal aid to eliminate highway
hazards, including those at grade crossings, and provide no explicit indication of their effect on negligence law, which often has assigned joint
responsibility for maintaining safe crossings to railroads and States.
Likewise, pre-emption is not established by 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(1)'s requirement that the States comply with the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices for Streets and Highways (Manual) and by that Manual's declaration that the States determine the need for, and type of,
safety devices to be installed at a grade crossing. It is implausible that
established state negligence law would be implicitly displaced by an
elliptical reference in a Government Manual otherwise devoted to describing for the benefit of state employees the proper size, color, and
shape of traffic signs and signals. Moreover, the Manual itself disavows
any claim to cover the subject matter of the tort law of grade crossings.
Finally, although 23 CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) do displace state decisionmaking authority by requiring particular warning devices at grade
crossings for certain federally funded projects, those regulations are
inapplicable here because a plan to install such devices at the crossing
at issue was shelved and the federal funds allocated for the project diverted elsewhere. Pp. 665-673.

(c) Easterwood's excessive speed claim cannot stand in light of the
Secretary's adoption of the regulations in 49 CFR $ 213.9(a). Although,
on their face, $ 213.9(a)'s provisions address only the maximum speeds
at which trains are permitted to travel given the nature of the track on
which they operate, the overall structure of the Secretary's regulations
demonstrates that these speed limits were adopted with safety concerns
in mind and should be understood as "covering the subject matter" in
question. It is irrelevant that the Secretary's primary purpose in enacting the speed limits may have been to prevent derailments, since

$ 434 does not call for an inquiry into purpose. Moreover, because the
common-law speed restrictions relied on by Easterwood are concerned
with local hazards only in the sense that their application depends on
each case's facts, those restrictions are not preserved by $ 434's second
saving clause. Pp. 673-675.

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
Thomas Easterwood was killed on February 24, 1988when a train owned and operated by petitioner and crossrespondent CSX Transportation, Inc., collided with the truckhe was driving at the Cook Street crossing in Cartersville,
Georgia. His widow, respondent and cross-petitioner LizzieEasterwood, brought this diversity wrongful-death action,
which alleges, inter alia, that CSX was negligent underGeorgia law for failing to maintain adequate warning devices
at the crossing and for operating the train at an excessivespeed. The issue before the Court is the extent to which
the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat.971, as amended, 45 U. S. C. $$ 421-447 (1988 ed. and Supp.
II), pre-empts these claims.The District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
granted summary judgment for CSX on the ground that bothclaims were pre-empted. 742 F. Supp. 676, 678 (1990). The
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in partand reversed in part, holding that respondent's allegation of
negligence based on the train's speed was pre-empted, butthat the claim based on the absence of proper warning devices was not. 933 F. 2d 1548, 1553-1556 (1991). BecauseCourts of Appeals have differed over the pre-emptive effect
of FRSA on negligence suits against railroads, we grantedthe petitions of both parties. 505 U. S. 1217 (1992).

FRSA was enacted in 1970 "to promote safety in all areas

Opinion of the Court
the Act specifically directs the Secretary of Transportationto study and develop solutions to safety problems posed by

grade crossings. $ 433. In addition, the Secretary is givenbroad powers to "prescribe, as necessary, appropriate rules,
regulations, orders, and standards for all areas of railroad
safety . . . ." $ 431(a). The pre-emptive effect of these reg-ulations is governed by $ 434, which contains express saving

and pre-emption clauses.2 Thus, the States are permittedto "adopt or continue in force any law, rule, regulation, order,
or standard relating to railroad safety until such time as theSecretary has adopted a rule, regulation, order, or standard
covering the subject matter of such State requirement."Even after federal standards have been promulgated, the
States may adopt more stringent safety requirements "whennecessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety
hazard," if those standards are "not incompatible with" federal laws or regulations and not an undue burden on interstate commerce.

In 1971, the Secretary, acting through the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), promulgated regulations under
FRSA setting maximum train speeds for different classes of
track. See 49 CFR $ 213.9 (1992). Also in 1971, and again
in 1972, the Secretary duly reported to Congress on the

subject matter of such State requirement. A State may adopt or continue
in force an additional or more stringent law, rule, regulation, order, or

problem of grade crossings and on possible solutions.3 Con-gress responded by enacting the Highway Safety Act of 1973,

Title II of the Act of Aug. 13, 1973, 87 Stat. 282, as amended,note following 23 U. S. C. $ 130. This Act makes federal
funds available to the States to improve grade crossings, inreturn for which the States must "conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify those rail-road crossings which may require separation, relocation, or
protective devices, and establish and implement a scheduleof projects for this purpose." 23 U. S. C. $ 130(d). Further
conditions on the States' use of federal aid to improve gradecrossings have been set out in regulations promulgated by
the Secretary through the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) under FRSA and the Highway Safety Act. See 23
CFR pts. 646, 655, 924, 1204 (1992). It is petitioner's conten-tion that the Secretary's speed and grade crossing regulations "cove[r] the subject matter" of, and therefore pre-empt,the state law on which respondent relies.

4

Where a state statute conflicts with, or frustrates, federallaw, the former must give way. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2;

Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981). In the

3 See U. S. Dept. of Transportation, Railroad-Highway Safety, Part I: A
Comprehensive Statement of the Problem (1971); U. S. Dept. of Transportation, Railroad-Highway Safety, Part II: Recommendations for Resolving
the Problem (1972).

4 The Court of Appeals found that, because the grade crossing regulations were promulgated pursuant to the Highway Safety Act (rather than
FRSA), their pre-emptive effect is not governed by $ 434. 933 F. 2d 1548,
1555 (CA11 1991). As petitioner notes, this distinction does not apply to
23 CFR pts. 646 and 1204, which were promulgated under the authority
of both statutes. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 91-790, p. 36. In any
event, the plain terms of $ 434 do not limit the application of its express
pre-emption clause to regulations adopted by the Secretary pursuant to
FRSA. Instead, they state that any regulation "adopted" by the Secretary may have pre-emptive effect, regardless of the enabling legislation.
At the very least, the Court of Appeals' conclusion is inappropriate with
respect to regulations issued under 23 U. S. C. $ 130, given that the latter
is a direct outgrowth of FRSA.

Opinion of the Court
interest of avoiding unintended encroachment on the author-ity of the States, however, a court interpreting a federal

statute pertaining to a subject traditionally governed bystate law will be reluctant to find pre-emption. Thus, preemption will not lie unless it is "the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Evidence of pre-emptive purpose is

sought in the text and structure of the statute at issue.
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 95 (1983). If the
statute contains an express pre-emption clause, the task ofstatutory construction must in the first instance focus on the

plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the
best evidence of Congress' pre-emptive intent.

According to $ 434, applicable federal regulations may preempt any state "law, rule, regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad safety." Legal duties imposed on railroads
by the common law fall within the scope of these broad
phrases. Cf. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504,
522 (1992) (federal statute barring additional " `requirement[s]' . . . `imposed under State law' " pre-empts commonlaw claims); id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (same). Thus, the issue
before the Court is whether the Secretary of Transportation
has issued regulations covering the same subject matter as
Georgia negligence law pertaining to the maintenance of, and
the operation of trains at, grade crossings. To prevail on the
claim that the regulations have pre-emptive effect, petitioner
must establish more than that they "touch upon" or "relate
to" that subject matter, cf. Morales v. Trans World Airlines,
Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 383-384 (1992) (statute's use of "relating
to" confers broad pre-emptive effect), for "covering" is a
more restrictive term which indicates that pre-emption will
lie only if the federal regulations substantially subsume the
subject matter of the relevant state law. See Webster's
Third New International Dictionary 524 (1961) (in the phrase
"policy clauses covering the situation," cover means "to com507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
prise, include, or embrace in an effective scope of treatmentor operation"). The term "covering" is in turn employed

within a provision that displays considerable solicitude forstate law in that its express pre-emption clause is both prefaced and succeeded by express saving clauses. See supra,at 662.

II
After filing an answer denying the allegations of negli-gence with respect to the warning devices at Cook Street

and with respect to the train's speed, petitioner moved forsummary judgment on the ground that these claims were
pre-empted. As the litigation comes to us, petitioner doesnot assert that the complaint fails to state a claim under
Georgia law. The sole issue here is pre-emption, which de-pends on whether the regulations issued by the Secretary
cover the subject matter of the two allegations, each of whichwe may assume states a valid cause of action.

5

As indicated above, the Secretary of Transportation hasaddressed grade crossing safety through a series of regulations. Each State receiving federal aid is required toestablish a "highway safety improvement program" that establishes priorities for addressing all manner of highwayhazards and guides the implementation and evaluation of

5 Because the litigation comes to us in this posture, neither party provides a description of Georgia statute or case law dealing with train
speeds or the duties of railroads with respect to grade crossings. However, we note that Georgia Code Ann. $ 32-6-190 (1991) provides that
railroads are under a duty to maintain their grade crossings "in such condition as to permit the safe and convenient passage of public traffic."
While final authority for the installation of particular safety devices at
grade crossings has long rested with state and local governments, see,
e. g., $ 40-6-25, this allocation of authority apparently does not relieve the
railroads of their duty to take all reasonable precautions to maintain grade
crossing safety, Southern R. Co. v. Georgia Kraft Co., 188 Ga. App. 623,
624, 373 S. E. 2d 774, 776 (1988), including, for example, identifying and
bringing to the attention of the relevant authorities dangers posed by
particular crossings.

States are subject to further regulations governingthe use of particular warning devices. For all projects,
they must employ devices that conform to standards setout in FHWA's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD or Manual).7$$ 646.214(b)(1), 655.603. In addition, for projects that involve grade crossings "located within the limits of or nearthe terminus of a Federal-aid highway project for construction of a new highway or improvement of [an] existing road-way," see $ 646.214(b)(2), or in which "Federal-aid funds
participate in the installation of the [warning] devices,"regulations specify warning devices that must be installed.
See $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4). Thus, States must employ auto-matic gates with flashing light signals as part of any improvement project that concerns a crossing that features,inter alia, multiple tracks, high speed trains operating
in areas of limited visibility, heavy vehicle or train traffic,or if a diagnostic team made up of "representatives of the
parties of interest in [the crossing]," $ 646.204(g), recom-mends them.

The regulations of 23 CFR pt. 924 do not of themselvessupport petitioner's claim of pre-emption. These provisions

establish the general terms of the bargain between the Fed-eral and State Governments: The States may obtain federal
funds if they take certain steps to ensure that the funds areefficiently spent. On its face, this federal effort to encourage the States to rationalize their decisionmaking has littleto say about the subject matter of negligence law, because,
with respect to grade crossing safety, the responsibilities of
railroads and the State are, and traditionally have been,quite distinct. Before the enactment of FRSA, for example,

Georgia's authority over grade crossing improvements did
not excuse a railroad's liability in negligence for failing to
maintain a safe crossing, see n. 5, supra, just as a jury finding

to include automatic gates with flashing light signals when one or more of
the following conditions exist:

"(A) Multiple main line railroad tracks.
"(B) Multiple tracks at or in the vicinity of the crossing which may be
occupied by a train or locomotive so as to obscure the movement of another
train approaching the crossing.

"(C) High Speed train operation combined with limited sight distance at
either single or multiple track crossings.

"(D) A combination of high speeds and moderately high volumes of highway and railroad traffic.

"(E) Either a high volume of vehicular traffic, high number of train
movements, substantial numbers of schoolbuses or trucks carrying hazardous materials, unusually restricted sight distance, continuing accident
occurrences, or any combination of these conditions.

"(F) A diagnostic team recommends them.
"(ii) In individual cases where a diagnostic team justifies that gates are
not appropriate, FHWA may find that the above requirements are not
applicable."

For the definition of "diagnostic team," see 23 CFR $ 646.204(g) (1992).

668 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. EASTERWOOD

Opinion of the Court
of railroad negligence bore no particular significance on theState's safety efforts beyond that which the State wished

to give it. Certainly there is no explicit indication in theregulations of 23 CFR pt. 924 that the terms of the Federal
Government's bargain with the States require modificationof this regime of separate spheres of responsibility. And,
contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals for the TenthCircuit, it does not necessarily follow that "[t]he hit-or-miss
common law method runs counter to a statutory scheme ofplanned prioritization."

Hatfield v. Burlington NorthernR. Co., 958 F. 2d 320, 324 (1992). In fact, the scheme of negligence liability could just as easily complement these regula-tions by encouraging railroads--the entities arguably most
familiar with crossing conditions--to provide current andcomplete information to the state agency responsible for determining priorities for improvement projects in accordancewith $ 924.9. In light of the relatively stringent standard
set by the language of $ 434 and the presumption against pre-emption, and given that the regulations provide no affirmative indication of their effect on negligence law, we are notprepared to find pre-emption solely on the strength of the
general mandates of 23 CFR pt. 924.Likewise, the requirement that the States comply with the
MUTCD does not cover the subject matter of the tort law ofgrade crossings. Petitioner's contrary reading rests primarily on language that appears in Part VIII of the Manual,entitled "Traffic Control Systems for Railroad-Highway
Grade Crossings":

"[T]he highway agency and the railroad company areentitled to jointly occupy the right-of-way in the conduct

of their assigned duties. This requires joint responsi-bility in the traffic control function between the public
agency and the railroad. The determination of needand selection of devices at a grade crossing is made by
the public agency with jurisdictional authority. Subjectto such determination and selection, the design, installa507us3$58D 11-20-96 18:59:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion and operation shall be in accordance with the national standards contained herein." Manual, at 8A-1.9

According to petitioner, the third sentence of this paragraph,
combined with the directive in 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(1) that
the States comply with the Manual, amounts to a determination by the Secretary that state governmental bodies shall
bear exclusive responsibility for grade crossing safety.

Petitioner's argument suffers from an initial implausibility:
It asserts that established state negligence law has been implicitly displaced by means of an elliptical reference in a Government Manual otherwise devoted to describing for the
benefit of state employees the proper size, color, and shape
of traffic signs and signals. Not surprisingly, the Manual
itself disavows any such pretensions: "It is the intent that
the provisions of this Manual be standards for traffic control
devices installation, but not a legal requirement for installation." Manual, at 1A-4. The language on which petitioner
relies undermines rather than supports its claim by acknowledging that the States must approve the installation of any
protective device even as the railroads maintain "joint responsibility" for traffic safety at crossings. As is made clear
in the FHWA's guide to the Manual, the MUTCD provides a
description of, rather than a prescription for, the allocation
of responsibility for grade crossing safety between the
Federal and State Governments and between States and
railroads:

9 Petitioner also notes similar language contained in the Manual, at
8D-1:

"The selection of traffic control devices at a grade crossing is determined by public agencies having jurisdictional responsibility at specific
locations.. . . . .

". . . Before a new or modified grade crossing traffic control system
is installed, approval is required from the appropriate agency within a
given State."

Opinion of the Court
"8A-6 Grade-Crossing Responsibility
"Jurisdiction"Jurisdiction over railroad-highway crossings resides

almost exclusively in the States. Within some States,responsibility is frequently divided among several public
agencies and the railroad." U. S. Dept. of Transporta-tion, Federal Highway Administration, Traffic Control
Devices Handbook (1983).
Rather than establishing an alternative scheme of duties in-compatible with existing Georgia negligence law, the Manual

disavows any claim to cover the subject matter of that bodyof law.

The remaining potential sources of pre-emption are theprovisions of 23 CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4), which, unlike
the foregoing provisions, do establish requirements as to theinstallation of particular warning devices. Examination of
these regulations demonstrates that, when they are applica-ble, state tort law is pre-empted. However, petitioner has
failed to establish that the regulations apply to these cases,and hence we find respondent's grade crossing claim is not
pre-empted.As discussed supra, at 666-667, under $$ 646.214(b)(3)
and (4), a project for the improvement of a grade crossingmust either include an automatic gate or receive FHWA
approval if federal funds "participate in the installa-tion of the [warning] devices."

10 Thus, unlike the Manual,

$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) displace state and private decision-making authority by establishing a federal-law requirement that certain protective devices be installed or fed-eral approval obtained. Indeed, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4)
effectively set the terms under which railroads are to partici-pate in the improvement of crossings. The former section

10 As petitioner has not suggested that the Cook Street crossing is located in, or near the terminus of, a federal-aid highway project, the issue
of the proper application of 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(2) (1992) is not before us.

Opinion of the Court
envisions railroad involvement in the selection of warn-ing devices through their participation in diagnostic teams

which may recommend the use or nonuse of crossing gates.$$ 646.214(b)(3)(i)(F) and (3)(ii). Likewise, $ 646.214(b)(4),
which covers federally funded installations at crossings that
do not feature multiple tracks, heavy traffic, or the like, ex-plicitly notes that railroad participation in the initial determination of "the type of warning device to be installed" atparticular crossings is subject to the Secretary's approval.
In either case, the Secretary has determined that the rail-roads shall not be made to pay any portion of installation
costs. $ 646.210(b)(1). In short, for projects in which federal funds participate in the installation of warning devices,
the Secretary has determined the devices to be installed and
the means by which railroads are to participate in their selection. The Secretary's regulations therefore cover the subject matter of state law which, like the tort law on which
respondent relies, seeks to impose an independent duty on a
railroad to identify and/or repair dangerous crossings.

The remaining question with respect to respondent's grade
crossing claim is whether the preconditions for the application of either regulation have been met. A review of the
record reveals that they have not. Petitioner relies on an
affidavit from an engineer for the Georgia Department of
Transportation (DOT) which was submitted in support of its
motion for summary judgment. The affidavit indicates that,
in 1979-1980, the DOT decided to install a crossing gate at
the West Avenue crossing in Cartersville. That gate could
not be installed, however, without placing motion-detection
devices at four adjacent crossings, including Cook Street.
App. 16. The DOT therefore installed new circuitry at each
crossing, and subsequently installed gates at West Avenue
and each of the adjacent crossings except Cook Street. Although a gate was also planned for Cook Street and funds
set aside for the project, no other devices were installed because the street's width required the construction of a traffic

Opinion of the Court
island, which in turn required city approval. When the citydeclined to approve the island out of concern for the flow of

vehicular traffic, the plan for the gate was shelved and thefunds allocated for use in another project.

These facts do not establish that federal funds "partici-pate[d] in the installation of the [warning] devices" at Cook
Street. The only equipment installed was the motion-detection circuitry. Such circuitry does not meet the definition of warning devices provided in 23 CFR $$ 646.204(i) and( j) (1992).

11 Petitioner nevertheless contends that the Cook

Street crossing was part of a single project to improve thefive Cartersville crossings, and that the regulations were applicable because federal funds participated in the installationof gates at the other four crossings. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 91-790, p. 20. Neither party identifies anystatutory or regulatory provisions defining the term "project," although some usages cast doubt on petitioner's view.See, e. g., 23 CFR $ 646.210(c)(3) (describing the elimination
of "a grade crossing" as "the . . . project"). Even if the termcould be construed to include either individual or multiple
crossing projects, it is clear that the Georgia DOT treatedthe installation of warning devices at West Avenue and Cook
Street as distinct projects. Respondent's own affiant statesthat the cost of the motion detector installed at Cook Street
"was included in the estimated costs proposal prepared . . .for the West Avenue crossing improvements . . . ." App. 17.

11 The relevant definitions state:
"(i) Passive warning devices means those types of traffic control devices, including signs, markings and other devices, located at or in advance
of grade crossings to indicate the presence of a crossing but which do not
change aspect upon the approach or presence of a train.

"(j) Active warning devices means those traffic control devices activated
by the approach or presence of a train, such as flashing light signals, automatic gates and similar devices, as well as manually operated devices and
crossing watchmen, all of which display to motorists positive warning
of the approach or presence of a train." 23 CFR $$ 646.204(i) and (j)
(emphases added).

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, as found by the District Court, when Cartersville
scotched the plans for the Cook Street gate, "the funds earmarked for this crossing were . . . transferred to other projects. The decision to install gate arms at the Cook Street
crossing was placed on a list of projects to be considered at
a later time." 742 F. Supp., at 678. In light of the inapplicability of $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) to these cases, we conclude
that respondent's grade crossing claim is not pre-empted.12

III
Federal regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to
FRSA and codified at 49 CFR $ 213.9(a) (1992) set maximum
allowable operating speeds for all freight and passenger
trains for each class of track on which they travel. The different classes of track are in turn defined by, inter alia, their
gage, alinement, curvature, surface uniformity, and the number of crossties per length of track. See $$ 213.51-213.143.
The track at the Cook Street crossing is class four, for which
the maximum speed is 60 miles per hour. Although respondent concedes that petitioner's train was traveling at
less than 60 miles per hour,13 she nevertheless contends that
petitioner breached its common-law duty to operate its train
at a moderate and safe rate of speed. See, e. g., Central of
Georgia R. Co. v. Markert, 200 Ga. App. 851, 852; 410 S. E. 2d
437, 438, cert. denied, 200 Ga. App. 895 (1991). Petitioner
contends that this claim is pre-empted because the federal
speed limits are regulations covering the subject matter of
the common law of train speed.

12 We reject petitioner's claim of implied "conflict" pre-emption, Brief
for Petitioner in No. 91-790, pp. 40-43, on the basis of the preceding analysis. Of course we express no opinion on how the state-law suit against
the railroad should come out in light of the decisions taken by Cartersville
and the Georgia DOT with respect to the Cook Street project.

13 Affidavits submitted by the parties indicate that the train was moving

at a rate of 32 to 50 miles per hour.

674 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. EASTERWOOD

Opinion of the Court
On their face, the provisions of $ 213.9(a) address only themaximum speeds at which trains are permitted to travel

given the nature of the track on which they operate. Never-theless, related safety regulations adopted by the Secretary
reveal that the limits were adopted only after the hazardsposed by track conditions were taken into account. Understood in the context of the overall structure of the regula-tions, the speed limits must be read as not only establishing
a ceiling, but also precluding additional state regulation ofthe sort that respondent seeks to impose on petitioner.

Because the conduct of the automobile driver is the majorvariable in grade crossing accidents, and because trains offer
far fewer opportunities for regulatory control, the safety reg-ulations established by the Secretary concentrate on providing clear and accurate warnings of the approach of oncomingtrains to drivers.

14 Accordingly, the Secretary's regulations

focus on providing appropriate warnings given variations intrain speed. The MUTCD, for example, requires the installation at grade crossings of signaling devices that provideuniform periods of advance notice regardless of train speed.
Manual, at 8C-7. Likewise, as discussed supra, at 666, auto-matic gates are required for federally funded projects affecting crossings over which trains travel at high speeds. 23CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3)(C) and (D). Further support for the
view that the limits in $ 213.9(a) were set with safety con-cerns already in mind is found in $ 213.9(c). Under that
section, railroads may petition for permission from the Rail14 See U. S. Dept. of Transportation, Railroad-Highway Safety, Part I: A
Comprehensive Statement of the Problem iv (1971) ("Nearly all grade
crossing accidents can be said to be attributable to some degree of `driver
error.' Thus, any effective program for improving [crossing] safety
should be oriented around the driver and his needs in approaching, traversing, and leaving the crossing site as safely and efficiently as possible");
see also U. S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Rail-Highway Crossings Study 8-1 (1989) ("[T]he most influential
predictors of train-vehicle accidents at rail-highway crossings are type of
warning devices installed, highway traffic volumes, and train volumes.
Less influential, but sometimes significant [is] maximum train speed . . .").

Opinion of the Court
road Administrator to operate in excess of the maximumspeed limit of 110 miles per hour, but only upon submission

of information pertaining to the signals, grade crossing pro-tections, and other devices that will allow safe operation.

Read against this background, $ 213.9(a) should be under-stood as covering the subject matter of train speed with respect to track conditions, including the conditions posed bygrade crossings. Respondent nevertheless maintains that
pre-emption is inappropriate because the Secretary's pri-mary purpose in enacting the speed limits was not to ensure
safety at grade crossings, but rather to prevent derailments.Section 434 does not, however, call for an inquiry into the
Secretary's purposes, but instead directs the courts to deter-mine whether regulations have been adopted that in fact
cover the subject matter of train speed. Respondent alsoargues that common-law speed restrictions are preserved by
the second saving clause of $ 434, under which "a State may. . . continue in force an additional or more stringent law . . .
relating to railroad safety when necessary to eliminate orreduce an essentially local safety hazard, and when not incompatible with any Federal law, rule, regulation, order, orstandard . . . ." The state law on which respondent relies is
concerned with local hazards only in the sense that its appli-cation turns on the facts of each case. The common law of
negligence provides a general rule to address all hazardscaused by lack of due care, not just those owing to unique
local conditions. Respondent's contrary view would com-pletely deprive the Secretary of the power to pre-empt state
common law, a power clearly conferred by $ 434. At theleast, this renders respondent's reliance on the common law
"incompatible with" FRSA and the Secretary's regulations.We thus conclude that respondent's excessive speed claim
cannot stand in light of the Secretary's adoption of the regu-lations in $ 213.9.

We hold that, under the FRSA, federal regulationsadopted by the Secretary of Transportation pre-empt respondent's negligence action only insofar as it asserts thatpetitioner's train was traveling at an excessive speed. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Souter joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I believe that the Federal Railroad Safety Act and the Sec-retary of Transportation's implementing regulations preempt neither of respondent/cross-petitioner Easterwood'sstate-law tort claims. I therefore concur in Parts I and II
of the Court's opinion but dissent from the remainder.In Part III of its opinion, the Court holds that the Secretary's regulation setting "maximum allowable operatingspeeds for all freight and passenger trains" pre-empts Easterwood's claim that CSX "breached its common-law duty tooperate its train at a moderate and safe rate of speed" below
the federally specified maximum speed at the Cook Streetcrossing. Ante, at 673 (citing 49 CFR $ 213.9(a) (1992)). The
Court concedes, however, that "the provisions of $ 213.9(a)address only the maximum speeds at which trains are permitted to travel given the nature of the track on which theyoperate." Ante, at 674 (emphasis added). Likewise, CSX
makes no effort to characterize any duty to reduce speedunder Georgia law as a state-law obligation based on track
safety, the precise "subject matter" "cover[ed]" by the Sec-retary's speed regulation. 45 U. S. C. $ 434. Indeed, CSX
admits that it shoulders a state-law duty to take measures
hazard. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 91-790, p. 3. As respondent's
complaint alleges only that petitioner's train was traveling too quickly
given the "time and place," App. 4, this case does not present, and we do
not address, the question of FRSA's pre-emptive effect on such related
claims.

against crossing accidents, including an "attempt to stop orslow the train if possible to avoid a collision."

1 Reply Brief

for Petitioner in No. 91-790, p. 3. The Court effectivelyagrees, as is evident from its decision to limit its opinion to

a common-law negligence action for excessive speed and
from its refusal to address related state-law claims for theviolation of a statutory speed limit or the failure to avoid a

specific hazard. See ante, at 675, and n. 15. For me, these
concessions dictate the conclusion that Easterwood's excessive speed claim escapes pre-emption. Speed limits based
solely on track characteristics, see 49 CFR $$ 213.51-213.143
(1992), cannot be fairly described as "substantially subsum[ing] the subject matter of . . . state law" regulating speed
as a factor in grade crossing safety. Ante, at 664.

The Secretary's own explanation of his train speed regulation confirms my view that the federal speed standard does
not pre-empt state regulation of train speed as a method of
ensuring crossing safety. When the Secretary promulgated
his speed regulation in conjunction with a set of track safety
standards, he declined to consider "variable factors such as
population density near the track" because these matters fell
"beyond the scope of the notice of proposed rule making."
36 Fed. Reg. 20336 (1971). See also id., at 11974 (notice of
proposed rulemaking).2 By contrast, the state law support1 See generally Ga. Code Ann. $ 46-8-190(b) (1992) (requiring an "engineer operating [a] locomotive" to "exercise due care in approaching [a]
crossing, in order to avoid doing injury to any person or property which
may be on the crossing"); Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Cook, 94
Ga. App. 650, 651-652, 95 S. E. 2d 703, 706-707 (1956); Atlantic Coast Line
R. Co. v. Bradshaw, 34 Ga. App. 360, 129 S. E. 304 (1925).

2 I reject the Solicitor General's contention that "[t]he Secretary has

concluded that reduced train speeds do not represent an appropriate
method of preventing crossing accidents." Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 29. The very source cited in support of this proposition states that "[i]f a collision [at a crossing] seems unavoidable," a locomotive engineer "must decide whether the train should be slowed or

put into emergency mode." Rail-Highway Crossings Study, Report of

ing Easterwood's excessive speed claim would impose liabil-ity on CSX for "operating [a] train at a speed that was

greater than reasonable and safe" at a crossing "adjacent toa busily traveled thoroughfare." App. 4-5. Because the
Secretary has not even considered how train speed affectscrossing safety, much less "adopted a rule, regulation, order,
or standard covering [that] subject matter," Georgia remainsfree to "continue in force any law" regulating train speed for
this purpose. 45 U. S. C. $ 434.Only by invoking a broad regulatory "background" can the
Court conclude that "$ 213.9(a) should be understood as cov-ering the subject matter of train speed with respect to track
conditions." Ante, at 675. It rests in part on the Manualon Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, which has no pre-emptive effect by its own terms orunder the federal regulations requiring compliance with it.
See ante, at 668-670; 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(1) (1992) (permit-ting "State standards" to "supplemen[t]" the Manual). The
Court goes so far as to rely on a federal crossing gate regula-tion that concededly does not govern the Cook Street site.
Compare ante, at 674 ("[A]utomatic gates are required forfederally funded projects"), with

ante, at 672 ("These factsdo not establish that federal funds `participate[d] in the installation of the [warning] devices' at Cook Street") (quoting23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(3)(i) (1992)). Rather than attempt to
excavate such scant evidence of pre-emption, I would followthe most natural reading of the Secretary's regulations: The
Federal Government has chosen neither to regulate trainspeed as a factor affecting grade crossing safety nor to prevent States from doing so. The Court's contrary view ofthese regulations' pre-emptive effect may well create a jurisdictional gap in which States lack the power to patrol thepotentially hazardous operation of trains at speeds below the
applicable federal limit.
(Apr. 1989). The Secretary's original declaration that he did not consider
crossing safety concerns therefore stands uncontradicted.

Had the Secretary wished to pre-empt all state laws gov-erning train speed, he could have more explicitly defined the

regulatory "subject matter" to be "cover[ed]." Doubtlesssuch a decision would be true to Congress' declared intent
that "laws, rules, regulations, orders, and standards relatingto railroad safety shall be nationally uniform to the extent
practicable." 45 U. S. C. $ 434. To read the Secretary's ex-isting maximum speed regulation as encompassing safety
concerns unrelated to track characteristics, however, negatesCongress' desire that state law be accorded "considerable solicitude." Ante, at 665. The "historic police powers of theStates" to regulate train safety must not "be superseded . . .
unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress."Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947).
Respect for the presumptive sanctity of state law should beno less when federal pre-emption occurs by administrative
fiat rather than by congressional edict. See Fidelity Fed.Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153-154

claim is pre-empted.

Syllabus

WITHROW v. WILLIAMS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 91-1030. Argued November 3, 1992--Decided April 21, 1993
After a police sergeant threatened to "lock [him] up" during a station

house interrogation about a double murder, respondent Williams made
inculpatory statements. He was then advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, waived those rights, and made more
inculpatory statements. The Michigan trial court declined to suppress
his statements on the ground that he had been given timely Miranda
warnings, and he was convicted of first-degree murder and related
crimes. Williams subsequently commenced this habeas action pro se,
alleging a Miranda violation as his principal ground for relief. The
District Court granted relief, finding that all statements made between
the sergeant's incarceration threat and Williams' receipt of Miranda
warnings should have been suppressed. Without conducting an evidentiary hearing or entertaining argument, the court also ruled that the
statements Williams made after receiving the Miranda warnings should
have been suppressed as involuntary under the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals agreed on both
points and affirmed, summarily rejecting the argument that the rule in
Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465--that when a State has given a full and
fair chance to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim, federal habeas review
is not available to a state prisoner alleging that his conviction rests on
evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search or seizure--should
apply to bar habeas review of Williams' Miranda claim.

Held:

1. Stone's restriction on the exercise of federal habeas jurisdiction
does not extend to a state prisoner's claim that his conviction rests on
statements obtained in violation of the Miranda safeguards. The Stone
rule was not jurisdictional in nature, but was based on prudential concerns counseling against applying the Fourth Amendment exclusionary
rule of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, on collateral review. Miranda differs from Mapp with respect to such concerns, and Stone consequently
does not apply. In contrast to Mapp, Miranda safeguards a fundamental trial right by protecting a defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination. Moreover, Miranda facilitates the correct
ascertainment of guilt by guarding against the use of unreliable statements at trial. Finally, and most importantly, eliminating review of

Miranda claims would not significantly benefit the federal courts in
their exercise of habeas jurisdiction, or advance the cause of federalism
in any substantial way. The burdens placed on busy federal courts
would not be lightened, since it is reasonable to suppose that virtually
every barred Miranda claim would simply be recast as a due process
claim that the particular conviction rested on an involuntary confession.
Furthermore, it is not reasonable to expect that, after 27 years of Miranda, the overturning of state convictions on the basis of that case will
occur frequently enough to be a substantial cost of review or to raise

habeas petition raised no independent due process claim, and the record
is devoid of any indication that petitioner consented under Federal Rule

Opinion of the Court
obtained through an unconstitutional search or seizure.
Today we hold that Stone's restriction on the exercise of federal habeas jurisdiction does not extend to a state prisoner's
claim that his conviction rests on statements obtained in violation of the safeguards mandated by Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436 (1966).

I

Police officers in Romulus, Michigan, learned that respondent, Robert Allen Williams, Jr., might have information
about a double murder committed on April 6, 1985. On
April 10, two officers called at Williams's house and asked
him to the police station for questioning. Williams agreed
to go. The officers searched Williams, but did not handcuff
him, and they all drove to the station in an unmarked car.
One officer, Sergeant David Early, later testified that Williams was not under arrest at this time, although a contemporaneous police report indicates that the officers arrested Williams at his residence. App. 12a-13a, 24a-26a.

At the station, the officers questioned Williams about his
knowledge of the crime. Although he first denied any
involvement, he soon began to implicate himself, and the officers continued their questioning, assuring Williams that
their only concern was the identity of the "shooter." After
consulting each other, the officers decided not to advise Williams of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, supra. See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a. When Williams persisted in denying involvement, Sergeant Early reproved him:

"You know everything that went down. You just don't
want to talk about it. What it's gonna amount to is you
can talk about it now and give us the truth and we're
gonna check it out and see if it fits or else we're simply
gonna charge you and lock you up and you can just tell
it to a defense attorney and let him try and prove differently." Ibid.

684 WITHROW v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
The reproof apparently worked, for Williams then admittedhe had furnished the murder weapon to the killer, who had

called Williams after the crime and told him where he haddiscarded the weapon and other incriminating items. Williams maintained that he had not been present at the crime
scene.Only at this point, some 40 minutes after they began questioning him, did the officers advise Williams of his Mirandarights. Williams waived those rights and during subsequent questioning made several more inculpatory state-ments. Despite his prior denial, Williams admitted that he
had driven the murderer to and from the scene of the crime,
had witnessed the murders, and had helped the murderer
dispose of incriminating evidence. The officers interrogated
Williams again on April 11 and April 12, and, on April 12,
the State formally charged him with murder.

Before trial, Williams moved to suppress his responses to
the interrogations, and the trial court suppressed the statements of April 11 and April 12 as the products of improper
delay in arraignment under Michigan law. See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 90a-91a. The court declined to suppress the statements of April 10, however, ruling that the police had given
Williams a timely warning of his Miranda rights. Id., at
90a. A bench trial led to Williams's conviction on two
counts each of first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and resulted in two
concurrent life sentences. The Court of Appeals of Michigan affirmed the trial court's ruling on the April 10 statements, People v. Williams, 171 Mich. App. 234, 429 N. W. 2d
649 (1988), and the Supreme Court of Michigan denied leave
to appeal, 432 Mich. 913, 440 N. W. 2d 416 (1989). We denied
the ensuing petition for writ of certiorari. Williams v.
Michigan, 493 U. S. 956 (1989).

Williams then began this action pro se by petitioning for a
writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, alleging a violation of his Miranda rights as the principal ground for relief.

Opinion of the Court
Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 90CV-70256, p. 5(ED Mich.). The District Court granted relief, finding that

the police had placed Williams in custody for Miranda pur-poses when Sergeant Early had threatened to "lock [him]
up," and that the trial court should accordingly have ex-cluded all statements Williams had made between that point
and his receipt of the Miranda warnings. App. to Pet. forCert. 49a-52a. The court also concluded, though neither
Williams nor petitioner had addressed the issue, that Wil-liams's statements after receiving the

Miranda warningswere involuntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thus likewise subject to suppression.App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a-71a. The court found that the
totality of circumstances, including repeated promises oflenient treatment if he told the truth, had overborne Williams's will.1The Court of Appeals affirmed, 944 F. 2d 284 (CA6 1991),
holding the District Court correct in determining the policehad subjected Williams to custodial interrogation before giving him the requisite Miranda advice, and in finding thestatements made after receiving the

Miranda warningsinvoluntary. Id., at 289-290. The Court of Appeals summarily rejected the argument that the rule in Stone v. Pow-ell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976), should apply to bar habeas review of
Williams's Miranda claim. 944 F. 2d, at 291. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the significant issue thus presented.

Opinion of the Court

II
We have made it clear that Stone's limitation on federalhabeas relief was not jurisdictional in nature,

3 but rested on

prudential concerns counseling against the application of theFourth Amendment exclusionary rule on collateral review.

See Stone, supra, at 494-495, n. 37; see also Kuhlmann v.
Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 447 (1986) (opinion of Powell, J.) (dis-cussing equitable principles underlying Stone); Kimmelman

v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365, 379, n. 4 (1986); Allen v. McCurry,449 U. S. 90, 103 (1980) (

Stone concerns "the prudent exer-cise of federal-court jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254"); cf.

28 U. S. C. $ 2243 (court entertaining habeas petition shall"dispose of the matter as law and justice require"). We simply concluded in Stone that the costs of applying the exclu-sionary rule on collateral review outweighed any potential
advantage to be gained by applying it there. Stone, supra,at 489-495.

We recognized that the exclusionary rule, held applicableto the States in

Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), "is not apersonal constitutional right"; it fails to redress "the injury

to the privacy of the victim of the search or seizure" at issue,"for any `[r]eparation comes too late.' " Stone, supra, at 486
(quoting Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 637 (1965)).The rule serves instead to deter future Fourth Amendment
violations, and we reasoned that its application on collateralreview would only marginally advance this interest in deterrence. Stone, 428 U. S., at 493. On the other side of theledger, the costs of applying the exclusionary rule on habeas

in state court, should collateral review of the same claim on a habeas
corpus petition be precluded?"), and we see no good reason to address it
in this case.

3 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a) provides: "The Supreme Court, a Justice

thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an application
for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to
the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in
violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."

Opinion of the Court
were comparatively great. We reasoned that doing sowould not only exclude reliable evidence and divert attention

from the central question of guilt, but would also intrudeupon the public interest in " `(i) the most effective utilization of limited judicial resources, (ii) the necessity of finality
in criminal trials, (iii) the minimization of friction betweenour federal and state systems of justice, and (iv) the maintenance of the constitutional balance upon which the doctrineof federalism is founded.' "

Id., at 491, n. 31 (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 259 (1973) (Powell,J., concurring)).

Over the years, we have repeatedly declined to extend the
rule in Stone beyond its original bounds. In Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), for example, we denied a request
to apply Stone to bar habeas consideration of a Fourteenth
Amendment due process claim of insufficient evidence to support a state conviction. We stressed that the issue was
"central to the basic question of guilt or innocence," Jackson,
443 U. S., at 323, unlike a claim that a state court had received evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, and we found that to review such a claim on
habeas imposed no great burdens on the federal courts. Id.,
at 321-322.

After a like analysis, in Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545
(1979), we decided against extending Stone to foreclose
habeas review of an equal protection claim of racial discrimination in selecting a state grand-jury foreman. A charge
that state adjudication had violated the direct command of
the Fourteenth Amendment implicated the integrity of the
judicial process, we reasoned, Rose, 443 U. S., at 563, and
failed to raise the "federalism concerns" that had driven the
Court in Stone. 443 U. S., at 562. Since federal courts had
granted relief to state prisoners upon proof of forbidden discrimination for nearly a century, we concluded, "confirmation
that habeas corpus remains an appropriate vehicle by which
federal courts are to exercise their Fourteenth Amendment

Opinion of the Court
responsibilities" would not likely raise tensions between thestate and federal judicial systems. Ibid.

In a third instance, in Kimmelman v. Morrison, supra, weagain declined to extend Stone, in that case to bar habeas
review of certain claims of ineffective assistance of counselunder the Sixth Amendment. We explained that unlike the
Fourth Amendment, which confers no "trial right," the Sixthconfers a "fundamental right" on criminal defendants, one
that "assures the fairness, and thus the legitimacy, of ouradversary process." 477 U. S., at 374. We observed that
because a violation of the right would often go unremediedexcept on collateral review, "restricting the litigation of some
Sixth Amendment claims to trial and direct review wouldseriously interfere with an accused's right to effective representation." Id., at 378.In this case, the argument for extending Stone again falls
short.4 To understand why, a brief review of the derivationof the Miranda safeguards, and the purposes they were designed to serve, is in order.The Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment
guarantees that no person "shall be compelled in any crimi-nal case to be a witness against himself." U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 5. In Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 (1897), theCourt held that the Clause barred the introduction in federal
cases of involuntary confessions made in response to custo-dial interrogation. We did not recognize the Clause's applicability to state cases until 1964, however, see Malloy v.
Hogan, 378 U. S. 1; and, over the course of 30 years, begin-ning with the decision in Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278

(1936), we analyzed the admissibility of confessions in suchcases as a question of due process under the Fourteenth
Amendment. See Stone, The Miranda Doctrine in theBurger Court, 1977 S. Ct. Rev. 99, 101-102. Under this ap4 We have in the past declined to address the application of Stone in this
context. See, e. g., Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 201, n. 3 (1989);
Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87, n. 11 (1977).

proach, we examined the totality of circumstances to deter-mine whether a confession had been " `made freely, voluntarily and without compulsion or inducement of any sort.' "Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 513 (1963) (quoting Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623 (1896)); seealso

Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, supra, at 223-227 (discuss-ing totality-of-circumstances approach). See generally 1

W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure $ 6.2 (1984). In-deed, we continue to employ the totality-of-circumstances
approach when addressing a claim that the introduction ofan involuntary confession has violated due process. E. g.,
Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991); Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 109-110 (1985).In Malloy, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment

incorporates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and thereby opened Bram's doctrinal avenue
for the analysis of state cases. So it was that two yearslater we held in Miranda that the privilege extended to state
custodial interrogations. In Miranda, we spoke of the privi-lege as guaranteeing a person under interrogation "the right
`to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfetteredexercise of his own will,' " 384 U. S., at 460 (quoting

Malloy,supra, at 8), and held that "without proper safeguards the

process of in-custody interrogation . . . contains inherentlycompelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he wouldnot otherwise do so freely." 384 U. S., at 467. To counter
these pressures we prescribed, absent "other fully effectivemeans," the now-familiar measures in aid of a defendant's
Fifth Amendment privilege:

"He must be warned prior to any questioning that hehas the right to remain silent, that anything he says can

be used against him in a court of law, that he has theright to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for himprior to any questioning if he so desires. Opportunity

690 WITHROW v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
to exercise these rights must be afforded to himthroughout the interrogation. After such warnings

have been given, and such opportunity afforded him, theindividual may knowingly and intelligently waive these
rights and agree to answer questions or make a state-ment."

Id., at 479.

Unless the prosecution can demonstrate the warnings andwaiver as threshold matters, we held, it may not overcome

an objection to the use at trial of statements obtained fromthe person in any ensuing custodial interrogation. See

ibid.;cf. Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 721-723 (1975) (permitting

use for impeachment purposes of statements taken in viola-tion of Miranda).

Petitioner, supported by the United States as amicus cu-riae, argues that Miranda's safeguards are not constitutional
in character, but merely "prophylactic," and that in conse-quence habeas review should not extend to a claim that a
state conviction rests on statements obtained in the absenceof those safeguards. Brief for Petitioner 91-93; Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 14-15. We accept petition-er's premise for purposes of this case, but not her conclusion.

The Miranda Court did of course caution that the Consti-tution requires no "particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the interrogation process," and left it open to aState to meet its burden by adopting "other procedures . . .
at least as effective in apprising accused persons" of theirrights. 384 U. S., at 467. The Court indeed acknowledged
that, in barring introduction of a statement obtained withoutthe required warnings, Miranda might exclude a confession

that we would not condemn as "involuntary in traditionalterms,"

id., at 457, and for this reason we have sometimescalled the Miranda safeguards "prophylactic" in nature.

E. g., Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203 (1989); Connect-icut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 528 (1987); Oregon v. Elstad,

Opinion of the Court
(Miranda Court "recognized that these procedural safe-guards were not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but were instead measures to insure that the rightagainst compulsory self-incrimination was protected"). But
cf. Quarles, supra, at 660 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (Miranda
Court "held unconstitutional, because inherently compelled,the admission of statements derived from in-custody questioning not preceded by an explanation of the privilegeagainst self-incrimination and the consequences of forgoing
it"). Calling the Miranda safeguards "prophylactic," how-ever, is a far cry from putting

Miranda on all fours with
Mapp, or from rendering Miranda subject to Stone.

As we explained in Stone, the Mapp rule "is not a personal
constitutional right," but serves to deter future constitutional violations; although it mitigates the juridical consequences of invading the defendant's privacy, the exclusion of
evidence at trial can do nothing to remedy the completed and
wholly extrajudicial Fourth Amendment violation. Stone,
428 U. S., at 486. Nor can the Mapp rule be thought to enhance the soundness of the criminal process by improving
the reliability of evidence introduced at trial. Quite the contrary, as we explained in Stone, the evidence excluded under
Mapp "is typically reliable and often the most probative information bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant." 428 U. S., at 490.

Miranda differs from Mapp in both respects. "Prophylactic" though it may be, in protecting a defendant's Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, Miranda
safeguards "a fundamental trial right." United States v.
Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264 (1990) (emphasis
added); cf. Kimmelman, 477 U. S., at 377 (Stone does not bar
habeas review of claim that the personal trial right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated). The privilege
embodies "principles of humanity and civil liberty, which had
been secured in the mother country only after years of struggle," Bram, 168 U. S., at 544, and reflects

692 WITHROW v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
"many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: . . . our preference for an accusatorial rather than
an inquisitorial system of criminal justice; our fear that
self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; our sense of fair play which
dictates `a fair state-individual balance by requiring the
government to leave the individual alone until good
cause is shown for disturbing him and by requiring the
government in its contest with the individual to shoulder the entire load;' our respect for the inviolability of
the human personality and of the right of each individual
`to a private enclave where he may lead a private life;'
our distrust of self-deprecatory statements; and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes `a shelter
to the guilty,' is often `a protection to the innocent.' "
Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of New York Harbor,
378 U. S. 52, 55 (1964) (citations omitted).

Nor does the Fifth Amendment "trial right" protected by
Miranda serve some value necessarily divorced from the
correct ascertainment of guilt. " `[A] system of criminal law
enforcement which comes to depend on the "confession" will,
in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses'
than a system relying on independent investigation." Michigan v. Tucker, supra, at 448, n. 23 (quoting Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 488-489 (1964)). By bracing against "the
possibility of unreliable statements in every instance of incustody interrogation," Miranda serves to guard against
"the use of unreliable statements at trial." Johnson v. New
Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 730 (1966); see also Schneckloth, 412
U. S., at 240 (Miranda "Court made it clear that the basis
for decision was the need to protect the fairness of the trial
itself "); Halpern, Federal Habeas Corpus and the Mapp Exclusionary Rule after Stone v. Powell, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1,

in selection of grand-jury foreman, as this claim goes to theintegrity of the judicial process).

Finally, and most importantly, eliminating review ofMiranda claims would not significantly benefit the federal
courts in their exercise of habeas jurisdiction, or advance thecause of federalism in any substantial way. As one

amicusconcedes, eliminating habeas review of Miranda issues

would not prevent a state prisoner from simply convertinghis barred Miranda claim into a due process claim that his
conviction rested on an involuntary confession. See Brieffor United States as Amicus Curiae 17. Indeed, although
counsel could provide us with no empirical basis for project-ing the consequence of adopting petitioner's position, see Tr.
of Oral Arg. 9-11, 19-21, it seems reasonable to suppose thatvirtually all

Miranda claims would simply be recast in thisway.
5

If that is so, the federal courts would certainly not haveheard the last of

Miranda on collateral review. Under thedue process approach, as we have already seen, courts look

to the totality of circumstances to determine whether a con-fession was voluntary. Those potential circumstances include not only the crucial element of police coercion, Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 167 (1986); the length of theinterrogation, Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 153-154

(1944); its location, see Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433, 441 (1961);its continuity,

Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556, 561 (1954); thedefendant's maturity, Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599-601

(1948) (opinion of Douglas, J.); education, Clewis v. Texas,386 U. S. 707, 712 (1967); physical condition, Greenwald v.

They also include the failure of police to advise the defendantof his rights to remain silent and to have counsel present

5 Justice O'Connor is confident that many such claims would be unjustified, see post, at 708-709, but that is beside the point. Justifiability is

(or, at least, brighter-line) rules in favor of an exhaustive
totality-of-circumstances approach on habeas would do much
of anything to lighten the burdens placed on busy federal
courts. See P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro,
Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal
System 188 (3d ed. 1988, Supp. 1992); Halpern, supra, at 40;
Schulhofer, Confessions and the Court, 79 Mich. L. Rev. 865,
891 (1981); see also Quarles, 467 U. S., at 664 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Fare v. Michael C., 439 U. S. 1310, 1314 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)) (Miranda's " `core virtue' " was " `afford[ing] police and courts clear guidance on the manner in
which to conduct a custodial investigation' "). We likewise
fail to see how purporting to eliminate Miranda issues from
federal habeas would go very far to relieve such tensions as
Miranda may now raise between the two judicial systems.
Relegation of habeas petitioners to straight involuntariness
claims would not likely reduce the amount of litigation, and
each such claim would in any event present a legal question
requiring an "independent federal determination" on habeas.
Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S., at 112.

One might argue that tension results between the two judicial systems whenever a federal habeas court overturns a
state conviction on finding that the state court let in a voluntary confession obtained by the police without the Miranda
safeguards. And one would have to concede that this has
occurred in the past, and doubtless will occur again. It is
not reasonable, however, to expect such occurrences to be
frequent enough to amount to a substantial cost of reviewing

Miranda claims on habeas or to raise federal-state tensionsto an appreciable degree. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11, 21. We

must remember in this regard that Miranda came downsome 27 years ago. In that time, law enforcement has
grown in constitutional as well as technological sophistica-tion, and there is little reason to believe that the police today
are unable, or even generally unwilling, to satisfy Miranda'srequirements. See

Quarles, supra, at 663 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (quoting Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 304 (1980) (Burger,C. J., concurring in judgment)) (" `meaning of Miranda has
become reasonably clear and law enforcement practices haveadjusted to its strictures' "); Schulhofer, Reconsidering

Mi-randa, 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 435, 455-457 (1987).
6 And if, finally, one should question the need for federal collateral re-view of requirements that merit such respect, the answer

simply is that the respect is sustained in no small part bythe existence of such review. "It is the occasional abuse that
the federal writ of habeas corpus stands ready to correct."Jackson, 443 U. S., at 322.

One final point should keep us only briefly. As he haddone in his state appellate briefs, on habeas Williams raised

only one claim going to the admissibility of his statements tothe police: that the police had elicited those statements without satisfying the Miranda requirements. See supra, at 684.In her answer, petitioner addressed only that claim. See
Brief in Support of Answer in No. 90CV-70256 DT, p. 3 (EDMich.). The District Court, nonetheless, without an evidentiary hearing or even argument, went beyond the habeaspetition and found the statements Williams made after re6 It should indeed come as no surprise that one of the submissions arguing against the extension of Stone in this case comes to us from law
enforcement organizations. See Brief for Police Foundation et al. as

Opinion of the Court
ceiving the Miranda warnings to be involuntary under due
process criteria. Before the Court of Appeals, petitioner
objected to the District Court's due process enquiry on the
ground that the habeas petition's reference to Miranda
rights had given her insufficient notice to address a due process claim. Brief for Respondent-Appellant in No. 90-2289,
p. 6 (CA6). Petitioner pursues the objection here. See Pet.
for Cert. 1; Brief for Petitioner 14-15, n. 2.

Williams effectively concedes that his habeas petition
raised no involuntariness claim, but he argues that the matter was tried by the implied consent of the parties under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b),7 and that petitioner
can demonstrate no prejudice from the District Court's
action. See Brief for Respondent 41-42, n. 22. The record,
however, reveals neither thought, word, nor deed of petitioner that could be taken as any sort of consent to the
determination of an independent due process claim, and petitioner was manifestly prejudiced by the District Court's
failure to afford her an opportunity to present evidence bearing on that claim's resolution. The District Court should
not have addressed the involuntariness question in these
circumstances.8

7 The relevant part of Rule 15(b) provides: "When issues not raised by
the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they
shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.
Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to
conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend
does not affect the result of the trial of these issues." See 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254 Rule 11 (application of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to habeas
petitions); 1 J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure

$ 17.2 (1988) (Rule 15 applies in habeas actions).

8 We need not address petitioner's arguments that Williams failed to

exhaust the involuntariness claim in the state courts and that the District
Court applied a new rule under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Of
course, we also express no opinion on the merits of the involuntariness
claim.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

IV
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in partand reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further

proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

Today the Court permits the federal courts to overturn onhabeas the conviction of a double murderer, not on the basis
of an inexorable constitutional or statutory command, butbecause it believes the result desirable from the standpoint
of equity and judicial administration. Because the princi-ples that inform our habeas jurisprudence--finality, federalism, and fairness--counsel decisively against the result theCourt reaches, I respectfully dissent from this holding.

I
The Court does not sit today in direct review of a state-court judgment of conviction. Rather, respondent seeks

relief by collaterally attacking his conviction through thewrit of habeas corpus. While petitions for the writ of habeas corpus are now commonplace--over 12,000 were filed in1990, compared to 127 in 1941--their current ubiquity ought
not detract from the writ's historic importance. See L.Mecham, Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts 191 (1991) (1990 fig-ures);

Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 446, n. 2 (1963) (Clark, J.,dissenting) (1941 figures). "The Great Writ" can be traced

through the common law to well before the founding of thisNation; its role as a "prompt and efficacious remedy for
whatever society deems to be intolerable restraints" is be-yond question.

Fay, 372 U. S., at 401-402. As Justice Har-lan explained:

"Habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is today, as it hasalways been, a fundamental safeguard against unlawful

custody. . . . Although the wording of earlier statutoryprovisions has been changed, the basic question before

the court to which the writ is addressed has always beenthe same: in the language of the present statute, on the
books since 1867, is the detention complained of `in viola-tion of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United
States'?" Id., at 449 (dissenting opinion).
Nonetheless, we repeatedly have recognized that collateralattacks raise numerous concerns not present on direct review. Most profound is the effect on finality. It goes with-out saying that, at some point, judicial proceedings must
draw to a close and the matter deemed conclusively resolved;no society can afford forever to question the correctness of
its every judgment. "[T]he writ," however, "strikes at fi-nality," McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491 (1991), depriving the criminal law "of much of its deterrent effect," Teaguev.

Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 309 (1989) (plurality opinion), andsometimes preventing the law's just application altogether,

see McCleskey, supra, at 491. "No one, not criminal defend-ants, not the judicial system, not society as a whole is benefited by a judgment providing a man shall tentatively go tojail today, but tomorrow and every day thereafter his continued incarceration shall be subject to fresh litigation."
Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 691 (1971) (Harlan,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also McCleskey, supra, at 492.In our federal system, state courts have primary responsibility for enforcing constitutional rules in their own criminaltrials. When a case comes before the federal courts on habeas rather than on direct review, the judicial role is "sig-nificantly different."

Mackey, supra, at 682 (Harlan, J., con-curring in part and dissenting in part). Accord, Teague,

supra, at 306-308. Most important here, federal courts ondirect review adjudicate every issue of federal law properly
presented; in contrast, "federal courts have never had a simi-lar obligation on habeas corpus." Mackey, supra, at 682

(Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Asthe Court explains today, federal courts exercising their habeas powers may refuse to grant relief on certain claims be-cause of "prudential concerns" such as equity and federalism.
Ante, at 686. This follows not only from the express language of the habeas statute, which directs the federal courtsto "dispose of [habeas petitions] as law and justice require,"

28 U. S. C. $ 2243, but from our precedents as well. In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we stated that "[t]his
Court has long recognized that in some circumstances consid-erations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice require a federal court to forgo the
exercise of its habeas corpus power." Id., at 539. Accord,
Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of
Cal., 503 U. S. 653, 653-654 (1992) ("Whether [a] claim is
framed as a habeas petition or as a [42 U. S. C.] $ 1983 action,
[what is sought is] an equitable remedy"; as a result, equity
must be "take[n] into consideration"); Fay v. Noia, supra,
at 438 ("[H]abeas corpus has traditionally been regarded as
governed by equitable principles"); Duckworth v. Eagan, 492
U. S. 195, 213 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[T]he Court
has long recognized that habeas corpus [is] governed by equitable principles" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Concerns for equity and federalism resonate throughout
our habeas jurisprudence. In 1886, only eight years after
Congress gave the federal courts power to issue writs ordering the release of state prisoners, this Court explained that
courts could accommodate federalism and comity concerns
by withholding relief until after state proceedings had terminated. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 251-253. Accord,
Fay, supra, at 418-419. More recently, we relied on those
same concerns in holding that new constitutional rules of
criminal procedure do not apply retroactively on habeas.
Teague, supra, at 306. Our treatment of successive petitions and procedurally defaulted claims similarly is governed
by equitable principles. McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 489-491

507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT
700 WITHROW v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
(successive petitions); id., at 490 (procedurally defaultedclaims);

Fay, supra, at 438 (procedurally defaulted claims).
Most telling of all, this Court continuously has recognizedthat the ultimate equity on the prisoner's side--a sufficient

showing of actual innocence--is normally sufficient, standing
alone, to outweigh other concerns and justify adjudication ofthe prisoner's constitutional claim. See

Sawyer v. Whitley,
505 U. S. 333, 340-347 (1992) (actual innocence of penalty);
Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496 (1986) (federal courts
may reach procedurally defaulted claims on a showing thata constitutional violation probably resulted in the conviction

of an actually innocent person); Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477
U. S. 436, 454 (1986) (colorable showing of actual innocence
suffices to excuse successive claim); see also Teague v. Lane,
supra, at 313 (where absence of procedure seriously diminishes the likelihood of an accurate conviction, a new rule requiring the procedure may be applied retroactively on
habeas).

Nonetheless, decisions concerning the availability of habeas relief warrant restraint. Nowhere is the Court's restraint more evident than when it is asked to exclude a
substantive category of issues from relitigation on habeas.
Although we recognized the possibility of excluding certain
types of claims long ago, see Mackey, supra, at 683 (Harlan,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), only once has
this Court found that the concerns of finality, federalism, and
fairness supported such a result; that was in Stone v. Powell,
428 U. S. 465 (1976). Ante, at 686. Since then, the Court
has refused to bar additional categories of claims on three
different occasions. Ante, at 687-688.

Today we face the question whether Stone v. Powell
should extend to bar claims on habeas that the prophylactic
rule of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), had been
violated. Continuing the tradition of caution in this area,
the Court answers that question in the negative. This time
I must disagree. In my view, the "prudential concerns,"

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ante, at 686, that inform our habeas jurisprudence counselthe exclusion of Miranda claims just as strongly as they did

the exclusionary rule claims at issue in Stone itself.

II
In Stone, the Court explained that the exclusionary ruleof

Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), was not an inevitableproduct of the Constitution but instead " `a judicially created

remedy.' " Stone, supra, at 486 (quoting United States v.
Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 349 (1974)). By threatening to ex-clude highly probative and sometimes critical evidence, the

exclusionary rule "is thought to encourage those who formu-late law enforcement policies, and the officers who implement
them, to incorporate Fourth Amendment ideals into theirvalue system." Stone, 428 U. S., at 492. The deterrent effect is strong: Any transgression of the Fourth Amendmentcarries the risk that evidence will be excluded at trial. Nonetheless, this increased sensitivity to Fourth Amendment val-ues carries a high cost. Exclusion not only deprives the jury
of probative and sometimes dispositive evidence, but also"deflects the truthfinding process and often frees the guilty."
Id., at 490. When that happens, it is not just the executiveor the judiciary but all of society that suffers: The executive
suffers because the police lose their suspect and the prosecu-tor the case; the judiciary suffers because its processes are
diverted from the central mission of ascertaining the truth;and society suffers because the populace again finds a guilty
and potentially dangerous person in its midst, solely becausea police officer bungled.

While that cost is considered acceptable when a case is ondirect review, the balance shifts decisively once the case is
on habeas. There is little marginal benefit to enforcing theexclusionary rule on habeas; the penalty of exclusion comes
too late to produce a noticeable deterrent effect. Id., at 493.Moreover, the rule "divert[s attention] from the ultimate
question of guilt," squanders scarce federal judicial re507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
sources, intrudes on the interest in finality, creates frictionbetween the state and federal systems of justice, and upsets

the " `constitutional balance upon which the doctrine offederalism is founded.' "

Id., at 490, 491, n. 31 (quoting
Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 259 (1973) (Powell,
J., concurring)). Because application of the exclusionaryrule on habeas "offend[s] important principles of federalism

and finality in the criminal law which have long informed thefederal courts' exercise of habeas jurisdiction,"

Duckworth,
492 U. S., at 208 (O'Connor, J., concurring), we held in Stonethat such claims would no longer be cognizable on habeas so

long as the State already had provided the defendant with a
full and fair opportunity to litigate.

I continue to believe that these same considerations apply
to Miranda claims with equal, if not greater, force. See
Duckworth, supra, at 209 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Like
the suppression of the fruits of an illegal search or seizure,
the exclusion of statements obtained in violation of Miranda
is not constitutionally required. This Court repeatedly has
held that Miranda's warning requirement is not a dictate of
the Fifth Amendment itself, but a prophylactic rule. See,
e. g., McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176 (1991); Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350 (1990); Duckworth, supra,
at 203; New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 654 (1984); Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 442-446 (1974). Because Miranda "sweeps more broadly than the Fifth Amendment
itself," it excludes some confessions even though the Constitution would not. Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 306
(1985). Indeed, "in the individual case, Miranda's preventive medicine [often] provides a remedy even to the defendant who has suffered no identifiable constitutional harm."
Id., at 307.

Miranda's overbreadth, of course, is not without justification. The exclusion of unwarned statements provides a
strong incentive for the police to adopt "procedural safeguards," Miranda, 384 U. S., at 444, against the exaction of

703Cite as: 507 U. S. 680 (1993)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
compelled or involuntary statements. It also promotes in-stitutional respect for constitutional values. But, like the

exclusionary rule for illegally seized evidence, Miranda'sprophylactic rule does so at a substantial cost. Unlike involuntary or compelled statements--which are of dubious reliability and are therefore inadmissible for any purpose--con-fessions obtained in violation of

Miranda are not necessarily
untrustworthy. In fact, because voluntary statements are"trustworthy" even when obtained without proper warnings,

Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 731 (1966), their sup-pression actually

impairs the pursuit of truth by concealing
probative information from the trier of fact. See Harvey,
supra, at 350 (Miranda "result[s] in the exclusion of some
voluntary and reliable statements"); Elstad, supra, at 312
(loss of "highly probative evidence of a voluntary confession"
is a "high cost [for] law enforcement"); McNeil, supra, at 181
(because "the ready ability to obtain uncoerced confessions
is not an evil but an unmitigated good," the exclusion of such
confessions renders society "the loser"); Tucker, supra, at
461 (White, J., concurring in judgment) ("[H]aving relevant
and probative testimony, not obtained by actual coercion . . .
aid[s] in the pursuit of truth"); Miranda, supra, at 538
(White, J., dissenting) ("Particularly when corroborated, . . .
such [voluntary] confessions have the highest reliability and
significantly contribute to the certitude with which we may
believe the accused is guilty").

When the case is on direct review, that damage to the
truth-seeking function is deemed an acceptable sacrifice for
the deterrence and respect for constitutional values that the
Miranda rule brings. But once a case is on collateral review, the balance between the costs and benefits shifts; the
interests of federalism, finality, and fairness compel Miranda's exclusion from habeas. The benefit of enforcing Miranda through habeas is marginal at best. To the extent
Miranda ensures the exclusion of involuntary statements,
that task can be performed more accurately by adjudicating

507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT
704 WITHROW v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the voluntariness question directly. See Johnson, supra,at 730-731. And, to the extent exclusion of voluntary but

unwarned confessions serves a deterrent function, "[t]heawarding of habeas relief years after conviction will often
strike like lightning, and it is absurd to think that this added
possibility . . . will have any appreciable effect on policetraining or behavior."

Duckworth, supra, at 211 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Judge Friendly made precisely thesame point 18 years earlier: "[T]he deterrent value of permitting collateral attack," he explained, "goes beyond thepoint of diminishing returns." Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 142, 163 (1970).

Despite its meager benefits, the relitigation of Miranda
claims on habeas imposes substantial costs. Just like the
application of the exclusionary rule, application of Miranda's
prophylactic rule on habeas consumes scarce judicial resources on an issue unrelated to guilt or innocence. No less
than the exclusionary rule, it undercuts finality. It creates
tension between the state and federal courts. And it upsets
the division of responsibilities that underlies our federal system. But most troubling of all, Miranda's application on
habeas sometimes precludes the just application of law altogether. The order excluding the statement will often be issued "years after trial, when a new trial may be a practical
impossibility." Duckworth, 492 U. S., at 211 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring). Whether the Court admits it or not, the grim
result of applying Miranda on habeas will be, time and time
again, "the release of an admittedly guilty individual who
may pose a continuing threat to society." Ibid.

Any rule that so demonstrably renders truth and society
"the loser," McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S., at 181, " `bear[s]
a heavy burden of justification, and must be carefully limited
to the circumstances in which it will pay its way by deterring
official lawlessness,' " United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897,
908, n. 6 (1984) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 257-

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
258 (1983) (White, J., concurring in judgment)). That bur-den is heavier still on collateral review. In light of the meager deterrent benefit it brings and the tremendous costs itimposes, in my view application of Miranda's prophylactic
rule on habeas "falls short" of justification. Ante, at 688.

III
The Court identifies a number of differences that, in itsview, distinguish this case from

Stone v. Powell. Ante, at691-695. I am sympathetic to the Court's concerns but find

them misplaced nonetheless.The first difference the Court identifies concerns the nature of the right protected. Miranda, the Court correctlypoints out, fosters Fifth Amendment, rather than Fourth
Amendment, values. Ante, at 691. The Court then offers adefense of the Fifth Amendment, reminding us that it is " `a
fundamental trial right' " that reflects " `principles of human-ity and civil liberty' "; that it was secured " `after years of
struggle' "; and that it does not serve "some value necessar-ily divorced from the correct ascertainment of guilt." Ante,
at 691-692 (quoting United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494U. S. 259, 364 (1990), and Bram v. United States, 168 U. S.
532, 544 (1897)). The Court's spirited defense of the FifthAmendment is, of course, entirely beside the point. The
question is not whether true Fifth Amendment claims--theextraction and use of

compelled testimony--should be cogni-zable on habeas. It is whether violations of Miranda's prophylactic rule, which excludes from trial voluntary confes-sions obtained without the benefit of Miranda's now-familiar
warnings, should be. The questions are not the same; norare their answers.

To say that the Fifth Amendment is a " `fundamental trialright,' "

ante, at 691 (quoting United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, supra, at 264), is thus both correct and irrelevant.

Miranda's warning requirement may bear many labels, but"fundamental trial right" is not among them. Long before

507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT
706 WITHROW v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Miranda was decided, it was well established that the FifthAmendment prohibited the introduction of compelled or involuntary confessions at trial. And long before Miranda,the courts enforced that prohibition by asking a simple and
direct question: Was "the confession the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice," or was the defendant'swill "overborne"?

Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S., at
225 (quoting Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 602(1961)); see

ante, at 688-689; see, e. g., Bram v. United States,
supra. Miranda's innovation was its introduction of thewarning requirement: It commanded the police to issue

warnings (or establish other procedural safeguards) before
obtaining a statement through custodial interrogation. And
it backed that prophylactic rule with a similarly prophylactic
remedy--the requirement that unwarned custodial statements, even if wholly voluntary, be excluded at trial. Miranda, 384 U. S., at 444. Excluding violations of Miranda's
prophylactic suppression requirement from habeas would
not leave true Fifth Amendment violations unredressed.
Prisoners still would be able to seek relief by "invok[ing] a
substantive test of voluntariness" or demonstrating prohibited coercion directly. Johnson, 384 U. S., at 730; Elstad,
470 U. S., at 307-308 (statements falling outside Miranda's
sweep analyzed under voluntariness standard). The Court
concedes as much. Ante, at 693 ("[E]liminating habeas review of Miranda issues would not prevent a state prisoner
from simply converting his barred Miranda claim into a due
process claim that his conviction rested on an involuntary
confession").

Excluding Miranda claims from habeas, then, denies collateral relief only in those cases in which the prisoner's statement was neither compelled nor involuntary but merely
obtained without the benefit of Miranda's prophylactic warnings. The availability of a suppression remedy in such cases
cannot be labeled a "fundamental trial right," for there is no
constitutional right to the suppression of voluntary state507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT

707Cite as: 507 U. S. 680 (1993)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ments. Quite the opposite: The Fifth Amendment, by itsterms, prohibits only

compelled self-incrimination; it makes
no mention of "unwarned" statements. U. S. Const., Amdt.5 ("No person . . . shall be

compelled in any criminal case to
be a witness against himself " (emphasis added)). On that
much, our cases could not be clearer. See, e. g., Michiganv.

Tucker, 417 U. S., at 448 ("Cases which involve the SelfIncrimination Clause must, by definition, involve an elementof coercion, since the Clause provides only that a person shall

not be compelled to give evidence against himself "); see
Elstad, supra, at 306-307; New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S.,
at 654-655, and n. 5. As a result, the failure to issue warnings does "not abridge [the] constitutional privilege against
compulsory self-incrimination, but depart[s] only from the
prophylactic standards later laid down by this Court in Miranda." Tucker, supra, at 446. If the principles of federalism, finality, and fairness ever counsel in favor of withholding
relief on habeas, surely they do so where there is no constitutional harm to remedy.

Similarly unpersuasive is the Court's related argument,
ante, at 692, that the Fifth Amendment trial right is not
"necessarily divorced" from the interest of reliability. Whatever the Fifth Amendment's relationship to reliability, Miranda's prophylactic rule is not merely "divorced" from the
quest for truth but at war with it as well. The absence of
Miranda warnings does not by some mysterious alchemy
convert a voluntary and trustworthy statement into an involuntary and unreliable one. To suggest otherwise is both unrealistic and contrary to precedent. As I explained above,
we have held over and over again that the exclusion of unwarned but voluntary statements not only fails to advance
the cause of accuracy but impedes it by depriving the jury
of trustworthy evidence. Supra, at 703. In fact, we have
determined that the damage Miranda does to the truthseeking mission of the criminal trial can become intolerable.

(unwarned but voluntary statement may be used for impeachment), and dispensed with it entirely elsewhere, see
Quarles, supra (unwarned statement may be used for any
purpose where statement was obtained under exigent circumstances bearing on public safety). And at least one
Member of this Court dissented from Miranda itself because
it "establish[ed] a new . . . barrier to the ascertainment of
truth by the judicial process." Miranda, supra, at 542
(opinion of White, J.). Consequently, I agree with the
Court that Miranda's relationship to accurate verdicts is an
important consideration when deciding whether to permit
Miranda claims on habeas. But it is a consideration that
weighs decisively against the Court's decision today.

The consideration the Court identifies as being "most importan[t]" of all, ante, at 693, is an entirely pragmatic one.
Specifically, the Court "project[s]" that excluding Miranda
questions from habeas will not significantly promote efficiency or federalism because some Miranda issues are relevant to a statement's voluntariness. Ante, at 693-695. It is

true that barring Miranda claims from habeas poses no barrier to the adjudication of voluntariness questions. But that
does not make it "reasonable to suppose that virtually all
Miranda claims [will] simply be recast" and litigated as voluntariness claims. Ante, at 693. Involuntariness requires
coercive state action, such as trickery, psychological pressure, or mistreatment. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157,
167 (1986) ("[C]oercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not `voluntary' "); ante,
at 693 (referring to "the crucial element of police coercion").
A Miranda claim, by contrast, requires no evidence of police
overreaching whatsoever; it is enough that law enforcement
officers commit a technical error. Even the forgetful failure
to issue warnings to the most wary, knowledgeable, and sea507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT

soned of criminals will do. Miranda, 384 U. S., at 468
("[W]e will not pause to inquire in individual cases whether
the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning
being given"). Given the Court's unqualified trust in the
willingness of police officers to satisfy Miranda's requirements, ante, at 695, its suggestion that their every failure to
do so involves coercion seems to me ironic. If the police
have truly grown in "constitutional . . . sophistication," ibid.,
then certainly it is reasonable to suppose that most technical
errors in the administration of Miranda's warnings are just
that.

In any event, I see no need to resort to supposition. The
published decisions of the lower federal courts show that
what the Court assumes to be true demonstrably is not. In
case after case, the courts are asked on habeas to decide
purely technical Miranda questions that contain not even a
hint of police overreaching. And in case after case, no voluntariness issue is raised, primarily because none exists.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Even assuming that many Miranda claims could "simplybe recast" as voluntariness claims, it does not follow that

barring Miranda's prophylactic rule from habeas would un-duly complicate their resolution. The Court labels

Miranda
a "bright-line (or, at least, brighter-line) rul[e]" and involuntariness an "exhaustive totality-of-circumstances approach,"
ante, at 694, but surely those labels overstate the differences.
Miranda, for all its alleged brightness, is not without its dif-ficulties; and voluntariness is not without its strengths.

Justice White so observed in his Miranda dissent, noting thatthe Court could not claim that

"judicial time and effort . . . will be conserved becauseof the ease of application of the

[Miranda] rule. [Miranda] leaves open such questions as whether the ac-cused was in custody, whether his statements were

spontaneous or the product of interrogation, whetherthe accused has effectively waived his rights, . . . all
of which are certain to prove productive of uncertainty
during investigation and litigation during prosecution."
Miranda, supra, at 544-545.

Experience has proved Justice White's prediction correct.
Miranda creates as many close questions as it resolves.The task of determining whether a defendant is in "custody"

has proved to be "a slippery one." Elstad, 470 U. S., at 309;
see, e. g., n. 1, supra (custody cases). And the supposedly"bright" lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous

declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the ade-quate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out
to be rather dim and ill defined. See Rhode Island v. Innis,
446 U. S. 291 (1980) (interrogation); n. 2, supra (interrogation); nn. 4 and 5, supra (waiver and invocation); n. 3, supra
(adequacy of warnings). Yet Miranda requires those lines
to be drawn with precision in each case.

The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other
hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without re507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
sort to formal and dispositive labels. By dispensing with
the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions
that are often better answered in shades and degrees, the
voluntariness inquiry often can make judicial decisionmaking
easier rather than more onerous. Thus, it is true that the
existence of warnings is still a consideration under the
totality-of-the-circumstances approach, ante, at 693-694, but
it is unnecessary to determine conclusively whether "custody" existed and triggered the warning requirement, or
whether the warnings given were sufficient. It is enough
that the habeas court look to the warnings or their absence,
along with all other factors, and consider them in deciding
what is, after all, the ultimate question: whether the confession was compelled and involuntary or the product of a free
and unimpaired will. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412
U. S., at 225-226.

Nor does continued application of Miranda's prophylactic
rule on habeas dispense with the necessity of testing confessions for voluntariness. While Miranda's conclusive presumption of coercion may sound like an impenetrable barrier
to the introduction of compelled testimony, in practice it
leaks like a sieve. Miranda, for example, does not preclude
the use of an unwarned confession outside the prosecution's
case in chief, Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971); Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714 (1975); involuntary statements, by
contrast, must be excluded from trial for all purposes,
Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 398 (1978). Miranda does
not preclude admission of the fruits of an unwarned statement, see Oregon v. Elstad, supra; but under the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments, we require the suppression of not
only compelled confessions but tainted subsequent confessions as well, Clewis v. Texas, 386 U. S. 707, 710 (1967). Finally, Miranda can fail to exclude some truly involuntary
statements: It is entirely possible to extract a compelled
statement despite the most precise and accurate of warnings.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
See Johnson, 384 U. S., at 730 (warnings are only one factorin determining voluntariness).

The Court's final rationale is that, because the federalcourts rarely issue writs for

Miranda violations, eliminating
Miranda claims from habeas will not decrease state-federal
tensions to an appreciable degree. Ante, at 694-695. Therelative infrequency of relief, however, does not diminish the

intrusion on state sovereignty; it diminishes only our justifi-cation for intruding in the first place. After all, even if relief is denied at the end of the day, the State still must divertits scarce prosecutorial resources to defend an otherwise
final conviction. If relief is truly rare, efficiency counsels in
favor of dispensing with the search for the prophylactic rule
violation in a haystack; instead, the federal courts should
concentrate on the search for true Fifth Amendment violations by adjudicating the questions of voluntariness and compulsion directly. I therefore find it of little moment that the
Police Foundation et al. support respondent. Ante, at 695,
n. 6. Those who bear the primary burden of defending state
convictions in federal courts--including 36 States and the
National District Attorneys Association-- resoundingly support the opposite side. See Brief for California et al. as
Amici Curiae; Brief for Americans for Effective Law Enforcement, Inc., and the National District Attorneys Association, Inc., as Amici Curiae; see also Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae (United States must defend against claims
raised by federal prisoners under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255).

The Court's response, that perhaps the police respect the
Miranda rule as a result of "the existence of [habeas] review," ante, at 695, is contrary to both case law and common
sense. As explained above, there is simply no reason to
think that habeas relief, which often " `strike[s] like lightning' " years after conviction, contributes much additional
deterrence beyond the threat of exclusion during state proceedings. See supra, at 704 (quoting Duckworth, 492 U. S.,
at 211 (O'Connor, J., concurring)). Accord, Friendly, 38

U. Chi. L. Rev., at 163. And our decision in Stone expresslyso held: "The view that the deterrence . . . would be furthered rests on the dubious assumption that law enforcementauthorities would fear that federal habeas review might reveal flaws . . . that went undetected at trial and on appeal."428 U. S., at 493 (footnote omitted). The majority offers no
justification for disregarding our decision in Stone; nor doesit provide any reason to question the truth of

Stone'sobservation.

IV
As the Court emphasizes today, Miranda's prophylacticrule is now 27 years old; the police and the state courts have

indeed grown accustomed to it. Ante, at 695. But it is pre-cisely because the rule is well accepted that there is little
further benefit to enforcing it on habeas. We can depend onlaw enforcement officials to administer warnings in the first
instance and the state courts to provide a remedy when lawenforcement officers err. None of the Court's asserted justifications for enforcing Miranda's prophylactic rule throughhabeas--neither reverence for the Fifth Amendment nor the
concerns of reliability, efficiency, and federalism--counsel infavor of the Court's chosen course. Indeed, in my view they
cut in precisely the opposite direction. The Court may re-consider its decision when presented with empirical data.
See ante, at 693 (noting absence of empirical data); ante, at688 (holding only that today's

argument in favor of extendingStone "falls short"). But I see little reason for such a costly

delay. Logic and experience are at our disposal now. Andthey amply demonstrate that applying Miranda's prophylactic rule on habeas does not increase the amount of justicedispensed; it only increases the frequency with which the
admittedly guilty go free. In my view, Miranda imposessuch grave costs and produces so little benefit on habeas that
its continued application is neither tolerable nor justified.Accordingly, I join Part III of the Court's opinion but respectfully dissent from the remainder.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

The issue in this case--whether the extraordinary remedyof federal habeas corpus should routinely be available for
claimed violations of Miranda rights--involves not jurisdic-tion to issue the writ, but the equity of doing so. In my
view, both the Court and Justice O'Connor disregard themost powerful equitable consideration: that Williams has already had full and fair opportunity to litigate this claim. Hehad the opportunity to raise it in the Michigan trial court;
he did so and lost. He had the opportunity to seek reviewof the trial court's judgment in the Michigan Court of Appeals; he did so and lost. Finally, he had the opportunity toseek discretionary review of that Court of Appeals judgment
in both the Michigan Supreme Court and this Court; he didso and review was denied. The question at this stage is
whether, given all that, a federal habeas court should nowreopen the issue and adjudicate the Miranda claim anew.
The answer seems to me obvious: it should not. That wouldbe the course followed by a federal habeas court reviewing
a federal conviction; it mocks our federal system to accordstate convictions less respect.

I
By statute, a federal habeas court has jurisdiction overany claim that a prisoner is "in custody in violation of the

Constitution or laws" of the United States. See 28 U. S. C.$$ 2241(c)(3), 2254(a), 2255. While that jurisdiction does require a claim of legal error in the original proceedings, cf.Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993), it is otherwise
sweeping in its breadth. As early as 1868, this Court de-scribed it in these terms:

"This legislation is of the most comprehensive charac-ter. It brings within the habeas corpus jurisdiction of
every court and of every judge every possible case ofprivation of liberty contrary to the National Constitu507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:03 PAGES OPINPGT

tion, treaties, or laws. It is impossible to widen thisjurisdiction." Ex parte McCardle, 6 Wall. 318, 325-

326 (1868).
Our later case law has confirmed that assessment. Habeasjurisdiction extends, we have held, to federal claims for

which an opportunity for full and fair litigation has alreadybeen provided in state or federal court, see

Brown v. Allen,344 U. S. 443, 458-459 (1953); Kaufman v. United States, 394

U. S. 217, 223-224 (1969), to procedurally defaulted federalclaims, including those over which this Court would have no
jurisdiction on direct review, see Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391,426, 428-429 (1963);

Kaufman, supra, at 223; Wainwright v.Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90-91 (1977); Coleman v. Thompson, 501

U. S. 722, 750 (1991), and to federal claims of a state criminaldefendant awaiting trial, see Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241,
251 (1886).But with great power comes great responsibility. Habeas
jurisdiction is tempered by the restraints that accompanythe exercise of equitable discretion. This is evident from
the text of the federal habeas statute, which provides thatwrits of habeas corpus "

may be granted"--not that theyshall be granted--and enjoins the court to "dispose of the

matter as law and justice require." 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241(a),2243 (emphases added). That acknowledgment of discretion
is merely the continuation of a long historic tradition. InEnglish law, habeas corpus was one of the so-called "prerogative" writs, which included the writs of mandamus, certio-rari, and prohibition. Duker, The English Origins of the
Writ of Habeas Corpus: A Peculiar Path to Fame, 53N. Y. U. L. Rev. 983, 984, n. 2 (1978); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 132 (1768). "[A]s in the case of all other preroga-tive writs," habeas would not issue "as of mere course," but
rather required a showing "why the extraordinary power ofthe crown is called in to the party's assistance." Ibid. And
even where the writ was issued to compel production of the

Opinion of Scalia, J.
prisoner in court, the standard applied to determine whether
relief would be accorded was equitable: The court was to
"determine whether the case of [the prisoner's] commitment
be just, and thereupon do as to justice shall appertain." 1
id., at 131.

This Court has frequently rested its habeas decisions on
equitable principles. In one of the earliest federal habeas
cases, Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 201 (1830), Chief Justice
Marshall wrote: "No doubt exists respecting the power [of
the Court to issue the writ]; the question is, whether this be
a case in which it ought to be exercised." And in Ex parte
Royall, the Court, while affirming that a federal habeas
court had "the power" to discharge a state prisoner awaiting
trial, held that it was "not bound in every case to exercise
such a power." 117 U. S., at 251. The federal habeas statute did "not deprive the court of discretion," which "should
be exercised in the light of the relations existing, under our
system of government, between the judicial tribunals of the
Union and of the States." Ibid.

This doctrine continues to be reflected in our modern
cases. In declining to extend habeas relief to all cases of
state procedural default, the Court in Fay v. Noia said: "Discretion is implicit in the statutory command that the judge
. . . `dispose of the matter as law and justice require,' 28
U. S. C. $ 2243; and discretion was the flexible concept employed by the federal courts in developing the exhaustion
rule." 372 U. S., at 438. See also Wainwright v. Sykes,
supra, at 88. In fashioning this Court's retroactivity doctrine, the plurality in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 308-310
(1989), also relied on equitable considerations. And in a case
announced today, holding that the harmless-error standard
for habeas corpus is less onerous than the one for direct
review, the Court carries on this tradition by expressly considering equitable principles such as "finality," "comity,"
and "federalism." Brecht v. Abrahamson, ante, at 635-636.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Indeed, as Justice O'Connor notes, this Court's jurispru-dence has defined the scope of habeas corpus largely by

means of such equitable principles. See ante, at 698-700(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). The use
of these principles, which serve as "gateway[s]" throughwhich a habeas petitioner must pass before proceeding to the
merits of a constitutional claim, "is grounded in the `equita-ble discretion' of habeas courts."

Herrera v. Collins, supra,at 404.

II
As the Court today acknowledges, see ante, at 686-687,the rule of

Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976), is simplyone application of equitable discretion. It does not deny a

federal habeas court jurisdiction over Fourth Amendmentclaims, but merely holds that the court ought not to entertain
them when the petitioner has already had an opportunity tolitigate them fully and fairly. See

id., at 495, n. 37. It istherefore not correct to say that applying Stone to the present case involves "eliminating review of Miranda claims"from federal habeas, ante, at 693, or that the Court is being
"asked to exclude a substantive category of issues from relit-igation on habeas," ante, at 700 (

O'Connor, J., concurring inpart and dissenting in part). And it is therefore unnecessary to discuss at length the value of Miranda rights, asthough it has been proposed that since they are particularly
worthless they deserve specially disfavored treatment. Theproposed rule would treat Miranda claims no differently
from all other claims, taking account of all equitable factors,including the opportunity for full and fair litigation, in determining whether to provide habeas review. Wherein Miranda and Fourth Amendment claims differ from some otherclaims, is that the most significant countervailing equitable

factor (possibility that the assigned error produced the con-viction of an innocent person) will ordinarily not exist.

At common law, the opportunity for full and fair litigationof an issue at trial and (if available) direct appeal was not

Opinion of Scalia, J.
only a factor weighing against reaching the merits of anissue on habeas; it was a

conclusive factor, unless the issue
was a legal issue going to the jurisdiction of the trial court.See

Ex parte Watkins, supra, at 202-203; W. Church, Habeas
Corpus $ 363 (1884). Beginning in the late 19th century,
however, that rule was gradually relaxed, by the device ofholding that various illegalities deprived the trial court of

jurisdiction. See, e. g., Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 176(1874) (no jurisdiction to impose second sentence in violation
of Double Jeopardy Clause); Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371,376-377 (1880) (no jurisdiction to try defendant for violation
of unconstitutional statute); Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309
(1915) (no jurisdiction to conduct trial in atmosphere of mob
domination); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923) (same);
Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 468 (1938) (no jurisdiction
to conduct trial that violated defendant's Sixth Amendment
right to counsel). See generally Wright v. West, 505 U. S.
277, 285-286 (1992) (opinion of Thomas, J.); Fay, supra, at
450-451 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Finally, the jurisdictional
line was openly abandoned in Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S.
101, 104-105 (1942). See P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, &
D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the
Federal System 1502 (3d ed. 1988) (hereinafter Hart and
Wechsler).

But to say that prior opportunity for full and fair litigation
no longer automatically precludes from consideration even
nonjurisdictional issues is not to say that such prior opportunity is no longer a relevant equitable factor. Reason would
suggest that it must be, and Stone v. Powell, supra, establishes that it is. Thus, the question before us is not whether
a holding unique to Fourth Amendment claims (and resting
upon nothing more principled than our estimation that
Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are not very important)
should be expanded to some other arbitrary category beyond
that; but rather, whether the general principle that is the
only valid justification for Stone v. Powell should for some

reason not be applied to Miranda claims. I think the an-swer to that question is clear: Prior opportunity to litigate

an issue should be an important equitable consideration inany habeas case, and should ordinarily preclude the court
from reaching the merits of a claim, unless it goes to thefairness of the trial process or to the accuracy of the ultimate result.Our case law since

Stone is entirely consistent with thisview. As the Court notes, ante, at 687-688, we have held

that the rule in Stone does not apply in three cases. Kimmel-man v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), involved alleged denial of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which unques-tionably goes to the fairness of the trial process.

Rose v.Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545 (1979), involved alleged discrimination by the trial court in violation of the Fourteenth Amend-ment. We concluded that since the "same trial court will be
the court that initially must decide the merits of such aclaim," and since the claim involved an assertion that "the
state judiciary itself has purposely violated the Equal Pro-tection Clause," no opportunity for a full and fair state hearing existed. Id., at 561; see also id., at 563. And Jacksonv.

Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), involved a claim that "norational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond

a reasonable doubt," id., at 324, which is obviously a directchallenge to the accuracy of the ultimate result.

III
The rule described above--or indeed a rule even some-what more limiting of habeas review than that--is followed

in federal postconviction review of federal convictions under28 U. S. C. $ 2255. In

Kaufman v. United States, 394 U. S.217 (1969), which held that res judicata does not bar $ 2255

habeas review of constitutional issues, we stated that a dis-trict court had "discretion" to refuse to reach the merits of
a constitutional claim that had already been raised and re-solved against the prisoner at trial and on direct review.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Id., at 227, n. 8. Since Kaufman, federal courts have uniformly held that, absent countervailing considerations, district courts may refuse to reach the merits of a constitutional
claim previously raised and rejected on direct appeal. See,
e. g., Giacalone v. United States, 739 F. 2d 40, 42-43 (CA2
1984); United States v. Orejuela, 639 F. 2d 1055, 1057 (CA3
1981); Stephan v. United States, 496 F. 2d 527, 528-529 (CA6
1974), cert. denied sub nom. Marchesani v. United States,
423 U. S. 861 (1975); see also 3 C. Wright, Federal Practice
and Procedure $ 593, p. 439, n. 26 (1982); Note, Developments
in the Law--Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038,
1064-1066 (1970). Thus, a prior opportunity for full and fair
litigation is normally dispositive of a federal prisoner's habeas claim. If the claim was raised and rejected on direct
review, the habeas court will not readjudicate it absent countervailing equitable considerations; if the claim was not
raised, it is procedurally defaulted and the habeas court will
not adjudicate it absent countervailing equitable considerations (e. g., actual innocence or cause and prejudice, see
United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152 (1982)).

Because lower federal courts have not generally recognized their discretion to deny habeas relief in state cases
where opportunity for full and fair litigation was accorded,
the peculiar state of current federal habeas practice is this:
State courts routinely see their criminal convictions vacated
by federal district judges, but federal courts see their criminal convictions afforded a substantial measure of finality and
respect. See Hart and Wechsler 1585. Only one theory can
possibly justify this disparity--the theory advanced in Fay
v. Noia, that a federal forum must be afforded for every federal claim of a state criminal defendant.* See 372 U. S., at

*Of course a federal forum is theoretically available in this Court, by
writ of certiorari. Quite obviously, however, this mode of review cannot
be generally applied due to practical limitations. See Stone v. Powell,
428 U. S. 465, 526 (1976) (Brennan, J., dissenting).

Opinion of Scalia, J.
418. In my view, that theory is profoundly wrong for sev-eral reasons.

First, it has its origin in a misreading of our early prece-dents.

Fay interpreted the holding of Ex parte Royall--
that federal courts had discretion not to entertain the habeas
claims of state prisoners prior to the conclusion of state-courtproceedings--as containing the implication that

after conclusion of those proceedings there would be plenary federal re-view of

all constitutional claims. 372 U. S., at 420. In fact,
however, Royall had noted and affirmed the common-lawrule that claims of error not going to the jurisdiction of the

convicting court could ordinarily be entertained only on writ
of error, not on habeas corpus. 117 U. S., at 253. See Fay,
supra, at 453-454 (Harlan, J., dissenting). See also Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 255 (1973) (Powell, J.,
concurring). Royall contained no hint of a suggestion that
a federal habeas court should afford state-court judgments
less respect than federal-court judgments. To the contrary,
it maintained the traditional view that federal and state
courts have equal responsibility for the protection of federal
constitutional rights. The discretion of the federal habeas
court "should be exercised," it said, "in the light of the relations existing, under our system of government, between the
judicial tribunals of the Union and of the States, . . . courts
equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the
Constitution." 117 U. S., at 251. And in describing the
proper disposition of a federal habeas petition filed after
state conviction, Royall cited Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163
(1874), which involved a federal habeas attack on a federal
conviction. See 117 U. S., at 253. Thus, Royall is properly
understood as saying that the federal habeas statute guaranteed state prisoners, not a federal forum for all their federal
claims, but rather the same rights to federal habeas relief
that federal prisoners possessed.

Worse than misreading case precedent, however, the federal right/federal forum theory misperceives the basic struc507us3$59K 11-26-96 17:09:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Scalia, J.
ture of our national system. That structure establishes this
Court as the supreme judicial interpreter of the Federal
Constitution and laws, but gives other federal courts no
higher or more respected a role than state courts in applying
that "Law of the Land"--which it says all state courts are
bound by, and all state judges must be sworn to uphold.
U. S. Const., Art. VI. See Robb v. Connolly, 111 U. S. 624,
637 (1884); Ex parte Royall, supra, at 251; Brown, 344 U. S.,
at 499 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). It would be a strange
constitution that regards state courts as second-rate instruments for the vindication of federal rights and yet makes no
mandatory provision for lower federal courts (as our Constitution does not). And it would be an unworkable constitution that requires redetermination in federal courts of all
issues of pervasive federal constitutional law that arise in
state-court litigation.

Absent indication to the contrary, state courts should be
presumed to have applied federal law as faithfully as federal
courts. See Ex parte Royall, supra, at 252; Brecht v. Abrahamson, ante, at 636. A federal court entertaining collateral attack against a state criminal conviction should accord
the same measure of respect and finality as it would to a
federal criminal conviction. As it exercises equitable discretion to determine whether the merits of constitutional
claims will be reached in the one, it should exercise a similar
discretion for the other. The distinction that has arisen in
lower court practice is unsupported in law, utterly impractical and demeaning to the States in its consequences, and
must be eliminated.

* * *

While I concur in Part III of the Court's opinion, I cannot
agree with the rest of its analysis. I would reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for a
determination whether, given that respondent has already
been afforded an opportunity for full and fair litigation in the

UNITED STATES v. OLANO et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1306. Argued December 9, 1992--Decided April 26, 1993
Two of the fourteen jurors selected to hear evidence in respondents' criminal trial were identified as alternates before jury deliberations began.
The District Court, without objection from respondents, permitted the
alternates to attend the deliberations, instructing them that they should
not participate, and respondents were convicted on a number of charges.
The Court of Appeals vacated respondents' convictions. It concluded,
inter alia, that the alternates' presence during deliberations violated
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c), which requires that alternate
jurors be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict. The
court found that the alternates' presence in violation of Rule 24(c) was
inherently prejudicial and reversible per se under the "plain error"
standard of Rule 52(b).

Held: The presence of the alternate jurors during jury deliberations was

not an error that the Court of Appeals was authorized to correct under
Rule 52(b). Pp. 731-741.

(a) A court of appeals has discretion under Rule 52(b) to correct "plain
errors or defects affecting substantial rights" that were forfeited because not timely raised in the district court, which it should exercise
only if the errors "seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings," United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157,
160. There are three limitations on appellate authority under Rule
52(b). First, there must be an "error." A deviation from a legal rule
during the district court proceedings is an error unless the defendant
has waived the rule. Mere forfeiture does not extinguish an error. Second, the error must be "plain," a term synonymous with "clear" or,
equivalently, "obvious." Third, the plain error must "affec[t] substantial rights," which normally means that the error must be prejudicial,
affecting the outcome of the district court proceedings. Normally a
court of appeals engages in a specific analysis of the district court's
record to determine prejudice, and the defendant bears the burden of
persuasion. This Court need not decide whether the phrase "affecting
substantial rights" is always synonymous with "prejudicial" or whether
there are errors that should be presumed prejudicial. Pp. 731-735.

(b) The language of Rule 52(b), the nature of forfeiture, and the established appellate practice that Congress intended to continue, all point to

507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT
726 UNITED STATES v. OLANO

Syllabus
the conclusion that the Rule is permissive, not mandatory. The standard that should guide the exercise of remedial discretion was articulated
in United States v. Atkinson, supra, at 160. The remedy is not limited
to cases of actual innocence, since an error may "seriously affect the
fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings" independent of the defendant's innocence. However, a plain error affecting
substantial rights does not, without more, satisfy the Atkinson standard, for otherwise the discretion afforded by Rule 52(b) would be illusory. Pp. 735-737.

(c) The Government concedes that the deviation from Rule 24(c) in
this case was an "error" that was "plain." However, that deviation did
not "affec[t] substantial rights." The presence of alternates during jury
deliberations is the type of error that must be analyzed for prejudicial
impact. While their presence contravened the cardinal principle that
jury deliberations shall remain private and secret, the purpose of such
privacy is to protect deliberations from improper influence. Whether a
presumption of prejudice is imposed or a specific analysis is made does
not change the ultimate inquiry: Did the intrusion affect the jury's deliberations and thereby its verdict? See, e. g., Parker v. Gladden, 385 U. S.
363 (per curiam). Respondents have made no specific showing that the
alternates either participated in, or "chilled," the jury's deliberations.
Nor can prejudice be presumed. The Court of Appeals erred in presuming that the alternates failed to follow the judge's instructions, see
Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206, and the alternates' mere presence did not entail a sufficient risk of "chill" to justify a presumption of
prejudice on that score. Since the error was not prejudicial, there is
no need to consider whether it would have warranted correction under
the Atkinson standard. Pp. 737-741.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question in this case is whether the presence of alter-nate jurors during jury deliberations was a "plain error" that

the Court of Appeals was authorized to correct under Fed-eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b).

I
Each of the respondents, Guy W. Olano, Jr., and RaymondM. Gray, served on the board of directors of a savings and

loan association. In 1986, the two were indicted in theWestern District of Washington on multiple federal charges
for their participation in an elaborate loan "kickback"scheme. Their joint jury trial with five other codefendants
commenced in March 1987. All of the parties agreed that14 jurors would be selected to hear the case, and that the 2
alternates would be identified before deliberations began.On May 26, shortly before the end of the 3-month trial,
the District Court suggested to the defendants that the twoalternate jurors, soon to be identified, might be allowed to
attend deliberations along with the regular jurors:

". . . I'd just like you to think about it, you have a day,let me know, it's just a suggestion and you can--if there

is even one person who doesn't like it we won't do it, butit is a suggestion that other courts have followed in long
cases where jurors have sat through a lot of testimony,and that is to let the alternates go in but not participate,
but just to sit in on deliberations."It's strictly a matter of courtesy and I know many
judges have done it with no objections from counsel.One of the other things it does is if they don't participate
but they're there, if an emergency comes up and peopledecide they'd rather go with a new alternate rather than
11, which the rules provide, it keeps that option open.It also keeps people from feeling they've sat here for
three months and then get just kind of kicked out. Butit's certainly not worth--unless it's something you all

Opinion of the Court
agree to, it's not worth your spending time hasslingabout, you know what I mean? You've got too much

else on your mind. I don't want it to be a big issue;it's just a suggestion. Think about it and let me know."
App. 79.
The matter arose again the next day, in an ambiguousexchange between Gray's counsel and the District Court:

"THE COURT: [H]ave you given any more thoughtas to whether you want the alternates to go in and not
participate, or do you want them out?"MR. ROBISON [counsel for Gray]: We would ask
they not."THE COURT: Not." App. 82.

One day later, on May 28, the last day of trial, the DistrictCourt for a third time asked the defendants whether they
wanted the alternate jurors to retire into the jury room.Counsel for defendant Davy Hilling gave an unequivocal,
affirmative answer.

"THE COURT: Well, Counsel, I received your alter-nates. Do I understand that the defendants now--it's

hard to keep up with you, Counsel. It's sort of a dayby day--but that's all right. You do all agree that all
fourteen deliberate?"Okay. Do you want me to instruct the two alternates not to participate in deliberation?"MR. KELLOGG [counsel for Hilling]: That's what I

was on my feet to say. It's my understanding that theconversation was the two alternates go back there instructed that they are not to take part in any fashion inthe deliberations." App. 86.

This discussion, like the preceding two, took place outsidethe hearing of the jurors. As before, both Gray's counsel
and Olano's counsel were present. Gray, too, attended allthree discussions. Olano may not have attended the third--

Opinion of the Court
he claims that the Marshal failed to return him to the court-room in time--but he was present at the first two.

The District Court concluded that Hilling's counsel wasspeaking for the other defendants as well as his own client.
None of the other counsel intervened during the colloquy
between the District Court and Hilling's counsel on May 28,nor did anyone object later the same day when the court

instructed the jurors that the two alternates would be per-mitted to attend deliberations. The court instructed:

"We have indicated to you that the parties would be selecting alternates at this time. I am going to inform
you who those alternates are, but before I do, let me tellyou, I think it was a difficult selection for all concerned,

and since the law requires that there be a jury of twelve,it is only going to be a jury of twelve. But what we
would like to do in this case is have all of you go backso that even the alternates can be there for the deliberations, but according to the law, the alternates must not
participate in the deliberations. It's going to be hard,but if you are an alternate, we think you should be there

because things do happen in the course of lengthy jurydeliberations, and if you need to step in, we want you to
be able to step in having heard the deliberations. Butwe are going to ask that you not participate.

"The alternates are Norman Sargent and ShirleyKinsella. I am going to ask at this time now, ladies and
gentlemen, that you retire to the jury room and begin
your deliberations." App. 89-90.

During deliberations, one of the alternate jurors was excused
at his request. The other alternate remained until the jury
returned with its verdict.

Both respondents were convicted on a number of charges.
They appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. 934 F. 2d 1425 (1991). The Court of Appeals
reversed certain counts for insufficient evidence and then

507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT
730 UNITED STATES v. OLANO

Opinion of the Court
considered whether the presence of alternate jurors duringjury deliberations violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c):

"The court may direct that not more than 6 jurors inaddition to the regular jury be called and impanelled to

sit as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors in the orderin which they are called shall replace jurors who, prior
to the time the jury retires to consider its verdict, be-come or are found to be unable or disqualified to perform
their duties. . . . An alternate juror who does not replacea regular juror shall be discharged after the jury retires
to consider its verdict."
Because respondents had not objected to the alternates'presence, the court applied a "plain error" standard under

Rule 52(b). Noting that "[w]e have not previously directlyresolved the question of the validity of a verdict when alternate jurors are permitted to be present during the jury'sdeliberations," the court relied on the "language of Rule
24(c), Rule 23(b), the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 23,and related Ninth Circuit precedent" to hold that Rule 24(c)
barred alternate jurors from attending jury deliberationsunless the defendant, on the record, explicitly consented to
their attendance. 934 F. 2d, at 1436-1437. The court foundthat Rule 24(c) was violated in the instant case, because "the
district court did not obtain individual waivers from eachdefendant personally, either orally or in writing."

Id., at1438. It then held that the presence of alternates in violation of Rule 24(c) was "inherently prejudicial" and reversibleper se. Ibid.

"We cannot fairly ascertain whether in a given casethe alternate jurors followed the district court's prohibition on participation. However, even if they heeded theletter of the court's instructions and remained orally
mute throughout, it is entirely possible that their atti-tudes, conveyed by facial expressions, gestures or the

like, may have had some effect upon the decision of oneor more jurors." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and

brackets omitted).
Finally, in a footnote, the court decided that "[b]ecause theviolation is inherently prejudicial and because it infringes

upon a substantial right of the defendants, it falls within theplain error doctrine."

Id., at 1439, n. 23.The Court of Appeals vacated respondents' remaining convictions and did not reach the other "substantial issues" thatthey had raised.

Id., at 1428, n. 3. We granted certiorarito clarify the standard for "plain error" review by the courts

of appeals under Rule 52(b). 504 U. S. 908 (1992).

II
"No procedural principle is more familiar to this Courtthan that a constitutional right," or a right of any other sort,

"may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by thefailure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal
having jurisdiction to determine it." Yakus v. United
States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944). Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 52(b), which governs on appeal from criminal proceedings, provides a court of appeals a limited power to cor-rect errors that were forfeited because not timely raised in
district court. The Rule has remained unchanged since theoriginal version of the Criminal Rules, and was intended as
"a restatement of existing law." Advisory Committee'sNotes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 833.
It is paired, appropriately, with Rule 52(a), which governsnonforfeited errors. Rule 52 provides:

"(a) Harmless Error. Any error, defect, irregu-larity or variance which does not affect substantial
rights shall be disregarded."(b)

Plain Error. Plain errors or defects affectingsubstantial rights may be noticed although they were

not brought to the attention of the court."

732 UNITED STATES v. OLANO

Opinion of the Court
Although "[a] rigid and undeviating judicially declaredpractice under which courts of review would invariably and

under all circumstances decline to consider all questionswhich had not previously been specifically urged would be
out of harmony with . . . the rules of fundamental justice,"
Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552, 557 (1941), the authoritycreated by Rule 52(b) is circumscribed. There must be an

"error" that is "plain" and that "affect[s] substantial rights."Moreover, Rule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the
forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court ofappeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion
unless the error " `seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity orpublic reputation of judicial proceedings.' "

United States v.Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15 (1985) (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)).

A
Rule 52(b) defines a single category of forfeited-but-reversible error. Although it is possible to read the Rule in

the disjunctive, as creating two separate categories--"plainerrors" and "defects affecting substantial rights"--that reading is surely wrong. See Young, 470 U. S., at 15, n. 12 (de-clining to adopt disjunctive reading). As we explained in
Young, the phrase "error or defect" is more simply read as"error." Ibid. The forfeited error "may be noticed" only if
it is "plain" and "affect[s] substantial rights." More pre-cisely, a court of appeals may correct the error (either vacating for a new trial, or reversing outright) only if it meetsthese criteria. The appellate court must consider the error,
putative or real, in deciding whether the judgment belowshould be overturned, but cannot provide that remedy unless
Rule 52(b) applies (or unless some other provision authorizesthe error's correction, an issue that respondents do not
raise).The first limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b)
is that there indeed be an "error." Deviation from a legal

733Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
rule is "error" unless the rule has been waived. For exam-ple, a defendant who knowingly and voluntarily pleads guilty

in conformity with the requirements of Rule 11 cannot havehis conviction vacated by a court of appeals on the ground
that he ought to have had a trial. Because the right to trial
is waivable, and because the defendant who enters a validguilty plea waives that right, his conviction without a trial

is not "error."Waiver is different from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture is
the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver isthe "intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known
right." Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938); see, e. g.,
Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 894, n. 2 (1991)
(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
(distinguishing between "waiver" and "forfeiture"); Spritzer,
Criminal Waiver, Procedural Default and the Burger Court,
126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 473, 474-477 (1978) (same); Westen, Away
from Waiver: A Rationale for the Forfeiture of Constitutional
Rights in Criminal Procedure, 75 Mich. L. Rev. 1214, 1214-
1215 (1977) (same). Whether a particular right is waivable;
whether the defendant must participate personally in the
waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver;
and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake. See,
e. g., 2 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure $ 11.6
(1984) (allocation of authority between defendant and counsel); Dix, Waiver in Criminal Procedure: A Brief for More
Careful Analysis, 55 Texas L. Rev. 193 (1977) (waivability
and standards for waiver). Mere forfeiture, as opposed to
waiver, does not extinguish an "error" under Rule 52(b). Although in theory it could be argued that "[i]f the question
was not presented to the trial court no error was committed
by the trial court, hence there is nothing to review," Orfield,
The Scope of Appeal in Criminal Cases, 84 U. Pa. L. Rev.
825, 840 (1936), this is not the theory that Rule 52(b) adopts.
If a legal rule was violated during the district court proceed507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT
734 UNITED STATES v. OLANO

Opinion of the Court
ings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then therehas been an "error" within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite

the absence of a timely objection.The second limitation on appellate authority under Rule
52(b) is that the error be "plain." "Plain" is synonymous
with "clear" or, equivalently, "obvious." See Young, supra,at 17, n. 14;

United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 163 (1982).
We need not consider the special case where the error wasunclear at the time of trial but becomes clear on appeal because the applicable law has been clarified. At a minimum,a court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule
52(b) unless the error is clear under current law.

The third and final limitation on appellate authority under
Rule 52(b) is that the plain error "affec[t] substantial rights."
This is the same language employed in Rule 52(a), and in
most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court
proceedings. See, e. g., Bank of Nova Scotia v. United
States, 487 U. S. 250, 255-257 (1988); United States v. Lane,
474 U. S. 438, 454-464 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part); Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S.
750, 758-765 (1946). When the defendant has made a timely
objection to an error and Rule 52(a) applies, a court of appeals normally engages in a specific analysis of the district
court record--a so-called "harmless error" inquiry--to determine whether the error was prejudicial. Rule 52(b) normally requires the same kind of inquiry, with one important
difference: It is the defendant rather than the Government
who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice. In most cases, a court of appeals cannot correct the
forfeited error unless the defendant shows that the error
was prejudicial. See Young, supra, at 17, n. 14 ("[F]ederal
courts have consistently interpreted the plain-error doctrine
as requiring an appellate court to find that the claimed error
. . . had [a] prejudicial impact on the jury's deliberations").
This burden shifting is dictated by a subtle but important

Opinion of the Court
difference in language between the two parts of Rule 52:While Rule 52(a) precludes error correction only if the error

"does not affect substantial rights" (emphasis added), Rule52(b) authorizes no remedy unless the error does "affec[t]
substantial rights." See also Note, Appellate Review in aCriminal Case of Errors Made Below Not Properly Raised
and Reserved, 23 Miss. L. J. 42, 57 (1951) (summarizing exist-ing law) ("The error must be real and such that it probably
influenced the verdict . . .").We need not decide whether the phrase "affecting substantial rights" is always synonymous with "prejudicial." Seegenerally

Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)(constitutional error may not be found harmless if error deprives defendant of the " `basic protections [without which] acriminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle
for determination of guilt or innocence, and no criminal pun-ishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair' ") (quoting
Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 577-578 (1986)). There may bea special category of forfeited errors that can be corrected
regardless of their effect on the outcome, but this issue neednot be addressed. Nor need we address those errors that
should be presumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot makea specific showing of prejudice. Normally, although perhaps
not in every case, the defendant must make a specific show-ing of prejudice to satisfy the "affecting substantial rights"
prong of Rule 52(b). B

Rule 52(b) is permissive, not mandatory. If the forfeitederror is "plain" and "affect[s] substantial rights," the court
of appeals has authority to order correction, but is notrequired to do so. The language of the Rule ("may be noticed"), the nature of forfeiture, and the established appellatepractice that Congress intended to continue all point to this
conclusion. "[I]n criminal cases, where the life, or as in thiscase the liberty, of the defendant is at stake, the courts of
the United States, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may

Proc. Rule 52(b), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 833) (" `[T]he court, at its
option, may notice a plain error not assigned or specified' ").We previously have explained that the discretion conferred by Rule 52(b) should be employed " `in those circum-stances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise
result.' " Young, 470 U. S., at 15 (quoting Frady, supra, at163, n. 14). In our collateral-review jurisprudence, the term

"miscarriage of justice" means that the defendant is actually
innocent. See, e. g., Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 339-
340 (1992). The court of appeals should no doubt correct a
plain forfeited error that causes the conviction or sentencing
of an actually innocent defendant, see, e. g., Wiborg v. United
States, 163 U. S. 632 (1896), but we have never held that a
Rule 52(b) remedy is only warranted in cases of actual
innocence.

Rather, the standard that should guide the exercise of remedial discretion under Rule 52(b) was articulated in United
States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157 (1936). The court of appeals should correct a plain forfeited error affecting substantial rights if the error "seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings." Id., at
160. As we explained in Young, the "standard laid down in
United States v. Atkinson [was] codified in Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 52(b)," 470 U. S., at 7, and we repeatedly
have quoted the Atkinson language in describing plain-error
review, see id., at 15; Frady, supra, at 163, n. 13; Silber
v. United States, 370 U. S. 717, 718 (1962) (per curiam); Johnson v. United States, 318 U. S. 189, 200 (1943); United States

Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 421, n. 19 (1977) (civil appeal).

Opinion of the Court
defendant's innocence. Conversely, a plain error affectingsubstantial rights does not, without more, satisfy the Atkinson standard, for otherwise the discretion afforded by Rule52(b) would be illusory.

With these basic principles in mind, we turn to the in-stant case.

III
The presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberationsis no doubt a deviation from Rule 24(c). The Rule explicitly

states: "An alternate juror who does not replace a regularjuror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its
verdict." It is a separate question whether such deviationamounts to "error" when the defendant consents to the alternates' presence. The Government supposes that there wasindeed an "error" in this case, on the premise that Rule 24(c)
is nonwaivable, see Reply Brief for United States 9, n. 4,and we assume without deciding that this premise is correct.
The Government also essentially concedes that the "error"was "plain." See

id., at 8-9, and n. 4.We therefore focus our attention on whether the error "affect[ed] substantial rights" within the meaning of Rule 52(b),and conclude that it did not. The presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations is not the kind of error that"affect[s] substantial rights" independent of its prejudicial
impact. Nor have respondents made a specific showing ofprejudice. Finally, we see no reason to presume prejudice
here.Assuming

arguendo that certain errors "affec[t] substan-tial rights" independent of prejudice, the instant violation of

Rule 24(c) is not such an error. Although the presence ofalternate jurors does contravene " `the cardinal principle
that the deliberations of the jury shall remain private andsecret,' " Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 23(b), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 785 (quoting United States v.
Virginia Erection Corp., 335 F. 2d 868, 872 (CA4 1964)), theprimary if not exclusive purpose of jury privacy and secrecy

Opinion of the Court
is to protect the jury's deliberations from improper influence.
"[I]f no harm resulted from this intrusion [of an alternate
juror into the jury room,] reversal would be pointless."
United States v. Watson, 669 F. 2d 1374, 1391 (CA11 1982).
We generally have analyzed outside intrusions upon the jury
for prejudicial impact. See, e. g., Parker v. Gladden, 385
U. S. 363 (1967) (per curiam) (bailiff 's comments to jurors,
such as "Oh that wicked fellow he is guilty," were prejudicial); Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984) (pretrial publicity
was not prejudicial); Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 (1986)
(presence of uniformed state troopers in courtroom was not
prejudicial). A prime example is Remmer v. United States,
347 U. S. 227 (1954), where an outsider had communicated
with a juror during a criminal trial, appearing to offer a
bribe, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation then had
investigated the incident. We noted that "[t]he sending of
an F. B. I. agent in the midst of a trial to investigate a juror
as to his conduct is bound to impress the juror," and remanded for the District Court to "determine the circumstances, the impact thereof upon the juror, and whether or
not it was prejudicial, in a hearing with all interested parties
permitted to participate." Id., at 229-230.

This "intrusion" jurisprudence was summarized in Smith
v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209 (1982):

"[D]ue process does not require a new trial every time
a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising
situation. Were that the rule, few trials would be constitutionally acceptable. . . . [I]t is virtually impossible to
shield jurors from every contact or influence that might
theoretically affect their vote. Due process means a
jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the
evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to
prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the
effect of such occurrences when they happen." Id., at
217.

Opinion of the Court
There may be cases where an intrusion should be presumedprejudicial, see,

e. g., Patton, supra, at 1031-1035; Turner v.
Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466 (1965), but a presumption of preju-dice as opposed to a specific analysis does not change the

ultimate inquiry: Did the intrusion affect the jury's deliberations and thereby its verdict? We cannot imagine why egre-gious comments by a bailiff to a juror

(Parker) or an apparent bribe followed by an official investigation (Remmer)should be evaluated in terms of "prejudice," while the mere

presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations shouldnot. Of course, the issue here is whether the alternates'
presence sufficed to establish remedial authority under Rule
52(b), not whether it violated the Sixth Amendment or Due
Process Clause, but we see no reason to depart from the
normal interpretation of the phrase "affecting substantial
rights."

The question, then, is whether the instant violation of Rule
24(c) prejudiced respondents, either specifically or presumptively. In theory, the presence of alternate jurors during
jury deliberations might prejudice a defendant in two different ways: either because the alternates actually participated
in the deliberations, verbally or through "body language"; or
because the alternates' presence exerted a "chilling" effect
on the regular jurors. See Watson, supra, at 1391; United
States v. Allison, 481 F. 2d 468, 472 (CA5 1973). Conversely,
"if the alternate in fact abided by the court's instructions to
remain orally silent and not to otherwise indicate his views
or attitude . . . and if the presence of the alternate did not
operate as a restraint upon the regular jurors' freedom of
expression and action, we see little substantive difference
between the presence of [the alternate] and the presence in
the juryroom of an unexamined book which had not been
admitted into evidence." Id., at 472.

Respondents have made no specific showing that the alternate jurors in this case either participated in the jury's deliberations or "chilled" deliberation by the regular jurors. We

507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT
740 UNITED STATES v. OLANO

Opinion of the Court
need not decide whether testimony on this score by the alter-nate jurors or the regular jurors, through affidavits or at a

Remmer-like hearing, would violate Federal Rule of Evi-dence 606(b), compare

Watson, supra, at 1391-1392, and
n. 17, with United States v. Beasley, 464 F. 2d 468 (CA10
1972), or whether the courts of appeals have authority toremand for

Remmer-like hearings on plain-error review. Respondents have never requested a hearing, and thus the rec-ord before us contains no direct evidence that the alternate

jurors influenced the verdict. On this record, we are notpersuaded that the instant violation of Rule 24(c) was actually prejudicial.

Nor will we presume prejudice for purposes of the Rule
52(b) analysis here. The Court of Appeals was incorrect in
finding the error "inherently prejudicial." 934 F. 2d, at
1439. Until the close of trial, the 2 alternate jurors were
indistinguishable from the 12 regular jurors. Along with
the regular jurors, they commenced their office with an oath,
see Tr. 212 (Mar. 2, 1987), received the normal initial admonishment, see id., at 212-218, heard the same evidence and
arguments, and were not identified as alternates until after
the District Court gave a final set of instructions, see App.
89-90. In those instructions, the District Court specifically
enjoined the jurors that "according to the law, the alternates
must not participate in the deliberations," and reiterated,
"we are going to ask that you not participate." Ibid. The
Court of Appeals should not have supposed that this injunction was contravened. "[It is] the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions." Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987). "[We] presum[e]
that jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attend
closely the particular language of the trial court's instructions in a criminal case and strive to understand, make sense
of, and follow the instructions given them." Francis v.
Franklin, 471 U. S. 307, 324, n. 9 (1985). See also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984) (in assessing

prejudice for purposes of ineffective-assistance claim, "acourt should presume . . . that the judge or jury acted according to law"). Nor do we think that the mere presence ofalternate jurors entailed a sufficient risk of "chill" to justify
a presumption of prejudice on that score.

In sum, respondents have not met their burden of showingprejudice under Rule 52(b). Whether the Government

could have met its burden of showing the absence of preju-dice, under Rule 52(a), if respondents had not forfeited their
claim of error, is not at issue here. This is a plain-error case,and it is respondents who must persuade the appellate court
that the deviation from Rule 24(c) was prejudicial.Because the conceded error in this case did not "affec[t]
substantial rights," the Court of Appeals had no authority
to correct it. We need not consider whether the error,
if prejudicial, would have warranted correction under the
Atkinson standard as "seriously affect[ing] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings." The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion and add this brief statement to
express my own understanding of the Court's holding.

When a court notices an error on its own initiative under
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), see Silber v.
United States, 370 U. S. 717, 718 (1962) (per curiam), it may
be awkward to say that the case is decided by burden of
proof concepts, for by definition none of the parties have addressed the issue. But the Court's opinion is phrased with
care to indicate that burden of proof concepts are the normal
or usual mode of analysis of error under Rule 52, see ante,
at 734-735, and so other rules may apply where the aggrieved party has not raised the issue. In most cases, how507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., concurring
ever, the party will have raised the alleged error on appeal.
In that context, the analysis the Court adopts today is helpful, for it gives operative effect to the difference under Rule
52 between those cases where an objection has been preserved and those where it has not.

That leads me to a final point, which is the independent
force of the Rule against permitting alternates in the jury
room during deliberations. As the Court is careful to note,
this case was submitted on the assumption that it is error to
follow this practice, and the Court does not question that
premise. Indeed, there are good reasons to suppose that
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c) is the product of a
judgment that our jury system should be given a stable and
constant structure, one that cannot be varied by a court with
or without the consent of the parties. See Reply Brief for
United States 9, n. 4. In the course of a lengthy trial, defense counsel, who may have numerous requests for rulings
pending before a district court, may acquiesce in a proposal
from the bench concerning jury composition so that counsel
can concentrate on matters they deem more pressing. In
such a climate, the trial court ought not to put counsel in the
position of having to object to a suggestion that compromises
the Federal Rules.

If there were a case in which a specific objection had been
made and overruled, the systemic costs resulting from the
Rule 24(c) violation would likely be significant, since it would
seem to me most difficult for the Government to show the
absence of prejudice, which would be required to avoid reversal of the conviction under Rule 52(a). Rule 24(c) is
based on certain premises about group dynamics that make
it difficult for us to know how the jury's deliberations may
have been affected. Defendants seeking reversal under
Rule 52(b) are also likely to experience these difficulties in
proving prejudice. But, as the Court makes clear today, the
operation of Rule 52(b) does not permit a party to withhold

an objection to the presence of alternate jurors during jurydeliberations and then to demand automatic reversal.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice White and
Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c), the trial
judge in this case had a clear and unqualified duty to dismiss
the alternate jurors at the end of the trial. Indeed, she
could no more admit the alternate jurors into the jury room
than she could afford any stranger access to that room while
the defendants' guilt or innocence was being decided. There
can be no question but that the trial judge's failure to abide
by the strictures of Rule 24(c) resulted in a violation of the
" `cardinal principle that the deliberations of the jury shall
remain private and secret in every case.' " Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 23(b), 18 U. S. C.
App., p. 785 (quoting United States v. Virginia Erection
Corp., 335 F. 2d 868, 872 (CA4 1964).

In my view, it is equally evident that this violation implicated "substantial rights" within the meaning of Rule 52. I
cannot agree with the Court's suggestion in Part III of its
opinion that Rule 24(c) errors may be deemed to "affect substantial rights" only when they have a prejudicial impact on
a particular defendant. At least some defects bearing on
the jury's deliberative function are subject to reversal regardless of whether prejudice can be shown, not only because
it is so difficult to measure their effects on a jury's decision,
but also because such defects "undermin[e] the structural integrity of the criminal tribunal itself." Vasquez v. Hillery,
474 U. S. 254, 263-264 (1986) (racial discrimination in selection of grand jury); see also Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S.
648, 668 (1987); id., at 669 (Powell, J., concurring) (improper
exclusion of juror opposed to death penalty). Whether or
not they harm the defendant, errors that call into question
the integrity of the jury's deliberations may harm the system

as a whole. In that sense, they may be said to "seriouslyaffect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial

proceedings," United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160(1936), making them candidates for reversal under Rule 52.
See United States v. Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15 (1985) (citing Atkinson, supra).The phrase "substantial rights" appears twice in Rule 52:

once in Rule 52(a), which describes the harmless-error rule,and again in Rule 52(b), in connection with the plain-error
rule. See ante, at 731. Presumably, the words have thesame meaning each time they are used. If the majority's
understanding of "substantial rights" is correct, then even
an objection by respondents to the alternates' presence during jury deliberations would not have mandated reversal
here; instead, the Rule 24(c) violation would have been subject to harmless-error review, as it did not "affect substantial
rights" within the meaning of Rule 52(a). I cannot concur in
reasoning that would lead to this result. Had respondents
objected, and had the trial court nonetheless refused to follow the plain dictates of Rule 24(c), deliberately rejecting the
considered judgment of the Rule's drafters, I think it clear
that reversal would have been the proper response, with or
without a showing of prejudice.

Reading "substantial rights" the same way in Rule 52(b)
as in Rule 52(a) does not, of course, eliminate the difference
between cases in which no objection is made and those in
which one is. A nonforfeited error affecting substantial
rights must be corrected under Rule 52(a). A forfeited
error, however, even if it is plain and affects substantial
rights, "may" be corrected at the discretion of the reviewing
court under Rule 52(b). See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b);
ante, at 735-737. It is this distinction between automatic
and discretionary reversal that gives practical effect to the
difference between harmless-error and plain-error review,
and also every incentive to the defendant to raise objections
at the trial level.

Stevens, J., dissenting
In this case, for instance, to say that the Rule 24(c) viola-tion affected substantial rights for purposes of Rule 52 does

not answer the ultimate, and, in my view, more difficult ques-tion presented: whether the Court of Appeals properly exercised its discretion to remedy the error. After consideringthe nature of the error, the degree to which the respondents
can be said to have consented to the procedure in question,see

ante, at 727-729, and the likelihood that the procedureactually affected the outcome of the jury deliberations, a reasonable judge could well have concluded that the Rule 24(c)error in this case did not call for reversal under Rule 52(b).
Rather, an opinion emphasizing the significance of the error,designed to provide guidance to the trial courts for future
cases, might have been viewed as an appropriate response.The courts of appeals are, however, allowed a wide measure of discretion in the supervision of litigation in their re-spective circuits. See

Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States,507 U. S. 234, 251, n. 24 (1993); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140,

146-148 (1985). Certainly, the courts of appeals are betterpositioned than we are to evaluate the need for firm enforcement of a procedural rule designed to protect the integrityof jury deliberations and to weigh the interest in such
enforcement against other relevant considerations. BecauseI am not persuaded that the Court of Appeals here abused
its broad discretion, I would affirm its judgment.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-2003. Argued February 23, 1993--Decided April 26, 1993
After California issued sales and use tax deficiency notices to federal contractor Williams Brothers Engineering Company (WBEC) in 1978 and
1982, the State assessed approximately $14 million in such taxes against
WBEC for the tax years 1975 through 1981. Under its contract with
the United States, WBEC received an annual fixed fee plus reimbursement for costs, including the state taxes. At the Government's direction, WBEC applied to the State Board of Equalization for redetermination of the assessments, but each claim was denied, with minor
exceptions. WBEC then paid the assessments under protest, using
funds the Government provided, and filed timely actions in state court.
In January 1988, the State and WBEC stipulated to a $3 million refund
and to dismissal of the actions without prejudice. In May 1988, the
Government filed suit in the Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that California had classified and taxed WBEC erroneously under state law and an $11 million refund plus interest. In granting the State summary judgment, the District Court rejected the
Government's argument that it was entitled to recovery based on the
federal common-law cause of action for money had and received. The
Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The Federal Government may not recover the taxes it claims were

wrongfully assessed under California law against WBEC. Pp. 751-760.

(a) Shouldering the entire economic burden of a levy through indemnification does not give the Government a federal common law cause of
action for money had and received to challenge a state tax on state-law
grounds simply because it is the Government. The contract here is in
all relevant respects identical to the ones discussed in United States v.
New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720, in which the Court held, inter alia, that
federal contractors are not immune from state taxes simply because the
Government reimburses all of the contractors' state tax expenditures,
see id., at 734-735. Moreover, the Government's voluntary agreement
to reimburse (or even fund in advance) WBEC for the taxes does not
make the Government's payments direct disbursements of federal funds
to the State. Cf. Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., 317 U. S. 575. Thus, the
Government cannot use the existence of its obligation to indemnify
WBEC to create the asserted federal cause of action. Bayne v. United
States, 93 U. S. 642, and Gaines v. Miller, 111 U. S. 395, share two fea507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
tures this case lacks and therefore are inapposite. Because WBEC (1)
did not steal or otherwise unlawfully take the money at issue from the
Government, and (2) did not have a relationship with California that
would make the State liable for WBEC's actions, the Court does not
imply a contract in law between California and the Government. Without an implied contract, an action for money had and received will not
lie against the State. See Bayne, supra, at 643. Pp. 751-756.

(b) Because it indemnified WBEC, the Government has a right to
be subrogated to WBEC's claims against the State. Under traditional
principles of subrogation, however, a subrogee takes no more rights
than its subrogor had. In this case, WBEC dismissed its state-law actions and the state statute of limitations has run against it. The Government argues that state statutes of limitations do not apply to it, but
in Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U. S. 126, this Court held
that even if that were true, the principle did not apply when the Government acquired a right by assignment after the statute of limitations has
run against the assignor. Id., at 141-142. Although the Government
acquired a right to be subrogated to WBEC's claims when it paid the
taxes, it was not subrogated to those claims until it filed this proceeding
in federal court. By then, the state statute of limitations had run; thus,
the Government was not subrogated to "a right free of a pre-existing
infirmity." Id., at 142. Pp. 756-759.

748 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is another in the long line of cases, beginning with
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), in which theFederal Government asks this Court for relief from what it

considers illegal state taxes. Unlike the typical tax immu-nity case, however, we are not presented with a claim that
the state tax is unconstitutional; instead, the question iswhether the Federal Government may recover taxes it
claims were wrongfully assessed under California lawagainst one of the Government's private contractors.

The United States has established three Naval PetroleumReserves in California and Wyoming, one of which is Naval

Petroleum Reserve No. 1, located in Kern County, Califor-nia. 10 U. S. C. $ 7420. First through the Department of
the Navy and later through the Department of Energy, theUnited States contracted with Williams Brothers Engineering Company (WBEC) to manage oil drilling operations atReserve No. 1 from 1975 to 1985. Under the contract,
WBEC received an annual fixed fee plus reimbursement forcosts, which the contract defined to include state sales and
use taxes.California assessed approximately $14 million in sales and
use taxes, pursuant to Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. $ 6384(West 1987), against WBEC for the years 1975 through 1981.

Opinion of the Court
The State informed WBEC of the tax deficiencies throughtwo notices, one issued in July 1978 and the other in December 1982. WBEC, at the direction of the United States, ap-plied to the California Board of Equalization for administrative redetermination of the assessments, see $ 6932. WBEC
argued that the State had misapplied its own law, taxingproperty that was outside the scope of $ 6384. The Board

of Equalization denied each claim, with minor exceptions.Thereafter, WBEC paid the assessments under protest,
using funds the Federal Government provided. It then filedtimely actions in state court. In January 1988, the State
and WBEC stipulated to a $3 million refund, for erroneous
assessments on property that WBEC had purchased and that
Government personnel had installed, and to dismissal of both
actions without prejudice. The remaining $11 million resulted from assessments on property that WBEC had purchased and that private subcontractors, managed by WBEC,
had installed.

In May 1988, the United States filed suit in the Eastern
District of California, seeking a declaratory judgment that
California had classified and taxed WBEC erroneously under
California law and that the taxed property actually was exempt. It sought a refund of the $11 million plus interest.
In the course of the suit, the United States argued it was
entitled to recovery based on the federal common-law cause
of action for money had and received. The District Court
rejected both grounds for recovery and granted summary
judgment for the State.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 932
F. 2d 1346 (1991). The court began by noting that the Government did not claim that either it or WBEC was constitutionally immune from the tax, an argument this Court rejected in United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720 (1982).
932 F. 2d, at 1347-1348. Because the United States lacked
"a colorable constitutional challenge," id., at 1349, the Court
of Appeals looked to whether federal common law might pro507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT
750 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
vide a cause of action. It declined to accept the Government's argument that the simple act of disbursing federal
funds was a "constitutional function" that created a federal
interest in conflict with state law. The Government had
done no more than pay state taxes pursuant to state law;
this did not rise to the level of a federal interest requiring
the application of federal law. Ibid. The Court of Appeals
then held that the Government could not maintain a quasicontract cause of action because the facts did not support a
claim of unjust enrichment. Among other things, "WBEC,
backed throughout by the United States, had a fair chance
to argue against the validity of the assessments in the administrative and state court proceedings." Id., at 1350. Finally, the Court of Appeals relied on the fact that the Government's quasi-contract argument was "posited upon the
interpretation of a state-created exemption from a state[]-
created sales tax." Ibid. The court found that the State's
claim filing requirements, including that a court action be
filed within 90 days of an administrative denial, were conditions precedent to a cause of action for a tax refund. Id., at
1350-1351. The Government had failed to satisfy the conditions; therefore, the Court of Appeals held, the Government
had no state cause of action and no quasi-contract action.
"Since federal statutes of limitations become determinative
only after the government acquires a cause of action, and
since the United States never acquired a cause of action,"
the court reasoned, the 6-year statute of limitations of "28
U. S. C. $ 2415 does not apply." Id., at 1351.

The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a factually similar case,
recently had reached the opposite conclusion. Id., at 1351-
1352. In United States v. Broward County, 901 F. 2d 1005
(1990), the Eleventh Circuit rejected the argument on which
the Ninth Circuit relied and held that the Government had
a "federal common law cause of action in quasi-contract for

money had and received." Id., at 1008-1009. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the conflict. 506 U. S. 813 (1992).

II
The Government concedes that it could have intervened inWBEC's administrative and state-court proceedings. Tr. of

Oral Arg. 17. But it argues that whether it complied withstate procedural requirements or whether it could have intervened is irrelevant, because it has a federal right to re-cover the taxes under the federal common-law cause of action for money had and received (also known as indebitatusassumpsit). Prior to the creation of federal administrative
and statutory remedies for the recovery of federal taxes, thisCourt held that a taxpayer could bring an action for money
had and received to recover erroneously or illegally assessedtaxes. In City of Philadelphia v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 720
(1867), the Court stated:

"[The] [a]ppropriate remedy to recover back moneypaid [to federal tax collectors] under protest on account

of duties or taxes erroneously or illegally assessed, is anaction of assumpsit for money had and received. Where
the party voluntarily pays the money, he is without rem-edy; but if he pays it by compulsion of law, or under
protest, or with notice that he intends to bring suit totest the validity of the claim, he may recover it back, if
the assessment was erroneous or illegal, in an action ofassumpsit for money had and received."

Id., at 731-732(citing Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137, 150 (1836)).

The Government reasons that it paid WBEC's taxes, that thetaxes were wrongfully assessed, and that therefore it may
recover the funds used to pay those taxes. Since an actionfor money had and received is based on a contract implied in
law, see Bayne v. United States, 93 U. S. 642, 643 (1877), theGovernment further reasons that its claims are governed by
the 6-year statute of limitations in 28 U. S. C. $ 2415(a), andnot the 90-day limitation period in the California Code.

752 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
The taxpayers in both City of Philadelphia and the caseon which it relies,

Elliott v. Swartwout, were attempting to
recover money they had paid under protest to the federaltax collector in settlement of tax assessments erroneously

made against them. In this case, by contrast, the taxpayer--WBEC--has had its day in court and gone home.The Government attempts to recover money it paid in reimbursement for state tax assessments against the contractor,even though the contractor already has challenged the assessment and accepted a resolution of its claims. The Gov-ernment contends that, because its contract with WBEC
involved an advanced funding arrangement, the Government
was the one that actually paid the state taxes. Because the
disbursement of federal funds is involved, the Government
asserts, the federal action for money had and received is appropriate. Even assuming that federal courts may entertain a federal common-law action for the recovery of state
taxes paid by the Government, we conclude that a federal
action is inappropriate here because the Government is in no
better position than as a subrogee of its contractor WBEC.

The management contract between the Government and
WBEC is in all relevant respects identical to the contracts
we discussed in United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720
(1982). There, as here, the State had imposed sales and use
taxes on private contractors managing Department of Energy sites. Like WBEC, two of the contractors received
costs plus a fixed fee. Id., at 723-724. Like WBEC's contracts, the contracts provided that title to all tangible personal property passed directly from the vendor to the Government. Id., at 724. "Finally, and most importantly, the
contracts use[d] a so-called `advanced funding' procedure to
meet contractor costs." Id., at 725. The contractors paid
creditors and employees with drafts drawn on a special bank
account in which the Government deposited funds, so that
only federal funds were expended when the contractors
made purchases. Id., at 726. Cf. App. 142-143 (Declaration

753Cite as: 507 U. S. 746 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
of Kenneth Meeks in Support of United States' Motion forSummary Judgment, describing similar funding operations

with WBEC).In

New Mexico, the Government brought an action arguing that the contractors' expenditures, other than those
made out of the fixed fees, were constitutionally immunefrom taxation. We noted that the doctrine of federal immunity from state taxation is "one that has been marked fromthe beginning by inconsistent decisions and excessively delicate distinctions." 455 U. S., at 730. After surveying our"confusing" precedents, we concluded it was time to return
to the underlying constitutional principle of tax immunity: A
State may not lay a tax " `directly upon the United States.' "
Id., at 733 (quoting Mayo v. United States, 319 U. S. 441, 447
(1943)). But whereas the Government is absolutely immune
from direct taxes, it is not immune from taxes merely because they have an "effect" on it, or "even because the Federal Government shoulders the entire economic burden of
the levy." 455 U. S., at 734. In fact, it is "constitutionally
irrelevant that the United States reimburse[s] all the contractor's expenditures, including those going to meet the
tax." Ibid. (citing Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1
(1941)). Tax immunity is "appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on the United States itself, or
on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the
Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as
separate entities." 455 U. S., at 735.

It is beyond peradventure that California did not tax--
indeed, could not have taxed--the Federal Government in
this case. California taxed WBEC. And the Government's
voluntary agreement to reimburse (or even fund in advance)
WBEC for those taxes does not make the Government's payments direct disbursements of federal funds to the State.
We addressed an analogous indemnification relationship in
Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., 317 U. S. 575 (1943). The
United States had contracted with a private corporation to

Opinion of the Court
operate a Maritime Commission vessel. A customs inspec-tor suffered injuries on the vessel that led to his death, and

his widow brought a maritime tort action against the privatecorporation. In defense, respondent contended "that if the
judgment against [it] stands, the United States ultimately
will have to pay it by reason of provisions of the contractbetween respondent and the [Maritime] Commission. It is

therefore urged that the United States is the real party ininterest."

Id., at 582. We rejected respondent's argument
that petitioner could be deprived of her cause of action byreason of the contract. "Immunity from suit on a cause of

action which the law creates cannot be so readily obtained."
Id., at 583. Absent congressional action, we would not allow
"concessions made by contracting officers of the government" to make such a "basic alteration" in the law. Id., at
584.

We conclude from Brady and New Mexico that the Government cannot use the existence of an obligation to indemnify
WBEC to create a federal cause of action for money had and
received to recover state taxes paid by WBEC any more
than the Roosevelt Steamship Company could use the existence of a right to indemnity from the Government to defeat
a claim for recovery. See Brady, supra, at 584. Cf. Farid
v. Smith, 850 F. 2d 917, 923 (CA2 1988) (a State's decision
to indemnify its public servants does not confer Eleventh
Amendment immunity on state officials sued in their personal capacity).

Although the Government does not cite Brady, it does cite
two other cases that suggest the lesson of Brady might not
apply in an action for money had and received. According
to the Government, Bayne v. United States, 93 U. S. 642
(1877), and Gaines v. Miller, 111 U. S. 395 (1884), stand for
the proposition that an action for money had and received
may "be employed by the United States to recover money
from a third party who received federal funds that had been
misappropriated by a government agent." Brief for United

Opinion of the Court
States 14. We find these cases inapposite. In Bayne, anArmy paymaster withdrew money from the paymaster's

bank account, endorsed the checks in blank, and sent themto Merchants' Bank with instructions to credit the account
of Bayne & Co. The Court affirmed the Government's judgment against Bayne & Co. under an action for money hadand received. 93 U. S., at 643. In

Gaines, the agent of an
estate's executors sold estate property and illegally kept aportion of the money. 111 U. S., at 396. Many years later,

the agent had died, but Gaines, the legatee of the first estate,brought an action in equity against the administrator of the
agent's estate. The Court affirmed the lower court's judgment against Gaines because, among other reasons, she had
an adequate remedy at law: an action for money had and
received. Id., at 397-398.

Bayne and Gaines share two features this case lacks. The
first is that, in each, the rightful owner of the money lost it
by way of theft. That is, the money passed from the first
party to the second party unlawfully. See Bayne, supra, at
643; Gaines, supra, at 396. The second feature is that in
both cases the rightful owner of the money sued a third
party who had a relationship that, at least for our purposes,
made that party legally responsible for the actions of the one
who unlawfully took the money. The Court was satisfied in
Bayne that the transactions between the paymaster, the
banks, and Bayne & Co. were "the result of a fraudulent
purpose to secure the use of the public money to Bayne &
Co., who received it with full knowledge that it belonged to
the United States, and had been applied in manifest violation
of the act of Congress." 93 U. S., at 643. In other words,
Bayne & Co. and the paymaster were accomplices, each liable
for the acts of the other. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 2. In Gaines,
petitioner sued the administrator of the agent's estate, who
was legally responsible for paying the agent's debts out of
the estate. See, e. g., 2 J. Perkins, Law of Executors and
Administrators 988-990 (6th Am. ed. 1877).

507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT
756 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
The Government does not contend that WBEC stole themoney at issue in this case or otherwise took money from

the Government unlawfully. WBEC did not. Nor does theGovernment contend that California and WBEC had a relationship that would make California liable for WBEC's actions. They did not. In fact, California and WBEC had anadverse relationship: that of creditor and debtor. California's demand that WBEC pay what California believed to bea lawful debt does not make California legally responsible
for the Government's indemnification of WBEC. In thesecircumstances, we do not imply a contract in law between
California and the Government. Without an implied contract, an action for money had and received will not lie
against the State.

Although the Government cannot proceed in an action for
money had and received, our discussion of indemnification
suggests the Government may not be without recourse: Because it indemnified the contractor, the Government has a
right to be subrogated to the contractor's claims against the
State. See 10 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts $ 1265 (3d
ed. 1967); Brief for Respondents 13 (conceding the same).
When proceeding by subrogation, the subrogee "stands in
the place of one whose claim he has paid." United States v.
Munsey Trust Co., 332 U. S. 234, 242 (1947). Here WBEC's
rights have lapsed and its claims are barred. Under traditional subrogation principles then, the claims of the United
States also would be barred. The subrogee, who has all the
rights of the subrogor, usually "cannot acquire by subrogation what another whose rights he claims did not have."
Ibid. Although WBEC filed actions in state court within 90
days of the Board of Equalization's administrative decisions,
WBEC later dismissed those cases without prejudice. A
dismissal without prejudice terminates the action and "concludes the rights of the parties in that particular action."
Gagnon Co. v. Nevada Desert Inn, 45 Cal. 2d 448, 455, 289 P.
2d 466, 472 (1955). A subrogee could have proceeded only

757Cite as: 507 U. S. 746 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
if WBEC could have filed a new state-court action at thattime, which it could not do.

The traditional rules of subrogation, however, do not nec-essarily apply to the Government. But cf.

United States v.
Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 332 U. S. 301, 309 (1947) (suggesting
that state law controls "where the Government has simplysubstituted itself for others as successor to rights governed

by state law"). The Government argues strenuously that,at the very least, state statutes of limitations do not bind
it. It cites three cases to support this position. See United
States v. Summerlin, 310 U. S. 414, 416 (1940); Board of
Comm'rs of Jackson County v. United States, 308 U. S. 343,351 (1939);

United States v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins.
Co., 364 U. S. 301, 308 (1960). In the cases the Government
cites, however, either the right at issue was obtained by theGovernment through, or created by, a federal statute, see

Summerlin, supra, at 416 (United States suing under claimreceived by assignment pursuant to Act of June 27, 1934, 48
Stat. 1246); Board of Comm'rs, supra, at 349-350 (UnitedStates suing as Indian trustee pursuant to congressional
statute); or a federal statute provided the statute of limi-tations, see

John Hancock, supra, at 301 (United States
redeeming mortgage foreclosure pursuant to statute of limitations in 28 U. S. C. $ 2410(c)). Moreover, in each case,the Government was proceeding in its sovereign capacity.

As the Government rightly notes:

"When the United States becomes entitled to a claim,
acting in its governmental capacity, and asserts its claimin that right, it cannot be deemed to have abdicated its

governmental authority so as to become subject to a
state statute putting a time limit upon enforcement."
Summerlin, supra, at 417.

In contrast, the Government here became entitled to its
claim by indemnifying a private contractor's state-law debt.
It can assert its claim only by way of subrogation, an equita507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT
758 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
ble action created by the courts. Summerlin is clearlydistinguishable.

Whether in general a state-law action brought by theUnited States is subject to a federal or state statute of limitations is a difficult question. We need not resolve it today,
however, because Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304U. S. 126 (1938), provides guidance in this case. There the

United States was proceeding as the assignee of the SovietGovernment and sought to collect under state law. The
petitioner argued that the statute of limitations had run, andthe United States asserted, among other defenses, that it
was not bound by state statutes of limitations. We found
that the circumstances of the case "admit[ted] of no appeal
to such a policy." Id., at 141. Even if the United States
had a right to be free from the statute of limitations, it was
deprived of no right on those facts. "[F]or the proof demonstrate[d] that the United States never acquired a right free
of a pre-existing infirmity, the running of limitations against
its assignor, which public policy does not forbid." Id., at
142.

Here, although the Government acquired a right to subrogation to WBEC's claims upon payment of the taxes, the
Government did not assert that right until it filed the federal
judicial proceeding. As the California Supreme Court has
held: " `[A] surety by payment does not become ipso facto
subrogated to the rights of the creditor, but only acquires a
right to such subrogation, and . . . before the substitution or
equitable assignment can actually take place he must actively assert his equitable right thereto. It is not a substantive tangible right of such nature and character that it can
be seized and held and enjoyed independently of a judicial
proceeding.' " Offer v. Superior Court of San Francisco,
194 Cal. 114, 117, 228 P. 11, 12 (1924) (quoting 25 Ruling Case
Law 1391 (1919)). Accord, 10 Jaeger, Williston on Contracts

$ 1265, at 848, and n. 9 (citing cases). Because the Government waited until after the state statute of limitations had

Opinion of the Court
run against WBEC to bring suit, the Government was notsubrogated to "a right free of a pre-existing infirmity."

Guaranty Trust, supra, at 142. That the doctrine of subro-gation is one of equity only strengthens our conclusion that
the Government may not proceed: The Government waited10 years after the first notice of deficiency was issued, 8
years after the second notice was issued, and almost 6 yearsafter the state statute of limitations ran to bring this suit.

The Government argues that affirming the Court of Ap-peals often will leave it "without an effective remedy to contest a tax improperly exacted from a federal contractor" andsubject it to the "vagaries" of 50 state tax-law procedures.
Brief for United States 26-27. But federal contractorsalready are subject to the substantive tax laws of the 50
States. Nothing in our decision prevents the Governmentfrom including in its contracts a requirement that its contractors be responsible for all taxes the Government believes arewrongfully assessed, a contract term that likely would remove any disinterest a contractor may have toward litigatingin state court. If our decision today results in an intolerable
drain on the public fisc, Congress, which can take into ac-count the concerns of the States as well as the Federal Government, is free to address the situation. See New Mexico,455 U. S., at 737-738.

III
In United States v. New Mexico, we held that the FederalGovernment is immune only from state taxes imposed on it

directly. Id., at 734. In so holding, we hoped to "forestall,at least to a degree, some of the manipulation and wooden
formalism that occasionally have marked tax litigation--andthat have no proper place in determining the allocation of
power between coexisting sovereignties." Id., at 737.Today we hold that shouldering the "entire economic burden
of the levy," id., at 734, through indemnification does not givethe Federal Government a federal common-law cause of action for money had and received to challenge a state tax on

Syllabus

EDENFIELD et al. v. FANE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-1594. Argued December 7, 1992--Decided April 26, 1993
Respondent Fane, a certified public accountant (CPA) licensed to practice

by the Florida Board of Accountancy, sued the Board for declaratory
and injunctive relief on the ground that its rule prohibiting CPA's from
engaging in "direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation" to obtain new clients violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. He alleged that
but for the prohibition he would seek clients through personal solicitation, as he had done while practicing in New Jersey, where such solicitation is permitted. The Federal District Court enjoined the rule's
enforcement, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: As applied to CPA solicitation in the business context, Florida's

prohibition is inconsistent with the free speech guarantees of the First
and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 765-777.

(a) The type of personal solicitation prohibited here is clearly commercial expression to which First Amendment protections apply. E. g.,
Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 762. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S.
447, which upheld a ban on in-person solicitation by lawyers, did not
hold that all personal solicitation is without First Amendment protection. In denying CPA's and their clients the considerable advantages
of solicitation in the commercial context, Florida's law threatens societal
interests in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information that the First Amendment is designed to safeguard. However,
commercial speech is "linked inextricably" with the commercial arrangement that it proposes, so that the State's interest in regulating the underlying transaction may give it a concomitant interest in the expression itself. Thus, Florida's rule need only be tailored in a reasonable
manner to serve a substantial state interest in order to survive First
Amendment scrutiny. See, e. g., Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp.
v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 564. Pp. 765-767.

(b) Even under the intermediate Central Hudson standard of review,
Florida's ban cannot be sustained as applied to Fane's proposed speech.
The Board's asserted interests--protecting consumers from fraud or
overreaching by CPA's and maintaining CPA independence and ensur507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:33 PAGES OPINPGT
762 EDENFIELD v. FANE

Syllabus
ing against conflicts of interest--are substantial. However, the Board
has failed to demonstrate that the ban advances those interests in any
direct and material way. A governmental body seeking to sustain a
restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it
recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a
material degree. Here, the Board's suppositions about the dangers of
personal solicitation by CPA's in the business context are not validated
by studies, anecdotal evidence, or Fane's own conduct; and its claims are
contradicted by a report of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and other literature. Nor can the ban be justified as a
reasonable time, place, or manner restriction on speech. Even assuming that a flat ban on commercial solicitation could be regarded as such
a restriction, the ban still must serve a substantial state interest in a
direct and material way. Pp. 767-773.

(c) The ban cannot be justified as a prophylactic rule because the
circumstances of CPA solicitation in the business context are not "inherently conducive to overreaching and other forms of misconduct."
Ohralik, supra, at 464. Unlike a lawyer, who is trained in the art of
persuasion, a CPA is trained in a way that emphasizes independence
and objectivity rather than advocacy. Moreover, while a lawyer may
be soliciting an unsophisticated, injured, or distressed lay person, a
CPA's typical prospective client is a sophisticated and experienced business executive who has an existing professional relation with a CPA,
who selects the time and place for their meeting, and for whom there is
no expectation or pressure to retain the CPA on the spot. In addition,
Ohralik in no way relieves a State of the obligation to demonstrate that
its restrictions on speech address a serious problem and contribute in a
material way to solving that problem. Pp. 773-777.

David C. Vladeck argued the cause for respondent. Withhim on the brief was Alan B. Morrison.*

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
In previous cases we have considered the constitutionalityof state laws prohibiting lawyers from engaging in direct,

personal solicitation of prospective clients. See Ohralik v.
Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978); In re Primus, 436U. S. 412 (1978). In the case now before us, we consider

a solicitation ban applicable to certified public accountants(CPA's) enacted by the State of Florida. We hold that, as
applied to CPA solicitation in the business context, Florida'sprohibition is inconsistent with the free speech guarantees
of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

I
Respondent Scott Fane is a CPA licensed to practice inthe State of Florida by the Florida Board of Accountancy

(Board). Before moving to Florida in 1985, Fane had hisown accounting CPA practice in New Jersey, specializing in
providing tax advice to small and medium-sized businesses.He often obtained business clients by making unsolicited
telephone calls to their executives and arranging meetingsto explain his services and expertise. This direct, personal,
uninvited solicitation was permitted under New Jersey law.When he moved to Florida, Fane wished to build a practice
similar to his solo practice in New Jersey but was unable todo so because the Board of Accountancy had a comprehensive
rule prohibiting CPA's from engaging in the direct, personal

Advertising Federation et al. by Richard E. Wiley, Howard H. Bell, Gilbert H. Weil, and Robert J. Levering; and for the American Association

David Ostrove, and Sydney S. Traum.

Kenneth R. Hart filed a brief for the Florida Institute of Certified Public
Accountants as amicus curiae.

Opinion of the Court
solicitation he had found most effective in the past. TheBoard's rules provide that a CPA "shall not by any direct,

in-person, uninvited solicitation solicit an engagement to per-form public accounting services . . . where the engagement
would be for a person or entity not already a client of [the
CPA], unless such person or entity has invited such a com-munication." Fla. Admin. Code $ 21A-24.002(2)(c) (1992).

"[D]irect, in-person, uninvited solicitation" means "anycommunication which directly or implicitly requests an immediate oral response from the recipient," which, underthe Board's rules, includes all "[u]ninvited in-person visits
or conversations or telephone calls to a specific potential
client." $ 21A-24.002(3).

The rule, according to Fane's uncontradicted submissions,
presented a serious obstacle, because most businesses are
willing to rely for advice on the accountants or CPA's already
serving them. In Fane's experience, persuading a business
to sever its existing accounting relations or alter them to
include a new CPA on particular assignments requires the
new CPA to contact the business and explain the advantages
of a change. This entails a detailed discussion of the client's
needs and the CPA's expertise, services and fees. See Affidavit of Scott Fane |||| 7, 11, App. 11, 15.

Fane sued the Board in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Florida, seeking declaratory and
injunctive relief on the ground that the Board's antisolicitation rule violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Fane alleged that but for the prohibition he would
seek clients through personal solicitation and would offer
fees below prevailing rates. Complaint |||| 9-11, App. 3-4.

In response to Fane's submissions, the Board relied on the
affidavit of Louis Dooner, one of its former chairmen.
Dooner concluded that the solicitation ban was necessary to
preserve the independence of CPA's performing the attest
function, which involves the rendering of opinions on a firm's
financial statements. His premise was that a CPA who so507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:33 PAGES OPINPGT

765Cite as: 507 U. S. 761 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
licits clients "is obviously in need of business and may bewilling to bend the rules." App. 23. In Dooner's view,

"[i]f [a CPA] has solicited the client he will be beholden tohim." Id., at 19. Dooner also suggested that the ban was
needed to prevent "overreaching and vexatious conduct bythe CPA."

Id., at 23.The District Court gave summary judgment to Fane and

enjoined enforcement of the rule "as it is applied to CPA'swho seek clients through in-person, direct, uninvited solicitation in the business context." Civ. Case No. 88-40264-MNP(ND Fla., Sept. 13, 1990), App. 88. A divided panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 945F. 2d 1514 (1991).

We granted certiorari, 504 U. S. 940 (1992), and nowaffirm.

II
In soliciting potential clients, Fane seeks to communicateno more than truthful, nondeceptive information proposing a

lawful commercial transaction. We need not parse Fane'sproposed communications to see if some parts are entitled to
greater protection than the solicitation itself. This casecomes to us testing the solicitation, nothing more. That is
what the State prohibits and Fane proposes.Whatever ambiguities may exist at the margins of the category of commercial speech, see, e. g., Pittsburgh Press Co.v.

Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376,384-388 (1973), it is clear that this type of personal solicitation is commercial expression to which the protections of theFirst Amendment apply. E. g., Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S.748, 762 (1976). While we did uphold a ban on in-person
solicitation by lawyers in Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,436 U. S. 447 (1978), that opinion did not hold that all personal solicitation is without First Amendment protection.See

id., at 457. There are, no doubt, detrimental aspects topersonal commercial solicitation in certain circumstances,

507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:33 PAGES OPINPGT
766 EDENFIELD v. FANE

Opinion of the Court
see id., at 464, and n. 23, but these detriments are not soinherent or ubiquitous that solicitation of this sort is removed from the ambit of First Amendment protection,cf.

United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 725 (1990) (plurality opinion) ("Solicitation is a recognized form of speech
protected by the First Amendment"); see also International
Society for Krishna Consciousness v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672,
677 (1992).In the commercial context, solicitation may have considerable value. Unlike many other forms of commercial ex-pression, solicitation allows direct and spontaneous communication between buyer and seller. A seller has a strong
financial incentive to educate the market and stimulate demand for his product or service, so solicitation produces more
personal interchange between buyer and seller than would
occur if only buyers were permitted to initiate contact. Personal interchange enables a potential buyer to meet and evaluate the person offering the product or service and allows
both parties to discuss and negotiate the desired form for
the transaction or professional relation. Solicitation also enables the seller to direct his proposals toward those consumers who he has a reason to believe would be most interested
in what he has to sell. For the buyer, it provides an opportunity to explore in detail the way in which a particular product or service compares to its alternatives in the market.
In particular, with respect to nonstandard products like the
professional services offered by CPA's, these benefits are
significant.

In denying CPA's and their clients these advantages,
Florida's law threatens societal interests in broad access to
complete and accurate commercial information that First
Amendment coverage of commercial speech is designed to
safeguard. See Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra,
at 762-765; Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S. 350,
377-378 (1977); Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 561-562 (1980).

Opinion of the Court
The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our socialand cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish. Some of the ideas and information are vital,some of slight worth. But the general rule is that the
speaker and the audience, not the government, assess thevalue of the information presented. Thus, even a communication that does no more than propose a commercial transac-tion is entitled to the coverage of the First Amendment.
See Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 762.Commercial speech, however, is "linked inextricably" with
the commercial arrangement that it proposes, Friedman v.
Rogers, 440 U. S. 1, 10, n. 9 (1979), so the State's interestin regulating the underlying transaction may give it a concomitant interest in the expression itself. See Ohralik,
supra, at 457. For this reason, laws restricting commercialspeech, unlike laws burdening other forms of protected expression, need only be tailored in a reasonable manner toserve a substantial state interest in order to survive First
Amendment scrutiny. Board of Trustees of State University of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989); Central HudsonGas & Electric Corp., 447 U. S., at 564. Even under this

intermediate standard of review, however, Florida's blanketban on direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation by CPA's cannot be sustained as applied to Fane's proposed speech.

III
To determine whether personal solicitation by CPA's maybe proscribed under the test set forth in

Central Hudson wemust ask whether the State's interests in proscribing it are

substantial, whether the challenged regulation advancesthese interests in a direct and material way, and whether the
extent of the restriction on protected speech is in reasonableproportion to the interests served. See

ibid. Though weconclude that the Board's asserted interests are substantial,

the Board has failed to demonstrate that its solicitation banadvances those interests.

768 EDENFIELD v. FANE

Opinion of the Court

A
In undertaking the first inquiry, we must identify withcare the interests the State itself asserts. Unlike rationalbasis review, the Central Hudson standard does not permitus to supplant the precise interests put forward by the State
with other suppositions. See Fox, supra, at 480. Neitherwill we turn away if it appears that the stated interests are
not the actual interests served by the restriction. See, e. g.,
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 730(1982).

To justify its ban on personal solicitation by CPA's, theBoard proffers two interests. First, the Board asserts
an interest in protecting consumers from fraud or overreach-ing by CPA's. Second, the Board claims that its ban is
necessary to maintain both the fact and appearance of CPAindependence in auditing a business and attesting to its financial statements.The State's first interest encompasses two distinct purposes: to prevent fraud and other forms of deception, and toprotect privacy. As to the first purpose, we have said that
"[t]he First Amendment . . . does not prohibit the State frominsuring that the stream of commercial information flow[s]
cleanly as well as freely," Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy,425 U. S., at 771-772, and our cases make clear that the State
may ban commercial expression that is fraudulent or decep-tive without further justification, see,

e. g., Central HudsonGas & Electric Corp., supra, at 563-564; In re R. M. J., 455

U. S. 191, 203 (1982); Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453U. S. 490, 507 (1981) (plurality opinion). Indeed, 25 States
and the District of Columbia take various forms of this ap-proach, forbidding solicitation by CPA's only under circumstances that would render it fraudulent, deceptive, or coer-cive. See,

e. g., Code of Colo. Regs. $ 7.12 (1991); N. D.Admin. Code $ 3-04-06-02 (1991); N. H. Code Admin. Rules

$ 507.02(c) (1990); D. C. Mun. Reg., Tit. 17, $ 2513.4 (1990).But where, as with the blanket ban involved here, truthful

507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:33 PAGES OPINPGT

769Cite as: 507 U. S. 761 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
and nonmisleading expression will be snared along withfraudulent or deceptive commercial speech, the State must

satisfy the remainder of the Central Hudson test by demon-strating that its restriction serves a substantial state interest and is designed in a reasonable way to accomplish that
end. See In re R. M. J., supra, at 203. For purposes ofthat test, there is no question that Florida's interest in ensuring the accuracy of commercial information in the market-place is substantial. See,

e. g., Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 771-772; San Francisco Arts & Athletics,
Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522, 539
(1987); Friedman v. Rogers, supra, at 13.

Likewise, the protection of potential clients' privacy is a
substantial state interest. Even solicitation that is neither
fraudulent nor deceptive may be pressed with such frequency or vehemence as to intimidate, vex, or harass the
recipient. In Ohralik, we made explicit that "protection of
the public from these aspects of solicitation is a legitimate
and important state interest." 436 U. S., at 462.

The Board's second justification for its ban--the need to
maintain the fact and appearance of CPA independence and
to guard against conflicts of interest--is related to the audit
and attest functions of a CPA. In the course of rendering
these professional services, a CPA reviews financial statements and attests that they have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and present a fair and accurate picture of the firm's financial
condition. See generally R. Gormley, Law of Accountants
and Auditors || 1.07[4] (1981); 1 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Professional Standards AU $ 110.01
(1991) (hereinafter AICPA Professional Standards). In the
Board's view, solicitation compromises the independence necessary to perform the audit and attest functions, because a
CPA who needs business enough to solicit clients will be
prone to ethical lapses. The Board claims that even if actual
misconduct does not occur, the public perception of CPA in507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:34 PAGES OPINPGT
770 EDENFIELD v. FANE

Opinion of the Court
dependence will be undermined if CPA's behave like ordi-nary commercial actors.

We have given consistent recognition to the State's impor-tant interests in maintaining standards of ethical conduct in
the licensed professions. See, e. g., Ohralik, supra, at 460;
Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 766; NationalSoc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S.

679, 696 (1978). With regard to CPA's, we have observedthat they must "maintain total independence" and act with
"complete fidelity to the public trust" when serving as inde-pendent auditors. United States v. Arthur Young & Co., 465
U. S. 805, 818 (1984). Although the State's interest in ob-scuring the commercial nature of public accounting practice
is open to doubt, see Bates v. Arizona State Bar Assn., 433U. S., at 369-371, the Board's asserted interest in maintaining CPA independence and ensuring against conflicts ofinterest is not. We acknowledge that this interest is substantial. See Ohralik, supra, at 460-461.

B
That the Board's asserted interests are substantial in theabstract does not mean, however, that its blanket prohibition

on solicitation serves them. The penultimate prong of the
Central Hudson test requires that a regulation impingingupon commercial expression "directly advance the state

interest involved; the regulation may not be sustained if itprovides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose." Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp.,447 U. S., at 564. We agree with the Court of Appeals that
the Board's ban on CPA solicitation as applied to the solicita-tion of business clients fails to satisfy this requirement.

It is well established that "[t]he party seeking to uphold arestriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it." Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S.60, 71, n. 20 (1983);

Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. This burden isnot satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather, a gov507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:34 PAGES OPINPGT

771Cite as: 507 U. S. 761 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
ernmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commer-cial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are

real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to amaterial degree. See,

e. g., Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 648-
649 (1985); Bolger, supra, at 73; In re R. M. J., 455 U. S., at205-206;

Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp., supra, at
569; Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U. S., at 13-15; Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 95 (1977). Without
this requirement, a State could with ease restrict commercialspeech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression.

The Board has not demonstrated that, as applied in the
business context, the ban on CPA solicitation advances its
asserted interests in any direct and material way. It presents no studies that suggest personal solicitation of prospective business clients by CPA's creates the dangers of fraud,
overreaching, or compromised independence that the Board
claims to fear. The record does not disclose any anecdotal
evidence, either from Florida or another State, that validates
the Board's suppositions. This is so even though 21 States
place no specific restrictions of any kind on solicitation by
CPA's, and only 3 States besides Florida have enacted a categorical ban. See 3 La. Admin. Code 46:XIX.507(D)(1)(c)
(Supp. 1988); Minn. Admin. Code $ 1100.6100 (1991); 22 Tex.
Admin. Code $ 501.44 (Supp. 1992). Not even Fane's own
conduct suggests that the Board's concerns are justified. Cf.
Ohralik, supra, at 467-468. The only suggestion that a ban
on solicitation might help prevent fraud and overreaching or
preserve CPA independence is the affidavit of Louis Dooner,
which contains nothing more than a series of conclusory
statements that add little if anything to the Board's original
statement of its justifications.

The Board directs the Court's attention to a report on CPA
solicitation prepared by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants in 1981. See AICPA, Report of the Spe507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:34 PAGES OPINPGT
772 EDENFIELD v. FANE

Opinion of the Court
cial Committee on Solicitation (1981), App. 29. The Reportcontradicts, rather than strengthens, the Board's submissions. The AICPA Committee stated that it was "unawareof the existence of any empirical data supporting the theories
that CPAs (a) are not independent of clients obtained by direct uninvited solicitation, or (b) do not maintain their inde-pendence in mental attitude toward those clients subjected

to direct uninvited solicitation by another CPA." Id., at 4,App. 38. Louis Dooner's suggestion that solicitation of new
accounts signals the need for work and invites an improperapproach from the client ignores the fact that most CPA
firms desire new clients. The AICPA Report discloses no
reason to suspect that CPA's who engage in personal solicitation are more desperate for work, or would be any more inclined to compromise their professional standards, than
CPA's who do not solicit, or who solicit only by mail or advertisement. With respect to the prospect of harassment or
overreaching by CPA's, the report again acknowledges an
"absence of persuasive evidence that direct uninvited solicitation by CPAs is likely to lead to false or misleading claims
or oppressive conduct." Id., at 2, App. 35.

Other evidence concerning personal solicitation by CPA's
also belies the Board's concerns. In contrast to the Board's
anxiety over uninvited solicitation, the literature on the accounting profession suggests that the main dangers of compromised independence occur when a CPA firm is too dependent upon, or involved with, a longstanding client. See,
e. g., P. Cottell & T. Perlin, Accounting Ethics 39-40 (1990);
G. Previts, The Scope of CPA Services: A Study of the Development of the Concept of Independence and the Profession's
Role in Society 142 (1985); S. Rep. No. 95-34, pp. 50-52
(1977); General Accounting Office, CPA Audit Quality: Status
of Actions Taken to Improve Auditing and Financial Reporting of Public Companies 36 (Mar. 1989) (GAO/AFMD-89-38).
It appears from the literature that a business executive who
wishes to obtain a favorable but unjustified audit opinion

773Cite as: 507 U. S. 761 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
from a CPA would be less likely to turn to a stranger whohas solicited him than to pressure his existing CPA, with

whom he has an ongoing, personal relation and over whomhe may also have some financial leverage. See id., at 34 ("A
company using the threat of changing accountants--opinionshopping--to pressure its existing accounting firm to accept
a less than desirable accounting treatment is one way inde-pendence is threatened"); Cottell & Perlin,

supra, at 34 (not-ing that independence can be eroded if a client is served by

a single auditor for a great length of time).For similar reasons, we reject the Board's alternative argument that the solicitation ban is a reasonable restrictionon the manner in which CPA's may communicate with prospective clients, rather than a direct regulation of the com-mercial speech itself. Assuming that a flat ban on commercial solicitation could be regarded as a content-neutral time,place, or manner restriction on speech, a proposition that is
open to serious doubt, see, e. g., Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771, a challenged restriction of that typestill must serve a substantial state interest in "a direct and

effective way," Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781,800 (1989). The State has identified certain interests in regulating solicitation in the accounting profession that are im-portant and within its legitimate power, but the prohibitions
here do not serve these purposes in a direct and materialmanner. Where a restriction on speech lacks this close and
substantial relation to the governmental interests asserted,it cannot be, by definition, a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction. C

Relying on Ohralik, the Board seeks to justify its solicita-tion ban as a prophylactic rule. It acknowledges that Fane's
solicitations may not involve any misconduct but argues thatall personal solicitation by CPA's must be banned, because
this contact most often occurs in private offices and is diffi-cult to regulate or monitor.

774 EDENFIELD v. FANE

Opinion of the Court
We reject the Board's argument and hold that, as appliedin this context, the solicitation ban cannot be justified as a

prophylactic rule. Ohralik does not stand for the proposi-tion that blanket bans on personal solicitation by all types of
professionals are constitutional in all circumstances. Be-cause "the distinctions, historical and functional, between
professions, may require consideration of quite different fac-tors,"

Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 773, n. 25,the constitutionality of a ban on personal solicitation will depend upon the identity of the parties and the precise circum-stances of the solicitation. Later cases have made this clear,
explaining that Ohralik's holding was narrow and dependedupon certain "unique features of in-person solicitation by
lawyers" that were present in the circumstances of that case.
Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of SupremeCourt of Ohio, 471 U. S., at 641; see also Shapero v. Kentucky

Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466, 472 (1988).Ohralik was a challenge to the application of Ohio's ban
on attorney solicitation and held only that a State Bar "con-stitutionally may discipline a lawyer for soliciting clients
in person, for pecuniary gain, under circumstances likelyto pose dangers that the State has a right to prevent."
Ohralik, 436 U. S., at 449. While Ohralik discusses the ge-neric hazards of personal solicitation, see

id., at 464-466, theopinion made clear that a preventative rule was justified only

in situations "inherently conducive to overreaching and otherforms of misconduct."

Id., at 464; cf. In re R. M. J., 455U. S., at 203 (advertising may be banned outright only if it is

actually or inherently misleading). The Court in Ohralikexplained why the case before it met this standard:

"[T]he potential for overreaching is significantly greaterwhen a lawyer, a professional trained in the art of persuasion, personally solicits an unsophisticated, injured,or distressed lay person. Such an individual may place
his trust in a lawyer, regardless of the latter's qual-ifications or the individual's actual need for legal rep507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:34 PAGES OPINPGT

775Cite as: 507 U. S. 761 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
resentation, simply in response to persuasion undercircumstances conducive to uninformed acquiescence.

Although it is argued that personal solicitation is valu-able because it may apprise a victim of misfortune of
his legal rights, the very plight of that person not onlymakes him more vulnerable to influence but also may
make advice all the more intrusive. Thus, under theseadverse conditions the overtures of an uninvited lawyer
may distress the solicited individual simply because oftheir obtrusiveness and the invasion of the individual's
privacy, even when no other harm materializes. Undersuch circumstances, it is not unreasonable for the State
to presume that in-person solicitation by lawyers moreoften than not will be injurious to the person solicited."
436 U. S., at 465-466 (footnotes omitted).
The solicitation here poses none of the same dangers. Un-like a lawyer, a CPA is not "a professional trained in the art

of persuasion." A CPA's training emphasizes independenceand objectivity, not advocacy. See 1 AICPA Professional
Standards AU $ 220; 2 id., ET $ 55; H. Magill & G. Previts,CPA Professional Responsibilities: An Introduction 105-108
(1991). The typical client of a CPA is far less susceptibleto manipulation than the young accident victim in

Ohralik.Fane's prospective clients are sophisticated and experienced

business executives who understand well the services that aCPA offers. See Affidavit of Scott Fane |||| 5-7, 10(A), App.
10-11, 13. In general, the prospective client has an existingprofessional relation with an accountant and so has an independent basis for evaluating the claims of a new CPA seek-ing professional work.

Id., || 6, App. 10-11.The manner in which a CPA like Fane solicits business

is conducive to rational and considered decisionmaking bythe prospective client, in sharp contrast to the "uninformed
acquiescence" to which the accident victims in Ohralikwere prone.

Ohralik, supra, at 465. While the clients inOhralik were approached at a moment of high stress and

vulnerability, the clients Fane wishes to solicit meet him intheir own offices at a time of their choosing. If they are

unreceptive to his initial telephone solicitation, they needonly terminate the call. Invasion of privacy is not a significant concern.

If a prospective client does decide to meet with Fane,there is no expectation or pressure to retain Fane on the

spot; instead, he or she most often exercises caution, check-ing references and deliberating before deciding to hire a new
CPA. See Affidavit of Scott Fane || 10(C), App. 13-14. Be-cause a CPA has access to a business firm's most sensitive
financial records and internal documents, retaining a new accountant is not a casual decision. Ibid. The engagements
Fane seeks are also long term in nature; to the extent he
engages in unpleasant, high pressure sales tactics, he can
impair rather than improve his chances of obtaining an engagement or establishing a satisfactory professional relation.
The importance of repeat business and referrals gives the
CPA a strong incentive to act in a responsible and decorous
manner when soliciting business. In contrast with Ohralik,
it cannot be said that under these circumstances, personal
solicitation by CPA's "more often than not will be injurious
to the person solicited." Ohralik, 436 U. S., at 466.

The Board's reliance on Ohralik is misplaced for yet another reason: The Board misunderstands what Ohralik
meant when it approved the use of a prophylactic rule. Id.,
at 464. The ban on attorney solicitation in Ohralik was prophylactic in the sense that it prohibited conduct conducive to
fraud or overreaching at the outset, rather than punishing
the misconduct after it occurred. But Ohralik in no way
relieves the State of the obligation to demonstrate that it is
regulating speech in order to address what is in fact a serious problem and that the preventative measure it proposes
will contribute in a material way to solving that problem.
See ibid. (describing the State's fear of harm from attorney
solicitation as "well founded").

Were we to read Ohralik in the manner the Board proposes, the protection afforded commercial speech would be
reduced almost to nothing; comprehensive bans on certain
categories of commercial speech would be permitted as
a matter of course. That would be inconsistent with the
results reached in a number of our prior cases. See, e. g.,
Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985); Bates v. State Bar of
Arizona, 433 U. S. 350 (1977); Linmark Associates, Inc. v.
Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85 (1977). It would also be inconsistent with this Court's general approach to the use of preventative rules in the First Amendment context. "Broad
prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect.
Precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so
closely touching our most precious freedoms." NAACP v.
Button, 371 U. S. 415, 438 (1963) (citations omitted). Even
under the First Amendment's somewhat more forgiving
standards for restrictions on commercial speech, a State may
not curb protected expression without advancing a substantial governmental interest. Here, the ends sought by the
State are not advanced by the speech restriction, and legitimate commercial speech is suppressed. For this reason, the
Board's rule infringes upon Fane's right to speak, as guaranteed by the Constitution.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Blackmun, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion, just as I joined Justice Stevens' recent opinion for the Court in Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., ante, p. 410, with the observation that I
again disengage myself from any part thereof, or inference
therefrom, that commercial speech that is free from fraud or
duress or the advocacy of unlawful activity is entitled to only
an "intermediate standard," see ante, at 767, of protection

O'Connor, J., dissenting
under the First Amendment's proscription of any law abridg-ing the freedom of speech.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
I continue to believe that this Court took a wrong turn
with Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S. 350 (1977), and
that it has compounded this error by finding increasingly unprofessional forms of attorney advertising to be protected
speech. See Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel

of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626 (1985); Shapero v.
Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466 (1988); Peel v. Attorney
Registration and Disciplinary Comm'n of Ill., 496 U. S. 91
(1990) (plurality opinion). These cases consistently focus on
whether the challenged advertisement directly harms the
listener: whether it is false or misleading, or amounts to
"overreaching, invasion of privacy, [or] the exercise of undue
influence," Shapero, supra, at 475. This focus is too narrow.
In my view, the States have the broader authority to prohibit
commercial speech that, albeit not directly harmful to the
listener, is inconsistent with the speaker's membership in a
learned profession and therefore damaging to the profession
and society at large. See Zauderer, supra, at 676-677
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment
in part, and dissenting in part); Shapero, supra, at 488-491
(O'Connor, J., dissenting); Peel, supra, at 119 (O'Connor, J.,
dissenting). In particular, the States may prohibit certain
"forms of competition usual in the business world," Goldfarb
v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792 (1975) (internal
quotation marks omitted), on the grounds that pure profit
seeking degrades the public-spirited culture of the profession
and that a particular profit-seeking practice is inadequately
justified in terms of consumer welfare or other social benefits. Commercialization has an incremental, indirect, yet
profound effect on professional culture, as lawyers know all
too well.

779Cite as: 507 U. S. 761 (1993)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
But even if I agreed that the States may target only professional speech that directly harms the listener, I still would
dissent in this case. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436
U. S. 447 (1978), held that an attorney could be sanctioned
for the in-person solicitation of two particularly vulnerable
potential clients, because of the inherent risk under such circumstances that the attorney's speech would be directly
harmful, and because a simple prohibition on fraud or overreaching would be difficult to enforce in the context of
in-person solicitation. See id., at 464-468. The result
reached by the majority today cannot be squared with
Ohralik.

Although Ohralik preceded Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557
(1980), this Court has understood Ohralik to mean that a
rule prohibiting in-person solicitation by attorneys would
satisfy the Central Hudson test. See Shapero, supra, at
472. Such a rule would "directly advanc[e] the governmental interest [and would not be] more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest." Central Hudson, supra, at 566.
A substantial fraction of in-person solicitations are inherently conducive to overreaching or otherwise harmful
speech, and these potentially harmful solicitations cannot be
singled out in advance (or so a reasonable legislator could
believe).

I see no constitutional difference between a rule prohibiting in-person solicitation by attorneys, and a rule prohibiting
in-person solicitation by certified public accountants (CPA's).
The attorney's rhetorical power derives not only from his
specific training in the art of persuasion, see ante, at 774-775,
but more generally from his professional expertise. His
certified status as an expert in a complex subject matter--
the law--empowers the attorney to overawe inexpert clients. CPA's have an analogous power. The drafters of
Fla. Admin. Code $ 21A-24.002(2)(c) (1992) reasonably could

507us3$62L 11-20-96 19:02:34 PAGES OPINPGT
780 EDENFIELD v. FANE

O'Connor, J., dissenting
have envisioned circumstances analogous to those inOhralik, where there is a substantial risk that the CPA will

use his professional expertise to mislead or coerce a naivepotential client.

Indeed, the majority scrupulously declines to question thevalidity of Florida's rule. The majority never analyzes the
rule itself under Central Hudson, cf. Posadas de Puerto Rico
Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328, 340-344 (1986) (analyzing "facial" validity of law regulating commercial speech by employing Central Hudson test), but in-stead seeks to avoid this analysis by characterizing Fane's
suit as an "as-applied" challenge. See ante, at 763, 767, 770,771, 774. I am surprised that the majority has taken this
approach without explaining or even articulating the under-lying assumption: that a commercial speaker can claim First
Amendment protection for particular instances of prohibitedcommercial speech, even where the prohibitory law satisfies
Central Hudson. Board of Trustees of State University of
N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469 (1989), appears to say the opposite,see

id., at 476-486, and we recently granted certiorari in acase that poses precisely this issue, see United States v. Edge

Broadcasting Co., 506 U. S. 1032 (1992).In any event, the instant case is not an "as-applied" challenge, in the sense that a speaker points to special featuresof his own speech as constitutionally protected from a valid
law. Cf. Zauderer, supra, at 644. The majority obscuresthis point by stating that Florida's rule "cannot be sustained
as applied to Fane's proposed speech," ante, at 767, and byparaphrasing Fane's affidavit at length to show that he does
not propose to solicit vulnerable clients, ante, at 775-776.But I do not understand the relevance of that affidavit here,
because the broad remedy granted by the District Courtgoes well beyond Fane's own speech.

"Florida Administrative Code, $$ 21A-24.002(2) and(3), places an unconstitutional ban on protected commercial speech in violation of the first . . . amendmen[t].

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The Board of Accountancy and State are hereby en-joined from enforcing that regulation as it is applied to

CPAs who seek clients through in-person, direct, unin-vited solicitation in the business context." App. 88.

Even if the majority is correct that a law satisfying CentralHudson cannot be applied to harmless commercial speech,
and that Fane's proposed speech will indeed be harmless,these two premises do not justify an injunction against the
enforcement of the antisolicitation rule to all CPA's.The majority also relies on the fact that petitioners were
enjoined only from enforcing the rule in the "business con-text." See

ante, at 763, 771. Yet this narrowing of focus,without more, does not salvage the District Court's remedy.

I fail to see why $ 21A-24.002(2)(c) should be valid overall,but not "in the business context." Small businesses constitute the vast majority of business establishments in theUnited States, see U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Statistical Abstract of the United States 526 (1992). The drafters of Flor-ida's rule reasonably could have believed that the average
small businessman is no more sophisticated than the averageindividual who is wealthy enough to hire a CPA for his personal affairs.In short, I do not see how the result reached by the majority is consistent with the validity of $ 21A-24.002(2)(c). Infailing to state otherwise, the majority implies that the rule
itself satisfies Central Hudson, and I agree, but on that pre-cise grounds I would reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.

No. 92-379. Illinois v. Condon. Sup. Ct. Ill. Certiorari de-nied. Reported below: 148 Ill. 2d 96, 592 N. E. 2d 951.

Justice White, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.
The State of Illinois, petitioner here, seeks review of a judg-ment of the Illinois Supreme Court holding that a police search
of respondent's home, conducted pursuant to a warrant, was un-constitutional because the police failed to knock and announce
their presence before entering the premises. Because the deci-sion below is in conflict with those of other courts on the question
of what showing police must make to dispense with the ordinaryknock-and-announce requirement in executing search warrants, I
would grant certiorari.Based on information provided by informants, police in Du Page
County, Illinois, obtained a warrant to search respondent's home.Police had been told by the informants that respondent had been
using the residence as a base for cocaine distribution, that resi-dents of the house monitored approaching traffic with closedcircuit surveillance cameras and a police scanner, and that severalweapons were kept inside the house. The police also knew that
the house was owned by respondent's brother, whom they pre-viously had arrested on drugs and weapons charges and who was
then a fugitive.On the evening of November 6, 1987, a team of police officers
executed the warrant. They stormed respondent's home withoutknocking or announcing their presence and arrested respondent.
A search of the home revealed cocaine, marijuana, 13 guns, andmarked currency obtained through drug transactions orchestrated
by police earlier that day.At his subsequent trial, respondent contended that the search
was constitutionally invalid under the Fourth Amendment be-cause police did not knock and announce their presence before
entering his home. The trial court denied respondent's suppres-sion motion, finding that exigent circumstances justified the unannounced entry. Respondent was thereafter convicted on severalcounts. On appeal, the State Appellate Court reversed respondent's conviction and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed, holdingthat the facts did not demonstrate exigent circumstances sufficient
to dispense with the knock-and-announce requirement. 148 Ill.2d 96, 592 N. E. 2d 951 (1992). In so holding, the court turned

February 22, 1993507 U. S.
aside each of the four circumstances proffered by the State asjustifying the unannounced entry: the presence of cocaine in the
house and the ease with which it could be destroyed, the existenceof surveillance cameras and a police scanner, the presence of
weapons in the house, and the fact that respondent's brother hadbeen carrying a loaded pistol at the time of his earlier arrest on
drug charges. Id., at 103-106, 592 N. E. 2d, at 955-956. Thecourt also rejected the State's contention that these circumstances
should be considered collectively in determining whether the un-announced entry was justified.

Id., at 106, 592 N. E. 2d, at 956.The decision below is in conflict with those of other courts

holding that similar factual showings demonstrate "exigent cir-cumstances" justifying an unannounced entry. See,

e. g., UnitedStates v. Keene, 915 F. 2d 1164, 1168-1169 (CA8 1990) (fact that

narcotics on premises could have been quickly destroyed justifiedunannounced entry), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1102 (1991);

State v.Matos, 135 N. H. 410, 411, 605 A. 2d 223, 224 (1992) (same); State

v. Williams, 168 Wis. 2d 970, 985-986, 485 N. W. 2d 42, 48 (1992)(combined presence of drugs and guns on premises justified unnanounced entry). The state courts are particularly divided over
whether the presence of illegal drugs alone will justify unan-nounced police entry on the theory that pausing to announce the

search will enable the destruction of evidence. See United Statesv.

Moore, 956 F. 2d 843, 849-850, and n. 9 (CA8 1992) (acknowledging split of authority and collecting cases); Matos, supra, at 412,605 A. 2d, at 224 (same).

Although there are perhaps prudential reasons counseling
against plenary review in this case, I would grant certiorari toresolve the conflict.

These petitions raise yet again the question whether waste by-products that are not ingestible or marketable may be included
in calculating the weight of a "mixture or substance containing adetectable amount of . . . methamphetamine" for purposes of

$ 2D1.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission, GuidelinesManual (Nov. 1991). The Circuits are deeply split on this issue.
As I noted in Walker v. United States, 506 U. S. 967, 968 (1992), theCourts of Appeals for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have
joined the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits in adopting an approachconsistent with that urged by petitioners. By contrast, the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, joined by the First and TenthCircuits, has adopted a contrary approach.

Ibid. In the decisionbelow, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit adhered to this

position, reaffirming its disagreement with the holding of theSixth Circuit in

United States v. Jennings, 945 F. 2d 129 (CA61991), and recognizing inconsistency with approaches adopted by

the Second and Eleventh Circuits. United States v. Sherrod, 964F. 2d 1501, 1509-1511, and n. 22 (CA5 1992). The conflict is enduring and the issue important. As a result of the conflict, thoseconvicted of violating federal law are subject to widely disparate
sentences, depending only on the federal circuit in which theircases are brought. The issue is a recurring one. Respondent
concedes that the Circuits are in conflict, but notes that it didnot oppose certiorari in

United States v. Mahecha-Onofre, 936F. 2d 623 (CA1), and this Court nonetheless denied review there,

502 U. S. 1009 (1991), and since has denied review of the issuefour more times. Respondent is correct. See

Cooper v. UnitedStates, 506 U. S. 1041 (1992) (
White and Blackmun, JJ., dissentingfrom denial of certiorari);
Walker v. United States, supra (Whiteand

April 2, 1993Miscellaneous Order

No. A-742. Fargo Women's Health Organization et al.v. Schafer, Governor of North Dakota, et al. D. C. N. D.
Application for stay and injunction pending appeal, presented toJustice Blackmun, and by him referred to the Court, denied.
The order heretofore entered by Justice Blackmun on March31, 1993, is vacated. Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens
would grant the application.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter joins,concurring.

Applicants challenged certain provisions of the North DakotaAbortion Control Act, N. D. Cent. Code $$ 14-02.1-01 to 14-
02.1-12 (1991), in the United States District Court for the Districtof North Dakota. Relying on our decision in United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), the District Court granted summaryjudgment against applicants. The court reasoned that applicants
could not mount a successful facial challenge because they wereunable to show that " `no set of circumstances exists under which
the [challenged provisions] would be valid.' " Fargo Women'sHealth Organization v. Skinner, No. A3-91-95 (Feb. 19, 1993)
(quoting Salerno, supra, at 745). The court denied applicants'motion for a stay and injunction pending appeal. See Fargo
Women's Health Organization v. Schafer, No. A3-91-95 (Mar. 9,1993). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit also denied
a motion for stay and injunction pending appeal. It agreed withthe District Court that the Salerno standard applied and concluded that this Court's decision last Term in Planned Parenthoodof Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), did not counsel
a different approach. See Fargo Women's Health Organization

O'Connor, J., concurring 507 U. S.
v. Schafer, No. 93-1579 (Mar. 30, 1993). The appeal was expe-dited, and argument is scheduled for April 14, 1993.

Applicants now ask us for a stay of the District Court's judg-ment and for injunctive relief. When a matter is pending before
a court of appeals, it long has been the practice of Members ofthis Court to grant stay applications only "upon the weightiest
considerations." O'Rourke v. Levine, 80 S. Ct. 623, 624, 4 L. Ed.2d 615, 616 (1960) (Harlan, J., in chambers). Accord,

CertainNamed and Unnamed Non-Citizen Children and Their Parents

v. Texas, 448 U. S. 1327, 1330 (1980) (Powell, J., in chambers); seealso

Heckler v. Redbud Hospital Dist., 473 U. S. 1308, 1312 (1985)(
Rehnquist, J., in chambers) ("[A] stay application to a CircuitJustice on a matter before a court of appeals is rarely granted"

(internal quotation marks omitted)); Heckler v. Lopez, 464 U. S.879, 884 (1983) (

Stevens, J., joined by Blackmun, J., dissentingin part) ("[I]n such a case the granting of a stay by a Circuit

Justice should be extremely rare and great deference should be
shown to the judgment of the Court of Appeals"). Consistentwith that practice, I vote to deny the stay application. I do not

believe applicants have demonstrated that this is one of those
rare and exceptional cases in which a stay pending appeal iswarranted.

I write separately, however, to point out that our denial of reliefshould not be viewed as signaling agreement with the lower
courts' reasoning. In my view, the approach taken by the lowercourts is inconsistent with

Casey. In striking down Pennsylvania's spousal-notice provision, we did not require petitioners to
show that the provision would be invalid in all circumstances.Rather, we made clear that a law restricting abortions constitutes

an undue burden, and hence is invalid, if, "in a large fraction ofthe cases in which [the law] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion."
Casey, 505 U. S., at 895. And the joint opinion specifically exam-ined the record developed in the District Court in determining

that Pennsylvania's informed-consent provision did not create anundue burden. See

id., at 885-887 (opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). While I express no view as to whetherthe particular provisions at issue in this case constitute an undue

burden, I believe the lower courts should have undertaken the
same analysis.

Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun and JusticeSouter join, dissenting.
Under Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (1981), adefendant who invokes the Fifth Amendment right to counsel
during custodial interrogation may not be subjected to furtherinterrogation until counsel is made available to him, unless he
subsequently initiates communications. "[I]t is inconsistent withMiranda [v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),] and its progeny," the
Court concluded, "for the authorities, at their instance, to reinter-rogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right
to counsel." Id., at 485. While easily stated, the Edwards rulehas not always been easy to apply. In particular, the question of
how officials conducting an interrogation ought to respond to adefendant's ambiguous or equivocal assertion of the right to counsel has divided the state and federal courts. The Court shouldtake this opportunity to resolve this important constitutional
question.Virginia police arrested petitioner in connection with the abduction, rape, and murder of 10-year-old Charity Powers. Petitionerwas advised of his Miranda rights and agreed to talk to a detective and an FBI agent. During the interrogation, petitionerasked the detective: " `Do you think I need an attorney here?' "

White, J., dissenting 507 U. S.
The detective responded by shaking his head slightly from sideto side, shrugging, and stating: " `You're just talking to us.' " The
interrogation continued and petitioner confessed to the crimes.See 244 Va. 386, 391, 422 S. E. 2d 380, 384 (1992). Petitioner
sought to suppress the confession, claiming, inter alia, that thecontinuation of the interrogation constituted an Edwards violation. The trial court denied the motion and petitioner was tried,convicted, and sentenced to death. Relying on its prior decision
in Eaton v. Commonwealth, 240 Va. 236, 253-254, 397 S. E. 2d385, 395-396 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 824 (1991), which in
turn relied on Edwards' reference to a defendant who has "clearlyasserted" the right to counsel, see supra, at 1043, the Virginia
Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that petitioner's question"did not constitute an unambiguous request for counsel" and
therefore was insufficient to trigger Edwards. 244 Va., at 396,422 S. E. 2d, at 387. Petitioner now seeks review of this ruling,
among others. Pet. for Cert. 11-12.It has been nearly a decade since the Court acknowledged the
existence of three "conflicting standards" used by state and fed-eral courts for determining the consequences of ambiguous or
equivocal assertions of the right to counsel. Smith v. Illinois,469 U. S. 91, 95-96, and n. 3 (1984) (per curiam). Thus,

"[s]ome courts have held that all questioning must ceaseupon any request for or reference to counsel, however equivocal or ambiguous. Others have attempted to define a thresh-old standard of clarity for such requests, and have held that
requests falling below this threshold do not trigger the rightto counsel. . . . Still others have adopted a third approach,
holding that when an accused makes an equivocal statementthat `arguably' can be construed as a request for counsel,
all interrogation must immediately cease except for narrowquestions designed to `clarify' the earlier statement and the
accused's desires respecting counsel." Id., at 96, n. 3 (cita-tions omitted).

This disagreement has not abated. Although a number of Cir-cuits have since adopted what Smith described as the "third approach," see United States v. Porter, 776 F. 2d 370 (CA1 1985);United States v. Gotay, 844 F. 2d 971, 975 (CA2 1988); United
States v. Fouche, 776 F. 2d 1398, 1405 (CA9 1985); Towne v. Dug-ger, 899 F. 2d 1104 (CA11), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 991 (1990), the

1045ORDERS
April 19, 1993507 U. S.
Sixth Circuit apparently adheres to the first approach. See Mag-lio v. Jago, 580 F. 2d 202, 205 (1978) (ambiguous invocation requires cessation of all questioning). State high courts also continueto issue conflicting decisions. Kentucky and Texas, like Virginia,
now employ a variant of the second, "threshold standard," ap-proach, see Dean v. Commonwealth, 844 S. W. 2d 417, 420 (Ky.
1992) (endorsing Eaton v. Commonwealth, supra); Russell v. State,727 S. W. 2d 573, 575 (Tex. Crim. App.) (en banc) (right to counsel
invoked if "clearly asserted"), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 856 (1987),while other States and the District of Columbia have embraced the
third approach, see State v. Staatz, 159 Ariz. 411, 414, 768 P. 2d143, 146 (1988); People v. Benjamin, 732 P. 2d 1167, 1171 (Colo.
1987), Crawford v. State, 580 A. 2d 571, 576-577 (Del. 1990); Ruffinv. United States, 524 A. 2d 685 (D. C. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U. S.
1057 (1988); Hall v. State, 255 Ga. 267, 273, 336 S. E. 2d 812, 816(1985); State v. Robinson, 427 N. W. 2d 217, 223 (Minn. 1988).

As it is apparent that a substantial number of criminal defend-ants who are identically situated in the eyes of the Constitution
have received, and will continue to receive, dissimilar treatmentbecause of the different approaches taken by the lower courts, I
would grant certiorari.

AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULES

OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE

Rule 3. Appeal as of right--how taken.. . . . .

(c) Content of the notice of appeal.--A notice of appeal
must specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each appellant in either the caption or the body of the
notice of appeal. An attorney representing more than one
party may fulfill this requirement by describing those parties with such terms as "all plaintiffs," "the defendants,"
"the plaintiffs A, B, et al.," or "all defendants except X." A
notice of appeal filed pro se is filed on behalf of the party
signing the notice and the signer's spouse and minor children, if they are parties, unless the notice of appeal clearly
indicates a contrary intent. In a class action, whether or
not the class has been certified, it is sufficient for the notice
to name one person qualified to bring the appeal as representative of the class. A notice of appeal also must designate the judgment, order, or part thereof appealed from,
and must name the court to which the appeal is taken. An
appeal will not be dismissed for informality of form or title
of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose
intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice. Form 1
in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form for a notice
of appeal.

(d) Serving the notice of appeal.--The clerk of the district
court shall serve notice of the filing of a notice of appeal by
mailing a copy to each party's counsel of record (apart from
the appellant's), or, if a party is not represented by counsel,
to the party's last known address. The clerk of the district
court shall forthwith send a copy of the notice and of the
docket entries to the clerk of the court of appeals named in

Rule 3.1. Appeal from a judgment entered by a magistrate

judge in a civil case.

Rule 4. Appeal as of right--when taken.

507rul3ap2 12-28-95 14:36:31 PGT * RULES

1065RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
thereof is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed byany party within 60 days after such entry. If a notice

of appeal is mistakenly filed in the court of appeals, theclerk of the court of appeals shall note thereon the date
when the clerk received the notice and send it to theclerk of the district court and the notice will be treated
as filed in the district court on the date so noted.(2) A notice of appeal filed after the court announces
a decision or order but before the entry of the judgmentor order is treated as filed on the date of and after the
entry.(3) If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any
other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 daysafter the date when the first notice was filed, or within
the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), which-ever period last expires.

(4) If any party makes a timely motion of a type speci-fied immediately below, the time for appeal for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing of thelast such motion outstanding. This provision applies
to a timely motion under the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure:

(A) for judgment under Rule 50(b);(B) to amend or make additional findings of fact
under Rule 52(b), whether or not granting the mo-tion would alter the judgment;

(C) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule59;
(D) for attorney's fees under Rule 54 if a districtcourt under Rule 58 extends the time for appeal;
(E) for a new trial under Rule 59; or(F) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is
served within 10 days after the entry of judgment.
A notice of appeal filed after announcement or entryof the judgment but before disposition of any of the

above motions is ineffective to appeal from the judg-ment or order, or part thereof, specified in the notice of
appeal, until the date of the entry of the order disposing

507rul3ap2 12-28-95 14:36:31 PGT * RULES
1066 RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE

of the last such motion outstanding. Appellate reviewof an order disposing of any of the above motions requires the party, in compliance with Appellate Rule 3(c),to amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A party
intending to challenge an alteration or amendment ofthe judgment shall file an amended notice of appeal
within the time prescribed by this Rule 4 measuredfrom the entry of the order disposing of the last such
motion outstanding. No additional fees will be requiredfor filing an amended notice.
. . . . .
(b) Appeal in a criminal case.--In a criminal case, a de-fendant shall file the notice of appeal in the district court

within 10 days after the entry either of the judgment ororder appealed from, or of a notice of appeal by the Government. A notice of appeal filed after the announcement of adecision, sentence, or order--but before entry of the judgment or order--is treated as filed on the date of and afterthe entry. If a defendant makes a timely motion specified
immediately below, in accordance with the Federal Rules ofCriminal Procedure, an appeal from a judgment of conviction
must be taken within 10 days after the entry of the orderdisposing of the last such motion outstanding, or within 10
days after the entry of the judgment of conviction, whicheveris later. This provision applies to a timely motion:

(1) for judgment of acquittal;(2) for arrest of judgment;
(3) for a new trial on any ground other than newlydiscovered evidence; or
(4) for a new trial based on the ground of newly dis-covered evidence if the motion is made before or within
10 days after entry of the judgment.
A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a deci-sion, sentence, or order but before it disposes of any of the

above motions, is ineffective until the date of the entry ofthe order disposing of the last such motion outstanding, or
until the date of the entry of the judgment of conviction,

507rul3ap2 12-28-95 14:36:31 PGT * RULES

1067RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
whichever is later. Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule
3(c), a valid notice of appeal is effective without amendment
to appeal from an order disposing of any of the above motions. When an appeal by the government is authorized by
statute, the notice of appeal must be filed in the district court
within 30 days after (i) the entry of the judgment or order
appealed from or (ii) the filing of a notice of appeal by any
defendant.

A judgment or order is entered within the meaning of this
subdivision when it is entered on the criminal docket. Upon
a showing of excusable neglect, the district court may--before or after the time has expired, with or without motion
and notice--extend the time for filing a notice of appeal for
a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the
time otherwise prescribed by this subdivision.

The filing of a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(b) does
not divest a district court of jurisdiction to correct a sentence
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c), nor does the filing of a motion
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c) affect the validity of a notice of
appeal filed before entry of the order disposing of the motion.

(c) Appeal by an inmate confined in an institution.--If
an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in
either a civil case or a criminal case, the notice of appeal is
timely filed if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail
system on or before the last day for filing. Timely filing
may be shown by a notarized statement or by a declaration
(in compliance with 28 U. S. C. $ 1746) setting forth the date
of deposit and stating that first-class postage has been prepaid. In a civil case in which the first notice of appeal is
filed in the manner provided in this subdivision (c), the 14-
day period provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this Rule 4 for
another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date
when the district court receives the first notice of appeal.
In a criminal case in which a defendant files a notice of
appeal in the manner provided in this subdivision (c), the
30-day period for the government to file its notice of appeal
runs from the entry of the judgment or order appealed from

Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2072 empowers the Supreme Court toprescribe general rules of practice and procedure and rules

Court does not itself draft and initially propose these rules.Section 2073 directs the Judicial Conference to prescribe the

procedures for proposing the rules mentioned in $ 2072.The Conference is authorized to appoint committees to propose such rules. These rules advisory committees are to be

made up of members of the professional bar and trial and
appellate judges. The Conference is also to appoint a standing committee on rules of practice and evidence to review
the recommendations of the advisory committees and to recommend to the Conference such rules and amendments to
those rules "as may be necessary to maintain consistency and
otherwise promote the interest of justice." $ 2073(b). Any
rules approved by the Conference are transmitted to the Supreme Court, which in turn transmits any rules "prescribed"
pursuant to $ 2072 to the Congress. Except as provided in

$ 2074(b), such rules become effective at a specified time unless Congress otherwise provides.

The members of the advisory and standing committees are
carefully named by The Chief Justice, and I am quite sure
that these experienced judges and lawyers take their work
very seriously. It is also quite evident that neither the
standing committee nor the Judicial Conference merely rubber stamps the proposals recommended to it. It is not at all
rare that advisory committee proposals are returned to the
originating committee for further study.

During my 31 years on the Court, the number of advisory
committees has grown as necessitated by statutory changes.
During that time, by my count at least, on some 64 occasions
we have "prescribed" and transmitted to Congress a new
set of rules or amendments to certain rules. Some of the
transmissions have been minor, but many of them have been
extensive. Over this time, Justices Black and Douglas,
either together or separately, dissented 13 times on the
ground that it was inappropriate for the Court to pass on the
merits of the rules before it.2 Aside from those two Jus2 421 U. S. 1019, 1022 (1975) (Douglas, J., dissenting); 416 U. S. 1001, 1003

997 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting); 461 U. S. 1117, 1119 (1983)(

O'Connor, J., dissenting). Only once in my memory didthe Court refuse to transmit some of the rule changes proposed by the Judicial Conference. 500 U. S. 964 (1991).

That the Justices have hardly ever refused to transmit therules submitted by the Judicial Conference and the fact that,

aside from Justices Black and Douglas, it has been quite rarefor any Justice to dissent from transmitting any such rule,
suggest that a sizable majority of the 21 Justices who satduring this period concluded that Congress intended them
to have a rather limited role in the rulemaking process. Thevast majority (including myself) obviously have not explicitly subscribed to the Black-Douglas view that many of the
rules proposed dealt with substantive matters that the Con-stitution reserved to Congress and that in any event were

prohibited by $ 2072's injunction against abridging, enlarg-ing, or modifying substantive rights.

Some of us, however, have silently shared Justice Black'sand Justice Douglas' suggestion that the enabling statutes
be amended

"to place the responsibility upon the Judicial Conference
rather than upon this Court. Since the statute was firstenacted in 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, the Judicial Conference

has been enlarged and improved and is now very activein its surveillance of the work of the federal courts and
in recommending appropriate legislation to Congress.
The present rules produced under 28 U. S. C. $ 2072 arenot prepared by us but by Committees of the Judicial

guished members and they render a high public service.It is they, however, who do the work, not we, and the

rules have only our imprimatur. The only contributionthat we actually make is an occasional exercise of a veto
power. If the rule-making for Federal District Courtsis to continue under the present plan, we believe that
the Supreme Court should not have any part in the task;rather, the statute should be amended to substitute the
Judicial Conference. The Judicial Conference can par-ticipate more actively in fashioning the rules and affirmatively contribute to their content and design betterthan we can. Transfer of the function to the Judicial
Conference would relieve us of the embarrassment ofhaving to sit in judgment on the constitutionality of
rules which we have approved and which as applied ingiven situations might have to be declared invalid."
374 U. S. 865, 869-870 (1963) (footnote omitted).
Despite the repeated protestations of both or one of thoseJustices, Congress did not eliminate our participation in the

rulemaking process. Indeed, our statutory role was contin-ued as the coverage of $ 2072 was extended to the rules of
evidence and to proceedings before magistrates. Congressclearly continued to direct us to "prescribe" specified rules.
But most of us concluded that for at least two reasons Con-gress could not have intended us to provide another layer
of review equivalent to that of the standing committee andthe Judicial Conference. First, to perform such a function
would take an inordinate amount of time, the expenditure ofwhich would be inconsistent with the demands of a growing
caseload. Second, some us, and I remain of this view, werequite sure that the Judicial Conference and its committees,
"being in large part judges of the lower courts and attorneyswho are using the Rules day in and day out, are in a far
better position to make a practical judgment upon their util-ity or inutility than we." 383 U. S. 1089, 1090 (1966) (Douglas, J., dissenting in part).I did my share of litigating when in practice and once

the trial practice is a dynamic profession, and the longer oneis away from it the less likely it is that he or she should

presume to second-guess the careful work of the active pro-fessionals manning the rulemaking committees, work that
the Judicial Conference has approved. At the very least, weshould not perform a de novo review and should defer to the
Judicial Conference and its committees as long as they havesome rational basis for their proposed amendments.

Hence, as I have seen the Court's role over the years, it isto transmit the Judicial Conference's recommendations without change and without careful study, as long as there is nosuggestion that the committee system has not operated with
integrity. If it has not, such a fact, or even such a claim,about a body so open to public inspection would inevitably
surface. This has been my practice, even though on severaloccasions, based perhaps on out-of-date conceptions, I had
serious questions about the wisdom of particular proposalsto amend certain rules.

In connection with the proposed rule changes now beforeus, there is no suggestion that the rulemaking process has
failed to function properly. No doubt the proposed changesdo not please everyone, as letters I have received indicate.
But I assume that such opposing views have been before thecommittees and have been rejected on the merits. That is
enough for me.Justice Douglas thought that the Court should be taken
out of the rulemaking process entirely, but as long as Con-gress insisted on our "prescribing" rules, he refused to be a
mere conduit and would dissent to forwarding rule changeswith which he disagreed. I note that

Justice Scaliaseems to follow that example. But I also note that as time

went on, Justice Douglas confessed to insufficient familiaritywith the context in which new rules would operate to pass
judgment on their merits.3

1096 DISSENTING STATEMENT OF SCALIA, J.

In conclusion, I suggest that it would be a mistake for thebench, the bar, or the Congress to assume that we are duplicating the function performed by the standing committee orthe Judicial Conference with respect to changes in the various rules which come to us for transmittal. As I have said,over the years our role has been a much more limited one.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, andwith whom

Justice Souter joins as to Part II, filed adissenting statement.

I dissent from the Court's adoption of the amendments toFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 (relating to sanctions for
frivolous litigation), and 26, 30, 31, 33, and 37 (relating todiscovery). In my view, the sanctions proposal will eliminate a significant and necessary deterrent to frivolous litiga-tion; and the discovery proposal will increase litigation costs,
burden the district courts, and, perhaps worst of all, intro-duce into the trial process an element that is contrary to the
nature of our adversary system.

I
Rule 11
It is undeniably important to the Rules' goal of "the just,speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action," Fed.

Rule Civ. Proc. 1, that frivolous pleadings and motions bedeterred. The current Rule 11 achieves that objective by
requiring sanctions when its standards are violated (thoughleaving the court broad discretion as to the manner of sanction), and by allowing compensation for the moving party'sexpenses and attorney's fees. The proposed revision would

920. But for most of these Rules I do not have sufficient insight and
experience to know whether they are desirable or undesirable. I must,
therefore, disassociate myself from them." 411 U. S. 992, 994 (1973).

With respect to Amendments to the Rules of Criminal Procedure forwarded by the Court a year later, the following statement was appended
to the Court's order, 416 U. S. 1003 (1974): "Mr. Justice Douglas is opposed to the Court's being a mere conduit of Rules to Congress since the
Court has had no hand in drafting them and has no competence to design
them in keeping with the titles and spirit of the Constitution."

507rulu3cv 11-13-96 17:26:07 PGT * RULES

1097DISSENTING STATEMENT OF SCALIA, J.
render the Rule toothless, by allowing judges to dispense
with sanctions, by disfavoring compensation for litigation
expenses, and by providing a 21-day "safe harbor" within
which, if the party accused of a frivolous filing withdraws
the filing, he is entitled to escape with no sanction at all.

To take the last first: In my view, those who file frivolous
suits and pleadings should have no "safe harbor." The
Rules should be solicitous of the abused (the courts and the
opposing party) and not of the abuser. Under the revised
Rule, parties will be able to file thoughtless, reckless, and
harassing pleadings, secure in the knowledge that they have
nothing to lose: If objection is raised, they can retreat without penalty. The proposed revision contradicts what this
Court said only three years ago: "Baseless filing puts the
machinery of justice in motion, burdening courts and individuals alike with needless expense and delay. Even if the
careless litigant quickly dismisses the action, the harm triggering Rule 11's concerns has already occurred. Therefore,
a litigant who violates Rule 11 merits sanctions even after a
dismissal." Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384,
398 (1990). The advisory committee itself was formerly of
the same view. Ibid. (quoting Letter from Chairman, Advisory Committee on Civil Rules).

The proposed Rule also decreases both the likelihood and
the severity of punishment for those foolish enough not to
seek refuge in the safe harbor after an objection is raised.
Proposed subsection (c) makes the issuance of any sanction
discretionary, whereas currently it is required. Judges, like
other human beings, do not like imposing punishment when
their duty does not require it, especially upon their own acquaintances and members of their own profession. They do
not immediately see, moreover, the systemwide benefits of
serious Rule 11 sanctions, though they are intensely aware
of the amount of their own time it would take to consider
and apply sanctions in the case before them. For these reasons, I think it important to the effectiveness of the scheme
that the sanctions remain mandatory.

507rulu3cv 11-13-96 17:26:07 PGT * RULES
1098 DISSENTING STATEMENT OF SCALIA, J.

Finally, the likelihood that frivolousness will even be challenged is diminished by the proposed Rule, which restricts
the award of compensation to "unusual circumstances," withmonetary sanctions "ordinarily" to be payable to the court.

Advisory Committee Notes to Proposed Rule 11, pp. 53-54.Under Proposed Rule 11(c)(2), a court may order payment
for "some or all of the reasonable attorneys' fees and otherexpenses incurred as a direct result of the violation" only
when that is "warranted for effective deterrence." Since
the deterrent effect of a fine is rarely increased by alteringthe identity of the payee, it takes imagination to conceive of

instances in which this provision will ever apply. And thecommentary makes it clear that even when compensation is
granted it should be granted stingily--only for costs "di-rectly and unavoidably caused by the violation."

Id., at 54.
As seen from the viewpoint of the victim of an abusive litiga-tor, these revisions convert Rule 11 from a means of obtaining compensation to an invitation to throw good money after
bad. The net effect is to decrease the incentive on the partof the person best situated to alert the court to perversion

of our civil justice system.I would not have registered this dissent if there were convincing indication that the current Rule 11 regime is ineffec-tive or encourages excessive satellite litigation. But there
appears to be general agreement, reflected in a recent report
of the advisory committee itself, that Rule 11, as written,basically works. According to that report, a Federal Judicial Center survey showed that 80% of district judges believeRule 11 has had an overall positive effect and should be retained in its present form, 95% believed the Rule had notimpeded development of the law, and about 75% said the benefits justify the expenditure of judicial time. See InterimReport on Rule 11, Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, reprinted in G. Vairo, Rule 11 Sanctions: Case Law Perspectives and Preventive Measures, App. I-8 to I-10 (2d ed.
1991). True, many lawyers do not like Rule 11. It may
cause them financial liability, it may damage their professional reputation in front of important clients, and the cost507rulu3cv 11-13-96 17:26:07 PGT * RULES

1099DISSENTING STATEMENT OF SCALIA, J.
of-litigation savings it produces are savings not to lawyersbut to litigants. But the overwhelming approval of the Rule

by the federal district judges who daily grapple with theproblem of litigation abuse is enough to persuade me that it
should not be gutted as the proposed revision suggests.1

II
Discovery Rules
The proposed radical reforms to the discovery process arepotentially disastrous and certainly premature--particularly

the imposition on litigants of a continuing duty to discloseto opposing counsel, without awaiting any request, various information "relevant to disputed facts alleged with par-ticularity." See Proposed Rules 26(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B), (e)(1).
This proposal is promoted as a means of reducing the unnec-essary expense and delay that occur in the present discovery
regime. But the duty-to-disclose regime does not replacethe current, much-criticized discovery process; rather, it
adds a further layer of discovery. It will likely increasethe discovery burdens on district judges, as parties litigate
about what is "relevant" to "disputed facts," whether thosefacts have been alleged with sufficient particularity, whether
the opposing side has adequately disclosed the required in-formation, and whether it has fulfilled its continuing obligation to supplement the initial disclosure. Documents will beproduced that turn out to be irrelevant to the litigation, because of the early inception of the duty to disclose and thesevere penalties on a party who fails to disgorge in a manner
consistent with the duty. See Proposed Rule 37(c) (prohibit1 I do not disagree with the proposal to make law firms liable for an
attorney's misconduct under the Rule, see Proposed Rule 11(c), or with
the proposal that Rule 11 sanctions be applied when claims in pleadings
that at one time were not in violation of the Rule are pursued after it is
evident that they lack support, see Proposed Rule 11(b); Advisory Committee Notes to Proposed Rule 11, p. 51.

It is curious that the proposed Rule regarding sanctions for discovery
abuses requires sanctions, and specifically recommends financial sanctions
and compensation to the moving party. See Proposed Rules 37(a)(4)(A),
(c)(1). No explanation for the inconsistency is given.

ing, in some circumstances, use of witnesses or informationnot voluntarily disclosed pursuant to the disclosure duty,

and authorizing divulgement to the jury of the failure todisclose).

The proposed new regime does not fit comfortably withinthe American judicial system, which relies on adversarial litigation to develop the facts before a neutral decisionmaker.By placing upon lawyers the obligation to disclose information damaging to their clients--on their own initiative, and
in a context where the lines between what must be disclosedand what need not be disclosed are not clear but require the

exercise of considerable judgment--the new Rule wouldplace intolerable strain upon lawyers' ethical duty to represent their clients and not to assist the opposing side. Re-quiring a lawyer to make a judgment as to what information
is "relevant to disputed facts" plainly requires him to usehis professional skills in the service of the adversary. See
Advisory Committee Notes to Proposed Rule 26, p. 96.

It seems to me most imprudent to embrace such a radicalalteration that has not, as the advisory committee notes, see

id., at 94, been subjected to any significant testing on a locallevel. Two early proponents of the duty-to-disclose regime
(both of whom had substantial roles in the development ofthe proposed Rule--one as Director of the Federal Judicial
Center and one as a member of the advisory committee) at
one time noted the need for such study prior to adoption ofa national rule. Schwarzer, The Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and Discovery Reform, 50 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 703,723 (1989); Brazil, The Adversary Character of Civil Discovery: A Critique and Proposals for Change, 31 Vand. L.Rev. 1295, 1361 (1978). More importantly, Congress itself
reached the same conclusion that local experiments to reducediscovery costs and abuse are essential

before major revision,
and in the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-650,

$$ 104, 105, 104 Stat. 5097-5098, mandated an extensive
pilot program for district courts. See also 28 U. S. C.

$$ 471, 473(a)(2)(C). Under that legislation, short-term experiments relating to discovery and case management are to

last at least three years, and the Judicial Conference is toreport the results of these experiments to Congress, along

with recommendations, by the end of 1995. Pub. L. 101-650,$ 105, 104 Stat. 5097-5098. Apparently, the advisory committee considered this timetable schedule too prolonged, seeAdvisory Committee Notes to Proposed Rule 26, p. 95, preferring instead to subject the entire federal judicial systemat once to an extreme, costly, and essentially untested revision of a major component of civil litigation. That seems to
me unwise. Any major reform of the discovery rules shouldawait completion of the pilot programs authorized by Congress, especially since courts already have substantial discre-tion to control discovery.

2 See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26.

I am also concerned that this revision has been recom-mended in the face of nearly universal criticism from every

conceivable sector of our judicial system, including judges,practitioners, litigants, academics, public interest groups,
and national, state and local bar, and professional associations. See generally Bell, Varner, & Gottschalk, Automatic
Disclosure in Discovery--The Rush to Reform, 27 Ga. L.
Rev. 1, 28-32, and nn. 107-121 (1992). Indeed, after the proposed Rule in essentially its present form was published to
comply with the notice-and-comment requirement of 28
U. S. C. $ 2071(b), public criticism was so severe that the
advisory committee announced abandonment of its duty-todisclose regime (in favor of limited pilot experiments), but
then, without further public comment or explanation, decided six weeks later to recommend the rule. 27 Ga. L. Rev.,

Constant reform of the federal rules to correct emerging
problems is essential. Justice White observes that Justice Douglas, who in earlier years on the Court had been
wont to note his disagreements with proposed changes, gen2 For the same reason, the proposed presumptive limits on depositions
and interrogatories, see Proposed Rules 30, 31, and 33, should not be
implemented.

erally abstained from doing so later on, acknowledging thathis expertise had grown stale. Ante, at 1095-1096, and n. 3.

Never having specialized in trial practice, I began at thelevel of expertise (and of acquiescence in others' proposals)
with which Justice Douglas ended. Both categories of revi-sion on which I remark today, however, seem to me not matters of expert detail, but rise to the level of principle andpurpose that even Justice Douglas in his later years continued to address. It takes no expert to know that a measurewhich eliminates rather than strengthens a deterrent to frivolous litigation is not what the times demand; and that abreathtakingly novel revision of discovery practice should
not be adopted nationwide without a trial run.In the respects described, I dissent from the Court's order.

within the United States, the court shall impose the costs
subsequently incurred in effecting service on the defendant
unless good cause for the failure be shown.

(3) A defendant that, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver so requested is not required
to serve an answer to the complaint until 60 days after
the date on which the request for waiver of service was
sent, or 90 days after that date if the defendant was
addressed outside any judicial district of the United
States.

(4) When the plaintiff files a waiver of service with

discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party,
including the existence, description, nature, custody,condition, and location of any books, documents, or other

tangible things and the identity and location of personshaving knowledge of any discoverable matter. The in507rulu3cv 11-13-96 17:26:08 PGT * RULES
1122 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

formation sought need not be admissible at the trial ifthe information sought appears reasonably calculated to

lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.(2) Limitations.--By order or by local rule, the court
may alter the limits in these rules on the number ofdepositions and interrogatories and may also limit the
length of depositions under Rule 30 and the number ofrequests under Rule 36. The frequency or extent of use
of the discovery methods otherwise permitted underthese rules and by any local rule shall be limited by the
court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought isunreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable
from some other source that is more convenient, lessburdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in theaction to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs itslikely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case,
the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, theimportance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and

after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion undersubdivision (c).

a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess
the applicability of the privilege or protection.

person from whom discovery is sought, accompanied by a
certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or
attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort

APPENDIX OF FORMS
Form 1A. Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service

of Summons

TO: (A)

A lawsuit has been commenced against you (or the entity on whose
behalf you are addressed). A copy of the complaint is attached to this
notice. It has been filed in the United States District Court for the

(D) and has been assigned docket number
(E) .
This is not a formal summons or notification from the court, but rather
my request that you sign and return the enclosed waiver of service in
order to save the cost of serving you with a judicial summons and an
additional copy of the complaint. The cost of service will be avoided if I
receive a signed copy of the waiver within (F) days after
the date designated below as the date on which this Notice and Request
is sent. I enclose a stamped and addressed envelope (or other means of
cost-free return) for your use. An extra copy of the waiver is also
attached for your records.

If you comply with this request and return the signed waiver, it will be
filed with the court and no summons will be served on you. The action
will then proceed as if you had been served on the date the waiver is filed,
except that you will not be obligated to answer the complaint before 60
days from the date designated below as the date on which this notice is
sent (or before 90 days from that date if your address is not in any judicial
district of the United States).

If you do not return the signed waiver within the time indicated, I will
take appropriate steps to effect formal service in a manner authorized by
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and will then, to the extent authorized by those Rules, ask the court to require you (or the party on whose
behalf you are addressed) to pay the full costs of such service. In that
connection, please read the statement concerning the duty of parties to
waive the service of the summons, which is set forth on the reverse side
(or at the foot) of the waiver form.

I affirm that this request is being sent to you on behalf of the plaintiff,

Duty to Avoid Unnecessary Costs of Service of Summons

Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain parties
to cooperate in saving unnecessary costs of service of the summons and
complaint. A defendant located in the United States who, after being

507rulu3cv 11-13-96 17:26:08 PGT * RULES
1156 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
notified of an action and asked by a plaintiff located in the United States
to waive service of a summons, fails to do so will be required to bear the
cost of such service unless good cause be shown for its failure to sign and
return the waiver.

It is not good cause for a failure to waive service that a party believes
that the complaint is unfounded, or that the action has been brought in an
improper place or in a court that lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter
of the action or over its person or property. A party who waives service
of the summons retains all defenses and objections (except any relating to
the summons or to the service of the summons), and may later object to
the jurisdiction of the court or to the place where the action has been
brought.

A defendant who waives service must within the time specified on the
waiver form serve on the plaintiff's attorney (or unrepresented plaintiff)
a response to the complaint and must also file a signed copy of the response with the court. If the answer or motion is not served within this
time, a default judgment may be taken against that defendant. By waiving service, a defendant is allowed more time to answer than if the summons had been actually served when the request for waiver of service
was received.

Form 2. Allegation of Jurisdiction
(a) Jurisdiction founded on diversity of citizenship and amount.
Plaintiff is a [citizen of the State of Connecticut]1 [corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut having its principal place
of business in the State of Connecticut] and defendant is a corporation
incorporated under the laws of the State of New York having its principal
place of business in a State other than the State of Connecticut. The
matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum of
fifty thousand dollars.

(b) Jurisdiction founded on the existence of a Federal question.
The action arises under [the Constitution of the United States, Article , Section ]; [the Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States, Section ]; [the Act of , Stat. ;
U. S. C., Title , $ ]; [the Treaty of the United States (here describe the treaty)]2 as hereinafter more fully appears.. . . . .

Form 18-A. [Abrogated]
Form 33. Notice of Availability of a Magistrate Judge to

Exercise Jurisdiction and Appeal Option

In accordance with the provisions of Title 28, U. S. C. $ 636(c), you are
hereby notified that a United States magistrate judge of this district court

507rulu3cv 11-13-96 17:26:08 PGT * RULES

1157RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
is available to exercise the court's jurisdiction and to conduct any or all
proceedings in this case including a jury or nonjury trial, and entry of a
final judgment. Exercise of this jurisdiction by a magistrate judge is,
however, permitted only if all parties voluntarily consent.

You may, without adverse substantive consequences, withhold your consent, but this will prevent the court's jurisdiction from being exercised by
a magistrate judge. If any party withholds consent, the identity of the
parties consenting or withholding consent will not be communicated to any
magistrate judge or to the district judge to whom the case has been
assigned.

An appeal from a judgment entered by a magistrate judge may be taken
directly to the United States court of appeals for this judicial circuit in
the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court.
Alternatively, upon consent of all parties, an appeal from a judgment entered by a magistrate judge may be taken directly to a district judge.
Cases in which an appeal is taken to a district judge may be reviewed by
the United States court of appeals for this judicial circuit only by way of
petition for leave to appeal.

Copies of the Form for the "Consent to Jurisdiction by a United States
Magistrate Judge" and "Election of Appeal to a District Judge" are available from the clerk of the court.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICEIN CHAMBERS
TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC., et al. v.FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

et al.
on application for injunction

No. A-798. Decided April 29, 1993
The application of cable operators and programmers for an injunction barring enforcement of $$ 4 and 5 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992--which require cable operators to
reserve a portion of their channel capacity for local commercial and noncommercial educational broadcast stations--is denied. Acts of Congress are presumptively constitutional and should remain in effect pending a final decision on the merits by this Court. Moreover, this Act
was upheld by a three-judge District Court, which rejected applicants'
argument that compelling them to carry signals of video programmers
they would otherwise choose not to carry violates the First Amendment.
Equally important, applicants are seeking an injunction rather than a
stay of a lower court's order. The power to issue such extraordinary
relief is to be used sparingly, only when necessary or appropriate in aid
of this Court's jurisdiction and the legal rights at issue are indisputably
clear. Implementation of $$ 4 and 5 would not prevent this Court's
exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to decide the merits of applicants'
appeal. Nor is it indisputably clear that applicants have a First
Amendment right to be free of the must-carry provisions. This Court
has not decided whether the activities of cable operators are more akin
to that of newspapers--on whom must-carry provisions cannot be imposed--or wireless broadcasters--on whom regulation has been constitutionally imposed in the past.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.
Applicants have asked me, as Circuit Justice for the Dis-trict of Columbia Circuit, to enjoin enforcement of $$ 4 and 5

of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competi-tion Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1471-1481, which

1302 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion in Chambers
require cable operators to reserve a portion of their channelcapacity for carrying local commercial and noncommercial

educational broadcast stations. Applicants, cable operatorsand programmers, contend that these "must-carry" provisions violate the First Amendment because (1) they tell cable
operators what speakers they must carry, thereby control-ling the content of the operator's speech and shrinking the

number of channels available for programming they mightprefer to carry; (2) they inhibit the operators' editorial discretion to determine what programming messages to provideto subscribers; and (3) they give local broadcast "speakers"
a preferred status. I herewith deny the application.

The 1992 Cable Act, like all Acts of Congress, is presumptively constitutional. As such, it "should remain in effect
pending a final decision on the merits by this Court." Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 429 U. S. 1347, 1348 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers). Moreover, the Act was upheld by
the three-judge District Court, and even the dissenting
judge rejected the argument now urged by applicants--that
Congress may not compel cable operators to carry the video
signals of programmers they would otherwise choose not to
carry. 819 F. Supp. 32, 61 (D. C. 1993). Unlike applicants,
therefore, all three judges below would recognize that the
Government may regulate cable television as a medium of
communication. Ibid.

Equally important is the fact that applicants are not
merely seeking a stay of a lower court's order, but an injunction against the enforcement of a presumptively valid Act of
Congress. Unlike a stay, which temporarily suspends "judicial alteration of the status quo," an injunction "grants judicial intervention that has been withheld by the lower
courts." Ohio Citizens For Responsible Energy, Inc. v.
NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers).
By seeking an injunction, applicants request that I issue an
order altering the legal status quo. Not surprisingly, they
do not cite any case in which such extraordinary relief has

Opinion in Chambers
been granted, either by a single Justice or by the wholeCourt.

The All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a), is the only sourceof this Court's authority to issue an injunction. We have
consistently stated, and our own Rules so require, that such
power is to be used sparingly. See, e. g., Ohio Citizens For
Responsible Energy, supra, at 1313; this Court's Rule 20.1
("The issuance by the Court of an extraordinary writ author-ized by 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a) is not a matter of right, but of

discretion sparingly exercised"). "[J]udicial power to stayan act of Congress, like judicial power to hold that act unconstitutional, is an awesome responsibility calling for the utmost circumspection in its exercise. This factor is all the
more important where, as here, a single member of the Court
is asked to delay the will of Congress to put its policies into
effect at the time it desires." Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.
v. United States, 85 S. Ct. 1, 2, 13 L. Ed. 2d 12, 14 (1964)
(Black, J., in chambers).

An injunction is appropriate only if (1) it is "necessary or
appropriate in aid of [our] jurisdictio[n]," 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a),
and (2) the legal rights at issue are "indisputably clear,"
Communist Party of Indiana v. Whitcomb, 409 U. S. 1235
(1972) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers); Ohio Citizens For Responsible Energy, supra, at 1313. Without doubt, implementation of $$ 4 and 5 would not prevent this Court's exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to decide the merits of
applicants' appeal. Nor is it "indisputably clear" that applicants have a First Amendment right to be free of the mustcarry provisions. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974), we struck down Florida's right of
reply statute, holding that the State may not compel "editors
or publishers to publish that which reason tells them should
not be published." Id., at 256 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Under Tornillo, Congress plainly could not impose the must-carry provisions on privately owned newspapers. In Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367

507us3IC2Z 12-20-95 21:19:22 PAGES IC1301PGT
1304 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion in Chambers
(1969), however, we upheld the Federal CommunicationsCommission's requirement that broadcasters cover public issues, and give each side of the issue fair coverage. Notingthat there is a finite number of frequencies available, we
stated that "[i]t is the purpose of the First Amendment topreserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth
will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopoli-zation of that market, whether it be by the Government itself
or a private licensee." Id., at 390. Although we have rec-ognized that cable operators engage in speech protected by
the First Amendment, Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439,444 (1991);

Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc.,476 U. S. 488, 494 (1986), we have not decided whether the

activities of cable operators are more akin to that of news-papers or wireless broadcasters.

Id., at 494-495.In light of these two lines of authority, it simply is not

indisputably clear that applicants have a First Amendmentright to be free from Government regulation. The application for an injunction pending appeal to this Court is there-fore denied.
