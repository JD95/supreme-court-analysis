DEATH OF JUSTICE WHITE
Supreme Court of the United States

TUESDAY, APRIL 16, 2002

Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens,
Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,
Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and
Justice Breyer.

The Chief Justice said:
As we open this morning, I want to pay tribute to our
friend and colleague Byron R. White, a retired Justice of this
Court, who died yesterday morning in Colorado.

Byron White was nominated to the Court by President
Kennedy on April 3, 1962, and was confirmed by the Senate
eight days later. He took the oath of office forty years ago
today, on April 16, 1962. He was the 93rd Justice to serve
on this Court.

Justice White was born and raised in Colorado. He was a
rare combination of brilliant scholar and gifted athlete. He
attended the University of Colorado, earning ten varsity letters, winning a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford. Before attending Oxford, he played professional football for the old
Pittsburgh Pirates. When he returned from Oxford, he attended Yale Law School while playing football for the Detroit Lions on the weekends. He served as an intelligence
officer for the Navy during World War II.

Justice White was graduated from Yale Law School, earning the Cullen Prize for high academic grades. He clerked
for Chief Justice Vinson and then returned home to Colorado
where he practiced law for fourteen years, before joining the

Justice Department as deputy attorney general under Rob-ert Kennedy. Less than a year later, President Kennedy

named him to the Court.Justice White was an able colleague and a good friend.
He came as close as any to meriting Matthew Arnold'sdescription of Sophocles: he "saw life steadily and he saw
it whole." All of us who served with him feel a sense ofpersonal loss. Our condolences go out to his wife, Marion,
his two children, and their families.At an appropriate time in the fall, the traditional memorial
observance of the Court and the Bar will be held in thisCourtroom.

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2001

NEW YORK et al. v. FEDERAL ENERGY

REGULATORY COMMISSION et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 00-568. Argued October 3, 2001--Decided March 4, 2002*
When the Federal Power Act (FPA) became law in 1935, most electric

utilities operated as separate, local monopolies subject to state or local
regulation; their sales were "bundled," meaning that consumers paid a
single charge for both the cost of the electricity and the cost of its delivery; and there was little competition among utility companies. Section
201(b) of the FPA gave the Federal Power Commission (predecessor to
respondent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)) jurisdiction over "the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce
and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce"; $ 205
prohibited, among other things, unreasonable rates and undue discrimination "with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the [Commission's] jurisdiction"; and $ 206 gave the Commission the power to correct
such unlawful practices. Since 1935, the number of electricity suppliers
has increased dramatically and technological advances have allowed
electricity to be delivered over three major "grids" in the continental
United States. In all but three States, any electricity entering a grid
becomes part of a vast pool of energy moving in interstate commerce.
As a result, power companies can transmit electricity over long dis*Together with No. 00-809, Enron Power Marketing, Inc. v. Federal

tances at a low cost. However, public utilities retain ownership of the
transmission lines that their competitors must use to deliver electricity
to wholesale and retail customers and thus can refuse to deliver their
competitors' energy or deliver that power on terms and conditions less
favorable than those they apply to their own transmissions. In Order
No. 888, FERC found such practices discriminatory under $ 205. Invoking its $ 206 authority, FERC (1) ordered "functional unbundling" of
wholesale generation and transmission services, which means that each
utility must state separate rates for its wholesale generation, transmission, and ancillary services, and must take transmission of its own
wholesale sales and purchases under a single general tariff applicable
equally to itself and others; (2) imposed a similar open access requirement on unbundled retail transmissions in interstate commerce; and
(3) declined to extend the open access requirement to the transmission
component of bundled retail sales, concluding that unbundling such
transmissions was unnecessary and would raise difficult jurisdictional
issues that could be more appropriately considered in other proceedings.
After consolidating a number of review petitions, the District of Columbia Circuit upheld most of Order No. 888. Here, the petition of New
York et al. (collectively New York) questions FERC's assertion of jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmissions, and the petition of Enron
Power Marketing, Inc. (Enron), questions FERC's refusal to assert jurisdiction over bundled retail transmissions.

Held:

1. FERC did not exceed its jurisdiction by including unbundled retail
transmissions within the scope of Order No. 888's open access requirements. New York insists that retail transactions are subject only to
state regulation, but the electric industry has changed since the FPA
was enacted, at which time the electricity universe was neatly divided
into spheres of retail versus wholesale sales. The FPA's plain language
readily supports FERC's jurisdiction claim. Section 201(b) gives
FERC jurisdiction over "electric energy in interstate commerce," and
the unbundled transmissions that FERC has targeted are made such
transmissions by the national grid's nature. No statutory language limits FERC's transmission jurisdiction to the wholesale market, although
the statute does limit FERC's sales jurisdiction to that market. In the
face of this clear statutory language, New York's arguments supporting
its contention that the statute draws a bright jurisdictional line between
wholesale and retail transactions are unpersuasive. Its argument that
the Court of Appeals applied an erroneous standard of review because
it ignored the presumption against federal pre-emption of state law focuses on the wrong legal question. The type of pre-emption at issue

3Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Syllabus
here concerns the rule that a federal agency may pre-empt state law
only when it is acting within the scope of congressionally delegated authority. Because the FPA unambiguously gives FERC jurisdiction
over the "transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce," without regard to whether the transmissions are sold to a reseller or directly
to a consumer, FERC's exercise of this power is valid. New York's
attempts to discredit this straightforward statutory analysis by reference to the FPA's legislative history are unavailing. And its arguments
that FERC jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmissions will impede
sound energy policy are properly addressed to FERC or to the Congress. Pp. 16-24.

2. FERC's decision not to regulate bundled retail transmissions was
a statutorily permissible policy choice. Contrary to Enron's argument,
FERC chose not to assert jurisdiction over such transmissions, but it
did not hold itself powerless to claim jurisdiction. Indeed, FERC explicitly reserved decision on that jurisdictional issue, and the reasons
FERC supplied for doing so provide valid support for that decision.
Having determined that the remedy it ordered constituted a sufficient
response to the problems it had identified in the wholesale market,
FERC had no $ 206 obligation to regulate bundled retail transmissions
or to order universal unbundling. This Court also agrees with FERC's
conclusion that regulating bundled retail transmissions raises difficult
jurisdictional issues. Pp. 25-28.

These cases raise two important questions concerning the

sions? Second, must FERC impose that requirement onutilities that continue to offer only "bundled" retail sales?

In Order No. 888, issued in 1996 with the stated purposeof "Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access
Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utili-ties,"

1 FERC answered yes to the first question and no to

the second. It based its answers on provisions of the Fed-eral Power Act (FPA), as added by $ 213, 49 Stat. 847, and

as amended, 16 U. S. C. $ 824 et seq., enacted in 1935.Whether or not the 1935 Congress foresaw the dramatic
changes in the power industry that have occurred in recentdecades, we are persuaded, as was the Court of Appeals, that
FERC properly construed its statutory authority.

I
In 1935, when the FPA became law, most electricity wassold by vertically integrated utilities that had constructed

their own power plants, transmission lines, and local deliv-ery systems. Although there were some interconnections
among utilities, most operated as separate, local monopoliessubject to state or local regulation. Their sales were "bundled," meaning that consumers paid a single charge that in-cluded both the cost of the electric energy and the cost of its
delivery. Competition among utilities was not prevalent.Prior to 1935, the States possessed broad authority to regulate public utilities, but this power was limited by our casesholding that the negative impact of the Commerce Clause
prohibits state regulation that directly burdens interstatecommerce.

2 When confronted with an attempt by Rhode Is1 FERC Stats. & Regs., Regs. Preambles, Jan. 1991-June 1996, || 31,036,
p. 31,632, 61 Fed. Reg. 21540 (1996). Order No. 888 also deals with the
recovery of "stranded costs" by utilities, but this aspect of the order is
not before us.

2 For example, in cases involving the interstate transmission of natural

gas, we held that a State could regulate direct sales to consumers even
when the gas was drawn from interstate mains, Pennsylvania Gas Co. v.

land to regulate the rates charged by a Rhode Island plant
selling electricity to a Massachusetts company, which resold
the electricity to the city of Attleboro, Massachusetts, we
invalidated the regulation because it imposed a "direct burden upon interstate commerce." Public Util. Comm'n of
R. I. v. Attleboro Steam & Elec. Co., 273 U. S. 83, 89 (1927).
Creating what has become known as the "Attleboro gap,"
we held that this interstate transaction was not subject to
regulation by either Rhode Island or Massachusetts, but only
"by the exercise of the power vested in Congress." Id.,
at 90.

When it enacted the FPA in 1935,3 Congress authorized
federal regulation of electricity in areas beyond the reach of
state power, such as the gap identified in Attleboro, but it
also extended federal coverage to some areas that previously
had been state regulated, see, e. g., id., at 87-88 (explaining,
prior to the FPA's enactment, that state regulations affecting interstate utility transactions were permissible if they
did not directly burden interstate commerce). The FPA
charged the Federal Power Commission (FPC), the predecessor of FERC, "to provide effective federal regulation of
the expanding business of transmitting and selling electric
power in interstate commerce." Gulf States Util. Co. v.
FPC, 411 U. S. 747, 758 (1973). Specifically, in $ 201(b) of the
FPA, Congress recognized the FPC's jurisdiction as including "the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce" and "the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interKan. v. Landon, 249 U. S. 236 (1919), but that a State could not regulate
the rate at which gas from out-of-state producers was sold to independent
distributing companies for resale to local consumers, Missouri ex rel. Barrett v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 265 U. S. 298, 309 (1924).

3 The FPA was enacted as Title II of the Public Utility Act of 1935, 49

Stat. 847. Title I of the Public Utility Act--not at issue here--regulated
financial practices of interstate holding companies that controlled a large
number of public utilities.

state commerce." 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b). Furthermore, $ 205of the FPA prohibited, among other things, unreasonable

rates and undue discrimination "with respect to any trans-mission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission," 16 U. S. C. $$ 824d(a)-(b), and $ 206 gave the FPCthe power to correct such unlawful practices, 16 U. S. C.

$ 824e(a).Since 1935, and especially beginning in the 1970's and
1980's, the number of electricity suppliers has increased dra-matically. Technological advances have made it possible to
generate electricity efficiently in different ways and insmaller plants.

4 In addition, unlike the local power networks of the past, electricity is now delivered over threemajor networks, or "grids," in the continental United States.

Two of these grids--the "Eastern Interconnect" and the"Western Interconnect"--are connected to each other. It is
only in Hawaii and Alaska and on the "Texas Interconnect"--which covers most of that State--that electricity is distributed entirely within a single State. In the rest of the coun-try, any electricity that enters the grid immediately becomes
a part of a vast pool of energy that is constantly moving ininterstate commerce.

5 As a result, it is now possible for

4 In Order No. 888, FERC noted that the optimum size of electric generation plants has shifted from the larger, 500 megawatt plants (with 10-year
lead time) of the past to the smaller, 50-to-150 megawatt plants (with
1-year lead time) of the present. These smaller plants can produce energy at a cost of 3-to-5 cents per kilowatt-hour, as opposed to the older
plants' production cost of 4-to-15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Order No. 888,
at 31,641.

5 See Brief for Respondent FERC 4-5. Over the years, FERC has described the interconnected grids in a number of proceedings. For example, in 1967, the FPC considered whether Florida Power & Light Co.
(FPL)--a utility attached to what was then the regional grid for the southeastern United States--transmitted energy in interstate commerce as a
result of that attachment. The FPC concluded that FPL's transmissions
were in interstate commerce: "[S]ince electric energy can be delivered
virtually instantaneously when needed on a system at a speed of 186,000

power companies to transmit electric energy over long dis-tances at a low cost. As FERC has explained, "the nature

and magnitude of coordination transactions" have enabledutilities to operate more efficiently by transferring substantial amounts of electricity not only from plant to plant in onearea, but also from region to region, as market conditions
fluctuate. Order No. 888, at 31,641.Despite these advances in technology that have increased
the number of electricity providers and have made it possible
for a "customer in Vermont [to] purchase electricity from anenvironmentally friendly power producer in California or a

cogeneration facility in Oklahoma," Transmission Access

2000) (case below), public utilities retain ownership of thetransmission lines that must be used by their competitors

to deliver electric energy to wholesale and retail customers.The utilities' control of transmission facilities gives them the
power either to refuse to deliver energy produced by com-petitors or to deliver competitors' power on terms and condimiles per second, such energy can be and is transmitted to FPL when
needed from out-of-state generators, and in turn can be and is transmitted
from FPL to help meet out-of-state demands; . . . there is a cause and
effect relationship in electric energy occurring throughout every generator and point on the FPL, Corp, Georgia, and Southern systems which
constitutes interstate transmission of electric energy by, to, and from
FPL." In re Florida Power & Light Co., 37 F. P. C. 544, 549 (1967). This
Court found the FPC's findings sufficient to establish the FPC's jurisdiction. FPC v. Florida Power & Light Co., 404 U. S. 453, 469 (1972).

network or grid energizes the entire grid, and consumers then draw undifferentiated energy from that grid." Brief for Electrical Engineers et al.

contentions that electricity functions "the way water flows through a pipe
or blood cells flow through a vein" and "can be controlled, directed and
traced" as these substances can be, calling such metaphors "inaccurate
and highly misleading." Id., at 2, 5.

tions less favorable than those they apply to their own trans-missions. E. g., Order No. 888, at 31,643-31,644.

6

Congress has addressed these evolving conditions in theelectricity market on two primary occasions since 1935.

First, Congress enacted the Public Utility Regulatory Poli-cies Act of 1978 (PURPA), 92 Stat. 3117, 16 U. S. C. $ 2601
et seq., to promote the development of new generating facili-ties and to conserve the use of fossil fuels. Because the traditional utilities controlled the transmission lines and werereluctant to purchase power from "nontraditional facilities,"
PURPA directed FERC to promulgate rules requiring utili-ties to purchase electricity from "qualifying cogeneration
and small power production facilities." FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 751 (1982); see 16 U. S. C. $ 824a-3(a).Over a decade later, Congress enacted the Energy Policy

Act of 1992 (EPAct), 106 Stat. 2776. This law authorizedFERC to order individual utilities to provide transmission
services to unaffiliated wholesale generators (i. e., to "wheel"power) on a case-by-case basis. See 16 U. S. C. $$ 824j-824k.
Exercising its authority under the EPAct, FERC ordered autility to "wheel" power for a complaining wholesale competitor 12 times, in 12 separate proceedings. Order No. 888, at31,646. FERC soon concluded, however, that these individual proceedings were too costly and time consuming to pro-vide an adequate remedy for undue discrimination throughout the market. Ibid.

6 In addition to policing utilities' anticompetitive behavior through the
various statutory provisions that explicitly address the electric industry,
discussed in more detail below, the Government has also used the antitrust
laws to this end. For example, in Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States,
410 U. S. 366 (1973), the Court permitted the Government to seek antitrust
remedies against a utility company which, among other things, refused to
sell power at wholesale to some municipalities and refused to transfer
competitors' power over its lines. Id., at 368. The Court concluded that
the FPA's existence did not preclude the applicability of the antitrust laws.
Id., at 372.

10 NEW YORK v. FERC

Opinion of the Court
Thus, in 1995, FERC initiated the rulemaking proceeding that led to the adoption of the order presently under
review. FERC proposed a rule that would "require that
public utilities owning and/or controlling facilities used for
the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce
have on file tariffs providing for nondiscriminatory openaccess transmission services." Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FERC Stats. & Regs., Proposed Regs., 1988-1999,
|| 32,514, p. 33,047, 60 Fed. Reg. 17662 (hereinafter NPRM).
The stated purpose of the proposed rule was "to encourage
lower electricity rates by structuring an orderly transition
to competitive bulk power markets." NPRM 33,048. The
NPRM stated:

"The key to competitive bulk power markets is opening
up transmission services. Transmission is the vital link
between sellers and buyers. To achieve the benefits of
robust, competitive bulk power markets, all wholesale
buyers and sellers must have equal access to the transmission grid. Otherwise, efficient trades cannot take
place and ratepayers will bear unnecessary costs.
Thus, market power through control of transmission is
the single greatest impediment to competition. Unquestionably, this market power is still being used today,
or can be used, discriminatorily to block competition." 7
Id., at 33,049.

7 Later in the NPRM, FERC explained that $ 206 of the FPA authorizes
FERC to remedy unduly discriminatory practices, and found: "that utilities owning or controlling transmission facilities possess substantial market power; that, as profit maximizing firms, they have and will continue
to exercise that market power in order to maintain and increase market
share, and will thus deny their wholesale customers access to competitively priced electric generation; and that these unduly discriminatory
practices will deny consumers the substantial benefits of lower electricity
prices." NPRM 33,052.

11Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Rather than grounding its legal authority in Congress'
more recent electricity legislation, FERC cited $$ 205-206
of the 1935 FPA--the provisions concerning FERC's power

to remedy unduly discriminatory practices--as providing
the authority for its rulemaking. See 16 U. S. C. $$ 824d-

824e.

In 1996, after receiving comments on the NPRM, FERC
issued Order No. 888. It found that electric utilities were
discriminating in the "bulk power markets," in violation of

$ 205 of the FPA, by providing either inferior access to their
transmission networks or no access at all to third-party
wholesalers of power. Order No. 888, at 31,682-31,684. Invoking its authority under $ 206, it prescribed a remedy containing three parts that are presently relevant.

First, FERC ordered "functional unbundling" of wholesale generation and transmission services. Id., at 31,654.
FERC defined "functional unbundling" as requiring each
utility to state separate rates for its wholesale generation,
transmission, and ancillary services, and to take transmission
of its own wholesale sales and purchases under a single general tariff applicable equally to itself and to others.

Second, FERC imposed a similar open access requirement
on unbundled retail transmissions in interstate commerce.
Although the NPRM had not envisioned applying the open
access requirements to retail transmissions, but rather
"would have limited eligibility to wholesale transmission customers," FERC ultimately concluded that it was "irrelevant
to the Commission's jurisdiction whether the customer receiving the unbundled transmission service in interstate
commerce is a wholesale or retail customer." Id., at 31,689.
Thus, "if a public utility voluntarily offers unbundled retail
access," or if a State requires unbundled retail access, "the
affected retail customer must obtain its unbundled transmis535US1 Unit: $U27 [09-18-03 13:04:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sion service under a non-discriminatory transmission tariffon file with the Commission." Ibid.

8

Third, FERC rejected a proposal that the open accessrequirement should apply to "the transmission component

of bundled retail sales." Id., at 31,699. Although FERCnoted that "the unbundling of retail transmission and
generation . . . would be helpful in achieving comparabil-ity," it concluded that such unbundling was not "necessary"
and would raise "difficult jurisdictional issues" that couldbe "more appropriately considered" in other proceedings.
Ibid.In its analysis of the jurisdictional issues, FERC distinguished between transmissions and sales. It explained:

"[Our statutory jurisdiction] over sales of electric en-ergy extends only to wholesale sales. However, when

a retail transaction is broken into two products that aresold separately (perhaps by two different suppliers: an
electric energy supplier and a transmission supplier), webelieve the jurisdictional lines change. In this situation, the state clearly retains jurisdiction over the saleof power. However, the unbundled transmission service involves only the provision of `transmission in inter-state commerce' which, under the FPA, is exclusively
within the jurisdiction of the Commission. Therefore,when a bundled retail sale is unbundled and becomes
separate transmission and power sales transactions, theresulting transmission transaction falls within the Federal sphere of regulation." Id., at 31,781.9
8 While it concluded that "the rates, terms, and conditions of all unbundled transmission service" were subject to its jurisdiction, FERC stated
that it would "give deference to state recommendations" regarding the
regulation of retail transmissions "when state recommendations are consistent with our open access policies." Order No. 888, at 31,689.

9 FERC also explained that it did not assert "jurisdiction to order retail

transmission directly to an ultimate consumer," id., at 31,781, and that
States had "authority over the service of delivering electric energy to

Opinion of the Court
In 1997, in response to numerous petitions for rehearingand clarification, FERC issued Order No. 888-A, FERC

Stats. & Regs., Regs. Preambles, July 1996-Dec. 2001,|| 31,048, p. 30,172, 62 Fed. Reg. 12274. With respect to various challenges to its jurisdiction, FERC acknowledged thatit did not have the "authority to order,

sua sponte, openaccess transmission services by public utilities," but explained that $ 206 of the FPA explicitly required it to rem-edy the undue discrimination that it had found. Order

No. 888-A, at 30,202; see 16 U. S. C. $ 824e(a). FERC alsorejected the argument that its failure to assert jurisdiction
over bundled retail transmissions was inconsistent with itsassertion of jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmissions.
FERC repeated its explanation that it did not believe thatregulation of bundled retail transmissions (

i. e., the "functional unbundling" of retail transmissions) "was necessary,"and again stated that such unbundling would raise serious jurisdictional questions. Order No. 888-A, at 30,225.
FERC did not, however, state that it had no power to reguend users. . . . State regulation of most power production and virtually
all distribution and consumption of electric energy is clearly distinguishable from this Commission's responsibility to ensure open and nondiscriminatory interstate transmission service. Nothing adopted by the
Commission today, including its interpretation of its authority over retail
transmission or how the separate distribution and transmission functions and assets are discerned when retail service is unbundled, is inconsistent with traditional state regulatory authority in this area." Id., at
31,782-31,783.

With respect to distinguishing "Commission-jurisdictional facilities used
for transmission in interstate commerce" from "state-jurisdictional local
distribution facilities," id., at 31,783, FERC identified seven relevant factors, id., at 31,771, 31,783-31,784. Recognizing the state interest in maintaining control of local distribution facilities, FERC further explained
that, "in instances of unbundled retail wheeling that occurs as a result of
a state retail access program, we will defer to recommendations by state
regulatory authorities concerning where to draw the jurisdictional line
under the Commission's technical test for local distribution facilities . . . ."

have jurisdiction over the retail sale of power, and statedthat, as a result, "[o]ur assertion of jurisdiction . . . arises
only if the [unbundled] retail transmission in interstate com-merce by a public utility occurs voluntarily or as a result of
a state retail program." Id., at 30,226.

II
A number of petitions for review of Order No. 888 wereconsolidated for hearing in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. After considering a host of objections,the Court of Appeals upheld most provisions of the order.
Specifically, it affirmed FERC's jurisdictional rulings thatare at issue in the present cases. 225 F. 3d, at 681.

The Court of Appeals first explained that the open accessrequirements in the orders--for both retail and wholesale
transmissions--were "premised not on individualized find-ings of discrimination by specific transmission providers, but
on FERC's identification of a fundamental systemic problemin the industry." Id., at 683. It held that FERC's factual
determinations were reasonable and that $$ 205 and 206 ofthe FPA gave the Commission authority to prescribe a marketwide remedy for a marketwide problem. InterpretingCircuit precedent--primarily cases involving the transmission of natural gas, e. g., Associated Gas Distributors v.
FERC, 824 F. 2d 981 (CADC 1987)--the Court of Appealsconcluded that even though FERC's general authority to

order open access was "limited," the statute made an excep-tion "where FERC finds undue discrimination." 225 F. 3d,
at 687-688.In its discussion of "Federal Versus State Jurisdiction over
Transmission Services," id., at 690-696, the Court of Appealsalso endorsed FERC's reasoning. The Court of Appeals
first addressed the complaints of the state regulatory com-missions that Order No. 888 "went too far" by going beyond

Opinion of the Court
the regulation of wholesale transactions and "assert[ing] ju-risdiction over all unbundled retail transmissions." Id., at

691, 692. The Court of Appeals concluded that the plain lan-guage of $ 201 of the FPA, which this Court has construed
broadly,10 supported FERC's regulation of transmissions ininterstate commerce that were part of unbundled retail
sales, as $ 201 gives FERC jurisdiction over the "transmis-sion of electric energy in interstate commerce." 16 U. S. C.

$ 824(b)(1). Even if the FPA were ambiguous, the Court ofAppeals explained that, given the technological complexities
of the national grids, it would have deferred to the Commis-sion's interpretation of $ 201 "as giving it jurisdiction over
both wholesale and retail transmissions." 225 F. 3d, at 694.The Court of Appeals next addressed the complaints of
transmission-dependent producers and wholesalers thatOrder No. 888 did not "go far enough."

Id., at 692. TheCourt of Appeals was not persuaded that FERC's assertion

of jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmission requiredFERC to assert jurisdiction over bundled retail transmissions or to mandate unbundling of retail transmissions. Id.,at 694. Noting that the FPA "clearly contemplates state jurisdiction over local distribution facilities and retail sales,"the Court of Appeals held:

"A regulator could reasonably construe transmissions
bundled with generation and delivery services and soldto a consumer for a single charge as either transmission

services in interstate commerce or as an integral compo-nent of a retail sale. Yet FERC has jurisdiction over
one, while the states have jurisdiction over the other.FERC's decision to characterize bundled transmissions
as part of retail sales subject to state jurisdiction there-fore represents a statutorily permissible policy choice to
which we must also defer under Chevron [U. S. A. Inc.

Opinion of the Court
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.837, 842-843 (1984)]." Id., at 694-695.

Because of the importance of the proceeding, we grantedboth the petition of the State of New York et al. (collectively
New York) questioning FERC's assertion of jurisdictionover unbundled retail transmissions and the petition of
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (Enron), questioning FERC'srefusal to assert jurisdiction over bundled retail transmissions. 531 U. S. 1189 (2001). We address these two ques-tions separately. At the outset, however, we note that no
petitioner questions the validity of the order insofar as itapplies to wholesale transactions: The parties dispute only
the proper scope of FERC's jurisdiction over retail transmis-sions. Furthermore, we are not confronted with any factual
issues. Finally, we agree with FERC that transmissions onthe interconnected national grids constitute transmissions in
interstate commerce. See, e. g., FPC v. Florida Power &
Light Co., 404 U. S. 453, 466-467 (1972); n. 5, supra.

III
The first question is whether FERC exceeded its jurisdic-tion by including unbundled retail transmissions within the

scope of its open access requirements in Order No. 888.New York argues that FERC overstepped in this regard,
and that such transmissions--because they are part of retailtransactions--are properly the subject of state regulation.
New York insists that the jurisdictional line between theStates and FERC falls between the wholesale and retail
markets.As the Court of Appeals explained, however, the landscape
of the electric industry has changed since the enactment ofthe FPA, when the electricity universe was "neatly divided
into spheres of retail versus wholesale sales." 225 F. 3d,at 691. As the Court of Appeals also explained, the plain
language of the FPA readily supports FERC's claim of juris-diction. Section 201(b) of the FPA states that FERC's

535US1 Unit: $U27 [09-18-03 13:04:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

17Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction includes "the transmission of electric energy
in interstate commerce" and "the sale of electric energy
at wholesale in interstate commerce." 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b).
The unbundled retail transmissions targeted by FERC are
indeed transmissions of "electric energy in interstate commerce," because of the nature of the national grid. There
is no language in the statute limiting FERC's transmission
jurisdiction to the wholesale market, although the statute
does limit FERC's sale jurisdiction to that at wholesale.
See ibid.; cf. FPC v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 406 U. S.
621, 636 (1972) (interpreting similar provisions of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 717(b), to mean that FPC jurisdiction "applies to interstate `transportation' regardless
of whether the gas transported is ultimately sold retail or

wholesale").

In the face of this clear statutory language, New York advances three arguments in support of its submission that the
statute draws a bright jurisdictional line between wholesale
transactions and retail transactions. First, New York contends that the Court of Appeals applied an erroneous standard of review because it ignored the presumption against
federal pre-emption of state law; second, New York claims
that other statutory language and legislative history shows
a congressional intent to safeguard pre-existing state regulation of the delivery of electricity to retail customers; and
third, New York argues that FERC jurisdiction over retail
transmissions would impede sound energy policy. These
arguments are unpersuasive.

The Presumption against Pre-emption

Pre-emption of state law by federal law can raise two quite
different legal questions. The Court has most often stated
a "presumption against pre-emption" when a controversy
concerned not the scope of the Federal Government's authority to displace state action, but rather whether a given state
authority conflicts with, and thus has been displaced by,

535US1 Unit: $U27 [09-18-03 13:04:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN
18 NEW YORK v. FERC

Opinion of the Court
the existence of Federal Government authority. See, e. g.,
Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories,
Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 715 (1985) (citing cases); see also Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996); Cipollone
v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 518 (1992). In sucha situation, the Court " `start[s] with the assumption that

the historic police powers of the States were not to be
superseded . . . unless that was the clear and manifest pur-pose of Congress.' "

Hillsborough County, 471 U. S., at 715
(quoting Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977)).These are not such cases, however, because the question presented does not concern the validity of a conflicting state law
or regulation.

The other context in which "pre-emption" arises concerns
the rule "that a federal agency may pre-empt state law only
when and if it is acting within the scope of its congressionally
delegated authority[,] . . . [for] an agency literally has no
power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until Congress confers
power upon it." Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476
U. S. 355, 374 (1986). This is the sort of case we confront
here--defining the proper scope of the federal power. Such
a case does not involve a "presumption against pre-emption,"
as New York argues, but rather requires us to be certain
that Congress has conferred authority on the agency. As
we have explained, the best way to answer such a question--
i. e., whether federal power may be exercised in an area of
pre-existing state regulation--"is to examine the nature and
scope of the authority granted by Congress to the agency."
Ibid. In other words, we must interpret the statute to determine whether Congress has given FERC the power to
act as it has, and we do so without any presumption one way
or the other.

As noted above, the text of the FPA gives FERC jurisdiction over the "transmission of electric energy in interstate
commerce and . . . the sale of electric energy at wholesale in

Opinion of the Court
interstate commerce." 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b). The references
to "transmission" in commerce and "sale" at wholesale were
made part of $ 201 of the statute when it was enacted in
1935.11 Subsections (c) and (d) of $ 201 explain, respectively,
the meaning of the terms "transmission" and "sale of electric
energy at wholesale." 12 This statutory text thus unambiguously authorizes FERC to assert jurisdiction over two sepa11 This reference is found twice in $ 201 of the FPA. Section 201(a), as
codified in 16 U. S. C. $ 824(a), states in full: "It is declared that the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution
to the public is affected with a public interest, and that Federal regulation
of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this subchapter
and subchapter III of this chapter and of that part of such business which
consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and
the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary
in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to
those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States." (Emphasis added.)

Section 201(b)(1), as codified in 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b)(1), states in full: "The
provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the transmission of electric
energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, but except as provided in paragraph (2) shall
not apply to any other sale of electric energy or deprive a State or State
commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of
hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line. The Commission shall have jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or
sale of electric energy, but shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically
provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter, over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in
local distribution or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy
consumed wholly by the transmitter." (Emphasis added.)

12 Section 201(c) of the FPA, as codified in 16 U. S. C. $ 824(c), explains

that "[f]or the purpose of this subchapter, electric energy shall be held to
be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a State and
consumed at any point outside thereof; but only insofar as such transmission takes place within the United States." Finally, $ 201(d), as codified
in 16 U. S. C. $ 824(d), states that the "term `sale of electric energy at
wholesale' when used in this subchapter, means a sale of electric energy
to any person for resale."

20 NEW YORK v. FERC

Opinion of the Court
rate activities--transmitting and selling. It is true that
FERC's jurisdiction over the sale of power has been specifically confined to the wholesale market. However, FERC's
jurisdiction over electricity transmissions contains no such
limitation. Because the FPA authorizes FERC's jurisdiction over interstate transmissions, without regard to
whether the transmissions are sold to a reseller or directly
to a consumer, FERC's exercise of this power is valid.

Legislative History

Attempting to discredit this straightforward analysis of
the statutory language, New York calls our attention to numerous statements in the legislative history indicating that
the 1935 Congress intended to do no more than close the
"Attleboro gap," by providing for federal regulation of
wholesale, interstate electricity transactions that the Court
had held to be beyond the reach of state authority in Attleboro, 273 U. S., at 89. To support this argument, and to
demonstrate that the 1935 Congress did not intend to supplant any traditionally state-held jurisdiction, New York
points to language added to the FPA in the course of the
legislative process that evidences a clear intent to preserve
state jurisdiction over local facilities. For example, $ 201(a)
provides that federal regulation is "to extend only to those
matters which are not subject to regulation by the States."
16 U. S. C. $ 824(a). And $ 201(b) states that FERC has no
jurisdiction "over facilities used for the generation of electric
energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only for
the transmission of electric energy in intrastate commerce,
or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter." 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b).

It is clear that the enactment of the FPA in 1935 closed
the "Attleboro gap" by authorizing federal regulation of interstate, wholesale sales of electricity--the precise subject
matter beyond the jurisdiction of the States in Attleboro.
And it is true that the above-quoted language from $ 201(a)
concerning the States' reserved powers is consistent with

535US1 Unit: $U27 [09-18-03 13:04:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

21Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
the view that the FPA was no more than a gap-closing stat-ute. It is, however, perfectly clear that the original FPA

did a good deal more than close the gap in state power identi-fied in Attleboro. The FPA authorized federal regulation
not only of wholesale sales that had been beyond the reachof state power, but also the regulation of wholesale sales that
had been previously subject to state regulation. See, e. g.,
Attleboro, 273 U. S., at 85-86 (noting, prior to the enactmentof the FPA, that States could regulate aspects of interstate

wholesale sales, as long as such regulation did not directlyburden interstate commerce). More importantly, as discussed above, the FPA authorized federal regulation of in-terstate transmissions as well as of interstate wholesale
sales, and such transmissions were not of concern in Attle-boro. Thus, even if Attleboro catalyzed the enactment of the
FPA, Attleboro does not define the outer limits of the stat-ute's coverage.

Furthermore, the portion of $ 201(a) cited by New Yorkconcerning the preservation of existing state jurisdiction is
actually consistent with Order No. 888, because unbundledinterstate transmissions of electric energy have never been
"subject to regulation by the States," 16 U. S. C. $ 824(a).Indeed, unbundled transmissions have been a recent development. As FERC explained, at the time that the FPA wasenacted, transmissions were bundled with the energy itself,
and electricity was delivered to both wholesale and retailcustomers as a complete, bundled package. Order No. 888,
at 31,639. Thus, in 1935, there was neither state nor federalregulation of what did not exist.

13

13 FERC recognized this point in reaching its jurisdictional conclusion:
"Rather than claiming `new' jurisdiction, the Commission is applying the
same statutory framework to a business environment in which . . . retail
sales and transmission service are provided in separate transactions. . . .
Because these types of products and transactions were not prevalent in
the past, the jurisdictional issue before us did not arise and . . . the Commission cannot be viewed as `disturbing' the jurisdiction of state regulators prior to and after the Attleboro case." Order No. 888-A, at
30,339-30,340.

22 NEW YORK v. FERC

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, we have described the precise reserved statepowers language in $ 201(a) as a mere " `policy declaration' "

that " `cannot nullify a clear and specific grant of jurisdiction,even if the particular grant seems inconsistent with the
broadly expressed purpose.' " FPC v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 376 U. S. 205, 215 (1964) (quoting Connecticut
Light & Power Co. v. FPC, 324 U. S. 515, 527 (1945)); see also
United States v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 345 U. S. 295,311 (1953). Because the FPA contains such "a clear and

specific grant of jurisdiction" to FERC over interstate trans-missions, as discussed above, the prefatory language cited
by New York does not undermine FERC's jurisdiction.New York is correct to point out that the legislative history is replete with statements describing Congress' intentto preserve state jurisdiction over local facilities. The sentiment expressed in those statements is incorporated in thesecond sentence of $ 201(b) of the FPA, as codified in 16
U. S. C. $ 824(b), which provides:

"The Commission shall have jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy, butshall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this subchapter and subchapter III of this chap-ter, over facilities used for the generation of electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution or only
for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate com-merce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric

energy consumed wholly by the transmitter."
Yet, Order No. 888 does not even arguably affect the States'jurisdiction over three of these subjects: generation facilities,

transmissions in intrastate commerce, or transmissions consumed by the transmitter. Order No. 888 does discuss local
distribution facilities, and New York argues that, as a result,
FERC has improperly invaded the States' authority "over
facilities used in local distribution," 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b).
However, FERC has not attempted to control local distri535US1 Unit: $U27 [09-18-03 13:04:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

23Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
bution facilities through Order No. 888. To the contrary,
FERC has made clear that it does not have jurisdiction over
such facilities, Order No. 888, at 31,969, and has merely set
forth a seven-factor test for identifying these facilities, without purporting to regulate them, id., at 31,770-31,771.

New York also correctly states that the legislative history
demonstrates Congress' interest in retaining state jurisdiction over retail sales. But again, FERC has carefully
avoided assuming such jurisdiction, noting repeatedly that
"the FPA does not give the Commission jurisdiction over
sales of electric energy at retail." Id., at 31,969. Because
federal authority has been asserted only over unbundled
transmissions, New York retains jurisdiction of the ultimate
sale of the energy. And, as discussed below, FERC did not
assert jurisdiction over bundled retail transmissions, leaving
New York with control over even the transmission component of bundled retail sales.

Our evaluation of the extensive legislative history reviewed in New York's brief is affected by the importance of
the changes in the electricity industry that have occurred
since the FPA was enacted in 1935. No party to these cases
has presented evidence that Congress foresaw the industry's
transition from one of local, self-sufficient monopolies to one
of nationwide competition and electricity transmission. Nor
is there evidence that the 1935 Congress foresaw the possibility of unbundling electricity transmissions from sales.
More importantly, there is no evidence that if Congress had
foreseen the developments to which FERC has responded,
Congress would have objected to FERC's interpretation of
the FPA. Whatever persuasive effect legislative history
may have in other contexts, here it is not particularly helpful
because of the interim developments in the electric industry.
Thus, we are left with the statutory text as the clearest guidance. That text unquestionably supports FERC's jurisdiction to order unbundling of wholesale transactions (which

Opinion of the Court
none of the parties before us questions), as well as to regulate the unbundled transmissions of electricity retailers.

Sound Energy Policy

New York argues that FERC jurisdiction over unbundled
retail transmission will impede sound energy policy. Specifically, New York cites the States' interest in overseeing
the maintenance of transmission lines and the siting of new
lines. It is difficult for us to evaluate the force of these arguments because New York has not separately analyzed the
impact of the loss of control over unbundled retail transmissions, as opposed to the loss of control over retail transmissions generally, and FERC has only regulated unbundled
transactions. Moreover, FERC has recognized that the
States retain significant control over local matters even
when retail transmissions are unbundled. See, e. g., Order
No. 888, at 31,782, n. 543 ("Among other things, Congress left
to the States authority to regulate generation and transmission siting"); id., at 31,782, n. 544 ("This Final Rule will not
affect or encroach upon state authority in such traditional
areas as the authority over local service issues, including reliability of local service; administration of integrated resource planning and utility buy-side and demand-side decisions, including DSM [demand-side management]; authority
over utility generation and resource portfolios; and authority
to impose nonbypassable distribution or retail stranded cost
charges"). We do note that the Edison Electric Institute,
which is a party to these cases, and which represents that
its members own approximately 70% of the transmission
facilities in the country, does not endorse New York's objections to Order No. 888. And, regardless of their persuasiveness, the sort of policy arguments forwarded by New York
are properly addressed to the Commission or to the Congress, not to this Court. E. g., Chemehuevi Tribe v. FPC,
420 U. S. 395, 423 (1975).

Opinion of the Court

IV
Objecting to FERC's order from the opposite direction,Enron argues that the FPA gives FERC the power to apply

its open access remedy to bundled retail transmissions ofelectricity, and, given FERC's findings of undue discrimination, that FERC had a duty to do so. In making this argu-ment, Enron persistently claims that FERC held that it had
no jurisdiction to grant the relief that Enron seeks.14 Thatassumption is incorrect: FERC chose not to assert such jurisdiction, but it did not hold itself powerless to claim juris-diction. Indeed, FERC explicitly reserved decision on the
jurisdictional issue that Enron claims FERC decided. SeeOrder No. 888, at 31,699 (explaining that Enron's position
raises "numerous difficult jurisdictional issues that we be-lieve are more appropriately considered when the Commission reviews unbundled retail transmission tariffs that maycome before us in the context of a state retail wheeling program"). Absent Enron's flawed assumption, FERC's rulingis clearly acceptable.

14 See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner in No. 00-809, p. 12 ("FERC . . . held
itself powerless to address the vast majority of the problem"); id., at 14
("FERC determined, however, that it did not have authority to extend its
functional unbundling remedy to transmissions for bundled retail sales");
id., at 18 ("FERC's decision that it did not have jurisdiction to apply [an
open access transmission tariff] to transmissions for bundled retail sales
was contrary to law"); id., at 20 ("[FERC found] no jurisdiction when the
cost of the transmission is bundled with the cost of power at retail").

Surprisingly, FERC seemed to agree with Enron's characterization of
its holding at some places in its own brief. E. g., Brief for Respondent
FERC 44-45 ("The Commission reasonably concluded that Congress has
not authorized federal regulation of the transmission component of bundled retail sales of electric energy" (emphasis added)). Yet, FERC's brief
also stated more accurately that FERC had decided not to assert jurisdiction, rather than concluded that it lacked the power to do so. E. g., id., at
15 ("[FERC] was not asserting jurisdiction to order utilities to unbundle
their retail services . . ."); id., at 49 (citing "the Commission's reasonable
decision not to override the States' historical regulation of transmission
that is bundled with a retail sale of energy").

26 NEW YORK v. FERC

Opinion of the Court
As noted above, in both Order No. 888 and rehearingOrder No. 888-A, FERC gave two reasons for refusing to

extend its open access remedy to bundled retail transmis-sions. First, FERC explained that such relief was not "necessary." Order No. 888, at 31,699; see also Order No. 888-A,at 30,225. Second, FERC noted that the regulation of bundled retail transmissions "raises numerous difficult jurisdictional issues" that did not need to be resolved in the presentcontext. Order No. 888, at 31,699; see also Order No. 888-A,

at 30,225-30,226. Both of these reasons provide valid sup-port for FERC's decision not to regulate bundled retail
transmissions.

First, with respect to FERC's determination that it was
not "necessary" to include bundled retail transmissions in its
remedy, it must be kept in mind exactly what it was that
FERC sought to remedy in the first place: a problem with
the wholesale power market. FERC's findings, as Enron
itself recognizes, concerned electric utilities' use of their
market power to " `deny their wholesale customers access to
competitively priced electric generation,' " thereby " `deny[ing] consumers the substantial benefits of lower electricity
prices.' " Brief for Petitioner in No. 00-809, pp. 12-13 (quoting NPRM 33,052) (emphasis added). The title of Order
No. 888 confirms FERC's focus: "Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services . . . ." Order No. 888, at 31,632 (emphasis
added). Indeed, FERC has, from the outset, identified its
goal as "facilitat[ing] competitive wholesale electric power
markets." NPRM 33,049 (emphasis added).

To remedy the wholesale discrimination it found, FERC
chose to regulate all wholesale transmissions. It also regulated unbundled retail transmissions, as was within its power
to do. See Part III, supra. However, merely because
FERC believed that those steps were appropriate to remedy
discrimination in the wholesale electricity market does not,
as Enron alleges, lead to the conclusion that the regulation

535US1 Unit: $U27 [09-18-03 13:04:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

27Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
of bundled retail transmissions was "necessary" as well.Because FERC determined that the remedy it ordered constituted a sufficient response to the problems FERC hadidentified in the wholesale market, FERC had no $ 206 obligation to regulate bundled retail transmissions or to orderuniversal unbundling.

15

Of course, it may be true that FERC's findings concerning
discrimination in the wholesale electricity market suggestthat such discrimination exists in the retail electricity market as well, as Enron alleges. Were FERC to investigatethis alleged discrimination and make findings concerning
undue discrimination in the retail electricity market, $ 206 ofthe FPA would require FERC to provide a remedy for that
discrimination. See 16 U. S. C. $ 824e(a) (upon a finding ofundue discrimination, "the Commission shall determine the
just and reasonable . . . regulation, practice, or contract . . .and shall fix the same by order"). And such a remedy could
very well involve FERC's decision to regulate bundled retail transmissions--Enron's desired outcome. However, because the scope of the order presently under review did not
concern discrimination in the retail market, Enron is wrong
to argue that $ 206 requires FERC to provide a full array of
retail-market remedies.

Second, we can agree with FERC's conclusion that Enron's
desired remedy "raises numerous difficult jurisdictional issues," Order No. 888, at 31,699, without deciding whether
Enron's ultimate position on those issues is correct. The issues raised by New York concerning FERC's jurisdiction
over unbundled retail transmissions are themselves serious.

15 Indeed, given FERC's acknowledgment "that recovery of legitimate
stranded costs is critical to the successful transition of the electric utility

28 NEW YORK v. FERC

Opinion of Thomas, J.
See Part III, supra. It is obvious that a federal order claim-ing jurisdiction over

all retail transmissions would have even
greater implications for the States' regulation of retailsales--a state regulatory power recognized by the same statutory provision that authorizes FERC's transmission juris-diction. See 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b) (giving FERC jurisdiction
over "transmission of electric energy," but recognizing state
jurisdiction over "any . . . sale of electric energy" other than"sale of electric energy at wholesale"). But even if we assume, for present purposes, that Enron is correct in its claimthat the FPA gives FERC the authority to regulate the
transmission component of a bundled retail sale, we never-theless conclude that the agency had discretion to decline to
assert such jurisdiction in this proceeding in part because of
the complicated nature of the jurisdictional issues. Like the
Court of Appeals, we are satisfied that FERC's choice not
to assert jurisdiction over bundled retail transmissions in a
rulemaking proceeding focusing on the wholesale market
"represents a statutorily permissible policy choice." 225 F.
3d, at 694-695.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

Today the Court finds that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC or Commission) properly construed its
statutory authority when it determined that: (1) it may require a utility that "unbundles" the cost of transmission from
the cost of electric energy to transmit competitors' electricity over its lines on the same terms that the utility applies
to its own energy transmissions; and (2) it need not impose
that requirement on utilities that continue to offer only "bundled" retail sales. Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), 16

Opinion of Thomas, J.
U. S. C. $ 824 et seq., FERC has jurisdiction over all inter-state transmission, regardless of the type of transaction with

which it is associated, and I concur in the Court's holdingwith respect to transmission used for unbundled retail sales
and join Parts II and III of its opinion. I dissent, however,from the Court's resolution of the question concerning transmission used for bundled retail sales because I believe thatthe Court fails to properly assess both the Commission's jurisdictional analysis and its justification for excluding bun-dled retail transmission from the Open Access Transmission
Tariff (OATT). FERC's explanations are inadequate and donot warrant our deference.

I
While the Court does not foreclose the possibility thatFERC's jurisdiction extends to transmission associated with

bundled retail sales, the Court defers to FERC's decision notto apply the OATT to such transmission on the ground that
the Commission made a permissible policy choice, ante, at 28(quoting Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC,
225 F. 3d 667, 694-695 (CADC 2000)), and by reference toFERC's assertions that: (1) such relief was not "necessary,"
ante, at 26 (citing Order No. 888, FERC Stats. & Regs.,Regs. Preambles, Jan. 1991- June 1996, || 31,036, p. 31,699;
Order No. 888-A, FERC Stats. & Regs., Regs. Preambles,July 1996-Dec. 2001, || 31,048, p. 30,225); and (2) "the regulation of bundled retail transmissions `raises numerous difficultjurisdictional issues' that did not need to be resolved in the
present context." Ante, at 26 (citing Order No. 888, at31,699; Order No. 888-A, at 30,225-30,226). The Court concludes that both reasons "provide valid support for FERC'sdecision not to regulate bundled retail transmissions. "
Ante, at 26.1

1 I note that the "reasons" upon which the Court relies were made only
in the specific context of FERC's explanation of its decision not to unbundle retail transmission and distribution. Order No. 888, at 31,698-31,699.
The comments were not given as a general explanation for FERC's

Opinion of Thomas, J.
I disagree. The Court defers to the Court of Appeals'characterization of FERC's decision as a "policy choice,"

rather than to any such characterization made by FERC it-self.

2 But a post-hoc rationalization offered by the Court of

Appeals is an insufficient basis for deference. "[A]n agency'saction must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by

the agency itself." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United
States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463U. S. 29, 50 (1983) (emphasis added).

Therefore, in order to properly assess FERC's decision notto apply the OATT to transmission connected to bundled retail sales, we must carefully evaluate the two justificationsthat the Court points to and relies on. Neither is sufficient.
As I discuss below, FERC failed to explain why regulatingsuch transmission is not "necessary," and FERC's inconclusive jurisdictional analysis does not provide a sound basis forour deference.

A
I cannot support the Court's reliance on FERC's explana-tion that "[a]lthough the unbundling of retail transmission

and generation, as well as wholesale transmission and gener-ation, would be helpful in achieving comparability, we do not
believe it is necessary." Order No. 888, at 31,699. Asidefrom this conclusory statement, FERC provides no explanation as to why such regulation is unnecessary and attachesno findings to support this single statement. As such, we

decision not to apply the OATT to transmission associated with bundled
retail sales, and FERC did not rely on the second explanation in Order
No. 888-A. See infra, at 41.

2 Specifically, the Court of Appeals stated that, in light of the fact that

a regulator could reasonably construe the transmission component of bundled retail sales as either part of a retail sale or a transmission service in
interstate commerce, "FERC's decision to characterize bundled transmissions as part of retail sales subject to state jurisdiction therefore represents a statutorily permissible policy choice to which we must also defer
under Chevron [U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984)]." 225 F. 3d 667, 694-695 (CADC 2000).

have no basis for determining whether FERC's decision isjustified. A brief review of the electric industry, and the

nature of transmission in particular, further calls into ques-tion both FERC's conclusory statement and its logical inference: That regulation of transmission is not necessary whenused in connection with one type of transaction but is necessary when used for another.An electric power system consists of three divisions: generation, transmission, and local distribution. Electricity isgenerated at power plants where "a fuel such as coal, gas,
oil, uranium or hydro power is used to spin a turbine whichturns a generator to generate electricity." Brief for Electrical Engineers et al. as Amici Curiae 12 (hereinafter Brieffor Electrical Engineers). "[G]enerating stations continuously feed electric energy into a web of transmission lines(loosely referred to as `the grid') at very high voltages."
P. Fox-Penner, Electric Utility Restructuring: A Guide tothe Competitive Era 5 (1997) (hereinafter Fox-Penner).
The transmission lines in turn feed "substations (essentiallytransformers) that reduce voltage and spread the power
from each transmission line to many successively smallerdistribution lines, culminating at the retail user." Id., at
23.3Unlike the other electricity components--and with the
exception of transmission in Alaska, Hawaii, and parts ofTexas--transmission is inherently interstate.

place over a network or grid, which consists of a configura3 At the local distribution centers, "the power flow is split to send power
to a number of primary feeder lines that lead to other transformers that
again step down and feed the power to secondary service lines that in

tion of interconnected transmission lines that cross statelines. Brief for Electrical Engineers 13. These lines are

owned and operated by the Nation's larger utilities. No in-dividual utility, however, has " `control over the actual transfers of electric power and energy with any particular electricsystem with which it is interconnected.' "

Id., at 15 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., 37 F. P. C. 544, 549 (1967)).
Electricity flows at extremely high voltages across the net-work in uncontrollable ways and cannot be easily directed

through a particular path from a specific generator to a con-sumer. Fox-Penner 26-27. The "[t]ransfer of electricity
from one point to another will, to some extent, flow over alltransmission lines in the interconnection, not just those in
the direct path of the transfer." Van Nostrand's ScientificEncyclopedia 1096 (D. Considine ed., 8th ed. 1995). The energy flow depends on "where the load (demand for electric-ity) and generation are at any given moment, with the energy always following the path (or paths) of least resistance."
Brief for Electrical Engineers 13. The paths, however,
"change moment by moment." Fox-Penner 27. And "[t]rying to predict the flow of electrons is akin to putting a drop
of ink into a water pipe flowing into a pool, and then trying
to predict how the ink drop will diffuse into the pool, and
which combination of outflow pipes will eventually contain
ink." Ibid.

Nonetheless, buyers and sellers do negotiate particular
contract paths, "route[s] nominally specified in an agreement to have electricity transmitted between two points."
T. Brennan, Shock to the System 76 (1996) (emphasis added).5

5 FERC notes that whether transmission is in interstate commerce
"does not turn on whether the contract path for a particular power or
transmission sale crosses state lines, but rather follows the physical flow
of electricity." Order No. 888, Appendix G, at 31,968. FERC states that
"[b]ecause of the highly integrated nature of the electric system, this results in most transmission of electric energy being `in interstate commerce.' " Ibid.

33Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
In practice, however, it is quite possible that most of the
power will never flow over the negotiated transmission lines.
The transactional arrangements, therefore, bear little resemblance to the physical behavior of electricity transmitted on
a power grid and, as such, it is impossible for either a utility
or FERC to isolate or distinguish between the transmission
used for bundled or unbundled wholesale or retail sales.

Given that it is impossible to identify which utility's lines
are used for any given transmission, FERC's decision to exclude transmission because it is associated with a particular
type of transaction appears to make little sense. And this
decision may conflict with FERC's statutory mandate to regulate when it finds unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential treatment with respect to any transmission subject to its jurisdiction. See 16 U. S. C. $$ 824d,
824e.6 FERC clearly recognizes the statute's mandate, stating in Order No. 888-A that "our authorities under the FPA
not only permit us to adapt to changing economic realities in
the electric industry, but also require us to do so, as necessary to eliminate undue discrimination and protect electric6 Section 824d(b), for example, provides:
"No public utility shall, with respect to any transmission or sale subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commission, (1) make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage, or (2) maintain any unreasonable difference in rates,
charges, service, facilities, or in any other respect, either as between localities or as between classes of service."

Section 824e(a) further provides that whenever FERC, after conducting
a hearing, finds that "any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or
sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affect[ing] such rate, charge, or classification is
unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, . . .
practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix
the same by order." (Emphasis added.)

ity customers." Order No. 888-A, at 30,176.7 And it is certainly possible that utilities that own or control lines on the
grid discriminate against entities that seek to use their
transmission lines regardless of whether the utilities themselves bundle or unbundle their transactions.8 The fact that
FERC found undue discrimination with respect to transmission used in connection with both bundled and unbundled
wholesale sales and unbundled retail sales indicates that
such discrimination exists regardless of whether the transmission is used in bundled or unbundled sales. Without
more, FERC's conclusory statement that "unbundling of retail transmission" is not "necessary" lends little support to
its decision not to regulate such transmission. And it sim7 FERC likewise states in Order No. 888, at 31,634, that the "legal and
policy cornerstone of these rules is to remedy undue discrimination in
access to the monopoly owned transmission wires that control whether
and to whom electricity can be transported in interstate commerce."
FERC also recognized that to comply with the statute's mandate, it "must
eliminate the remaining patchwork of closed and open jurisdictional transmission systems and ensure that all these systems, including those that
already provide some form of open access, cannot use monopoly power
over transmission to unduly discriminate against others." Id., at 31,635.

8 For example, the Electric Power Supply Association explains that

transmission owning utilities may discriminate against entities that seek
to use their transmission systems, thereby preventing the entities from
using their lines, in the following ways: (1) They may block available transfer capacity--the capability of the physical transmission network to facilitate activity over and above its committed uses--by overscheduling transmission for their own retail loads across "valuable" transmission paths;
(2) they may improperly avoid certain costs that other entities would be
subject to; or (3) they may fail to make accurate disclosure of available
transfer capability, causing "serious difficulties for suppliers attempting to
schedule electricity sales across their transmission facilities." Brief for
Respondent Electric Power Supply Association 7-9. Similarly, petitioner
Enron explains that a "utility can reserve superior transmission capacity
for its own bundled retail sales, at times even closing its facilities to other
transmissions . . . forcing competitors of the utility to scramble for less
direct, less predictable and more expensive transmission options." Brief
for Petitioner in No. 00-809, pp. 41-42.

ply cannot be the case that the nature of the commercialtransaction controls the scope of FERC's jurisdiction.

To be sure, I would not prejudge whether FERC mustrequire that transmission used for bundled retail sales be
subject to FERC's open access tariff. At a minimum, how-ever, FERC should have determined whether regulating
transmission used in connection with bundled retail sales
was in fact "necessary to eliminate undue discrimination andprotect electricity customers."

Ibid. FERC's conclusory
statement instills little confidence that it either made thisdetermination or that it complied with the unambiguous dictates of the statute. While the Court essentially ignores the
statute's mandatory prescription by approving of FERC's
decision as a permissible "policy choice," the FPA simply
does not give FERC discretion to base its decision not to
remedy undue discrimination on a "policy choice."

The Court itself struggles to find support for FERC's conclusion that it was not "necessary" to regulate bundled retail
transmission in order to remedy discrimination. First, the
Court points to the fact that FERC's findings concerned electric utilities' use of their market power to " `deny their
wholesale customers access to competitively priced electric
generation,' thereby `deny[ing] consumers the substantial
benefits of lower electricity prices.' " Ante, at 26 (quoting
Brief for Petitioner in No. 00-809, pp. 12-13). Second, the
Court notes that the title of Order No. 888 confirms FERC's
focus because it references promoting wholesale competition.
Ante, at 26. Finally, the Court relies on the fact that FERC
has identified its goal as " `facilitat[ing] competitive wholesale electric power markets.' " Ibid. (quoting Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FERC Stats. & Regs., Proposed Regs.,
1988-1999, || 32,514, p. 33,049; 60 Fed. Reg. 17662).

I fail to understand how these statements support FERC's
determination that it was not "necessary" to regulate bundled retail transmission. Utilities that bundle may use their
market power to discriminate against those seeking access

Opinion of Thomas, J.
to the lines in connection with either retail or wholesalesales. It is certainly possible, perhaps even likely, that the

only way to remedy undue discrimination and ensure openaccess to transmission services is to regulate all utilities that
operate transmission facilities, and not just those that usetheir own lines for the purpose of wholesale sales or in connection with unbundled retail transactions. FERC does notsuggest that the only entities that engage in discriminatory
behavior are those that use their transmission facilities forwholesale sales or unbundled retail sales. And relying on
FERC's reference to wholesale markets makes little sensewhen FERC regulates transmission connected to retail sales
so long as the transmission is in a State that unbundles retailsales or where the utility voluntarily unbundles. See

infra,at 41-42.

"We have frequently reiterated that an agency must co-gently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given
manner . . . ." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U. S., at 48.Here, FERC's failure to do so prevents us from evaluating
whether or not the agency engaged in reasoned decision-making when it determined that it was not "necessary" to
regulate bundled retail transmission.

B
The Court also relies on FERC's explanation that theprospect of unbundling retail transmission and generation

"raises numerous difficult jurisdictional issues that we be-lieve are more appropriately considered when the Commission reviews unbundled retail transmission tariffs that maycome before us in the context of a state retail wheeling

program." Order No. 888, at 31,699. The Court providesthe following explanation for its decision to rely on this
statement:

"But even if we assume, for present purposes, thatEnron is

correct in its claim that the FPA gives FERCthe authority to regulate the transmission component of

Opinion of Thomas, J.
a bundled retail sale, we nevertheless conclude that theagency had discretion to decline to assert such jurisdiction in this proceeding in part because of the compli-cated nature of the jurisdictional issues." Ante, at 28.

This explanation is wholly unsatisfying, both because theCourt's reliance on FERC's statement fails to take into account the unambiguous language of the statute and becauseFERC has given various inconsistent explanations of its
jurisdiction. 1

FERC's statement implies that its decision not to regulatewas based, at least in part, both on a determination that
the statute is ambiguous and on a determination that certaininterstate transmission may fall outside of its jurisdiction.
The FPA, however, unambiguously grants FERC jurisdic-tion over the interstate transmission of electric energy in
interstate commerce. 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b)(1). As the Courtnotes, "[t]here is no language in the statute limiting FERC's
transmission jurisdiction to the wholesale market." Ante,at 17. The Court correctly recognizes that "the FPA authorizes FERC's jurisdiction over interstate transmissions,without regard to whether the transmissions are sold to a
reseller or directly to a consumer." Ante, at 20.Similarly, although FERC draws a jurisdictional line between transmission used in connection with bundled and un-bundled retail sales, the statute makes no such distinction.
The terms "bundled" and "unbundled" are not found in thestatute.

9 The only jurisdictional line that the statute draws

with regard to transmission is between interstate and intra-state. See $ 824(b)(1). Congress does not qualify its grant

9 The difference between the two types of sales is that with an unbundled retail sale, a utility, either voluntarily or pursuant to state law, presents separate charges for the electricity, the transmission service, and
the delivery service. In a bundled sale, all components are combined as
one charge. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 00-809, at 4-5.

to FERC of jurisdiction over interstate transmission. Nordoes the Court explain how the statute grants FERC jurisdiction over unbundled retail transmission, yet is ambiguouswith respect to the question of bundled retail transmission.

Even if I agreed that the statute is ambiguous, FERC didnot purport to resolve an ambiguity in the passage upon
which the Court relies. Instead, FERC refused to resolvewhat it considered to be a statutory ambiguity, in part because it determined that resolving this question was too dif-ficult. Thus, while under

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. NaturalResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843

(1984), the Court will defer to an agency's reasonable inter-pretation of an ambiguous statute, this passage does not provide an interpretation to which the Court can defer.

2
FERC does provide more explicit interpretations of itsjurisdiction elsewhere. It is difficult, however, to isolate

FERC's position on this matter because FERC presents dif-ferent interpretations in its orders, its brief, and at oral argument. At certain points, FERC affirmatively states thatit lacks jurisdiction to regulate this transmission; at other
times, FERC is noncommittal. The Court's heavy relianceon

one statement, therefore, is misplaced. And while theCourt recognizes in a footnote that FERC made conflicting

representations, see ante, at 25, n. 14, in deciding to defer tothe agency the Court fails to place any weight on the fact
that the agency presented inconsistent positions. See
United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 228 (2001) ("Thefair measure of deference to an agency administering its own

statute has been understood to vary with circumstances, andcourts have looked to the degree of the agency's care, its

jurisdiction nor rely on any other explanation provided byFERC.

For example, in its brief FERC argues that because thestatute is ambiguous, the Court of Appeals properly deferred
under Chevron to FERC's reasonable decision not to regu-late. Brief for Respondent FERC 49. FERC then contends that it made a reasonable finding that it lacked juris-diction over the transmission component of bundled retail
sales and that it was therefore not required to regulate thetransmission component.

Id., at 49-50; see also id., at 44("The Commission reasonably concluded that Congress has

not authorized federal regulation of the transmission compo-nent of bundled retail sales of electric energy"). The brief
also notes, however, that FERC has attempted to regulatetransmission connected to retail bundled sales and maintains
that it continues to believe that it has authority to requirepublic utilities to treat customers of unbundled interstate
transmission in a manner comparable to the treatment af-forded bundled transmission users.

Id., at 48.10At oral argument, FERC proposed a different explanation.

It stated that the agency was not disclaiming its authorityto order the unbundling of the transmission component of a

10 FERC earlier rejected the proposed curtailment provisions of a public
utility's federal OATT that favored the utility's bundled retail customers
over its wholesale transmission customers. It asserted that, in compliance with Order No. 888 and in order to enforce the OATT, it could regulate transmission curtailment in a manner that had an indirect effect upon
the utility's services to its retail customers. Brief for Respondent FERC
48; see Northern States Power Co. v. FERC, 176 F. 3d 1090, 1095 (CA8
1999). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, noting
that "FERC concede[d] that it has no jurisdiction whatsoever over the
state's regulation of [the utility's] bundled retail sales activities," held that
FERC exceeded its authority under the FPA. Id., at 1096. While I do
not endorse the court's conclusion with respect to FERC's jurisdiction,
I note that the Court of Appeals pointed to the inconsistencies in FERC's
position, explaining that "FERC's observation that no inherent conflict
exists between its mandates and practical application is viewed through
an adversarial bias." Id., at 1094.

retail sale. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42-43. FERC explained thatit lacks jurisdiction over the transmission "as long as the

State hasn't unbundled [the retail sale], the utility has notunbundled it, and FERC has not exercised whatever authority it would have to unbundle it." Id., at 50 (emphasisadded).

FERC's orders present still more views of its jurisdiction.As already noted, when considering whether FERC should
unbundle retail transmission and generation, FERC assertsthat this particular question "raises numerous difficult jurisdictional issues" more appropriately considered at a latertime. Order No. 888, at 31,699. FERC, at other points,
however, makes clear its belief that there is a jurisdictionalline between unbundled and bundled retail transmission.
Explaining its "legal determination" that it has exclusive ju-risdiction over unbundled retail transmission in interstate
commerce, FERC notes that it found "compelling the factthat section 201 of the FPA,

on its face, gives the Commis-sion jurisdiction over transmission in interstate commerce

(by public utilities) without qualification." Id., at 31,781.Nonetheless, when addressing why "its authority attaches
only to unbundled, but not bundled, retail transmission ininterstate commerce," FERC affirmatively states that "we
believe that when transmission is sold at retail as part andparcel of the delivered product called electric energy, the
transaction is a sale of electric energy at retail" and that"[u]nder the FPA, the Commission's jurisdiction over sales
of electric energy extends only to wholesale sales." Ibid.By contrast, when the "retail transaction is broken into
two products that are sold separately," FERC "believe[s] thejurisdictional lines change."

Ibid. FERC explains:

"In this situation, the state clearly retains jurisdictionover the sale of the power. However, the unbundled

transmission service involves only the provision of`transmission in interstate commerce' which, under the
FPA, is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Com535US1 Unit: $U27 [09-18-03 13:04:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

41Cite as: 535 U. S. 1 (2002)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
mission. Therefore, when a bundled retail sale is un-bundled and becomes separate transmission and power

sales transactions, the resulting transmission trans-action falls within the Federal sphere of regulation."
Ibid.
FERC here concludes that the act of unbundling itselfchanges its jurisdictional lines. Unbundling, FERC notes,

may occur in one of two ways: (1) voluntarily by a publicutility or (2) as a result of a state retail access program that
orders unbundling. Ibid. Either action brings the trans-mission within the scope of FERC's jurisdiction.

Subsequently, in Order No. 888-A, FERC responded torehearing requests by supplanting its earlier conclusion that
"the matter raises numerous difficult jurisdictional issues"with the explanation quoted above from Order No. 888, at
31,781. See Order No. 888-A, at 30,225. It is possible,therefore, that FERC abandoned its "difficult jurisdictional
issues" explanation altogether. Thus, while it is true thatFERC, at one point, evades the jurisdictional question by
deeming it too "difficult" to resolve, more often than notFERC affirmatively concludes that it in fact does not have
jurisdiction over the transmission at issue here. From thissurvey of FERC's positions, I can only conclude that the
Court's singular reliance on the one statement is misguided.

3
Finally, to the extent that FERC has concluded that itlacks jurisdiction over transmission connected to bundled retail sales, it ignores the clear statutory mandate. By refus-ing to regulate the transmission associated with retail sales
in States that have chosen not to unbundle retail sales,FERC has set up a system under which: (a) each State's
internal policy decisions concerning whether to require un-bundling controls the nature of federal jurisdiction; (b) a utility's voluntary decision to unbundle determines whetherFERC has jurisdiction; and (c) utilities that are allowed to

Opinion of Thomas, J.
continue bundling may discriminate against other companiesattempting to use their transmission lines. The statute neither draws these distinctions nor provides that the jurisdic-tional lines shift based on actions taken by the States, the
public utilities, or FERC itself. While Congress understoodthat transmission is a necessary component of all energy
sales, it granted FERC jurisdiction over all interstate trans-mission, without qualification. As such, these distinctions
belie the statutory text. II

As the foregoing demonstrates, I disagree with the defer-ence the Court gives to FERC's decision not to regulate
transmission connected to bundled retail sales. Because thestatute unambiguously grants FERC jurisdiction over all interstate transmission and $ 824e mandates that FERC rem-edy undue discrimination with respect to all transmission
within its jurisdiction, at a minimum the statute requiredFERC to consider whether there was discrimination in the
marketplace warranting application of either the OATT orsome other remedy.

I would not, as petitioner Enron requests, compel FERCto apply the OATT to bundled retail transmissions. I would
vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment and require FERC onremand to engage in reasoned decisionmaking to determine
whether there is undue discrimination with respect to trans-mission associated with retail bundled sales, and if so, what
remedy is appropriate.For all of these reasons, I respectfully dissent from Part
IV of the Court's opinion.

YOUNG et ux. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 00-1567. Argued January 9, 2002--Decided March 4, 2002
If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a claim for certain taxes for

which the return was due within three years before the individual taxpayer files a bankruptcy petition, its claim enjoys eighth priority under
11 U. S. C. $ 507(a)(8)(A)(i), and is nondischargeable in bankruptcy under

$ 523(a)(1)(A). The IRS assessed a tax liability against petitioners for
their failure to include payment with their 1992 income tax return filed
on October 15, 1993. On May 1, 1996, petitioners filed a Chapter 13
bankruptcy petition, which they moved to dismiss before a reorganization plan was approved. On March 12, 1997, the day before the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Chapter 13 petition, petitioners filed a Chapter 7 petition. A discharge was granted, and the case was closed.
When the IRS subsequently demanded that they pay the tax debt, petitioners asked the Bankruptcy Court to reopen the Chapter 7 case and
declare the debt discharged under $ 523(a)(1)(A), claiming that it fell
outside $ 507(a)(8)(A)(i)'s "three-year lookback period" because it pertained to a tax return due more than three years before their Chapter
7 filing. The court reopened the case, but sided with the IRS. Petitioners' tax return was due more than three years before their Chapter
7 filing but less than three years before their Chapter 13 filing. Holding
that the "lookback period" is tolled during the pendency of a prior bankruptcy petition, the court concluded that the 1992 debt had not been
discharged when petitioners were granted a discharge under Chapter 7.
The District Court and the First Circuit agreed.

Held: Section 507(a)(8)(A)(i)'s lookback period is tolled during the pendency of a prior bankruptcy petition. Pp. 46-54.

(a) The lookback period is a limitations period subject to traditional
equitable tolling principles. It prescribes a period in which certain
rights may be enforced, encouraging the IRS to protect its rights before
three years have elapsed. Thus, it serves the same basic policies furthered by all limitations periods: "repose, elimination of stale claims,
and certainty about a plaintiff's opportunity for recovery and a defendant's potential liabilities." Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555. The
fact that the lookback commences on a date that may precede the date
when the IRS discovers its claim does not make it a substantive component of the Bankruptcy Code as petitioners claim. Pp. 46-49.

44 YOUNG v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
(b) Congress is presumed to draft limitations periods in light of the
principle that such periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling
unless tolling would be inconsistent with statutory text. Tolling is appropriate here. Petitioners' Chapter 13 petition erected an automatic
stay under $ 362(a), which prevented the IRS from taking steps to collect the unpaid taxes. When petitioners later filed their Chapter 7 petition, the three-year lookback period therefore excluded time during
which their Chapter 13 petition was pending. Because their 1992 tax
return was due within that three-year period, the lower courts properly
held that the tax debt was not discharged. Tolling is appropriate regardless of whether petitioners filed their Chapter 13 petition in good
faith or solely to run down the lookback period. In either case, the IRS
was disabled from protecting its claim. Pp. 49-51.

(c) The statutory provisions invoked by petitioners--$$ 523(b), 108(c),
and 507(a)(8)(A)(ii)--do not display an intent to preclude tolling here.
Pp. 51-53.

233 F. 3d 56, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Grenville Clark III argued the cause and filed briefs forpetitioners.
Patricia A. Millett argued the cause for the UnitedStates. With her on the briefs were

Solicitor GeneralOlson, Assistant Attorney General O'Connor, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Bruce R. Ellisen, and Thomas J.Sawyer.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
A discharge under the Bankruptcy Code does not extin-guish certain tax liabilities for which a return was due

within three years before the filing of an individual debt-or's petition. 11 U. S. C. $$ 523(a)(1)(A), 507(a)(8)(A)(i). We
must decide whether this "three-year lookback period" istolled during the pendency of a prior bankruptcy petition.

Opinion of the Court
October 15, 1993 (petitioners had obtained an extension ofthe April 15 deadline). About $15,000 was owing. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed the tax liability onJanuary 3, 1994, and petitioners made modest monthly payments ($40 to $300) from April 1994 until November 1995.On May 1, 1996, they sought protection under Chapter 13 of
the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of New Hampshire. The bulk of their taxliability (about $13,000, including accrued interest) remained

due. Before a reorganization plan was confirmed, however,the Youngs moved on October 23, 1996, to dismiss their
Chapter 13 petition, pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 1307(b). On
March 12, 1997, one day before the Bankruptcy Court dismissed their Chapter 13 petition, the Youngs filed a new petition, this time under Chapter 7. This was a "no asset" petition, meaning that the Youngs had no assets available to
satisfy unsecured creditors, including the IRS. A discharge
was granted June 17, 1997; the case was closed September
22, 1997.

The IRS subsequently demanded payment of the 1992 tax
debt. The Youngs refused and petitioned the Bankruptcy
Court to reopen their Chapter 7 case and declare the debt
discharged. In their view, the debt fell outside the Bankruptcy Code's "three-year lookback period," $$ 523(a)(1)(A),
507(a)(8)(A)(i), and had therefore been discharged, because it
pertained to a tax return due on October 15, 1993, more than
three years before their Chapter 7 filing on March 12, 1997.
The Bankruptcy Court reopened the case but sided with the
IRS. Although the Youngs' 1992 income tax return was due
more than three years before they filed their Chapter 7 petition, it was due less than three years before they filed their
Chapter 13 petition on May 1, 1996. Holding that the
"three-year lookback period" is tolled during the pendency
of a prior bankruptcy petition, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that the 1992 tax debt had not been discharged. The

Opinion of the Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed. 233 F. 3d 56 (2000).
We granted certiorari. 533 U. S. 976 (2001).

II
Section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code excepts certain individual debts from discharge, including any tax "of the kind
and for the periods specified in section . . . 507(a)(8) of this
title, whether or not a claim for such tax was filed or allowed." $ 523(a)(1)(A). Section 507(a), in turn, describes
the priority of certain claims in the distribution of the debtor's assets. Subsection 507(a)(8)(A)(i) gives eighth priority
to "allowed unsecured claims of governmental units, only to
the extent that such claims are for-- . . . a tax on or measured by income or gross receipts-- . . . for a taxable year
ending on or before the date of the filing of the petition for
which a return, if required, is last due, including extensions,
after three years before the date of the filing of the petition . . . ." (Emphasis added.) This is commonly known as
the "three-year lookback period." If the IRS has a claim
for taxes for which the return was due within three years
before the bankruptcy petition was filed, the claim enjoys
eighth priority under $ 507(a)(8)(A)(i) and is nondischargeable in bankruptcy under $ 523(a)(1)(A).

The terms of the lookback period appear to create a loophole: Since the Code does not prohibit back-to-back Chapter
13 and Chapter 7 filings (as long as the debtor did not receive
a discharge under Chapter 13, see $$ 727(a)(8), (9)), a debtor
can render a tax debt dischargeable by first filing a Chapter
13 petition, then voluntarily dismissing the petition when the
lookback period for the debt has lapsed, and finally refiling
under Chapter 7. During the pendency of the Chapter 13
petition, the automatic stay of $ 362(a) will prevent the IRS
from taking steps to collect the unpaid taxes, and if the
Chapter 7 petition is filed after the lookback period has expired, the taxes remaining due will be dischargeable. Peti535US1 Unit: $U28 [09-18-03 13:18:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tioners took advantage of this loophole, which, they believe,is permitted by the Bankruptcy Code.

We disagree. The three-year lookback period is a limita-tions period subject to traditional principles of equitable tolling. Since nothing in the Bankruptcy Code precludes equi-table tolling of the lookback period, we believe the courts
below properly excluded from the three-year limitation theperiod during which the Youngs' Chapter 13 petition was
pending. A

The lookback period is a limitations period because it pre-scribes a period within which certain rights (namely, priority and nondischargeability in bankruptcy) may be enforced.1 H. Wood, Limitations of Actions $ 1, p. 1 (4th D. Moore ed.
1916). Old tax claims--those pertaining to returns duemore than three years before the debtor filed the bankruptcy
petition--become dischargeable, so that a bankruptcy decreewill relieve the debtor of the obligation to pay. The period
thus encourages the IRS to protect its rights--by, say, col-lecting the debt, 26 U. S. C. $$ 6501, 6502 (1994 ed. and Supp.
V), or perfecting a tax lien, $$ 6322, 6323(a), (f) (1994 ed.)--before three years have elapsed. If the IRS sleeps on its
rights, its claim loses priority and the debt becomes dis-chargeable. Thus, as petitioners concede, the lookback
period serves the same "basic policies [furthered by] all limi-tations provisions: repose, elimination of stale claims, and
certainty about a plaintiff 's opportunity for recovery anda defendant's potential liabilities." Rotella v. Wood, 528
U. S. 549, 555 (2000). It is true that, unlike most statutesof limitations, the lookback period bars only some, and not
all, legal remedies 1 for enforcing the claim (viz., priority and

1 Equitable remedies may still be available. Traditionally, for example,
a mortgagee could sue in equity to foreclose mortgaged property even
though the underlying debt was time barred. Hardin v. Boyd, 113 U. S.
756, 765-766 (1885); 2 G. Glenn, Mortgages $$ 141-142, pp. 812-818 (1943);
see also Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 523 U. S. 410, 415-416 (1998) (recoup535US1 Unit: $U28 [09-18-03 13:18:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nondischargeability in bankruptcy); that makes it a morelimited statute of limitations, but a statute of limitations

nonetheless.Petitioners argue that the lookback period is a substantive
component of the Bankruptcy Code, not a procedural limita-tions period. The lookback period commences on the date
the return for the tax debt "is last due," $ 507(a)(8)(A)(i), noton the date the IRS discovers or assesses the unpaid tax.
Thus, the IRS may have less than three years to protectitself against the risk that a debt will become dischargeable
in bankruptcy.To illustrate, petitioners offer the following variation on
this case: Suppose the Youngs filed their 1992 tax return onOctober 15, 1993, but had not received (as they received
here) an extension of the April 15, 1993, due date. Assumethe remaining facts of the case are unchanged: The IRS assessed the tax on January 3, 1994; petitioners filed a Chapter13 petition on May 1, 1996; that petition was voluntarily dismissed and the Youngs filed a new petition under Chapter 7on March 12, 1997. In this hypothetical, petitioners argue,
their tax debt would have been dischargeable in the firstpetition under Chapter 13. Over three years would have
elapsed between the due date of their return (April 15, 1993)and their Chapter 13 petition (May 1, 1996). But the IRS--
which may not have discovered the debt until petitionersfiled a return on October 15, 1993--would have enjoyed less
than three years to collect the debt or prevent the debt frombecoming dischargeable in bankruptcy (by perfecting a tax
lien). The Code even contemplates this possibility, petition-ers believe. Section 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) renders a tax debt nondischargeable if it arises from an untimely return filed within
two years before a bankruptcy petition. Thus, if petitionershad filed their return on April 30, 1994 (more than two years

before their Chapter 13 petition), and if the IRS had been
ment is available after a limitations period has lapsed); United States v.
Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 611 (1990) (same).

Opinion of the Court
unaware of the debt until the return was filed, the IRS wouldhave had only two years to act before the debt became dischargeable in bankruptcy. For these reasons, petitionersbelieve the lookback period is not a limitations period, but
rather a definition of dischargeable taxes.We disagree. In the sense in which petitioners use the
term, all limitations periods are "substantive": They definea subset of claims eligible for certain remedies. And the
lookback is not distinctively "substantive" merely because itcommences on a date that may precede the date when the
IRS discovers its claim. There is nothing unusual about astatute of limitations that commences when the claimant has
a complete and present cause of action, whether or not he isaware of it. See 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 6.1,
pp. 370, 378 (1991); 2 Wood, supra, $ 276c(1), at 1411. As forpetitioners' reliance on $ 523(a)(1)(B)(ii), that section proves,
at most, that Congress put different limitations periods ondifferent kinds of tax debts. All tax debts falling within the
terms of the three-year lookback period are nondischarge-able in bankruptcy. $$ 523(a)(1)(A), 507(a)(8)(A)(i). Even if
a tax debt falls outside the terms of the lookback period, itis nonetheless nondischargeable if it pertains to an untimely
return filed within two years before the bankruptcy petition.$ 523(a)(1)(B)(ii). These provisions are complementary; they
do not suggest that the lookback period is something otherthan a limitations period.

B
It is hornbook law that limitations periods are "custom-arily subject to `equitable tolling,' "

Irwin v. Department ofVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990), unless tolling would

be "inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute,"United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38, 48 (1998). See also
American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 558-559(1974); Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397 (1946); Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 349-350 (1875). Congress mustbe presumed to draft limitations periods in light of this back535US1 Unit: $U28 [09-18-03 13:18:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ground principle. Cf. National Private Truck Council, Inc.
v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 515 U. S. 582, 589-590 (1995);
United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, 13 (1994). That is
doubly true when it is enacting limitations periods to be applied by bankruptcy courts, which are courts of equity and
"appl[y] the principles and rules of equity jurisprudence."
Pepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295, 304 (1939); see also United
States v. Energy Resources Co., 495 U. S. 545, 549 (1990).

This Court has permitted equitable tolling in situations
"where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked
by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass." Irwin, supra, at 96 (footnotes omitted). We
have acknowledged, however, that tolling might be appropriate in other cases, see, e. g., Baldwin County Welcome
Center v. Brown, 466 U. S. 147, 151 (1984) (per curiam), and
this, we believe, is one. Cf. Amy v. Watertown (No. 2), 130
U. S. 320, 325-326 (1889); 3 J. Story, Equity Jurisprudence

$ 1974, pp. 558-559 (14th W. Lyon ed. 1918). The Youngs'
Chapter 13 petition erected an automatic stay under $ 362,
which prevented the IRS from taking steps to protect its
claim. When the Youngs filed a petition under Chapter 7,
the three-year lookback period therefore excluded time during which their Chapter 13 petition was pending. The
Youngs' 1992 tax return was due within that three-year period. Hence the lower courts properly held that the tax
debt was not discharged when the Youngs were granted a
discharge under Chapter 7.

Tolling is in our view appropriate regardless of petitioners'
intentions when filing back-to-back Chapter 13 and Chapter
7 petitions--whether the Chapter 13 petition was filed in
good faith or solely to run down the lookback period. In
either case, the IRS was disabled from protecting its claim
during the pendency of the Chapter 13 petition, and this pe535US1 Unit: $U28 [09-18-03 13:18:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
riod of disability tolled the three-year lookback period whenthe Youngs filed their Chapter 7 petition.

C
Petitioners invoke several statutory provisions which theyclaim display an intent to preclude tolling here. First they

point to $ 523(b), which, they believe, explicitly permits dis-charge in a Chapter 7 proceeding of certain debts that were
nondischargeable (as this tax debt was) in a prior Chapter13 proceeding. Petitioners misread the provision. Section
523(b) declares that

"a debt that was excepted from discharge under subsec-tion (a)(1), (a)(3), or (a)(8) of this section . . . in a prior

case concerning the debtor . . . is dischargeable in a caseunder this title unless, by the terms of subsection (a) of
this section, such debt is not dischargeable in the caseunder this title." (Emphasis added.)

The phrase "excepted from discharge" in this provision isnot synonymous (as petitioners would have it) with "nondischargeable." It envisions a prior bankruptcy proceedingthat progressed

to the discharge stage, from which dischargea particular debt was actually "excepted." It thus has no

application to the present case; and even if it did, the verysame arguments in favor of tolling that we have found persuasive with regard to $ 507 would apply to $ 523 as well.One might perhaps have expected an explicit tolling provision in $ 523(b) if that subsection applied only to those debts"excepted from discharge" in the earlier proceeding that
were subject to the three-year lookback--but in fact it alsoapplies to excepted debts (see $ 523(a)(3)) that were subject
to no limitations period. And even the need for tolling asto debts that

were subject to the three-year lookback is mini-mal, since a separate provision of the Code, $ 727(a)(9), constrains successive discharges under Chapters 13 and 7: Gen-erally speaking, six years must elapse between filing of the

52 YOUNG v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
two bankruptcy petitions, which would make the need fortolling of the three-year limitation nonexistent. The absence of an explicit tolling provision in $ 523 therefore sug-gests nothing.

Petitioners point to two provisions of the Code, which, intheir view, do contain a tolling provision. Its presence
there, and its absence in $ 507, they argue, displays an intent
to preclude equitable tolling of the lookback period. We dis-agree. Petitioners point first to $ 108(c), which reads:

"Except as provided in section 524 of this title, if applicable nonbankruptcy law . . . fixes a period for com-mencing or continuing a civil action in a court other than

a bankruptcy court on a claim against the debtor . . . ,
and such period has not expired before the date of thefiling of the petition, then such period does not expire

until the later of--(1) the end of such period, includingany suspension of such period occurring on or after the
commencement of the case; or (2) 30 days after notice ofthe termination or expiration of the stay . . . with respect to such claim."
Petitioners believe $ 108(c)(1) contains a tolling provision.
The lower courts have split over this issue, compare, e. g.,
Rogers v. Corrosion Products, Inc., 42 F. 3d 292, 297 (CA5),
cert. denied, 515 U. S. 1160 (1995), with Garbe Iron Works,
Inc. v. Priester, 99 Ill. 2d 84, 457 N. E. 2d 422 (1983); we need
not resolve it here. Even assuming petitioners are correct,
we would draw no negative inference from the presence of
an express tolling provision in $ 108(c)(1) and the absence of
one in $ 507. It would be quite reasonable for Congress to
instruct nonbankruptcy courts (including state courts) to
toll nonbankruptcy limitations periods (including state-law
limitations periods) while, at the same time, assuming that
bankruptcy courts will use their inherent equitable powers
to toll the federal limitations periods within the Code.

53Cite as: 535 U. S. 43 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Finally, petiti oners point to a tolling provisi on in

$ 507(a)(8)(A), the same subsection that sets forth the threeyear lookback period. Subsection 507(a)(8)(A) grants eighth
priority to tax claims pertaining to returns that were due
within the three-year lookback period, $ 507(a)(8)(A)(i), and
to claims that were assessed within 240 days before the debtor's bankruptcy petition, $ 507(a)(8)(A)(ii). Whereas the
three-year lookback period contains no express tolling provision, the 240-day lookback period is tolled "any time plus 30
days during which an offer in compromise with respect to
such tax that was made within 240 days after such assessment was pending." $ 507(a)(8)(A)(ii). Petitioners believe
this express tolling provision, appearing in the same subsection as the three-year lookback period, demonstrates a statutory intent not to toll the three-year lookback period.

If anything, $ 507(a)(8)(A)(ii) demonstrates that the Bankruptcy Code incorporates traditional equitable principles.
An "offer in compromise" is a settlement offer submitted by
a debtor. When $ 507(a)(8)(A)(ii) was enacted, it was IRS
practice--though no statutory provision required it--to stay
collection efforts (if the Government's interests would not be
jeopardized) during the pendency of an "offer in compromise," 26 CFR $ 301.7122-1(d)(2) (1978); M. Saltzman, IRS
Practice and Procedure || 15.07[1], p. 15-47 (1981).2 Thus, a
court would not have equitably tolled the 240-day lookback
period during the pendency of an "offer in compromise,"
since tolling is inappropriate when a claimant has voluntarily
chosen not to protect his rights within the limitations period.
See, e. g., Irwin, 498 U. S., at 96. Hence the tolling provision
in $ 507(a)(8)(A)(ii) supplements rather than displaces principles of equitable tolling.

2 The Code was amended in 1998 to prohibit collection efforts during the
pendency of an offer in compromise. See 26 U. S. C. $ 6331(k) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V).

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. VONN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-973. Argued November 6, 2001--Decided March 4, 2002
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 lays out steps that a judge must

take to ensure that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary. Rule 11(h)'s
requirement that any variance from those procedures "which does not
affect substantial rights shall be disregarded" is similar to the general
"harmless-error" rule in Rule 52(a). However, Rule 11(h) does not include a plain-error provision comparable to Rule 52(b), which provides
that a defendant who fails to object to trial error may nonetheless have
a conviction reversed by showing among other things that plain error
affected his substantial rights. After respondent Vonn was charged
with federal bank robbery and firearm crimes, the Magistrate Judge
twice advised him of his constitutional rights, including the right to be
represented by counsel at every stage of the proceedings; Vonn signed
a statement saying that he had read and understood his rights; and he
answered yes to the court's questions whether he had understood the
court's explanation of his rights and whether he had read and signed
the statement. When Vonn later pleaded guilty to robbery, the court
advised him of the constitutional rights he was relinquishing, but
skipped the advice required by Rule (11)(c)(3) that he would have the
right to assistance of counsel at trial. Subsequently, Vonn pleaded
guilty to the firearm charge and to a later-charged conspiracy count.
Again, the court advised him of the rights he was waiving, but did not
mention the right to counsel. Eight months later, Vonn moved to withdraw his guilty plea on the firearm charge but did not cite Rule 11 error.
The court denied the motion and sentenced him. On appeal, he sought
to set aside all of his convictions, for the first time raising Rule 11. The
Ninth Circuit agreed that there had been error and held that Vonn's
failure to object before the District Court to the Rule 11 omission was
of no import because Rule 11(h) subjects all Rule 11 violations to
harmless-error review. Declining to go beyond the plea proceeding in
considering whether Vonn was aware of his rights, the court held that
the Government had not met its burden, under harmless-error review,
of showing no effect on substantial rights, and vacated the convictions.

Held:

56 UNITED STATES v. VONN

Syllabus
(a) Relying on the canon that expressing one item of a commonly
associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned, Vonn
claims that Rule 11(h)'s specification of harmless-error review shows an
intent to exclude the plain-error standard with which harmless error is
paired in Rule 52. However, this canon is only a guide, whose fallibility
can be shown by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or
statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion of its common
relatives. Here, the harmless- and plain-error alternatives are associated together in Rule 52, having apparently equal dignity with Rule
11(h), and applying by its terms to error in the application of any other
Rule of Criminal Procedure. To hold that Rule 11(h)'s terms imply that
the latter half of Rule 52 has no application to Rule 11 errors would
amount to finding a partial repeal of Rule 52(b) by implication, a result
sufficiently disfavored, Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986,
1017, as to require strong support. Support, however, is not readily
found, for Vonn has merely selected one possible interpretation of the
supposedly intentional omission of a Rule 52(b) counterpart while logic
would equally allow a reading that, without a plain-error rule, a silent
defendant has no right of review on direct appeal. Pp. 63-66.

(b) Vonn attempts to find support for his reading by pointing beyond the Rule's text to McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459--which
was decided when Rule 11 was relatively primitive--and the developments in that case's wake culminating in Rule 11(h)'s enactment. One
clearly expressed Rule 11(h) objective was to end the practice of reversing automatically for any Rule 11 error, a practice stemming from reading McCarthy expansively to require that Rule 52(a)'s harmless-error
provision could not be applied in Rule 11 cases. However, McCarthy
had nothing to do with the choice between harmless-error and plainerror review. Nor is there any persuasive reason to think that when
the Advisory Committee and Congress considered Rule 11(h) they accepted the view Vonn erroneously attributes to this Court in McCarthy.
The Advisory Committee focused on the disarray, after McCarthy,
among Courts of Appeals in treating trivial errors. The cases cited in
the Committee's Notes cannot reliably be read to suggest that plainerror review should never apply to Rule 11 errors, when the Notes
never made such an assertion and the cases never mentioned the plainerror/harmless-error distinction. Rather, the Committee should be
taken at its word that the harmless-error provision was added because
some courts read McCarthy to require that Rule 52(a)'s general
harmless-error provision did not apply to Rule 11 proceedings. The
Committee implied nothing more than it said, and it certainly did not
implicitly repeal Rule 52(b) so far as it might cover a Rule 11 case.

(c) Vonn's position would also have a tendency to undercut the object of Rule 32(e), which governs guilty plea withdrawal by creating an
incentive to file withdrawal motions before sentence, not afterward.
This tends to separate meritorious second thoughts and mere sour
grapes over a sentence once pronounced. But the incentive to think
and act early when Rule 11 is at stake would prove less substantial if a
defendant could be silent until direct appeal, when the Government
would always have the burden to prove harmlessness. Pp. 72-74.

2. A reviewing court may consult the whole record when considering
the effect of any Rule 11 error on substantial rights. The Advisory
Committee intended the error's effect to be assessed on an existing record, but it did not mean to limit that record strictly to the plea proceeding, as the Ninth Circuit did here. McCarthy ostensibly supports that
court's position; but it was decided before Rule 11(h) was enacted, and
it was not a case with a record on point. Here, in addition to the transcript of the plea hearing and Rule 11 colloquy, the record shows that
Vonn was advised of his right to trial counsel during his initial appearance and twice at his first arraignment, and that four times either he or
his counsel affirmed that he had heard or read a statement of his rights
and understood them. Because there are circumstances in which defendants may be presumed to recall information provided to them prior
to the plea proceeding, cf. Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 618,
the record of Vonn's initial appearance and arraignments is relevant in
fact and well within the Advisory Committee's understanding of the
record that should be open to consideration. Since the transcripts of
Vonn's first appearance and arraignment were not presented to the
Ninth Circuit, this Court should not resolve their bearing on his claim
before the Ninth Circuit has done so. Pp. 74-76.

Opinion of the Court
Monica Knox argued the cause for respondent. With heron the brief was Maria E. Stratton.*

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Government avoids reversal of a criminal convictionby showing that trial error, albeit raised by a timely objection, affected no substantial right of the defendant and wasthus harmless. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a). A defendant
who failed to object to trial error may nonetheless obtainreversal of a conviction by carrying the converse burden,
showing among other things that plain error did affect hissubstantial rights. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).

Rule 11(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure isa separate harmless-error rule applying only to errors committed under Rule 11, the rule meant to ensure that a guiltyplea is knowing and voluntary, by laying out the steps a trial
judge must take before accepting such a plea. Like Rule52(a), it provides that a failure to comply with Rule 11 that
"does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."Rule 11(h) does not include a plain-error provision comparable to Rule 52(b).The first question here is whether a defendant who lets
Rule 11 error pass without objection in the trial court mustcarry the burdens of Rule 52(b) or whether even the silent
defendant can put the Government to the burden of prov-ing the Rule 11 error harmless.

1 The second question is

urge the Court of Appeals to adopt a plain-error standard. As the Court
of Appeals recognized, 224 F. 3d 1152, 1155 (CA9 2000), this position was
squarely barred by Circuit precedent holding that any Rule 11 error is
subject to harmless-error review. United States v. Odedo, 154 F. 3d 937,
940 (CA9 1998). Although the Government did not challenge Odedo as
controlling precedent, we have previously held that such a claim is preserved if made by the current litigant in "the recent proceeding upon

Opinion of the Court
whether a court reviewing Rule 11 error under either stand-ard is limited to examining the record of the colloquy between court and defendant when the guilty plea was entered,or may look to the entire record begun at the defendant's
first appearance in the matter leading to his eventual plea.We hold that a silent defendant has the burden to satisfy
the plain-error rule and that a reviewing court may consult
the whole record when considering the effect of any error onsubstantial rights.

On February 28, 1997, respondent Alphonso Vonn was
charged with armed bank robbery, under 18 U. S. C.

$$ 2113(a) and (d), and using and carrying a firearm during
and in relation to a crime of violence, under 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c). Vonn appeared that day before a Magistrate Judge,
who advised him of his constitutional rights, including "the
right to retain and to be represented by an attorney of [his]
own choosing at each and every sta[g]e of the proceedings."
App. 15. Vonn said that he had heard and understood his
rights, and the judge appointed counsel to represent him.

On March 17, 1997, three days after being indicted, Vonn,
along with his appointed counsel, appeared in court for his
arraignment. Again, the Magistrate Judge told Vonn about
his rights, including the right to counsel at all stages of the
proceedings. Vonn's counsel gave the court a form entitled
"Statement of Defendant's Constitutional Rights," on which

which the lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue, and [the
litigant] did not concede in the current case the correctness of that precedent." United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 44-45 (1992). Although
there evidently was some confusion as to the Government's precise position in Odedo, presumably because the Government argued there, as here,
that failure to raise a Rule 11 objection constitutes "waiver," the Court of
Appeals understood the Government to contend that "forfeited error" is
subject to plain-error review. That, coupled with the fact that the Government did not concede below that Odedo was correctly decided, is
enough for us to take up this question.

60 UNITED STATES v. VONN

Opinion of the Court
Vonn said he understood his rights, including the right tocounsel. His counsel signed a separate statement that he

was satisfied that Vonn had read and understood the state-ment of his rights. The Clerk of Court then asked Vonn
whether he had heard and understood the court's explanationof his rights, and whether he had read and signed the statement, and Vonn said yes to each question.On May 12, 1997, Vonn came before the court and indicated
that he would plead guilty to armed bank robbery but wouldgo to trial on the firearm charge. The court then addressed
him and, up to a point, followed Rule 11(c)(3) of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure. The judge advised Vonn of
the constitutional rights he would relinquish by pleadingguilty, but skipped the required advice that if Vonn were
tried he would have "the right to the assistance of counsel."Several months later, the stakes went up when the grand
jury returned a superseding indictment, charging Vonnunder an additional count of conspiracy to commit bank robbery. Although he first pleaded not guilty to this charge aswell as the firearm count, at a hearing on September 3, 1997,
Vonn said he intended to change both pleas to guilty. Again,the court advised Vonn of rights waived by guilty pleas, but
failed to mention the right to counsel if he went to trial.This time, the prosecutor tried to draw the court's attention
to its error, saying that she did not "remember hearing theCourt inform the defendant of his right to assistance of counsel." Id., at 61. The court, however, may have mistakenthe remark as going to Rule 11(c)(2), and answered simply
that Vonn was represented by counsel.2Eight months later, Vonn moved to withdraw his guilty
plea on the firearm charge. He did not, however, cite Rule11 error but instead based his request on his own mistake

2 Rule 11(c)(2) provides that "if the defendant is not represented by an
attorney," the court must inform the defendant that he "has the right to
be represented by an attorney at every stage of the proceeding and, if
necessary, one will be appointed to represent [him]."

about facts relevant to the charge. The court denied thismotion, and on June 22, 1998, sentenced Vonn to 97 months

in prison.On appeal, Vonn sought to set aside not only the firearm
conviction but the other two as well, for the first time mak-ing an issue of the District Judge's failure to advise him of
his right to counsel at trial, as required by the Rule. TheCourt of Appeals agreed there had been error, and held that
Vonn's failure to object before the District Court to its Rule11 omission was of no import, since Rule 11(h) "supersedes
the normal waiver rule," and subjects all Rule 11 violationsto harmless-error review, 224 F. 3d 1152, 1155 (CA9 2000)
(citing United States v. Odedo, 154 F. 3d 937 (CA9 1998)).The consequence was to put the Government to the burden
of showing no effect on substantial rights.3 The court de-clined to "go beyond the plea proceeding in considering
whether the defendant was aware of his rights," and did notaccept the record of Vonn's plea colloquies as evidence that
Vonn was aware of his continuing right to counsel at trial.224 F. 3d, at 1155. It held the Government had failed to
shoulder its burden to show the error harmless and vacatedVonn's convictions.

We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 1189 (2001), to resolve con-flicts among the Circuits on the legitimacy of (1) placing the
burden of plain error on a defendant appealing on the basisof Rule 11 error raised for the first time on appeal,

4 and

(2) looking beyond the plea colloquy to other parts of the

3 As already noted, n. 1, supra, the Government in this case did not
specifically argue that the plain-error rule, Rule 52(b), governs this case;
that was its position in Odedo, 154 F. 3d, at 939, on which the Court of
Appeals relied for authority here. Hence, the Court of Appeals in this
case went no further than to reject the Government's waiver argument.

5 We think the

Court of Appeals was mistaken on each issue, and vacateand remand.

II
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure re-quires a judge to address a defendant about to enter a plea

of guilty, to ensure that he understands the law of his crimein relation to the facts of his case, as well as his rights as a
criminal defendant. The Rule has evolved over the courseof 30 years from general scheme to detailed plan, which now
includes a provision for dealing with a slip-up by the judgein applying the Rule itself. Subsection (h) reads that "[a]ny
variance from the procedures required by this rule whichdoes not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."
The language comes close to tracking the text of Rule 52(a),providing generally for "harmless-error" review, that is, consideration of error raised by a defendant's timely objection,but subject to an opportunity on the Government's part to
carry the burden of showing that any error was harmless, ashaving no effect on the defendant's substantial rights. See
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a) ("Any error, defect, irregularityor variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be
disregarded"); United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734(1993).

Rule 52(a), however, has a companion in Rule 52(b), a"plain-error" rule covering issues not raised before the district court in a timely way: "Plain errors or defects affectingsubstantial rights may be noticed although they were not
brought to the attention of the court." When an appellatecourt considers error that qualifies as plain, the tables are
turned on demonstrating the substantiality of any effect on

Opinion of the Court
a defendant's rights: the defendant who sat silent at trial hasthe burden to show that his "substantial rights" were affected. Id., at 734-735. And because relief on plain-errorreview is in the discretion of the reviewing court, a defendant has the further burden to persuade the court that theerror " `seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public
reputation of judicial proceedings.' " Id., at 736 (quoting
United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)).The question here is whether Congress's importation of

the harmless-error standard into Rule 11(h) without its com-panion plain-error rule was meant to eliminate a silent defendant's burdens under the Rule 52(b) plain-error review,and instead give him a right to subject the Government to
the burden of demonstrating harmlessness. If the answeris yes, a defendant loses nothing by failing to object to obvious Rule 11 error when it occurs. We think the answeris no.

A
Vonn's most obvious recourse is to argue from the textitself: Rule 11(h) unequivocally provides that a trial judge's

"variance" from the letter of the Rule 11 scheme shall bedisregarded if it does not affect substantial rights, the classic
shorthand formulation of the harmless-error standard. Itincludes no exception for nonobjecting defendants.

Despite this unqualified simplicity, however, Vonn does notargue that Rule 11 error must always be reviewed on the
11(h) standard, with its burden on the Government to showan error harmless. Even though Rule 11(h) makes no distinction between direct and collateral review, Vonn does notclaim even that the variant of harmless-error review applicable on collateral attack, see Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S.619, 638 (1993), would apply when evaluating Rule 11 error
on habeas review. Rather, he concedes that the adoption of11(h) had no effect on the stringent standard for collateral
review of Rule 11 error under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed.),as established by our holding in

United States v. Timmreck,

535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
64 UNITED STATES v. VONN

Opinion of the Court
441 U. S. 780 (1979), that a defendant cannot overturn a
guilty plea on collateral review absent a showing that the
Rule 11 proceeding was " `inconsistent with the rudimentary
demands of fair procedure' " or constituted a " `complete
miscarriage of justice,' " id., at 783 (quoting Hill v. United
States, 368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962)). The concession is prudent,
for the Advisory Committee Notes explaining the adoption
of Rule 11(h) speak to a clear intent to leave Timmreck undisturbed,6 and there is no question of Timmreck's validity
in the aftermath of the 1983 amendments.

Whatever may be the significance of the text of Rule 11(h)
for our issue, then, it cannot be as simple as the face of the
provision itself. Indeed, the closest Vonn gets to a persuasive argument that Rule 11 excuses a silent defendant from
the burdens of plain-error review is his invocation of the
common interpretive canon for dealing with a salient omission from statutory text. He claims that the specification of
harmless-error review in 11(h) shows an intent to exclude
the standard with which harmless error is paired in Rule 52,
the plain-error standard with its burdens on silent defendants. The congressional choice to express the one standard
of review without its customary companion does not, however, speak with any clarity in Vonn's favor.

6 In the absence of a clear legislative mandate, the Advisory Committee
Notes provide a reliable source of insight into the meaning of a rule, especially when, as here, the rule was enacted precisely as the Advisory Committee proposed. See Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U. S. 153, 165-
166, n. 9 (1988) (where "Congress did not amend the Advisory Committee's
draft in any way . . . the Committee's commentary is particularly relevant
in determining the meaning of the document Congress enacted"). Although the Notes are the product of the Advisory Committee, and not
Congress, they are transmitted to Congress before the rule is enacted
into law. See Amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure, H. R. Doc.
No. 98-55 (1983) (submitting to Congress amendments to the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, including the addition of Rule 11(h), accompanied by the report of the Judicial Conference containing the Advisory
Committee Notes to the amendment).

Opinion of the Court
At best, as we have said before, the canon that expressingone item of a commonly associated group or series excludes

another left unmentioned is only a guide, whose fallibilitycan be shown by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any ex-clusion of its common relatives. See

Pauley v. BethEnergy
Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 703 (1991); cf. Burns v. United
States, 501 U. S. 129, 136 (1991) ("An inference drawn fromcongressional silence certainly cannot be credited when it is

contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of con-gressional intent"). Here, the plausibility of an expressionexclusion reading of Rule 11(h) is subject to one strike without even considering what such a reading would mean in
practice, or examining the circumstances of adopting 11(h).
For here the harmless- and plain-error alternatives are associated together in the formally enacted Rule 52, having apparently equal dignity with Rule 11(h), and applying by its
terms to error in the application of any other Rule of criminal procedure. To hold that the terms of Rule 11(h) imply
that the latter half of Rule 52 has no application to Rule 11
errors would consequently amount to finding a partial repeal
of Rule 52(b) by implication, a result sufficiently disfavored,
Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1017 (1984), as
to require strong support.

Support, however, is not readily found. In the first place,
even if we indulge Vonn with the assumption that Congress
meant to imply something by failing to pair a plain-error
provision with the harmless-error statement in Rule 11(h),
just what it would have meant is subject to argument. Vonn
thinks the implication is that defendants who let Rule 11
error pass without objection are relieved of the burden on
silent defendants generally under the plain-error rule, to
show the error plain, prejudicial, and disreputable to the judicial system. But, of course, this is not the only "implication" consistent with Congress's choice to say nothing about
Rule 11 plain error. It would be equally possible, as a mat535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ter of logic, to argue that if Rule 52(b) were implicitly madeinapplicable to Rule 11 errors, a defendant who failed to object to Rule 11 errors would have no right of review on directappeal whatever. A defendant's right to review of error he
let pass in silence depends upon the plain-error rule; noplain-error rule, no direct review. Vonn has, then, merely
selected one possible interpretation of the supposedly inten-tional omission of a Rule 52(b) counterpart, even though logic
would equally allow another one, not to Vonn's liking.

B
Recognition of the equivocal character of any claimed im-plication of speaking solely in terms of harmless error forces

Vonn to look beyond the text in hope of finding confirmationfor his reading as opposed to the one less hospitable to silent
defendants. And this effort leads him to claim support in
McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459 (1969), and the de-velopments in the wake of that case culminating in the enactment of Rule 11(h). This approach, at least, gets us on theright track, for the one clearly expressed objective of Rule
11(h) was to end the practice, then commonly followed, ofreversing automatically for any Rule 11 error, and that
practice stemmed from an expansive reading of McCarthy.What that case did, and did not, hold is therefore significant.

When McCarthy was decided, Rule 11 was relatively prim-itive, requiring without much detail that the trial court personally address a defendant proposing to plead guilty andestablish on the record that he was acting voluntarily, with
an understanding of the charge and upon a factual basis sup-porting conviction.

Id., at 462.7 When McCarthy stood be7 Prior to its amendment in 1975, Rule 11 provided, in relevant part:
"The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept
such plea or a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with
understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the
plea. . . . The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless
it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea."

Opinion of the Court
fore the District Court to plead guilty to tax evasion, how-ever, the judge's colloquy with him went no further than

McCarthy's understanding of his right to a jury trial, theparticular sentencing possibilities, and the absence of any
threats or promises. There was no discussion of the ele-ments of the crime charged, or the facts that might support
it. Indeed, despite the allegation that McCarthy had acted
"willfully and knowingly," his lawyer consistently argued atthe sentencing hearing that his client had merely been neglectful, ibid. Although defense counsel raised no objectionto the trial court's deficient practice under Rule 11, this
Court reversed the conviction on direct review. The Court
rested the result solely on the trial judge's obvious failure to
conform to the Rule, id., at 464, and emphasized that the
Rule's procedural safeguards served important constitutional interests in guarding against inadvertent and ignorant
waivers of constitutional rights, id., at 465. Although the
Government asked to have the case remanded for further
evidentiary hearing and an opportunity to show that McCarthy's plea had been made knowingly and voluntarily, the
Court said no and ordered the plea and resulting conviction
vacated.

Vonn does not, of course, claim that McCarthy held that a
silent defendant had no plain-error burden, but he says that
this must have been the Court's understanding, or it would
have taken McCarthy's failure to object to the trial judge's
Rule 11 failings, combined with his failure to meet the requirements of the plain-error rule, as a bar to relief. This
reasoning is unsound, however, for two reasons, the first
being that not a word was said in McCarthy about the plainerror rule, or for that matter about harmless error. The
opinion said nothing about Rule 52 or either of the rules by
name. The parties' briefs said nothing. The only serious
issue was raised by the Government's request to remand the
case for a new evidentiary hearing on McCarthy's state of
mind when he entered the plea, and not even this had any535US1 Unit: $U29 [09-23-03 08:53:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
thing to do with either the harmless- or plain-error rule.Under the former, the Government's opportunity and burden

is to show the error harmless based on the entire recordbefore the reviewing court, see

United States v. Hasting, 461
U. S. 499, 509, n. 7 (1983); under the plain-error rule the Gov-ernment likewise points to parts of the record to counter any

ostensible showing of prejudice the defendant may make, see
United States v. Young, 470 U. S. 1, 16 (1985). Under eitherrule, the Government's opportunity is to persuade with what

it has, not to initiate further litigation. Yet further litiga-tion is what the Government wanted in

McCarthy. It argued that if the Court did not think that the existing record
demonstrated that McCarthy's plea had been knowing and
voluntary, the Court should remand for a further hearing
with new evidence affirmatively making this showing, 394
U. S., at 469. When the Court said no, it made no reference
to harmless or plain error, but cited the object of Rule 11
to eliminate time-wasting litigation after the fact about how
knowing and voluntary a defendant really had been at an
earlier hearing. Id., at 469-470. And it expressed intense
skepticism that any defendant would succeed, no matter how
little he understood, once the evidence at a subsequent hearing showed that he had desired to plead. Id., at 469. In
sum, McCarthy had nothing to do with the choice between
harmless-error and plain-error review; the issue was simply
whether the Government could extend the litigation for additional evidence.

Vonn's attempt to read the McCarthy Court's mind is
therefore purely speculative. What is worse, however, his
speculation is less plausible than the view that the Court
would probably have held that McCarthy satisfied the plainerror burdens if that had mattered. There was no question
that the trial judge had failed to observe Rule 11, and the
failing was obvious. So was the prejudice to McCarthy.
Having had no explanation from the judge of the knowing
and willful state of mind charged as of the time of the tax

Opinion of the Court
violation, he pleaded guilty and was later sentenced at ahearing in which his lawyer repeatedly represented that McCarthy had been guilty of nothing but sloppiness.8 The con-tradiction between the plea and the denial of the mental
state alleged bespoke the prejudice of an unknowing plea, towhich the judge's indifference was an affront to the integrity
of the judicial system. While we need not religitate or re-write

McCarthy at this point, it is safe to say that the actualopinion is not even speculative authority that the plain-error

rule stops short of Rule 11 errors.Nor is there any persuasive reason to think that when the
Advisory Committee and Congress later came to considerRule 11(h) they accepted the view Vonn erroneously attributes to this Court in McCarthy. The attention of the Advi-sory Committee to the problem of Rule 11 error was not
drawn by McCarthy so much as by events that subsequentlyinvested that case with a significance beyond its holding. In
1975, a few years after McCarthy came down, Congresstransformed Rule 11 into a detailed formula for testing a
defendant's readiness to proceed to enter a plea of guilty,obliging the judge to give specified advice about the charge,
the applicable criminal statute, and even collateral law. TheCourt in

McCarthy had, for example, been content to saythat a defendant would need to know of the right against

self-incrimination and rights to jury trial and confrontationbefore he could knowingly plead. But the 1975 revision of
Rule 11 required instruction on such further matters ascross-examination in addition to confrontation, see Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3); the right to counsel "at . . . trial" evenwhen the defendant stood in court with a lawyer next to him
(as in this case), see ibid.; and even the consequences of any

8 Nor did McCarthy claim that the guilty plea should be accepted on the
Alford theory that a defendant may plead guilty while protesting innocence when he makes a conscious choice to plead simply to avoid the expenses or vicissitudes of trial. North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U. S. 25

Opinion of the Court
perjury the defendant might commit at the plea hearing, see
Rule 11(c)(5).

Although the details newly required in Rule 11 colloquies
did not necessarily equate to the importance of the overarching issues of knowledge and voluntariness already addressed
in the earlier versions of the Rule, some Courts of Appeals
felt bound to treat all Rule 11 lapses as equal and to read
McCarthy as mandating automatic reversal for any one of
them. See Advisory Committee's Notes on 1983 Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 1568
(hereinafter Advisory Committee's Notes) (citing United
States v. Boone, 543 F. 2d 1090 (CA4 1976); United States v.
Journet, 544 F. 2d 633 (CA2 1976)). This approach imposed
a cost on Rule 11 mistakes that McCarthy neither required
nor justified, and by 1983 the practice of automatic reversal
for error threatening little prejudice to a defendant or disgrace to the legal system prompted further revision of Rule
11. Advisory Committee's Notes 1568.

The Advisory Committee reasoned that, although a rule of
per se reversal might have been justified at the time McCarthy was decided, "[a]n inevitable consequence of the 1975
amendments was some increase in the risk that a trial judge,
in a particular case, might inadvertently deviate to some degree from the procedure which a very literal reading of Rule
11 would appear to require." Advisory Committee's Notes
1568. After the amendments, "it became more apparent
than ever that Rule 11 should not be given such a crabbed
interpretation that ceremony was exalted over substance."
Ibid.

Vonn thinks the Advisory Committee's report also includes
a signal that it meant to dispense with a silent defendant's
plain-error burdens. He stresses that the report cited
Courts of Appeals cases of "crabbed interpretation" that had
given relief to nonobjecting defendants. By proposing only
a harmless-error amendment to correct the mistakes made

71Cite as: 535 U. S. 55 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
in these cases, he says, the Committee must have thought
that the Government's only answer to nonobjecting defendants should be to prove error harmless, if it could. But this
argument ignores the fact that these cases were not merely
instances of automatic reversal, but were cited along with
harmless-error cases as illustrations of the "considerable disagreement" that arose after McCarthy among Courts of Appeals in treating errors of trivial significance. See Advisory
Committee's Notes 1568. Given the Advisory Committee's
apparent focus on the disarray among courts, the citations
Vonn points to cannot reliably be read to suggest that plainerror review should never apply to Rule 11 errors, when the
Advisory Committee Notes never made such an assertion
and the reported cases cited by the Committee never mentioned the plain-error/harmless-error distinction.

We think, rather, that the significance of Congress's choice
to adopt a harmless-error rule is best understood by taking
the Advisory Committee at its word. "It must . . . be emphasized that a harmless error provision has been added to
Rule 11 because some courts have read McCarthy as meaning that the general harmless error provision in Rule 52(a)
cannot be utilized with respect to Rule 11 proceedings."
Id., at 1569. The Committee said it was responding simply to a claim that the harmless-error rule did not apply.
Having pinpointed that problem, it gave a pinpoint answer.
If instead the Committee had taken note of claims that
"Rule 52" did not apply, or that "neither harmless-error nor

plain-error rule applied," one could infer that enacting a
harmless-error rule and nothing more was meant to rule out
anything but harmless-error treatment. But by providing
for harmless-error review in response to nothing more than
the claim that harmless-error review would itself be erroneous, the Advisory Committee implied nothing more than it
said, and it certainly did not implicitly repeal Rule 52(b) so
far as it might cover a Rule 11 case.

72 UNITED STATES v. VONN

Opinion of the Court

C
A further reason to doubt that Congress could have intended Vonn's position is the tendency it would have to
undercut the object of Rule 32(e), which governs withdrawing a plea of guilty by creating an incentive to file withdrawal motions before sentence, not afterward. A trial
judge is authorized to grant such a presentence motion if
the defendant carries the burden of showing a "fair and just
reason" for withdrawal, and a defendant who fails to move
for withdrawal before sentencing has no further recourse except "direct appeal or . . . motion under 28 U. S. C. 2255,"
subject to the rules covering those later stages. Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 32(e). Whatever the "fair and just" standard
may require on presentence motions,9 the Advisory Committee Notes confirm the textual suggestion that the Rule
creates a " `near-presumption' " against granting motions
filed after sentencing, Advisory Committee's Notes on 1983
Amendment to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32, 18 U. S. C. App.,
p. 1621 (quoting United States v. Barker, 514 F. 2d 208, 219
(CADC 1975)). This is only good sense; in acting as an
incentive to think through a guilty plea before sentence is
imposed, the Rule tends to separate meritorious second
thoughts (say, a defendant's doubts about his understanding)
and mere sour grapes over a sentence once pronounced.
The "near-presumption" concentrates plea litigation in the
trial courts, where genuine mistakes can be corrected easily,
and promotes the finality required in a system as heavily
dependent on guilty pleas as ours.

9 The Courts of Appeals have held that a Rule 11 violation that is harmless under Rule 11(h) does not rise to the level of a "fair and just reason"
for withdrawing a guilty plea. See United States v. Driver, 242 F. 3d 767,
769 (CA7 2001) ("Even an established violation of Rule 11 can be harmless
error . . . and thus not a `fair and just reason' to return to Square One");
United States v. Siegel, 102 F. 3d 477, 481 (CA11 1996); United States v.
Martinez-Molina, 64 F. 3d 719, 734 (CA1 1995).

Opinion of the Court
But the incentive to think and act early when Rule 11 isat stake would prove less substantial if Vonn's position were

law; a defendant could choose to say nothing about a judge'splain lapse under Rule 11 until the moment of taking a direct
appeal, at which time the burden would always fall on theGovernment to prove harmlessness. A defendant could
simply relax and wait to see if the sentence later struck himas satisfactory; if not, his Rule 11 silence would have left
him with clear but uncorrected Rule 11 error to place onthe Government's shoulders. This result might, perhaps, be
sufferable if there were merit in Vonn's objection that apply-ing the plain-error standard to a defendant who stays mum
on Rule 11 error invites the judge to relax. The plain-errorrule, he says, would discount the judge's duty to advise the
defendant by obliging the defendant to advise the judge.But, rhetoric aside, that is always the point of the plain-error
rule: the value of finality requires defense counsel to be onhis toes, not just the judge, and the defendant who just sits
there when a mistake can be fixed cannot just sit there whenhe speaks up later on.

10

10 Contrary to Justice Stevens's suggestion, post, at 78-80 (opinion
concurring in part and dissenting in part), there is nothing "perverse"
about conditioning the Government's harmless-error burden on an objection when the judge commits Rule 11 error. A defendant's right to counsel on entering a guilty plea is expressly recognized in Rule 11(c)(2), and
counsel is obliged to understand the Rule 11 requirements. It is fair to
burden the defendant with his lawyer's obligation to do what is reasonably
necessary to render the guilty plea effectual and to refrain from trifling
with the court. It therefore makes sense to require counsel to call a Rule
11 failing to the court's attention. It is perfectly true that an uncounseled
defendant may not, in fact, know enough to spot a Rule 11 error, but when
a defendant chooses self-representation after a warning from the court of
the perils this entails, see Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 835 (1975),
Rule 11 silence is one of the perils he assumes. Any other approach is at
odds with Congress's object in adopting Rule 11, recognized in McCarthy
v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 465 (1969), to combat defendants' "often
frivolous" attacks on the validity of their guilty pleas, by aiding the district judge in determining whether the defendant's plea was knowing and

74 UNITED STATES v. VONN

Opinion of the Court
In sum, there are good reasons to doubt that expressing aharmless-error standard in Rule 11(h) was meant to carry

any implication beyond its terms. At the very least, thereis no reason persuasive enough to think 11(h) was intended
to repeal Rule 52(b) for every Rule 11 case.

III
The final question goes to the scope of an appellate court'senquiry into the effect of a Rule 11 violation, whatever the

review, plain error or harmless. The Court of Appeals con-fined itself to considering the record of "the plea proceeding," 224 F. 3d, at 1156, applying Circuit precedent recogniz-ing that the best evidence of a defendant's understanding
when pleading guilty is the colloquy closest to the momenthe enters the plea. While there is no doubt that this position serves the object of Rule 11 to eliminate wasteful posthoc probes into a defendant's psyche, McCarthy, 394 U. S., at
470, the Court of Appeals was more zealous than the policybehind the Rule demands. The Advisory Committee intended the effect of error to be assessed on an existing rec-ord, no question, but it did not mean to limit that record
strictly to the plea proceedings: the enquiry " `must be re-solved solely on the basis of the Rule 11 transcript' and the
other portions (e. g., sentencing hearing) of the limited recordmade in such cases." Advisory Committee's Notes 1569
(quoting United States v. Coronado, 554 F. 2d 166, 170, n. 5(CA5 1977)).

True, language in McCarthy ostensibly supports the posi-tion taken by the Court of Appeals (which did not, however,
rest on it); we admonished that "[t]here is no adequate substivoluntary and creating a record at the time of the plea supporting that
decision.

Vonn's final retort that application of the plain-error rule would tend to
leave some "unconstitutional pleas" uncorrected obviates the question in
this case, which is who bears the burden of proving that Rule 11 error did
or did not prejudice the defendant: the Government or the defendant?

Opinion of the Court
tute for demonstrating in the record at the time the plea is
entered the defendant's understanding of the nature of the
charge against him," 394 U. S., at 470 (emphasis in original).But

McCarthy was decided before the enactment of Rule
11(h), which came with the commentary just quoted, and McCarthy in any event was not a case with a record of anything
on point, even outside the Rule 11 hearing. The Government responded to the laconic plea colloquy not by referringto anything illuminating in the record; instead it brought up

the indictment, tried to draw speculative inferences fromconversations McCarthy probably had with his lawyer, and
sought to present new evidence. The only serious alternative to "the record at the time the plea [was] entered" was an
evidentiary hearing for further factfinding by the trial court.

Here, however, there is a third source of information, outside the four corners of the transcript of the plea hearing
and Rule 11 colloquy, but still part of the record. Transcripts brought to our attention show that Vonn was advised
of his right to trial counsel during his initial appearance before the Magistrate Judge and twice at his first arraignment.
The record shows that four times either Vonn or his counsel
affirmed that Vonn had heard or read a statement of his
rights and understood what they were. Because there are
circumstances in which defendants may be presumed to recall information provided to them prior to the plea proceeding, cf. Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 618 (1998) (a
defendant with a copy of his indictment before pleading
guilty is presumed to know the nature of the charge against
him), the record of Vonn's initial appearance and arraignment
is relevant in fact, and well within the Advisory Committee's
understanding of "other portions . . . of the limited record"
that should be open to consideration. It may be considered here.

The transcripts covering Vonn's first appearance and arraignment were not, however, presented to the Court of Appeals. Probably owing to that court's self-confinement to a

narrower record, it made no express ruling on the part of
the Government's rehearing motion requesting to make the
first-appearance and arraignment transcripts part of the appellate record. For that reason, even with the transcripts
now in the parties' joint appendix filed with us, we should
not resolve their bearing on Vonn's claim before the Court
of Appeals has done so. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103 (2001).

We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals's judgment and
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

For the reasons stated in Part III of the Court's opinion,
I agree that the effect of a violation of Rule 11 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure should be evaluated on the
basis of the entire record, rather than just the record of the
plea colloquy, and that a remand is therefore required. Contrary to the Court's analysis in Part II of its opinion, however, I am firmly convinced that the history, the text of Rule
11, and the special office of the Rule all support the conclusion, "urged by the Government" in McCarthy v. United
States, 394 U. S. 459, 469 (1969), that the burden of demonstrating that a violation of that Rule is harmless is "place[d]
upon the Government," ibid.

In McCarthy, after deciding that the trial judge had not
complied with Rule 11, the Court had to "determine the effect of that noncompliance, an issue that ha[d] engendered a
sharp difference . . . among the courts of appeals." Id., at
468. The two alternatives considered by those courts were
the automatic reversal rule that we ultimately unanimously
endorsed in McCarthy and the harmless-error rule urged by

the Government.1 No one even argued that the defendantshould have the burden of proving prejudice.

2 The Court's

conclusion that "prejudice inheres in a failure to comply withRule 11" was uncontroversial.

3 Id., at 471.

During the years preceding the 1983 amendment to Rule11, it was generally understood that noncompliance with

Rule 11 in direct appeal cases required automatic reversal.See Advisory Committee's Notes on 1983 Amendments to
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 1568 (herein-after Advisory Committee's Notes) (citing

United States v.Boone, 543 F. 2d 1090 (CA4 1976); United States v. Journet,

544 F. 2d 633 (CA2 1976)). Thus, prior to the addition ofRule 11(h), neither plain-error

4 nor harmless-error review

applied to Rule 11 violations. Rejecting McCarthy's "ex1 McCarthy was decided 15 years after the adoption of Rule 52, and yet
neither the parties nor the Court discussed the application of that Rule
despite the fact that the defendant had failed to object to the Rule 11
error.

2 Nor did the Government make such an argument in the Court of Appeals in this case. That should be a sufficient reason for refusing to consider the argument here, see United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36,
55-61 (1992) (Stevens, J., dissenting), but, as in Williams, the Court finds
it appropriate to accord "a special privilege for the Federal Government,"
id., at 59.

3 "We thus conclude that prejudice inheres in a failure to comply with

Rule 11, for noncompliance deprives the defendant of the Rule's procedural
safeguards that are designed to facilitate a more accurate determination
of the voluntariness of his plea." McCarthy, 394 U. S., at 471-472.
Not a word in the proceedings that led to the amendment rejecting the
automatic reversal remedy questioned the validity of the proposition
that every violation of the Rule is presumptively prejudicial. The amendment merely gives the Government the opportunity to overcome that
presumption.

4 Rule 52(b) states: "Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights

may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the
court." When a court reviews for plain error, the burden is on the defendant to show that the error affected his substantial rights. United
States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734-735 (1993).

treme sanction of automatic reversal" for technical violations, Congress added subsection 11(h), which closely tracks
the harmless-error language of Rule 52(a).5 Advisory Committee's Notes 1569. As the Advisory Committee's Notes
make clear, "Subdivision (h) makes no change in the responsibilities of the judge at Rule 11 proceedings, but instead
merely rejects the extreme sanction of automatic reversal."
Ibid. (emphasis deleted and added). The plain text thus embodies Congress' choice of incorporating the standard found
in Rule 52(a), while omitting that of Rule 52(b).6 Because
the pre-existing background of Rule 11 was that Rule 52(b)
did not apply, and because the amendment adding Rule 52(a)
via subsection (h) did not also add Rule 52(b), the straightforward conclusion is that plain-error review does not apply
to Rule 11 errors.

Congress' decision to apply only Rule 52(a)'s harmlesserror standard to Rule 11 errors is tailored to the purpose
of the Rule. The very premise of the required Rule 11 colloquy is that, even if counsel is present, the defendant may not
adequately understand the rights set forth in the Rule unless
the judge explains them. It is thus perverse to place the
burden on the uninformed defendant to object to deviations
from Rule 11 or to establish prejudice arising out of the
judge's failure to mention a right that he does not know he

5 Rule 52(a) states: "Harmless error. Any error, defect, irregularity or
variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."
Rule 11(h) states: "Harmless error. Any variance from the procedures
required by this rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be
disregarded."

6 The Court incorrectly asserts that this is an argument for repeal by

implication of Rule 52(b). Ante, at 65 ("To hold that the terms of Rule
11(h) imply that the latter half of Rule 52 has no application to Rule 11
errors would consequently amount to finding a partial repeal of Rule 52(b)
by implication, a result sufficiently disfavored"). This ignores the fact
that prior to the enactment of Rule 11(h), courts applied neither Rule 52(a)
nor (b) to Rule 11 violations.

has.7 Under the Court's approach, the Government bearsthe burden of establishing no harm only when the defendant

objects to the district court's failure to inform him. In otherwords, the Government must show prejudice only when the
defendant asks the judge to advise him of a right of whichthe Rule 11 colloquy assumes he is unaware. To see the
implausibility of this, imagine what such an objection wouldsound like: "Your Honor, I object to your failure to inform
me of my right to assistance of counsel if I proceed to trial."Despite this implausible scenario, and to support the result
that it reaches, the Court's analysis relies upon an image ofa cunning defendant, who is fully knowledgeable of his
rights, and who games the system by sitting silently as thedistrict court, apparently less knowledgeable than the defendant, slips up in following the dictates of Rule 11. See,
e. g., ante, at 63 ("[A] defendant loses nothing by failing to

7 The Court states that this is like any other application of the plainerror rule as it is applied to all trial errors. Ante, at 73 ("The plain-error
rule, [Vonn] says, would discount the judge's duty to advise the defendant
by obliging the defendant to advise the judge. But, rhetoric aside, that
is always the point of the plain-error rule . . ."). Unlike most rules that
apply to a trial, however, the special purpose of the Rule 11 colloquy is
to provide information to a defendant prior to accepting his plea. Given
this purpose, it is inconceivable that Congress intended the same rules
for review of noncompliance to apply. A parallel example from the
self-representation context illustrates this point. Pursuant to Faretta v.
California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975), a defendant who wishes to represent himself must "be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation," id., at 835. Assume a defendant states that he wishes to
proceed pro se, and the trial judge makes no attempt to warn the defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. If the defendant makes no objection to the trial court's failure to warn, surely we
would not impose a plain-error review standard upon this nonobjecting
defendant. This is so because the assumption of Faretta's warning requirement is that the defendant is unaware of the dangers. It is illogical
in this context, as in the Rule 11 context, to require the presumptively
unknowing defendant to object to the court's failure to adequately inform.
Congress' decision to apply the harmless-error standard to all Rule 11
errors surely reflects this logic.

object to obvious Rule 11 error when it occurs"); ante, at 73("[A] defendant could choose to say nothing about a judge's

plain lapse under Rule 11 until the moment of taking a directappeal, at which time the burden would always fall on the
Government to prove harmlessness. A defendant couldsimply relax and wait to see if the sentence later struck him
as satisfactory"). My analysis is based on a fundamentallydifferent understanding of the considerations that motivated
the Rule 11 colloquy requirements in the first place.Namely, in light of the gravity of a plea, the court will assume no knowledge on the part of the defendant, even ifrepresented by counsel, and the court must inform him of a
base level of information before accepting his plea.8The express inclusion in Rule 11 of a counterpart to Rule
52(a) and the omission of a counterpart to Rule 52(b) is bestunderstood as a reflection of the fact that it is only fair to
place the burden of proving the impact of the judge's erroron the party who is aware of it rather than the party who
is unaware of it. This burden allocation gives incentive tothe judge to follow meticulously the Rule 11 requirements
and to the prosecutor to correct Rule 11 errors at the timeof the colloquy. The Court's approach undermines those
incentives.I would remand to the Court of Appeals to determine
whether, taking account of the entire record, the Govern-ment has met its burden of establishing that the District
Court's failure to inform the respondent of his right to coun-sel at trial was harmless.

8 See Kercheval v. United States, 274 U. S. 220, 223 (1927) ("A plea of
guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extrajudicial confession; it is itself a conviction. . . . Out of just consideration
for persons accused of crime, courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall
not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full
understanding of the consequences").

Syllabus

RAGSDALE et al. v. WOLVERINEWORLD WIDE, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 00-6029. Argued January 7, 2002--Decided March 19, 2002
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or Act) guarantees

qualifying employees 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year and encourages businesses to adopt more generous policies. Respondent Wolverine World Wide, Inc., granted petitioner Ragsdale 30 weeks of medical
leave under its more generous policy in 1996. It refused her request
for additional leave or permission to work part time and terminated
her when she did not return to work. She filed suit, alleging that 29
CFR $ 825.700(a), a Labor Department regulation, required Wolverine
to grant her 12 additional weeks of leave because it had not informed
her that the 30-week absence would count against her FMLA entitlement. The District Court granted Wolverine summary judgment, finding that the regulation was in conflict with the statute and invalid because it required Wolverine to grant Ragsdale more than 12 weeks of
FMLA-compliant leave in one year. The Eighth Circuit agreed.

Held: Section 825.700(a) is contrary to the Act and beyond the Secretary

of Labor's authority. Pp. 86-96.

(a) To determine whether $ 825.700(a) is a valid exercise of the Secretary's authority to issue regulations necessary to carry out the FMLA,
see 29 U. S. C. $ 2654, this Court must consult the Act, viewing it as a
"symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme," Gustafson v. Alloyd
Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569. Among other things, the Act subjects an employer that interferes with, restrains, or denies the exercise of an employee's FMLA rights, $ 2615(a)(1), to consequential damages and equitable relief, $ 2617(a)(1); and requires the employer to post a notice
of FMLA rights on its premises, $ 2619(a). The Secretary's regulations require, in addition, that an employer give employees written notice that an absence will be considered FMLA leave. 29 CFR $ 825.208.
Even assuming that this regulatory requirement is valid, the Secretary's categorical penalty for its breach is contrary to the Act. Section
825.700(a) punishes an employer's failure to provide timely notice of the
FMLA designation by denying the employer any credit for leave
granted before the notice, and the penalty is unconnected to any prejudice the employee might have suffered from the employer's lapse. The
employee will be entitled to 12 additional weeks of leave even if he or

she would have acted in the same manner had notice been given and
can sue if not granted the additional leave. Pp. 86-89.

(b) This penalty is incompatible with the FMLA's remedial mechanism. To prevail under $ 2617, an employee must prove that the employer violated $ 2615 by interfering with, restraining, or denying the
exercise of FMLA rights. Even then, $ 2617 provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation. In contrast,

$ 825.700(a) establishes an irrebuttable presumption that the employee's exercise of FMLA rights was restrained. There is no empirical
or logical basis for this presumption, as the facts of this case demonstrate. Ragsdale has not shown that she would have taken less, or
intermittent, leave had she received the required notice. In fact her
physician did not clear her to work until long after her 30-week leave
period had ended. Blind to the reality that she would have taken the
entire 30-week absence even had Wolverine complied with the notice
regulations, $ 825.700(a) required the company to give her 12 more
weeks and rendered it liable under $ 2617 when it denied her request
and terminated her. The regulation fundamentally alters the FMLA's
cause of action by relieving employees of the burden of proving any
real impairment of their rights and resulting prejudice. The Government claims that its categorical rule is easier to administer than a
fact-specific inquiry, but Congress chose a remedy requiring the retrospective, case-by-case examination the Secretary now seeks to eliminate. The regulation instructs courts to ignore $ 2617's command that
employees prove impairment of their statutory rights and resulting
harm. Agencies are not authorized to contravene Congress' will in this
manner. Cf. Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U. S.
356. Pp. 89-92.

(c) Section 825.700(a) would be an unreasonable choice even if the
Secretary were authorized to circumvent the FMLA's remedial provisions for the sake of administrative convenience. Categorical rules
reflect broad generalizations holding true in so many cases that inquiry into whether they apply to the case at hand would be needless and wasteful. However, when the generalizations fail to hold in
the run of cases, as is true here, the justification for the categorical
rule disappears. See, e. g., State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 8-22.
Pp. 92-93.

(d) Inasmuch as the Secretary's penalty will have no substantial relation to the harm to the employee in the run of cases, it also amends
the FMLA's fundamental guarantee of entitlement to a "total" of 12
weeks of leave in a 12-month period, a compromise between employers
who wanted fewer weeks and employees who wanted more. Courts

and agencies must respect and give effect to such compromises. However, the Secretary's penalty subverts this balance by entitling certain
employees to leave beyond the statutory mandate. Pp. 93-94.

(e) That the penalty is disproportionate and inconsistent with Congress' intent is also evident from $ 2619, which assesses a $100 fine for
an employer's willful failure to post a general notice. In contrast, the
regulation establishes a much heavier sanction for any violation of the
Secretary's supplemental notice requirement. P. 95.

(f) Section 825.700(a) is also in considerable tension with the statute's
admonition that nothing in the Act should discourage employers from
adopting more generous policies. Congress was well aware that the
more generous employers, discouraged by technical rules and burdensome administrative requirements, might be pushed down to the Act's
minimum standard, yet $ 825.700(a)'s severe, across-the-board penalty is
directed at such employers. Pp. 95-96.

(g) In holding that the bounds of the Secretary's discretion to issue
regulations were exceeded here, this Court does not decide whether the
notice and designation requirements are themselves valid or whether
other remedies for their breach might be consistent with the statute.

84 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Qualifying employees are guaranteed 12 weeks of un-paid leave each year by the Family and Medical Leave Act

of 1993 (FMLA or Act), 107 Stat. 6, as amended, 29 U. S. C.$ 2601

et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V). The Act encouragesbusinesses to adopt more generous policies, and many employers have done so. Respondent Wolverine World Wide,Inc., for example, granted petitioner Tracy Ragsdale 30
weeks of leave when cancer kept her out of work in 1996.Ragsdale nevertheless brought suit under the FMLA. She
alleged that because Wolverine was in technical violationof certain Labor Department regulations, she was entitled
to more leave.One of these regulations, 29 CFR $ 825.700(a) (2001), did
support Ragsdale's claim. It required the company to granther 12 more weeks of leave because it had not informed her
that the 30-week absence would count against her FMLAentitlement. We hold that the regulation is contrary to the
Act and beyond the Secretary of Labor's authority. Rags-dale was entitled to no more leave, and Wolverine was entitled to summary judgment.

I
Ragsdale began working at a Wolverine factory in 1995,but in the following year she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's

disease. Her prescribed treatment involved surgery andmonths of radiation therapy. Though unable to work during
this time, she was eligible for seven months of unpaid sickleave under Wolverine's leave plan. Ragsdale requested

Opinion of the Court
and received a 1-month leave of absence on February 21,1996, and asked for a 30-day extension at the end of each

of the seven months that followed. Wolverine granted thefirst six requests, and Ragsdale missed 30 consecutive weeks
of work. Her position with the company was held openthroughout, and Wolverine maintained her health benefits
and paid her premiums during the first six months of her
absence. Wolverine did not notify her, however, that 12weeks of the absence would count as her FMLA leave.

In September, Ragsdale sought a seventh 30-day exten-sion, but Wolverine advised her that she had exhausted her
seven months under the company plan. Her condition persisted, so she requested more leave or permission to work
on a part-time basis. Wolverine refused and terminated her
when she did not come back to work.

Ragsdale filed suit in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Her claim relied on
the Secretary's regulation, which provides that if an employee takes medical leave "and the employer does not designate the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken does not
count against an employee's FMLA entitlement." 29 CFR

$ 825.700(a) (2001). The required designation had not been
made, so Ragsdale argued that her 30 weeks of leave did "not
count against [her] FMLA entitlement." Ibid. It followed
that when she was denied additional leave and terminated
after 30 weeks, the statute guaranteed her 12 more weeks.
She sought reinstatement, backpay, and other relief.

When the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, Wolverine conceded it had not given Ragsdale specific notice that part of her absence would count as FMLA
leave. It maintained, however, that it had complied with the
statute by granting her 30 weeks of leave--more than twice
what the Act required. The District Court granted summary judgment to Wolverine. In the court's view the regulation was in conflict with the statute and invalid because,
in effect, it required Wolverine to grant Ragsdale more than

12 weeks of FMLA-compliant leave in one year. The Courtof Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed. 218 F. 3d 933

(2000).We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 928 (2001), and now affirm.

II
Wolverine's challenge concentrates on the validity of asingle sentence in $ 825.700(a). This provision is but a small

part of the administrative structure the Secretary devisedpursuant to Congress' directive to issue regulations "necessary to carry out" the Act. 29 U. S. C. $ 2654 (1994 ed.).The Secretary's judgment that a particular regulation fits
within this statutory constraint must be given consider-able weight. See

United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642,673 (1997) (citing Batterton v. Francis, 432 U. S. 416, 424-426

(1977)). Our deference to the Secretary, however, has im-portant limits: A regulation cannot stand if it is " `arbitrary,
capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.' " UnitedStates v. O'Hagan, supra, at 673 (quoting Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.837, 844 (1984)). To determine whether $ 825.700(a) is a
valid exercise of the Secretary's authority, we must consultthe Act, viewing it as a "symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme." Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 569(1995).

The FMLA's central provision guarantees eligible em-ployees 12 weeks of leave in a 1-year period following certain events: a disabling health problem; a family member'sserious illness; or the arrival of a new son or daughter. 29
U. S. C. $ 2612(a)(1). During the mandatory 12 weeks, theemployer must maintain the employee's group health coverage. $ 2614(c)(1). Leave must be granted, when "medi-cally necessary," on an intermittent or part-time basis.

$ 2612(b)(1). Upon the employee's timely return, the em-ployer must reinstate the employee to his or her former position or an equivalent. $ 2614(a)(1). The Act makes it un535US1 Unit: $U30 [09-18-03 15:25:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

87Cite as: 535 U. S. 81 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
lawful for an employer to "interfere with, restrain, or deny
the exercise of " these rights, $ 2615(a)(1), and violators are
subject to consequential damages and appropriate equitable
relief, $ 2617(a)(1).

A number of employers have adopted policies with terms
far more generous than the statute requires. Congress encouraged as much, mandating in the Act's penultimate provision that "[n]othing in this Act . . . shall be construed
to discourage employers from adopting or retaining leave
policies more generous than any policies that comply with
the requirements under this Act." $ 2653. Some employers, like Wolverine, allow more than the 12-week annual
minimum; others offer paid leave. U. S. Dept. of Labor,
D. Cantor et al., Balancing the Needs of Families and Employers: Family and Medical Leave Surveys 5-10, 5-12 (2001)
(22.9% of FMLA-covered establishments allow more than 12
weeks of leave per year; 62.7% provide paid disability leave).
As long as these policies meet the Act's minimum requirements, leave taken may be counted toward the 12 weeks
guaranteed by the FMLA. See 60 Fed. Reg. 2230 (1995)
("[E]mployers may designate paid leave as FMLA leave and
offset the maximum entitlements under the employer's more
generous policies").

With this statutory structure in place, the Secretary issued regulations requiring employers to inform their workers about the relationship between the FMLA and leave
granted under company plans. The regulations make it the
employer's responsibility to tell the employee that an absence will be considered FMLA leave. 29 CFR $ 825.208(a)
(2001). Employers must give written notice of the designation, along with detailed information concerning the employee's rights and responsibilities under the Act, "within a
reasonable time after notice of the need for leave is given by
the employee--within one or two business days if feasible."

88 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
The regulations are in addition to a notice provision ex-plicitly set out in the statute. Section 2619(a) requires employers to "keep posted, in conspicuous places . . . , a no-tice . . . setting forth excerpts from, or summaries of, the
pertinent provisions of this subchapter and informationpertaining to the filing of a charge." According to the Secretary, the more comprehensive and individualized notice
required by the regulations is necessary to ensure that em-ployees are aware of their rights when they take leave.

See 60 Fed. Reg. 2220 (1995). We need not decide todaywhether this conclusion accords with the text and structure
of the FMLA, or whether Congress has instead "spoken tothe precise question" of notice,

Chevron, supra, at 842, and
so foreclosed the notice regulations. Even assuming the ad-ditional notice requirement is valid, the categorical penalty

the Secretary imposes for its breach is contrary to the Act'sremedial design.

The penalty is set out in a separate regulation, $ 825.700,which is entitled "What if an employer provides more generous benefits than required by the FMLA?" This is the
sentence on which Ragsdale relies:

"If an employee takes paid or unpaid leave and the em-ployer does not designate the leave as FMLA leave, the

leave taken does not count against an employee's FMLA
entitlement." 29 CFR $ 825.700(a) (2001).

This provision punishes an employer's failure to providetimely notice of the FMLA designation by denying it any

credit for leave granted before the notice. The penalty isunconnected to any prejudice the employee might have suffered from the employer's lapse. If the employee takes an
undesignated absence of 12 weeks or more, the regulation
always gives him or her the right to 12 more weeks of leave
that year. The fact that the employee would have acted in
the same manner if notice had been given is, in the Secretary's view, irrelevant. Indeed, as we understand the Sec535US1 Unit: $U30 [09-18-03 15:25:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

89Cite as: 535 U. S. 81 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
retary's position, the employer would be required to grantthe added 12 weeks even if the employee had full knowledge of the FMLA and expected the absence to count againstthe 12-week entitlement. An employer who denies the employee this additional leave will be deemed to have violatedthe employee's rights under $ 2615 and so will be liable for
damages and equitable relief under $ 2617.

The categorical penalty is incompatible with the FMLA'scomprehensive remedial mechanism. To prevail under the

cause of action set out in $ 2617, an employee must prove,as a threshold matter, that the employer violated $ 2615 by
interfering with, restraining, or denying his or her exercise
of FMLA rights. Even then, $ 2617 provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation: The
employer is liable only for compensation and benefits lost
"by reason of the violation," $ 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I), for other
monetary losses sustained "as a direct result of the violation," $ 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(II), and for "appropriate" equitable
relief, including employment, reinstatement, and promotion,

$ 2617(a)(1)(B). The remedy is tailored to the harm suffered.
Cf. EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 292-293 (2002)
(provisions in Title VII stating that plaintiffs "may recover"
damages and "appropriate" equitable relief "refer to the trial
judge's discretion in a particular case to order reinstatement
and award damages in an amount warranted by the facts of
that case").

Section 825.700(a), Ragsdale contends, reflects the Secretary's understanding that an employer's failure to comply
with the designation requirement might sometimes burden
an employee's exercise of basic FMLA rights in violation
of $ 2615. Consider, for instance, the right under $ 2612(b)(1)
to take intermittent leave when medically necessary. An
employee who undergoes cancer treatments every other
week over the course of 12 weeks might want to work during the off weeks, earning a paycheck and saving six weeks
for later. If she is not informed that her absence qualifies

90 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
as FMLA leave--and if she does not know of her right underthe statute to take intermittent leave--she might take all

12 of her FMLA-guaranteed weeks consecutively and haveno leave remaining for some future emergency. In circumstances like these, Ragsdale argues, the employer's failureto give the notice required by the regulation could be said
to "deny," "restrain," or "interfere with" the employee's
exercise of her right to take intermittent leave.This position may be reasonable, but the more extreme

one embodied in $ 825.700(a) is not. The penalty provisiondoes not say that in certain situations an employer's failure
to make the designation will violate $ 2615 and entitle the
employee to additional leave. Rather, the regulation establishes an irrebuttable presumption that the employee's exercise of FMLA rights was impaired--and that the employee
deserves 12 more weeks. There is no empirical or logical
basis for this presumption, as the facts of this case well
demonstrate. Ragsdale has not shown that she would have
taken less leave or intermittent leave if she had received
the required notice. As the Court of Appeals noted--and
Ragsdale did not dispute in her petition for certiorari--
"Ragsdale's medical condition rendered her unable to work
for substantially longer than the FMLA twelve-week period." 218 F. 3d, at 940. In fact her physician did not clear
her to work until December, long after her 30-week leave
period had ended. Even if Wolverine had complied with the
notice regulations, Ragsdale still would have taken the entire 30-week absence. Blind to this reality, the Secretary's
provision required the company to grant Ragsdale 12 more
weeks of leave--and rendered it liable under $ 2617 when it
denied her request and terminated her.

The challenged regulation is invalid because it alters the
FMLA's cause of action in a fundamental way: It relieves
employees of the burden of proving any real impairment of
their rights and resulting prejudice. In the case at hand,
the regulation permitted Ragsdale to bring suit under $ 2617,

535US1 Unit: $U30 [09-18-03 15:25:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

91Cite as: 535 U. S. 81 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
despite her inability to show that Wolverine's actions restrained her exercise of FMLA rights. Section 825.700(a)
transformed the company's failure to give notice--along with
its refusal to grant her more than 30 weeks of leave--into
an actionable violation of $ 2615. This regulatory sleight
of hand also entitled Ragsdale to reinstatement and backpay, even though reinstatement could not be said to be
"appropriate" in these circumstances and Ragsdale lost no
compensation "by reason of " Wolverine's failure to designate her absence as FMLA leave. By mandating these results absent a showing of consequential harm, the regulation
worked an end run around important limitations of the statute's remedial scheme.

In defense of the regulation, the Government notes that
a categorical penalty requiring the employer to grant more
leave is easier to administer than one involving a fact-specific
inquiry into what steps the employee would have taken had
the employer given the required notice. "Regardless of how
serious the problem an administrative agency seeks to address, however, it may not exercise its authority `in a manner
that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that
Congress enacted into law.' " FDA v. Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 125 (2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline Project v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 517 (1988)). By its
nature, the remedy created by Congress requires the retrospective, case-by-case examination the Secretary now seeks
to eliminate. The purpose of the cause of action is to permit
a court to inquire into matters such as whether the employee
would have exercised his or her FMLA rights in the absence
of the employer's actions. To determine whether damages
and equitable relief are appropriate under the FMLA, the
judge or jury must ask what steps the employee would
have taken had circumstances been different--considering,
for example, when the employee would have returned to
work after taking leave. Though the Secretary could not

92 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
enact rules purporting to make these kinds of determi-nations for the courts, $ 825.700(a) has this precise effect.

For this reason, the Government's reliance upon Mourningv.

Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U. S. 356 (1973),
is misplaced. Just as the FMLA does not itself require em-ployers to give individualized notice, see

supra, at 88, the
Truth in Lending Act did not itself require lenders to make
certain disclosures mandated by the regulation at issue in
Mourning. In sustaining the regulation, we observed that
the disclosure requirement was not contrary to the statuteand that the Federal Reserve Board's rulemaking authority

was much broader than the Secretary's is here. See 411
U. S., at 361-362 (quoting 15 U. S. C. $ 1604 (1970 ed.) (empowering the Board to issue regulations not only necessary
"to carry out the purposes of [the statute]," but also "necessary or proper . . . to prevent circumvention or evasion [of
the statute], or to facilitate compliance therewith")). The
crucial distinction, however, is that although we referred to
the Board's regulation as a "remedial measure," 411 U. S., at
371, the disclosure requirement was in fact enforced through
the statute's pre-existing remedial scheme and in a manner
consistent with it. The Board simply assessed violators the
$100 minimum statutory fine applicable to lenders who failed
to make required disclosures. See id., at 376. In contrast,

$ 825.700(a) enforces the individualized notice requirement
in a way that contradicts and undermines the FMLA's preexisting remedial scheme. While $ 2617 says that employees must prove impairment of their statutory rights and resulting harm, the Secretary's regulation instructs the courts
to ignore this command. Our previous decisions, Mourning
included, do not authorize agencies to contravene Congress'
will in this manner.

Furthermore, even if the Secretary were authorized to
reconfigure the FMLA's cause of action for her administrative convenience, this particular rule would be an unreasonable choice. As we have noted in other contexts, categorical

Opinion of the Court
rules--such as the rule of per se antitrust illegality--reflectbroad generalizations holding true in so many cases that

inquiry into whether they apply to the case at hand wouldbe needless and wasteful.

Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE
Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 50, n. 16 (1977); Eastman Kodak
Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U. S. 451, 486-487
(1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting). When the generalizations
fail to hold in the run of cases--when, for example, a particu-lar restraint of trade does not usually present a pronounced

risk of injury to competition--the justification for the cate-gorical rule disappears. See,

e. g., State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522
U. S. 3, 8-22 (1997) (rejecting per se ban on vertical maximum price fixing). That said, the generalization made by
the Secretary's categorical penalty--that the proper redress for an employer's violation of the notice regulations is
a full 12 more weeks of leave--holds true in but few cases.
The employee who would have taken the absence anyway,
of course, would need no more leave; but the regulation provides 12 additional weeks. Even the employee who would
have chosen to work on an intermittent basis--say, every
other week, see supra, at 89-90--could claim an entitlement
not to 12 weeks of leave but instead to the 6 weeks he or she
would not have taken. To be sure, 12 more weeks might
be an appropriate make-whole remedy for an employee who
would not have taken any leave at all if the notice had
been given. It is not a "fair assumption," United States v.
O'Hagan, 521 U. S., at 676, however, that this fact pattern
will occur in any but the most exceptional of cases.

To the extent the Secretary's penalty will have no substantial relation to the harm suffered by the employee in
the run of cases, it also amends the FMLA's most fundamental substantive guarantee--the employee's entitlement
to "a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month
period." $ 2612(a)(1). Like any key term in an important
piece of legislation, the 12-week figure was the result of compromise between groups with marked but divergent inter535US1 Unit: $U30 [09-18-03 15:25:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
94 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
ests in the contested provision. Employers wanted fewerweeks; employees wanted more. See H. R. Rep. No. 102-

135, pt. 1, p. 37 (1991). Congress resolved the conflict bychoosing a middle ground, a period considered long enough
to serve "the needs of families" but not so long that it wouldupset "the legitimate interests of employers." $ 2601(b).

Courts and agencies must respect and give effect to these
sorts of compromises. Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U. S.807, 818-819 (1980). The Secretary's chosen penalty subverts the careful balance, for it gives certain employees aright to more than 12 weeks of FMLA-compliant leave in
a given 1-year period. This is so in part because the employee will often enjoy every right guaranteed by the FMLA
during part or all of an undesignated absence. Under the
Secretary's regulations, moreover, employers must comply
with the FMLA's minimum requirements during these undesignated periods. See, e. g., 29 CFR $ 825.208(c) (2001)
(an employee on paid leave "is subject to the full protections
of the Act" during "the absence preceding the notice to the
employee of the [FMLA] designation"). Here, the Secretary required Wolverine to maintain Ragsdale's health benefits for at least 12 weeks of her 30-week absence; if it had
not, Ragsdale could have sued. The penalty provision, in
turn, required the company to grant Ragsdale 12 more weeks
after the 30 weeks had passed. Section 2654 merely authorizes the Secretary to issue rules "necessary to carry out" the
Act, but these regulations extended Wolverine's liability far
beyond the 12-week total guaranteed by the statute. It is
no answer to say, as the Government does, that the Secretary's provision is consistent with the Act because employers
must provide more than 12 weeks of leave only when they
do not comply with the individualized notice requirement.
If this argument carried the day, a penalty of 24 weeks--
or 36, or 48--would also be permissible. Just as those provisions would be contrary to the FMLA's 12-week mandate,
so is $ 825.700(a).

Opinion of the Court
That the Secretary's penalty is disproportionate and in-consistent with Congress' intent is evident as well from the

sole notice provision in the Act itself. As noted above,$ 2619 directs employers to post a general notice informing
employees of their FMLA rights. See supra, at 88. Thisprovision sets out its own penalty for noncompliance: "Any
employer that willfully violates this section may be assessed
a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $100 for each separateoffense." $ 2619(b). Congress believed that a $100 fine, enforced by the Secretary, was the appropriate penalty forwillful violations of the only notice requirement specified
in the statute. The regulation, in contrast, establishes a
much heavier sanction, enforced not by the Secretary but
by employees, for both willful and inadvertent violations
of a supplemental notice requirement.

Section 825.700(a) is also in considerable tension with the
statute's admonition that "[n]othing in this Act . . . shall be
construed to discourage employers from adopting or retaining leave policies more generous than any policies that
comply with the requirements under this Act." $ 2653.
The FMLA was intended to pull certain employers up to the
minimum standard, but Congress was well aware of the danger that it might push more generous employers down to the
minimum at the same time. Technical rules and burdensome administrative requirements, Congress knew, might
impose unforeseen liabilities and discourage employers from
adopting policies that varied much from the basic federal
requirements.

Although $ 825.700(a) itself is directed toward employers
"provid[ing] more generous benefits than required by the
FMLA," its severe and across-the-board penalty could cause
employers to discontinue these voluntary programs. Compliance with the designation requirement is easy enough for
companies meeting only the minimum federal requirements:
All leave is given the FMLA designation. Matters are quite
different for companies like Wolverine, which offer more

diverse and expansive options to their employees. In addi-tion to allowing more than 12 weeks of leave per year, these

employers might also provide leave for non-FMLA reasons,or to employees who are not yet FMLA eligible--leave the
Secretary may not permit to be designated as FMLA leave.See, e. g., 60 Fed. Reg. 2230 (1995) ("Leave granted under
circumstances that do not meet . . . specified reasons forFMLA-qualifying leave may

not be counted against [the]FMLA's 12-week entitlement"). Those employers must decide, almost as soon as leave is requested, whether to desig-nate the absence as FMLA leave. The answer might not
always be obvious, and this decision may require substan-tial investigation. The regulation imposes a high price for
a good-faith but erroneous characterization of an absenceas non-FMLA leave, and employers like Wolverine might
well conclude that the simpler, less generous route is thepreferable one.

These considerations persuade us that $ 825.700(a) effectsan impermissible alteration of the statutory framework and
cannot be within the Secretary's power to issue regulations"necessary to carry out" the Act under $ 2654. In so holding we do not decide whether the notice and designation re-quirements are themselves valid or whether other means
of enforcing them might be consistent with the statute.Whatever the bounds of the Secretary's discretion on this
matter, they were exceeded here. The FMLA guaranteedRagsdale 12--not 42--weeks of leave in 1996.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court today holds that the Family and Medical LeaveAct of 1993 (FMLA or Act), 29 U. S. C. $ 2601 et seq. (1994

ployee notice that leave is FMLA qualifying before the leavemay be counted against the employer's 12-week obligation.

Because I believe the Secretary is justified in requiring suchindividualized notice and because I think that nothing in the
Act constrains the Secretary's ability to secure compliancewith that requirement by refusing to count the leave against
the employer's statutory obligation, I respectfully dissent.

I
I begin with the question the Court set aside, see ante, at88, whether the Secretary was justified in requiring individualized notice at all. The FMLA gives the Secretarythe notice and comment rulemaking authority to "prescribe
such regulations as are necessary to carry out" the Act.29 U. S. C. $ 2654 (1994 ed.). In light of this explicit congressional delegation of rulemaking authority, we must up-hold the Secretary's regulations unless they are "arbitrary,
capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." ChevronU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837, 844 (1984).The Secretary has reasonably determined that individualized notice is necessary to implement the FMLA's pro-visions. According to the Secretary, to fulfill the FMLA's
purposes, employees need to be aware of their rights andresponsibilities under the Act. See 60 Fed. Reg. 2220 (1995)
("The intent of this notice requirement is to insure em-ployees receive the information necessary to enable them
to take FMLA leave"). Although the Act requires that eachemployer post a general notice of FMLA rights, 29 U. S. C.

$ 2619(a), the provision of individualized notice provides addi-tional assurance that employees taking leave are aware of
their rights under the Act. Individualized notice remindsemployees of the existence of the Act and its protections at
the very moment they become relevant. See also 29 CFR$ 825.301(b)(1) (2001) (notice must also include information
about various FMLA rights and obligations).

98 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Perhaps more importantly, individualized notice indi-cates to employees that the Act applies to them specifically.

To trigger employers' FMLA obligations, employees neednot explicitly assert their rights under the Act; they must
only inform their employers of their reasons for seekingleave. See $ 825.208(a)(2). They may not be aware that
their leave is protected under the FMLA. For many employees, the individualized notice required by the Secre-tary may therefore be their first opportunity to learn that

their leave is in fact protected by the FMLA. This notonly assists employees in enforcing their entitlement to
12 weeks of leave, but also helps them take advantage of
their other rights under the Act (such as their right to take
intermittent leave, 29 U. S. C. $ 2612(b)(1), or to substitute
accrued paid leave, $ 2612(b)(2)), and facilitates their enforcement of the employer's other obligations (such as the obligation to continue health insurance coverage during FMLA
leave, $ 2614(c)(1), and the obligation to restore the employee
to a position upon return from leave, $ 2614(a)).

Individualized notice also informs employees whether the
employer plans to provide FMLA and employer-sponsored
leave consecutively or concurrently. This can facilitate
leave planning, allowing employees to organize their health
treatments or family obligations around the total amount of
leave they will ultimately be provided.

Given these reasons, the Secretary's decision to require
individualized notice is not arbitrary and capricious. Respondent does not disagree, instead arguing that, whether or
not these reasons are valid, requiring individualized notice
is contrary to the Act. Because the Act explicitly requires
other sorts of notice, such as the requirement that the employer post a general notice, $ 2619(a), and requirements that
an employee notify the employer of the need for or reasons
for FMLA leave, $$ 2612(e)(1), 2613, respondent argues that
Congress intended that the Secretary not enact any other
notice requirements.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The Act, however, provides no indication that its noticeprovisions are intended to be exclusive. Nor does it make

sense for them to be so. Different notice requirementsserve different functions. The requirement that employees
notify their employers of their reasons for leave, for instance,informs employers that their obligations have been triggered
and allows them to use the certification mechanisms pro-vided in the Act. $ 2613. The requirement that employees
give advance notice when leave is foreseeable, $ 2612(e)(1),facilitates employer planning. That the Act provides for
notice to further these objectives indicates nothing aboutwhether the Secretary may permissibly use the same tool to
further different ends.Even the provision that may seem most similar, the general notice requirement, $ 2619(a), serves a significantly dif-ferent purpose than the Secretary's requirement. Although
both inform employees of their rights under the Act, thegeneral notice requirement is particularly useful to employees who might otherwise never approach their employerwith a leave request, while the individualized notice requirement is targeted at employees after they have informed theemployer of their request for leave. Moreover, even if the
purposes of both sorts of notice were identical, it is not atall clear that, by providing for one sort of notice to further these objectives, Congress intended to preclude theSecretary from bolstering this purpose with an additional
notice requirement. I therefore conclude that nothing in theAct precludes the Secretary from accomplishing her goals
through a requirement of individualized notice.

II
Also at issue before the Court is whether the Secretarymay secure compliance with the individualized notice requirement by providing that leave will not count againstthe employer's 12-week obligation unless the employer fulfills this requirement. The Court concludes that this means

535US1 Unit: $U30 [09-18-03 15:25:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
100 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
of securing compliance is inconsistent with the cause of ac-tion the Act provides when employers "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U. S. C.

$ 2615. The Court appears to see two different kinds of con-flict. At times, the Court seems to suggest that, insofar as
the purpose of the individualized notice requirement is to
enable the employee to enforce the Act's specific protections(such as the right to be reinstated at the end of the leave

period), the Act restricts employees to bringing $ 2615 ac-tions to redress violations of these protections and not the
notice requirement itself. See ante, at 91 (The Secretary's
penalty provision "transformed the company's failure to
give notice . . . into an actionable violation of $ 2615").
Under that section, employees bear the burden of proving
the violation, and their recovery is limited to whatever
damages they can show they have suffered because of the
employer's violation. $ 2617 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).

If this is in fact the Court's view, it would effectively eviscerate the individualized notice requirement. Under such
a scheme, an employer could feel no obligation to provide
individualized notice, only an obligation to refrain from
otherwise violating the Act's other provisions. This would
seriously impede the Secretary's goals. While the fear of
litigation under $ 2615 might go some way toward deterring
employers from, for instance, failing to reinstate employees
who have taken leave or discontinuing their health insurance
while they are on leave, it would do so less effectively than
if employees were explicitly informed that their leave was
FMLA qualifying at the moment it was taken. More importantly, the potential for $ 2615 liability would do nothing to further some of the Secretary's other goals, such as
making employees aware that the range of options provided by the FMLA is available to them. Without individualized notice, for instance, employees may not be made
aware that they have the option of requesting intermittent

O'Connor, J., dissenting
leave, $ 2612(b)(1), or the option of asking the employer tosubstitute accrued paid vacation or sick leave for unpaid

FMLA leave, $ 2612(b)(2). An employer may only be liableunder $ 2615 for denying these options if the employee knows
enough to request them. A rule that would restrict FMLAremedies to violations of $ 2615 based on denials of other
statutorily protected rights would thus be equivalent to
denying the Secretary the power to enforce an individual-ized notice requirement at all. Because I believe the individualized notice requirement is justified, and because theSecretary's power to create such a requirement must also
include a power to enforce it in some way, this extreme view
of the Act's remedial scheme should be rejected.

At other times, however, the Court suggests a less extreme view--that the Secretary may be allowed to require
individualized notice, but that the remedy for failing to
give such notice must also lie under $ 2615, requiring the
employee to prove harm from the employer's failure to notify. See ante, at 91 (suggesting that the appropriate rule
is one "involving a fact-specific inquiry into what steps the
employee would have taken had the employer given the required notice"). This was the approach adopted by the
Court of Appeals, allowing recovery when an "employer's
failure to give notice . . . interfere[s] with or [denies] an employee's substantive FMLA rights." 218 F. 3d 933, 939
(CA8 2000).

But there is no reason to restrict the Secretary's remedy to $ 2615 actions. The Secretary is charged with adopting regulations that are "necessary to carry out" the Act.

$ 2654. This includes the power to craft appropriate remedies for regulatory violations. In Mourning v. Family
Publications Service, Inc., 411 U. S. 356 (1973), where the
Federal Reserve Board was empowered to "prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of " the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1604, this Court deferred to its choice
of remedies, asserting that "[w]e have consistently held

that where reasonable minds may differ as to which ofseveral remedial measures should be chosen, courts should

defer to the informed experience and judgment of the agencyto whom Congress delegated appropriate authority." 411
U. S., at 371-372.Just as the fact that the Act provides for certain sorts
of notice does not preclude the Secretary from providing forother sorts, the fact that the Act provides for certain remedies does not tie the hands of the Secretary to provide forothers. The Court's argument to the contrary seems to be
based on something like the maxim expressio unius est
exclusio alterius--that Congress' decision to provide for oneremedy indicates that it did not intend for the Secretary

to have authority to create any others. Because of thedeference given to agencies on matters about which the statutes they administer are silent, Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843,however, expressio unius ought to have somewhat reduced
force in this context. See Texas Rural Legal Aid, Inc. v.
Legal Servs. Corp., 940 F. 2d 685, 694 (CADC 1991). Forexample, in Mourning, this Court deferred to the agency's

decision to impose a set fine on lenders who violated a regu-lation, rejecting the argument that, because the Truth in
Lending Act provided for one sort of remedy, the agencylacked authority to impose any other sort of penalty. Although the penalty was set in an amount equal to the mini-mum fine set forth in the statute, it clearly went beyond
the statute's remedial scheme, which required that damagesbe set in an amount related to the lender's finance charge.
Cf. ante, at 92. In so holding, we stated:

"[T]he objective sought in delegating rulemaking au-thority to an agency is to relieve Congress of the impossible burden of drafting a code explicitly covering everyconceivable future problem. Congress cannot then be
required to tailor civil penalty provisions so as to dealprecisely with each step which the agency thereafter
finds necessary." 411 U. S., at 376.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Moreover, the Act itself provides some remedies that falloutside the framework of 29 U. S. C. $ 2615--for instance,

the fine for failure to post a general notice of FMLA rights,$ 2619(b). This confirms that $ 2615 is not intended to be
the exclusive remedy for violations of the Act or its imple-menting regulations. Respondent conceded at oral argument that the Secretary could secure compliance with the
individual notice requirement through establishment of afine, a remedy that goes beyond $ 2615. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.

If the Secretary may enforce her regulations with a fine,what in the Act precludes her from enforcing them as appropriate through a range of remedies, such as treble damages,
cease and desist orders punishable by contempt, or, in this
case, additional leave?

The Court further claims that, even if the Secretary has
the power to craft her own remedy for violation of the regulation, the particular remedy she has chosen is unreasonable.
See ante, at 92-93. The Court does not take issue with the
reasonableness of a categorical remedy, one that is not necessarily tailored to the individual loss of each litigant. See
Mourning, supra, at 377 (approving of such "prophylactic"
rules). The Court's argument is instead based on its assertion that the categorical remedy the Secretary has chosen is
too harsh. In the Court's judgment, 12 weeks of additional
leave is too great a punishment because few employees will
have actually suffered this much harm from the employer's
failure to give individualized notice. See ante, at 93.

We are bound, however, to defer to the Secretary's judgment of the likely harms of lack of notice so long as it is
reasonable. I believe that it is. The Secretary has determined that a variety of purposes will be served through
individualized notice, including facilitating employee planning, and enabling enforcement of the Act's protections and
use of its various options by making employees aware that
their leave is FMLA qualifying at the moment they take
it. For those employees who ultimately bring suit for denial

104 RAGSDALE v. WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
of notice, it is difficult to quantify their damages retrospectively--it requires knowing not only what options an employee would have been likely to take had notice been given,
but also the extent to which that employee's ability to plan
leave was compromised. Moreover, an employer's failure to
give individualized notice may itself cause some employees
(unaware that their leave is FMLA qualifying) not to bring
suit at all. I therefore see no reason to doubt the Secretary's judgment that 12 additional weeks of leave is an appropriate penalty for failing to provide individualized notice.

The Court further suggests that the Secretary's remedy
is contrary to the statute in two other ways. First, it claims
that the penalty would exceed the FMLA's guarantee of
12 weeks of leave under $$ 2612(a)(1) and (d)(1). See ante,
at 93-94. But nothing requires an employer to provide
more than 12 weeks of leave--an employer may avoid this
penalty by following the regulation. The penalty the Secretary has chosen no more extends an employer's obligations under the Act than would any fine or other remedy for
a violation of those obligations. Nor, as the Court notes,
would a longer penalty violate this aspect of the Act. See
ante, at 94. To the extent that an even lengthier penalty
would be inappropriate, it would be because it is unreasonable, not because it is contrary to the Act's 12-week
allotment.

Moreover, providing this notice is not at all onerous.
In most situations, notice will require nothing more than informing the employee of what the employer already knows:
that the leave is FMLA qualifying. The employer will
eventually have to make this designation to comply with
the Act's recordkeeping requirements. 29 U. S. C. $ 2616(b).
At most, the regulation moves up the time of this designation. When an employer is unsure at the time the leave
begins whether it qualifies, the regulations allow an interim designation followed by later confirmation. 29 CFR

O'Connor, J., dissenting

$ 825.208(e)(2) (2001). This is hardly the "high price" ofwhich the Court complains. See ante, at 96.

Second, the Court claims that the penalty would discour-age employers from voluntarily providing more leave than
the FMLA requires, contrary to the Act's assertion that"[n]othing in this Act . . . shall be construed to discourage
employers from adopting or retaining [more generous] leavepolicies," $ 2653. See

ante, at 95. This section sets out ageneral interpretive principle, however, and should not be

construed as removing from the Secretary the power tocraft any regulation that might have even a small discouraging effect, no matter how otherwise important. Moreover,because of the ease with which an employer may meet its
obligation to provide individualized notice, this effect willbe minimal.

For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals and remand the case for appropriate
proceedings.

EDELMAN v. LYNCHBURG COLLEGE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 00-1072. Argued January 8, 2002--Decided March 19, 2002
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that a "charge" of employment discrimination be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission "within [a specified number of] days after the alleged
unlawful . . . practice occurred," $ 706(e)(1), and that the charge "be
in writing under oath or affirmation," $ 706(b). An EEOC regulation
permits an otherwise timely filer to verify a charge after the time for
filing has expired. After respondent Lynchburg College denied academic tenure to petitioner Edelman, he faxed a letter to the EEOC in
November 1997, claiming that the College had subjected him to genderbased, national origin, and religious discrimination. Edelman made no
oath or affirmation. The EEOC advised him to file a charge within the
applicable 300-day time limit and sent him a Form 5 Charge of Discrimination, which he returned 313 days after he was denied tenure. Edelman subsequently sued in a Virginia state court on various state-law
claims, but later added a Title VII cause of action. The College then
removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss, claiming that
Edelman's failure to file the verified Form 5 with the EEOC within the
applicable filing period was a bar to subject-matter jurisdiction. Edelman replied that his November 1997 letter was a timely filed charge and
that under the EEOC regulation, the Form 5 verification related back
to the letter. The District Court dismissed the Title VII complaint,
finding that the letter was not a "charge" under Title VII because neither Edelman nor the EEOC treated it as one. The Fourth Circuit
affirmed, holding that Title VII's plain language foreclosed the relationback regulation. The court reasoned that, because a charge requires
verification and must be filed within the limitations period, it follows
that a charge must be verified within that period.

Held: The EEOC's relation-back regulation is an unassailable interpretation of $ 706. Pp. 112-119.

(a) There is nothing plain in reading "charge" to require an oath by
definition. Title VII nowhere defines "charge." Section 706(b) merely
requires that a charge be verified, without saying when; $ 706(e)(1) provides that a charge must be filed within a given period, without indicating whether it must be verified when filed. Neither provision incorporates the other so as to give a definition by necessary implication.

Syllabus
The Fourth Circuit's assumption that $$ 706(b) and (e)(1) must be read as
one, with "charge" defined as "under oath or affirmation," was a doubtful
structural and logical leap. Nor is the gap bridged by the commonsense
rule that statutes are to be read as a whole, see United States v. Morton,
467 U. S. 822, 828, for the two quite different objectives of the timing
and verification requirements prevent reading "charge" to subsume
them both by definition. The time limitation is meant to encourage a
potential charging party to raise a discrimination claim before it gets
stale, while the verification requirement is intended to protect employers from the disruption and expense of responding to a claim unless
a complainant is serious enough and sure enough to support it by oath
subject to liability for perjury. The latter object, however, demands an
oath only by the time the employer is obliged to respond to the charge,
not at the time an employee files it with the EEOC. The statute is
thus open to interpretation and the regulation addresses a legitimate
question. Pp. 112-113.

(b) The College's argument that the regulation addressed a substantive issue over which the EEOC has no rulemaking power is simply a
recast of the plain language argument just rejected. Moreover, there
is no need to resolve the degree of deference reviewing courts owe the
regulation because this Court finds that the rule is not only reasonable,
but states the position the Court would adopt were it interpreting the
statute from scratch. Pp. 113-114.

(c) Although the verification provision is meant to forestall catchpenny claims of disgruntled but not necessarily aggrieved employees,
Congress presumably did not mean to affect Title VII's nature as a remedial scheme in which laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected
to initiate the process, see, e. g., EEOC v. Commercial Office Products
Co., 486 U. S. 107, 124. Construing $ 706 to permit the relation back
of an oath omitted from an original filing ensures that the lay complainant, who may not know enough to verify on filing, will not risk
forfeiting his rights inadvertently. At the same time, the EEOC
looks out for the employer's interest by refusing to call for any response to an otherwise sufficient complaint until the verification has
been supplied. This Court would be hard pressed to take issue with
the EEOC's position after deciding, in Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S.
757, 765, that a failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
11's signature requirement did not require dismissal of a timely filed but
unsigned notice of appeal because nothing prevented later cure of the
signature defect. There is no reason to think that relation back of the
oath here is any less reasonable than relation back of the signature in
Becker. In fact, it would be passing strange to disagree with the EEOC
even without Becker, for a long history of judicial practice with oath

Opinion of the Court
requirements supports the relation-back cure. Moreover, the legislative history indicates that Congress amended Title VII several times
without once casting doubt on the EEOC's construction. Pp. 115-118.

(d) This Court's judgment does not reach the District Court's conclusion that Edelman's letter was not a charge under Title VII because
neither Edelman nor the EEOC treated it as one. The Court notes,
however, that that view has some support at the factual level in that
the EEOC admittedly failed to comply with $ 706(e)(1)'s requirement
that "notice of the charge . . . be served upon the person . . . charge[d]
within ten days" of filing with the EEOC. Edelman's counsel agrees
with the Government that the significance of the delayed notice to the
College will be open on remand. Pp. 118-119.

On June 6, 1997, respondent Lynchburg College denied academic tenure to petitioner Leonard Edelman, who faxed aletter to an EEOC field office on November 14, 1997, claiming "gender-based employment discrimination, exacerbatedby discrimination on the basis of . . . national origin and religion." App. 52. Edelman made no oath or affirmation.

On November 26, 1997, Edelman's lawyer wrote to the fieldoffice requesting an interview with an EEOC investigator

and stating his "understanding that delay occasioned by theinterview will not compromise the filing date, which will remain as November 14, 1997." Id., at 54. An EEOC em-ployee replied to Edelman and advised him to arrange an
interview with a member of the field office. Without refer-ring to the lawyer's letter, the employee reminded Edelman
that "a charge of discrimination must be filed within the timelimits imposed by law."

Id., at 57. In Edelman's case, the
filing period was 300 days after the alleged discriminatory
practice.1After the interview, the EEOC sent Edelman a Form 5

Charge of Discrimination for him to review and verify by

oath or affirmation. On April 15, 1998, 313 days after theJune 6, 1997, denial of tenure, the EEOC received the verified Form 5, which it forwarded to the College for response.After completing an investigation, the EEOC issued Edelman a notice of right to sue.Edelman first sued in a Virginia state court on various
state-law claims, but later added a cause of action under TitleVII, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). The College then removed
the case to Federal District Court and moved to dismiss,claiming that Edelman's failure to file the verified Form 5
with the EEOC within the applicable filing period was a barto subject-matter jurisdiction. Edelman replied that his November 1997 letter was a timely filed charge and that underan EEOC regulation, 29 CFR $ 1601.12(b) (1997),

2 the verification on the Form 5 related back to the letter.The District Court found, however, that the November

letter was not a "charge" within the meaning of Title VIIbecause neither Edelman nor the EEOC treated it as one,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 22-24, with the consequence that therewas no timely filing to which the verification on Form 5 could
relate back. After finding no ground for equitable tollingof the filing requirements, the District Court dismissed the
Title VII complaint and remanded the state-law claims. Id.,at 24-25.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 228 F.3d 503, 512 (CA4 2000). The majority held that the plain
language of the statute foreclosed the EEOC regulation

2 The regulation provides in relevant part that "a charge is sufficient
when the Commission receives from the person making the charge a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties, and to describe
generally the action or practices complained of. A charge may be
amended to cure technical defects or omissions, including failure to verify
the charge, or to clarify and amplify allegations made therein. Such
amendments and amendments alleging additional acts which constitute
unlawful employment practices related to or growing out of the subject
matter of the original charge will relate back to the date the charge was
first received."

Opinion of the Court
allowing a later oath to relate back to an earlier charge.
The majority reasoned that the verification and filing provisions in $ 706 of Title VII 3 were interdependent in defining
"charge": "Because a charge requires verification . . . , and
because a charge must be filed within the limitations period, . . . it follows that a charge must be verified within the
limitations period." Id., at 508.

Judge Luttig concurred only in the judgment. Id., at 512-
513. He said that although the majority probably had
"the better interpretation" of the statute, id., at 513, its
reading of the filing and verification requirements as one was
not compelled by the language, and the court was "bound to
give deference" to the EEOC's construction, ibid. He nonetheless joined in the judgment for the District Court's
reasons.

Because of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,4 we
granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 928 (2001), and now reverse.

3 Section 706(b) reads in relevant part that "[w]henever a charge is filed
by or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved, or by a member
of the Commission, alleging that an employer . . . has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the Commission shall serve a notice of the
charge . . . on such employer . . . within ten days, and shall make an
investigation thereof. Charges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Commission requires." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(b). As to filing, $ 706(e)(1) provides
that "[a] charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and
eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred and
notice of the charge . . . shall be served upon the person against whom
such charge is made within ten days thereafter, except that in a case of
an unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agency
with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice . . . , such charge
shall be filed . . . within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful
employment practice occurred." $ 2000e-5(e)(1).

Opinion of the Court

II

A

Section 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5, governs the filing of charges of discrimination with the EEOC. Section 706(b) requires "[c]harges"to "be in writing under oath or affirmation . . . contain[ing]
such information and . . . in such form as the Commissionrequires." $ 2000e-5(b). Section 706(e)(1) provides that
"[a] charge . . . shall be filed within one hundred and eighty[or in some cases, three hundred] days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." $ 2000e-5(e)(1).Neither provision defines "charge," which is likewise undefined elsewhere in the statute. Section 706(b) merely re-quires the verification of a charge, without saying when it
must be verified; $ 706(e)(1) provides that a charge must befiled within a given period, without indicating whether the
charge must be verified when filed. Neither provision incor-porates the other so as to give a definition by necessary
implication.The assumption of the Court of Appeals that the two provisions must be read as one, with "charge" defined as "under
oath or affirmation," was thus a structural and logical leap.Nor is the gap bridged by the rule of common sense that

statutes are to be read as a whole, see United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984). Although reading the two
provisions together would not be facially inconsistent, doing
that would ignore the two quite different objectives of thetiming and verification requirements, which stand in the way

of reading "charge" to subsume them both by definition.The point of the time limitation is to encourage a potential
charging party to raise a discrimination claim before it gets
cert. denied, 495 U. S. 932 (1990); Casavantes v. California State Univ.,
732 F. 2d 1441, 1443 (CA9 1984); Price v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 687
F. 2d 74, 77, and n. 3 (CA5 1982).

Opinion of the Court
stale, for the sake of a reliable result and a speedy end toany illegal practice that proves out.

5 The verification requirement has the different object of protecting employersfrom the disruption and expense of responding to a claim

unless a complainant is serious enough and sure enough tosupport it by oath subject to liability for perjury.

6 This object, however, demands an oath only by the time the em-ployer is obliged to respond to the charge, not at the time

an employee files it with the EEOC. There is accordinglynothing plain in reading "charge" to require an oath by definition. Questionable would be the better word.

B
The statute is thus open to interpretation and the regula-tion addresses a legitimate question. Before we touch on

the merits of the EEOC's position, however, two thresholdmatters about the status of the regulation can be given short
shrift. The first is whether the agency's rulemaking ex-ceeded its authority to adopt "suitable procedural regulations," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-12(a), and instead addressed a sub-stantive issue over which the EEOC has no rulemaking
power, see EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.244, 257 (1991);

General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125,141 (1976). Although the College argues that the EEOC's

regulation "alter[s] a substantive requirement included byCongress in the statute," Brief for Respondent 32-33, this
is really nothing more than a recast of the plain languageargument; the College is merely restating the position we

5 See Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 256-257 (1980)
("Limitations periods, while guaranteeing the protection of the civil rights
laws to those who promptly assert their rights, also protect employers
from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions
that are long past").

6 See EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U. S. 54, 76, n. 32 (1984) ("The function

of an oath is to impress upon its taker an awareness of his duty to tell
the truth").

Opinion of the Court
just rejected, that Congress defined "charge" as a verifiedaccusation.

The other issue insignificant in this case, however promi-nent it is in much of the litigation that goes on over agency
rulemaking, is the degree of deference owed to the regula-tion by reviewing courts. We agree with the Government
as amicus that deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844(1984), does not necessarily require an agency's exercise of

express notice-and-comment rulemaking power,7 see Brieffor United States et al. as Amici Curiae 19, n. 11; we so
observed in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 230-231 (2001) ("[W]e have sometimes found reasons for Chevron
deference even when no such administrative formality wasrequired and none was afforded"). But there is no need to
resolve any question of deference here. We find the EEOCrule not only a reasonable one, but the position we would
adopt even if there were no formal rule and we were inter-preting the statute from scratch. Because we so clearly
agree with the EEOC, there is no occasion to defer and nopoint in asking what kind of deference, or how much.

8

7 Title VII does not require the EEOC to utilize notice-and-comment
procedures. Section 713(a) of Title VII requires the procedural regulations to "be in conformity with the standards and limitations" of the
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $$ 551-559. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-
12(a) (1994 ed.). And the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C.

$ 553(b), excepts "rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice"
from notice-and-comment procedures unless required by statute.

8 We, of course, do not mean to say that the EEOC's position is the

"only one permissible." See Commercial Office Products, 486 U. S., at
125 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The
agency might, for example, have decided that the time to test the complainant's seriousness is before the agency expends any effort on the case,
and so have required a verified complaint prior to interview. Justice
O'Connor suggests, see post, at 122 (opinion concurring in judgment),
that recognizing this implies that a sphere of deference is appropriate, and
so resolves the Chevron question. But not all deference is deference
under Chevron, see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 234 (2001),

Opinion of the Court

C
A complaint to the EEOC starts the agency down the road
to investigation, conciliation, and enforcement, and it is nosmall thing to be called upon to respond. As we said before,

the verification provision is meant to provide some degree ofinsurance against catchpenny claims of disgruntled, but not
necessarily aggrieved, employees. In requiring the oath oraffirmation, however, Congress presumably did not mean to
affect the nature of Title VII as "a remedial scheme in whichlaypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the
process." EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486
U. S. 107, 124 (1988); Love v. Pullman Co., 404 U. S. 522, 527
(1972). Construing $ 706 to permit the relation back of an
oath omitted from an original filing ensures that the lay complainant, who may not know enough to verify on filing, will
not risk forfeiting his rights inadvertently. At the same
time, the EEOC looks out for the employer's interest by
refusing to call for any response to an otherwise sufficient
complaint until the verification has been supplied.9

We would be hard pressed to take issue with the EEOC's
position after deciding Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757

and there is no need to resolve deference issues when there is no need
for deference.

9 The general practice of EEOC staff members is to prepare a formal

charge of discrimination for the complainant to review and to verify, once
the allegations have been clarified. See Brief for United States et al. as
Amici Curiae 24. The complainant must submit a verified charge before
the agency will require a response from the employer. See Brief for
United States et al. as Amici Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 16.

Respondent argues that the employer will be prejudiced by these procedures because "there would be no deadline for verifying a charge." Brief
for Respondent 34, n. 26. But this is not our case, which simply challenges relation back per se, and our understanding is that the EEOC's
standard practice is to caution complainants that if they fail to follow up
on their initial unverified charge, the EEOC will not proceed further with
the complaint. See App. 57; Brief for United States et al. as Amici
Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 17.

Opinion of the Court
(2001), last Term. In that case, we considered whether theFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 signature requirement

entailed the dismissal of a notice of appeal that was timelyfiled in the district court but was not signed within the filing
period. We held that while the timing and content require-ments for the notice of appeal were "jurisdictional in nature," nothing prevented later cure of the signature defect,532 U. S., at 765. There is no reason to think that relation
back of the oath here is any less reasonable than relationback of the signature in

Becker. Both are aimed at stem-ming the urge to litigate irresponsibly, and if relation back

is a good rule for courts of law, it would be passing strangeto call it bad for an administrative agency.

10 In fact, it

would be passing strange to disagree with the EEOC evenwithout Becker, for a long history of practice with oath requirements supports the relation-back cure.Where a statute or supplemental rule requires an oath,

11

courts have shown a high degree of consistency in acceptinglater verification as reaching back to an earlier, unverified

filing.12 This background law not only persuades by its reg10 We also note that Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
permits the relation back of amendments to pleadings under specified
circumstances.

11 See, e. g., Rule C(6) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty

and Maritime Claims ("[A] person who asserts an interest in or right
against the property that is the subject of the [civil forfeiture] action must
file a verified statement identifying the interest or right").

define a charge to " `mean an accusation of discrimination supported by
oath or affirmation.' " 118 Cong. Rec. 4815 (1972). The Senator expressed his view that the amendment preserved what he believed to be
an existing requirement under the 1964 Act that "charges are to be filed
and made under oath in writing." Ibid. This understanding was neither
confirmed nor denied, but Senator Williams, the bill's floor manager, suggested that rather than the "one coverall, blanket" definition proposed by
Senator Allen, the oath requirement could be included at the beginning of

By amending the law without repudiating the regulation,Congress "suggests its consent to the Commission's practice." EEOC v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 449 U. S. 590,600, n. 17 (1981); see also

We accordingly hold the EEOC's relation-back regulationto be an unassailable interpretation of $ 706 and therefore

reverse. Our judgment does not, however, reach the con-clusion drawn by the District Court, and the single judge
on the Court of Appeals, that Edelman's letter was not acharge under the statute because neither he nor the EEOC

$ 706(b). Ibid. So modified, the amendment was adopted by voice vote
and enacted into law.

Besides refining the language of $ 706 of Title VII, the 1972 amendments
extended the basic time period for filing a charge with the EEOC from
90 to 180 days, and from 210 to 300 days in deferral States. Pub. L.
92-261, 86 Stat. 104. Congress also added a requirement that the EEOC
notify employers within 10 days of receiving a filed charge. Ibid. In
view of the above-described exchange over the phrasing of the verification
requirement, and because Congress enacted this requirement while at
the same time amending the charge-filing deadline in $ 706(e), respondent
advocates our reading the 1972 amendments as a "congressional compromise." Brief for Respondent 24. We are asked, in other words, to
conclude that Congress lengthened the time for filing charges only because Congress, at the same time, required that a charge necessarily be
verified when first filed. The evidence for such a quid pro quo is, however, equivocal.

treated it as one. It is enough to say here that at the factuallevel their view has some support. Although $ 706(e)(1) of

Title VII provides that the "notice of the charge . . . shallbe served upon the person against whom such charge is
made within ten days" of filing with the EEOC, 42 U. S. C.$$ 2000e-5(b) and (e)(1), the Government's lawyer acknowledged at oral argument that the EEOC failed to "comply

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
Congress has authorized the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) "to issue, amend, or rescind suitable procedural regulations to carry out the provisions of
[Title VII]. Regulations issued under this section shall be
in conformity with the standards and limitations of " the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-12(a)
(1994 ed.). The EEOC promulgated 29 CFR $ 1601.12(b)
(1997) pursuant to its clear statutory authority to issue
procedural regulations. See $ 1601.1 ("The regulations set
forth . . . contain the procedures established by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission for carrying out its
responsibilities in the administration and enforcement of title
VII . . ." (emphasis added)). I concur because I read the
Court's opinion to hold that the EEOC possessed the authority to promulgate this procedural regulation, and that the
regulation is reasonable, not proscribed by the statute, and
issued in conformity with the APA.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring in the judgment.

The Court today holds that there is no need in this caseto defer to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulation because the agency's position is the one it"would adopt even if there were no formal rule and [the
Court] were interpreting the statute from scratch." Ante,at 114. I do not agree that the EEOC has adopted the most
natural interpretation of Title VII's provisions regarding thefiling with the EEOC of charges of discrimination. See 42
U. S. C. $ 2000e-5 (1994 ed.). But, because the statute is atleast somewhat ambiguous, I would defer to the agency's
interpretation. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844 (1984);EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 125

(1988) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment) ("[D]eference [to the EEOC] is particularly appropriate on this type of technical issue of agency procedure").I think the regulation, 29 CFR $ 1601.12(b) (1997), should be
sustained on this alternative basis.Title VII requires "charges" of discrimination to "be in
writing under oath or affirmation." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(b).
It also requires "charge[s]" to "be filed within one hundredand eighty [or in some circumstances three hundred] days

after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred."$ 2000e-5(e)(1). The most natural reading of these provisions is that the first is intended to be definitional, defininga "charge" as an allegation of discrimination made in writing
under oath or affirmation. The second then specifies thetime period in which such a verified charge must be filed.
That Congress intended the provisions to be read togetherin this way is suggested by the fact that the two provisions
are found in subsections of the same section of the statute.See

Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809
(1989) ("It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction
that the words of a statute must be read in their context and

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme").Surprisingly, however, the Court holds that the best reading is precisely the opposite--it says it "clearly agree[s] withthe EEOC" that charges do not need to be verified within
the specified time period. See ante, at 114.Despite the fact that I think the best reading of the statute
is that a charge must be made under oath or affirmation
within the specified time, this is not the only possible read-ing of the statute. The definition section of the statute,

42 U. S. C. $ 2000e, which expressly defines a number ofterms, does not define the word "charge" to mean an allegation made under oath or affirmation. In fact, the definition
section does not define the word "charge" at all. And the
provision stating that "charges shall be in writing under oath
or affirmation" is not framed as a definition--it does not say,
for example, that a charge is an allegation made in writing
under oath or affirmation. Because the statute does not
explicitly define "charge" to incorporate verification but only
suggests it, the requirement that charges be verified and the
requirement that charges be filed within the specified time
could be read as independent requirements that do not need
to be satisfied simultaneously. Congress, therefore, cannot
be said to have "unambiguously expressed [its] intent"
that the charge must be under oath or affirmation when filed.
Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843 (emphasis added). Given this ambiguity, under our decision in Chevron, "the question . . .
[becomes] whether the agency's [position] is based on a permissible construction of the statute," ibid., or, in other
words, whether the agency's position is "reasonable," id., at
845. If so, then we must give it "controlling weight," id.,
at 844.

I find the regulation to be reasonable for some of the same
reasons that the Court finds it to be the best interpretation
of the statute. As the Court notes, Title VII is " `a remedial
scheme in which laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process.' " Ante, at 115 (quoting Com535US1 Unit: $U31 [09-18-03 15:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mercial Office Products Co., supra, at 124). Permitting re-lation back of an oath omitted from an original filing is

reasonable because it helps ensure that lay complainants willnot inadvertently forfeit their rights. The regulation is also
consistent, as the Court explains, with the common-law prac-tice of allowing later verifications to relate back. See

ante,
at 116-117. For these reasons, I think the regulation is reasonable and should be sustained.The Court reserved the question of whether the EEOC's

regulation is entitled to Chevron deference. See ante, at114. I doubt that it is possible to reserve this question
while simultaneously maintaining, as the Court does, see
ante, at 114-115, n. 8, that the agency is free to change its
interpretation. To say that the matter is ambiguous enough
to permit agency choice and to suggest that the Court would
countenance a different choice is to say that the Court would
(because it must) defer to a reasonable agency choice. Indeed, the concurring opinion that the Court cites for the
proposition that the agency could change its position was
premised on the idea that the agency was entitled to deference. See Commercial Office Products Co., supra, at 125-
126 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).

I think the EEOC's regulation is entitled to Chevron deference. We have, of course, previously held that because
the EEOC was not given rulemaking authority to interpret the substantive provisions of Title VII, its substantive
regulations do not receive Chevron deference, but instead
only receive consideration according to the standards established in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).
See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 257
(1991) ("[T]he level of deference afforded [the agency's judgment] `will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with
earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which
give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control' ")

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
(quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140); General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, 141-142 (1976). The EEOC has, however, been given "authority from time to time to issue . . .suitable

procedural regulations to carry out the provisions
of " Title VII, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-12(a) (emphasis added).The regulation at issue here, which permits relation back of

amendments to charges filed with the EEOC, is clearly such
a procedural regulation. See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(establishing rules for amendments to pleadings and relation

back as part of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). Thus,as the Court recognizes, see

ante, at 113-114, the EEOC was
exercising authority explicitly delegated to it by Congress
when it promulgated this rule.

The regulation was also promulgated pursuant to sufficiently formal procedures. Although the EEOC originally
issued the regulation without undergoing formal noticeand-comment procedures, it was repromulgated pursuant to
those procedures in 1977. See 42 Fed. Reg. 42022, 42023
(1977); id., at 55388, 55389. We recognized in United States
v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001), that although notice-andcomment procedures are not required for Chevron deference, notice-and-comment is "significant . . . in pointing
to Chevron authority," and that an "overwhelming number of our cases applying Chevron deference have reviewed
the fruits of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication." 533 U. S., at 230-231. I see no reason why a repromulgation pursuant to notice-and-comment procedures
should be less entitled to deference than an original promulgation pursuant to those procedures. Cf. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741 (1996) (giving
deference to "a full-dress regulation . . . adopted pursuant
to the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act designed to assure . . . deliberation" even
though the regulation was prompted by litigation).

Moreover, the regulation is codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations, 29 CFR $ 1601.12(b) (1997), and so is binding

on all the parties coming before the EEOC, as well as on theEEOC itself. In this regard, it is distinguishable from the

Customs Service ruling letters at issue in Mead Corp., supra,at 233, which we found not to be binding on third parties and
to be changeable by the Customs Service merely upon notice,and to which we therefore denied Chevron deference. See

Chevron deference to an agency opinion letter thatwe suggested lacked "the force of law," but stating that "the

Because I believe the regulation is entitled to reviewunder Chevron, and because the regulation is reasonable,
I concur in the judgment.

v. RUCKER et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-1770. Argued February 19, 2002--Decided March 26, 2002*
Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1437d(l)(6) provides that each "public housing agency

shall utilize leases . . . provid[ing] that . . . any drug-related criminal
activity on or off [federally assisted low-income housing] premises, engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be
cause for termination of tenancy." Respondents are four such tenants
of the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA). Paragraph 9(m) of their
leases obligates them to "assure that the tenant, any member of the
household, a guest, or another person under the tenant's control, shall
not engage in . . . any drug-related criminal activity on or near the
premises." Pursuant to United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) regulations authorizing local public housing
authorities to evict for drug-related activity even if the tenant did not
know, could not foresee, or could not control behavior by other occupants, OHA instituted state-court eviction proceedings against respondents, alleging violations of lease paragraph 9(m) by a member of each
tenant's household or a guest. Respondents filed federal actions
against HUD, OHA, and OHA's director, arguing that $ 1437d(l)(6) does
not require lease terms authorizing the eviction of so-called "innocent"
tenants, and, in the alternative, that if it does, the statute is unconstitutional. The District Court's issuance of a preliminary injunction
against OHA was affirmed by the en banc Ninth Circuit, which held
that HUD's interpretation permitting the eviction of so-called "innocent" tenants is inconsistent with congressional intent and must be rejected under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843.

Held: Section 1437d(l)(6)'s plain language unambiguously requires lease

terms that give local public housing authorities the discretion to terminate the lease of a tenant when a member of the household or a guest
engages in drug-related activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew,
or should have known, of the drug-related activity. Congress' decision

not to impose any qualification in the statute, combined with its use of
the term "any" to modify "drug-related criminal activity," precludes any
knowledge requirement. See United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600,
609. Because "any" has an expansive meaning--i. e., "one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind," United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S.
1, 5--any drug-related activity engaged in by the specified persons is
grounds for termination, not just drug-related activity that the tenant
knew, or should have known, about. The Ninth Circuit's ruling that
"under the tenant's control" modifies not just "other person," but also
"member of the tenant's household" and "guest," runs counter to basic
grammar rules and would result in a nonsensical reading. Rather,
HUD offers a convincing explanation for the grammatical imperative
that "under the tenant's control" modifies only "other person": By "control," the statute means control in the sense that the tenant has permitted access to the premises. Implicit in the terms "household member"
or "guest" is that access to the premises has been granted by the tenant.
Section 1437d(l)(6)'s unambiguous text is reinforced by comparing it to
21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7), which subjects all leasehold interests to civil forfeiture when used to commit drug-related criminal activities, but expressly exempts tenants who had no knowledge of the activity, thereby
demonstrating that Congress knows exactly how to provide an "innocent owner" defense. It did not provide one in $ 1437d(l)(6). Given
that Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue, Chevron, supra, at 842, other considerations with which the Ninth Circuit
attempted to bolster its holding are unavailing, including the legislative
history, the erroneous conclusion that the plain reading of the statute
leads to absurd results, the canon of constitutional avoidance, and reliance on inapposite decisions of this Court to cast doubt on $ 1437d(l)(6)'s
constitutionality under the Due Process Clause. Pp. 130-136.

not. We agree with petitioners.Respondents are four public housing tenants of the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA). Paragraph 9(m) of respond-ents' leases, tracking the language of $ 1437d(

l)(6), obligatesthe tenants to "assure that the tenant, any member of the

household, a guest, or another person under the tenant's con-trol, shall not engage in . . . [a]ny drug-related criminal activity on or near the premise[s]." App. 59. Respondents alsosigned an agreement stating that the tenant "understand[s]
that if I or any member of my household or guests shouldviolate this lease provision, my tenancy may be terminated
and I may be evicted." Id., at 69.In late 1997 and early 1998, OHA instituted eviction proceedings in state court against respondents, alleging viola-tions of this lease provision. The complaint alleged: (1) that
the respective grandsons of respondents William Lee andBarbara Hill, both of whom were listed as residents on the
leases, were caught in the apartment complex parking lotsmoking marijuana; (2) that the daughter of respondent
Pearlie Rucker, who resides with her and is listed on thelease as a resident, was found with cocaine and a crack cocaine pipe three blocks from Rucker's apartment;1 and(3) that on three instances within a 2-month period, respondent Herman Walker's caregiver and two others were foundwith cocaine in Walker's apartment.

and provide that "[i]n deciding to evict for criminal activity,the [public housing authority] shall have discretion to consider all of the circumstances of the case . . . ." 24 CFR$ 966.4(

activity includes those situations in which "[the] tenant didnot know, could not foresee, or could not control behavior by

other occupants of the unit." 56 Fed. Reg. 51560, 51567(1991).

After OHA initiated the eviction proceedings in statecourt, respondents commenced actions against HUD, OHA,

Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A), arguing
that 42 U. S. C. $ 1437d(l)(6) does not require lease terms authorizing the eviction of so-called "innocent" tenants, and, in
the alternative, that if it does, then the statute is unconstitutional.3 The District Court issued a preliminary injunction,
enjoining OHA from "terminating the leases of tenants pursuant to paragraph 9(m) of the `Tenant Lease' for drugrelated criminal activity that does not occur within the ten2 The regulations require public housing authorities (PHAs) to impose a
lease obligation on tenants:

A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that

$ 1437d(l)(6) unambiguously permits the eviction of tenants
who violate the lease provision, regardless of whether the
tenant was personally aware of the drug activity, and that
the statute is constitutional. See Rucker v. Davis, 203 F. 3d
627 (CA9 2000). An en banc panel of the Court of Appeals
reversed and affirmed the District Court's grant of the preliminary injunction. See Rucker v. Davis, 237 F. 3d 1113
(2001). That court held that HUD's interpretation permitting the eviction of so-called "innocent" tenants "is inconsistent with Congressional intent and must be rejected" under
the first step of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984). 237
F. 3d, at 1126.

We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 976 (2001), 534 U. S. 813
(2001), and now reverse, holding that 42 U. S. C. $ 1437d(l)(6)
unambiguously requires lease terms that vest local public
housing authorities with the discretion to evict tenants for
the drug-related activity of household members and guests
whether or not the tenant knew, or should have known, about
the activity.

That this is so seems evident from the plain language of
the statute. It provides that "[e]ach public housing agency
shall utilize leases which . . . provide that . . . any drugrelated criminal activity on or off such premises, engaged
in by a public housing tenant, any member of the tenant's
household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's

Opinion of the Court
qualification in the statute, combined with its use of the term
"any" to modify "drug-related criminal activity," precludes
any knowledge requirement. See United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600, 609 (1989). As we have explained, "the
word `any' has an expansive meaning, that is, `one or some
indiscriminately of whatever kind.' " United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997). Thus, any drug-related activity
engaged in by the specified persons is grounds for termination, not just drug-related activity that the tenant knew, or
should have known, about.

The en banc Court of Appeals also thought it possible that
"under the tenant's control" modifies not just "other person,"
but also "member of the tenant's household" and "guest."
237 F. 3d, at 1120. The court ultimately adopted this reading, concluding that the statute prohibits eviction where the
tenant, "for a lack of knowledge or other reason, could not
realistically exercise control over the conduct of a household
member or guest." Id., at 1126. But this interpretation
runs counter to basic rules of grammar. The disjunctive
"or" means that the qualification applies only to "other person." Indeed, the view that "under the tenant's control"
modifies everything coming before it in the sentence would
result in the nonsensical reading that the statute applies to
"a public housing tenant . . . under the tenant's control."
HUD offers a convincing explanation for the grammatical

imperative that "under the tenant's control" modifies only
"other person": "by `control,' the statute means control in the
sense that the tenant has permitted access to the premises."
66 Fed. Reg. 28781 (2001). Implicit in the terms "household
member" or "guest" is that access to the premises has been
granted by the tenant. Thus, the plain language of

$ 1437d(l)(6) requires leases that grant public housing authorities the discretion to terminate tenancy without regard
to the tenant's knowledge of the drug-related criminal
activity.

DEVELOPMENT v. RUCKER

Opinion of the Court

Comparing $ 1437d(l)(6) to a related statutory provision
reinforces the unambiguous text. The civil forfeiture statute that makes all leasehold interests subject to forfeiture when used to commit drug-related criminal activities
expressly exempts tenants who had no knowledge of the
activity: "[N]o property shall be forfeited under this
paragraph . . . by reason of any act or omission established
by that owner to have been committed or omitted without
the knowledge or consent of that owner." 21 U. S. C.

$ 881(a)(7) (1994 ed.). Because this forfeiture provision was
amended in the same Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 that created 42 U. S. C. $ 1437d(l)(6), the en banc Court of Appeals
thought Congress "meant them to be read consistently" so
that the knowledge requirement should be read into the eviction provision. 237 F. 3d, at 1121-1122. But the two sections deal with distinctly different matters. The "innocent
owner" defense for drug forfeiture cases was already in existence prior to 1988 as part of 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7). All
that Congress did in the 1988 Act was to add leasehold interests to the property interests that might be forfeited under
the drug statute. And if such a forfeiture action were to be
brought against a leasehold interest, it would be subject to
the pre-existing "innocent owner" defense. But 42 U. S. C.

$ 1437(d)(l)(6), with which we deal here, is a quite different
measure. It is entirely reasonable to think that the Government, when seeking to transfer private property to itself in
a forfeiture proceeding, should be subject to an "innocent
owner defense," while it should not be when acting as a landlord in a public housing project. The forfeiture provision
shows that Congress knew exactly how to provide an "innocent owner" defense. It did not provide one in $ 1437d(l)(6).

The en banc Court of Appeals next resorted to legislative
history. The Court of Appeals correctly recognized that reference to legislative history is inappropriate when the text
of the statute is unambiguous. 237 F. 3d, at 1123. Given
that the en banc Court of Appeals' finding of textual ambigu535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ity is wrong, see supra, at 130-132, there is no need to con-sult legislative history.

4

Nor was the en banc Court of Appeals correct in conclud-ing that this plain reading of the statute leads to absurd results.5 The statute does not require the eviction of any ten4 Even if it were appropriate to look at legislative history, it would not
help respondents. The en banc Court of Appeals relied on two passages
from a 1990 Senate Report on a proposed amendment to the eviction provision. 237 F. 3d, at 1123 (citing S. Rep. No. 101-316 (1990)). But this
Report was commenting on language from a Senate version of the 1990
amendment, which was never enacted. The language in the Senate version, which would have imposed a different standard of cause for eviction
for drug-related crimes than the unqualified language of $ 1437d(l)(6), see
136 Cong. Rec. 15991, 16012 (1990) (reproducing S. 566, 101st Cong., 2d
Sess., $$ 521(f) and 714(a) (1990)), was rejected at Conference. See H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 101-943, p. 418 (1990). And, as the dissent from the en
banc decision below explained, the passages may plausibly be read as a
mere suggestion about how local public housing authorities should exercise
the "wide discretion to evict tenants connected with drug-related criminal
behavior" that the lease provision affords them. 237 F. 3d, at 1134
(Sneed, J., dissenting).

Respondents also cite language from a House Report commenting on
the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 983.
Brief for Respondents 15-16. For the reasons discussed supra, at 132
and this page, legislative history concerning forfeiture provisions is not
probative on the interpretation of $ 1437d(l)(6).

A 1996 amendment to $ 1437d(l)(6), enacted five years after HUD issued
its interpretation of the statute, supports our holding. The 1996 amendment expanded the reach of $ 1437d(l)(6), changing the language of the
lease provision from applying to activity taking place "on or near" the
public housing premises, to activity occurring "on or off" the public housing premises. See Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996,

$ 9(a)(2), 110 Stat. 836. But Congress, "presumed to be aware" of HUD's
interpretation rejecting a knowledge requirement, made no other change
to the statute. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978).

5 For the reasons discussed above, no-fault eviction, which is specifically

authorized under $ 1437d(l)(6), does not violate $ 1437d(l)(2), which prohibits public housing authorities from including "unreasonable terms and conditions [in their leases]." In addition, the general statutory provision in
the latter section cannot trump the clear language of the more specific

$ 1437d(l)(6). See Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504,
524-526 (1989).

Opinion of the Court

ant who violated the lease provision. Instead, it entruststhat decision to the local public housing authorities, who are

in the best position to take account of, among other things,the degree to which the housing project suffers from "rampant drug-related or violent crime," 42 U. S. C. $ 11901(2)(1994 ed. and Supp. V), "the seriousness of the offending action," 66 Fed. Reg., at 28803, and "the extent to which the
leaseholder has . . . taken all reasonable steps to prevent ormitigate the offending action,"

ibid. It is not "absurd" that
a local housing authority may sometimes evict a tenant whohad no knowledge of the drug-related activity. Such "nofault" eviction is a common "incident of tenant responsibility
under normal landlord-tenant law and practice." 56 Fed.
Reg., at 51567. Strict liability maximizes deterrence and
eases enforcement difficulties. See Pacific Mut. Life Ins.
Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 14 (1991).

And, of course, there is an obvious reason why Congress
would have permitted local public housing authorities to conduct no-fault evictions: Regardless of knowledge, a tenant
who "cannot control drug crime, or other criminal activities
by a household member which threaten health or safety of
other residents, is a threat to other residents and the project." 56 Fed. Reg., at 51567. With drugs leading to "murders, muggings, and other forms of violence against tenants,"
and to the "deterioration of the physical environment that
requires substantial government expenditures," 42 U. S. C.

$ 11901(4) (1994 ed., Supp. V), it was reasonable for Congress
to permit no-fault evictions in order to "provide public and
other federally assisted low-income housing that is decent,
safe, and free from illegal drugs," $ 11901(1) (1994 ed.).

In another effort to avoid the plain meaning of the statute,
the en banc Court of Appeals invoked the canon of constitutional avoidance. But that canon "has no application in the
absence of statutory ambiguity." United States v. Oakland
Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, 532 U. S. 483, 494 (2001).
"Any other conclusion, while purporting to be an exercise in

Opinion of the Court
judicial restraint, would trench upon the legislative powersvested in Congress by Art. I, $ 1, of the Constitution."

United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 680 (1985). Thereare, moreover, no "serious constitutional doubts" about Congress' affording local public housing authorities the discre-tion to conduct no-fault evictions for drug-related crime.
Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 314, n. 9 (1993) (emphasis
deleted).The en banc Court of Appeals held that HUD's interpretation "raise[s] serious questions under the Due Process Clauseof the Fourteenth Amendment," because it permits "tenants
to be deprived of their property interest without any relationship to individual wrongdoing." 237 F. 3d, at 1124-1125
(citing Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 224-225 (1961);
Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. Danaher, 238
U. S. 482 (1915)). But both of these cases deal with the acts
of government as sovereign. In Scales, the United States
criminally charged the defendant with knowing membership
in an organization that advocated the overthrow of the
United States Government. In Danaher, an Arkansas statute forbade discrimination among customers of a telephone
company. The situation in the present cases is entirely different. The government is not attempting to criminally
punish or civilly regulate respondents as members of the
general populace. It is instead acting as a landlord of property that it owns, invoking a clause in a lease to which respondents have agreed and which Congress has expressly
required. Scales and Danaher cast no constitutional doubt
on such actions.

The Court of Appeals sought to bolster its discussion of
constitutional doubt by pointing to the fact that respondents
have a property interest in their leasehold interest, citing
Greene v. Lindsey, 456 U. S. 444 (1982). This is undoubtedly
true, and Greene held that an effort to deprive a tenant of
such a right without proper notice violated the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But, in the present

Opinion of the Court

cases, such deprivation will occur in the state court whereOHA brought the unlawful detainer action against respondents. There is no indication that notice has not been givenby OHA in the past, or that it will not be given in the future.
Any individual factual disputes about whether the lease pro-vision was actually violated can, of course, be resolved in
these proceedings.6We hold that "Congress has directly spoken to the precise
question at issue." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S., at 842. Section1437d(l)(6) requires lease terms that give local public housing authorities the discretion to terminate the lease of a ten-ant when a member of the household or a guest engages in
drug-related activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew,or should have known, of the drug-related activity.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or deci-sion of these cases.

6 The en banc Court of Appeals cited only the due process constitutional
concern. Respondents raise two others: the First Amendment and the
Excessive Fines Clause. We agree with Judge O'Scannlain, writing for
the panel that reversed the injunction, that the statute does not raise
substantial First Amendment or Excessive Fines Clause concerns. Lyng
v. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S. 360 (1988), forecloses respondents' claim
that the eviction of unknowing tenants violates the First Amendment
guarantee of freedom of association. See 203 F. 3d 627, 647 (2000). And
termination of tenancy "is neither a cash nor an in-kind payment imposed
by and payable to the government" and therefore is "not subject to analysis as an excessive fine." Id., at 648.

HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v. NATIONALLABOR RELATIONS BOARD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 00-1595. Argued January 15, 2002--Decided March 27, 2002
Petitioner hired Jose Castro on the basis of documents appearing to verify

his authorization to work in the United States, but laid him and others
off after they supported a union-organizing campaign at petitioner's
plant. Respondent National Labor Relations Board (Board) found that
the layoffs violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and
ordered backpay and other relief. At a compliance hearing before an
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to determine the amount of backpay,
Castro testified, inter alia, that he was born in Mexico, that he had
never been legally admitted to, or authorized to work in, this country,
and that he gained employment with petitioner only after tendering a
birth certificate belonging to a friend born in Texas. Based on this
testimony, the ALJ found that the Board was precluded from awarding
Castro relief by Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, and by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), which makes it unlawful for employers knowingly to hire undocumented workers or for employees to use fraudulent documents to establish employment eligibility.
The Board reversed with respect to backpay, citing its precedent holding
that the most effective way to further the immigration policies embodied
in IRCA is to provide the NLRA's protections and remedies to undocumented workers in the same manner as to other employees. The Court
of Appeals denied review and enforced the Board's order.

Held: Federal immigration policy, as expressed by Congress in IRCA,

foreclosed the Board from awarding backpay to an undocumented alien
who has never been legally authorized to work in the United States.
Pp. 142-152.

(a) This Court has consistently set aside the Board's backpay awards
to employees found guilty of serious illegal conduct in connection with
their employment. See, e. g., Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB, 316 U. S. 31,
40-47. Since Southern S. S. Co., the Court has never deferred to the
Board's remedial preferences where such preferences potentially trench
upon federal statutes and policies unrelated to the NLRA. See, e. g.,
Sure-Tan, supra, in which the Court set aside an award of reinstatement
and backpay to undocumented alien workers who were not authorized

Syllabus
to reenter this country following their voluntary departure when their
employers unlawfully reported them to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in retaliation for union activity. Among other things, the
Court there found that the Board's authority with respect to the selection of remedies was limited by federal immigration policy as expressed
in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and held that, in order
to avoid a potential conflict with the INA with respect to backpay, the
employees must be deemed "unavailable" for work (and the accrual of
backpay therefore tolled) during any period when they were not "lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the United States." 467
U. S., at 903. This case is controlled by the Southern Steamship line
of cases. ABF Freight System, Inc. v. NLRB, 510 U. S. 317, 325, distinguished. Pp. 142-146.

(b) As a matter of plain language, Sure-Tan's express limitation of
backpay to documented alien workers forecloses the backpay award to
Castro, who was never lawfully entitled to be present or employed in
the United States. But the Court need not resolve whether, read in
context, Sure-Tan's limitation applies only to aliens who left the United
States and thus cannot claim backpay without lawful reentry. The
question presented here is better analyzed through a wider lens, focusing on a legal landscape now significantly changed. The Southern S. S.
Co. line of cases established that where the Board's chosen remedy
trenches upon a federal statute or policy outside the Board's competence
to administer, the Board's remedy may have to yield. Whether or not
this was the situation at the time of Sure-Tan, it is precisely the situation today. Two years after Sure-Tan, Congress enacted IRCA, a comprehensive scheme that made combating the employment of illegal
aliens in the United States central to the policy of immigration law.
INS v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 194,
and n. 8. Among other things, IRCA established an extensive "employment verification system," 8 U. S. C. $ 1324a(a)(1), designed to deny employment to aliens who (a) are not lawfully present in the United States,
or (b) are not lawfully authorized to work in the United States,

$ 1324a(h)(3). It also makes it a crime for an unauthorized alien to subvert the employer verification system by tendering fraudulent documents, $ 1324c(a), an offense that Castro committed when obtaining employment with petitioner. Thus, allowing the Board to award backpay
to illegal aliens would unduly trench upon explicit statutory prohibitions
critical to federal immigration policy. It would encourage the successful evasion of apprehension by immigration authorities, condone prior
violations of the immigration laws, and encourage future violations.

However broad the Board's discretion to fashion remedies when dealing
only with the NLRA, it is not so unbounded as to authorize this sort of
an award. Lack of authority to award backpay does not mean that the
employer gets off scot-free. The Board here has already imposed other
significant sanctions against petitioner, including orders that it cease
and desist its NLRA violations and conspicuously post a notice detailing
employees' rights and its prior unfair practices, which are sufficient to
effectuate national labor policy regardless of whether backpay accompanies them, Sure-Tan, supra, at 904, and n. 13. Pp. 146-152.

140 HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

The National Labor Relations Board (Board) awardedbackpay to an undocumented alien who has never been legally authorized to work in the United States. We hold thatsuch relief is foreclosed by federal immigration policy, as expressed by Congress in the Immigration Reform and ControlAct of 1986 (IRCA).

Petitioner Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. (petitioner orHoffman), custom-formulates chemical compounds for businesses that manufacture pharmaceutical, construction, andhousehold products. In May 1988, petitioner hired Jose
Castro to operate various blending machines that "mix andcook" the particular formulas per customer order. Before
being hired for this position, Castro presented documentsthat appeared to verify his authorization to work in the
United States. In December 1988, the United Rubber,Cork, Linoleum, and Plastic Workers of America, AFL-CIO,
began a union-organizing campaign at petitioner's productionplant. Castro and several other employees supported the
organizing campaign and distributed authorization cards toco-workers. In January 1989, Hoffman laid off Castro and
other employees engaged in these organizing activities.Three years later, in January 1992, respondent Board
found that Hoffman unlawfully selected four employees, in-cluding Castro, for layoff "in order to rid itself of known
union supporters" in violation of $ 8(a)(3) of the NationalLabor Relations Act (NLRA).

1 306 N. L. R. B. 100. To

remedy this violation, the Board ordered that Hoffman(1) cease and desist from further violations of the NLRA,

(2) post a detailed notice to its employees regarding the re-medial order, and (3) offer reinstatement and backpay to the

1 Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA prohibits discrimination "in regard to hire
or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization." 49 Stat.

Opinion of the Court
four affected employees. Id., at 107-108. Hoffman enteredinto a stipulation with the Board's General Counsel and

agreed to abide by the Board's order.In June 1993, the parties proceeded to a compliance hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to determinethe amount of backpay owed to each discriminatee. On the
final day of the hearing, Castro testified that he was born in
Mexico and that he had never been legally admitted to, orauthorized to work in, the United States. 314 N. L. R. B.

683, 685 (1994). He admitted gaining employment withHoffman only after tendering a birth certificate belonging to
a friend who was born in Texas. Ibid. He also admitted
that he used this birth certificate to fraudulently obtain a
California driver's license and a Social Security card, and to
fraudulently obtain employment following his layoff by Hoffman. Ibid. Neither Castro nor the Board's General Counsel offered any evidence that Castro had applied or intended
to apply for legal authorization to work in the United States.
Ibid. Based on this testimony, the ALJ found the Board
precluded from awarding Castro backpay or reinstatement
as such relief would be contrary to Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB,
467 U. S. 883 (1984), and in conflict with IRCA, which makes
it unlawful for employers knowingly to hire undocumented
workers or for employees to use fraudulent documents
to establish employment eligibility. 314 N. L. R. B., at
685-686.

In September 1998, four years after the ALJ's decision,
and nine years after Castro was fired, the Board reversed
with respect to backpay. 326 N. L. R. B. 1060. Citing its
earlier decision in A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc.,
320 N. L. R. B. 408 (1995), the Board determined that "the
most effective way to accommodate and further the immigration policies embodied in [IRCA] is to provide the protections and remedies of the [NLRA] to undocumented workers
in the same manner as to other employees." 326 N. L. R. B.,
at 1060. The Board thus found that Castro was entitled to

Opinion of the Court
$66,951 of backpay, plus interest. Id., at 1062. It calculatedthis backpay award from the date of Castro's termination to

the date Hoffman first learned of Castro's undocumented sta-tus, a period of 4

1/2 years. Id., at 1061. A dissenting Board

member would have affirmed the ALJ and denied Castro allbackpay. Id., at 1062 (opinion of Hurtgen).

Hoffman filed a petition for review of the Board's orderin the Court of Appeals. A panel of the Court of Appeals
denied the petition for review. 208 F. 3d 229 (CADC 2000).After rehearing the case en banc, the court again denied the
petition for review and enforced the Board's order. 237F. 3d 639 (2001). We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 976 (2001),
and now reverse.2This case exemplifies the principle that the Board's discretion to select and fashion remedies for violations of theNLRA, though generally broad, see,

e. g., NLRB v. Seven-UpBottling Co. of Miami, Inc., 344 U. S. 344, 346-347 (1953), is

2 The Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether the
Board may award backpay to undocumented workers. Compare NLRB
v. A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc., 134 F. 3d 50, 56 (CA2 1997)
(holding that illegal workers could collect backpay under the NLRA), and
Local 512, Warehouse and Office Workers' Union v. NLRB, 795 F. 2d 705,
719-720 (CA9 1986) (same), with Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc. v. NLRB, 976
F. 2d 1115, 1121-1122 (CA7 1992) (holding that illegal workers could not
collect backpay under the NLRA). The question has a checkered career
before the Board, as well. Compare Felbro, Inc., 274 N. L. R. B. 1268,
1269 (1985) (illegal workers could not be awarded backpay in light of
Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883 (1984)), with A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil
Buyers Group, Inc., 320 N. L. R. B. 408, 415 (1995) (illegal workers could
be awarded backpay notwithstanding Sure-Tan); Memorandum GC 87-8

Opinion of the Court
not unlimited, see, e. g., NLRB v. Fansteel MetallurgicalCorp., 306 U. S. 240, 257-258 (1939); Southern S. S. Co. v.

NLRB, 316 U. S. 31, 46-47 (1942); NLRB v. Bildisco & Bil-disco, 465 U. S. 513, 532-534 (1984); Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB,
supra, at 902-904. Since the Board's inception, we haveconsistently set aside awards of reinstatement or backpay
to employees found guilty of serious illegal conduct inconnection with their employment. In

Fansteel, the Boardawarded reinstatement with backpay to employees who engaged in a "sit down strike" that led to confrontation withlocal law enforcement officials. We set aside the award,
saying:

"We are unable to conclude that Congress intended tocompel employers to retain persons in their employ regardless of their unlawful conduct,--to invest those whogo on strike with an immunity from discharge for acts
of trespass or violence against the employer's property,which they would not have enjoyed had they remained
at work." 306 U. S., at 255.
Though we found that the employer had committed seriousviolations of the NLRA, the Board had no discretion to remedy those violations by awarding reinstatement with back-pay to employees who themselves had committed serious
criminal acts. Two years later, in Southern S. S. Co., supra,the Board awarded reinstatement with backpay to five employees whose strike on shipboard had amounted to a mutinyin violation of federal law. We set aside the award, saying:

"It is sufficient for this case to observe that the Boardhas not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of
the Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it maywholly ignore other and equally important [c]ongressional objectives." 316 U. S., at 47.
Although the Board had argued that the employees' conductdid not in fact violate the federal mutiny statute, we rejected

this view, finding the Board's interpretation of a statute so

Opinion of the Court
far removed from its expertise merited no deference fromthis Court.

Id., at 40-46. Since Southern S. S. Co., we
have accordingly never deferred to the Board's remedialpreferences where such preferences potentially trench upon

federal statutes and policies unrelated to the NLRA. Thus,we have precluded the Board from enforcing orders found in
conflict with the Bankruptcy Code, see Bildisco, supra, at
527-534, 529, n. 9 ("While the Board's interpretation of theNLRA should be given some deference, the proposition that

the Board's interpretation of statutes outside its expertise islikewise to be deferred to is novel"), rejected claims that
federal antitrust policy should defer to the NLRA, Connell
Constr. Co. v. Plumbers, 421 U. S. 616, 626 (1975), and precluded the Board from selecting remedies pursuant to its
own interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act, Carpenters v. NLRB, 357 U. S. 93, 108-110 (1958).

Our decision in Sure-Tan followed this line of cases and
set aside an award closely analogous to the award challenged
here. There we confronted for the first time a potential conflict between the NLRA and federal immigration policy, as
then expressed in the Immigration and Nationality Act
(INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. $ 1101 et seq.
Two companies had unlawfully reported alien-employees to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in retaliation for union activity. Rather than face INS sanction, the
employees voluntarily departed to Mexico. The Board investigated and found the companies acted in violation of

$$ 8(a)(1) and (3) of the NLRA. The Board's ensuing order
directed the companies to reinstate the affected workers and
pay them six months' backpay.

We affirmed the Board's determination that the NLRA applied to undocumented workers, reasoning that the immigration laws "as presently written" expressed only a " `peripheral concern' " with the employment of illegal aliens. 467
U. S., at 892 (quoting De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351, 360
(1976)). "For whatever reason," Congress had not "made it

Opinion of the Court
a separate criminal offense" for employers to hire an il-legal alien, or for an illegal alien "to accept employment after

entering this country illegally." Sure-Tan, 467 U. S., at 892-893. Therefore, we found "no reason to conclude that application of the NLRA to employment practices affecting suchaliens would necessarily conflict with the terms of the INA."
Id., at 893.

With respect to the Board's selection of remedies, how-ever, we found its authority limited by federal immigration policy. See id., at 903 ("In devising remedies for unfairlabor practices, the Board is obliged to take into account another `equally important Congressional objective' " (quoting
Southern S. S. Co., supra, at 47)). For example, the Board
was prohibited from effectively rewarding a violation of
the immigration laws by reinstating workers not authorized
to reenter the United States. Sure-Tan, 467 U. S., at 903.
Thus, to avoid "a potential conflict with the INA," the
Board's reinstatement order had to be conditioned upon
proof of "the employees' legal reentry." Ibid. "Similarly,"
with respect to backpay, we stated: "[T]he employees must
be deemed `unavailable' for work (and the accrual of backpay
therefore tolled) during any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the United
States." Ibid. "[I]n light of the practical workings of the
immigration laws," such remedial limitations were appropriate even if they led to "[t]he probable unavailability of the
[NLRA's] more effective remedies." Id., at 904.

The Board cites our decision in ABF Freight System, Inc.
v. NLRB, 510 U. S. 317 (1994), as authority for awarding
backpay to employees who violate federal laws. In ABF
Freight, we held that an employee's false testimony at a
compliance proceeding did not require the Board to deny
reinstatement with backpay. The question presented was
"a narrow one," id., at 322, limited to whether the Board was
obliged to "adopt a rigid rule" that employees who testify
falsely under oath automatically forfeit NLRA remedies, id.,

Opinion of the Court
at 325. There are significant differences between that caseand this. First, we expressly did not address whether the

Board could award backpay to an employee who engaged in"serious misconduct" unrelated to internal Board proceedings, id., at 322, n. 7, such as threatening to kill a supervisor,
ibid. (citing Precision Window Mfg. v. NLRB, 963 F. 2d 1105,
1110 (CA8 1992)), or stealing from an employer, 510 U. S., at
322, n. 7 (citing NLRB v. Commonwealth Foods, Inc., 506F. 2d 1065, 1068 (CA4 1974)). Second, the challenged order

did not implicate federal statutes or policies administeredby other federal agencies, a "most delicate area" in which
the Board must be "particularly careful in its choice of remedy." Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371
U. S. 156, 172 (1962). Third, the employee misconduct at
issue, though serious, was not at all analogous to misconduct
that renders an underlying employment relationship illegal
under explicit provisions of federal law. See, e. g., 237 F. 3d,
at 657, n. 2 (Sentelle, J., dissenting) ("The perjury statute
provides for criminal sanctions; it does not forbid a present
or potential perjurer from obtaining a job" (distinguishing
ABF Freight)). For these reasons, we believe the present
case is controlled by the Southern S. S. Co. line of cases,
rather than by ABF Freight.

It is against this decisional background that we turn to the
question presented here. The parties and the lower courts
focus much of their attention on Sure-Tan, particularly its
express limitation of backpay to aliens "lawfully entitled to
be present and employed in the United States." 467 U. S.,
at 903. All agree that as a matter of plain language, this
limitation forecloses the award of backpay to Castro. Castro was never lawfully entitled to be present or employed
in the United States, and thus, under the plain language of
Sure-Tan, he has no right to claim backpay. The Board
takes the view, however, that read in context, this limitation
applies only to aliens who left the United States and thus
cannot claim backpay without lawful reentry. Brief for Re535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
spondent 17-24. The Court of Appeals agreed with thisview. 237 F. 3d, at 642-646. Another Court of Appeals,

however, agrees with Hoffman, and concludes that Sure-Tansimply meant what it said, i. e., that any alien who is "not
lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the UnitedStates" cannot claim backpay. See Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc.
v. NLRB, 976 F. 2d 1115, 1118-1121 (CA7 1992); Brief forPetitioner 7-20. We need not resolve this controversy. For
whether isolated sentences from Sure-Tan definitively con-trol, or count merely as persuasive dicta in support of petitioner, we think the question presented here better analyzedthrough a wider lens, focused as it must be on a legal landscape now significantly changed.The

Southern S. S. Co. line of cases established that wherethe Board's chosen remedy trenches upon a federal statute

or policy outside the Board's competence to administer, theBoard's remedy may be required to yield. Whether or not
this was the situation at the time of Sure-Tan, it is preciselythe situation today. In 1986, two years after

Sure-Tan,Congress enacted IRCA, a comprehensive scheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the United States.$ 101(a)(1), 100 Stat. 3360, 8 U. S. C. $ 1324a. As we have
previously noted, IRCA "forcefully" made combating theemployment of illegal aliens central to "[t]he policy of immigration law." INS v. National Center for Immigrants'Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 194, and n. 8 (1991). It did so by
establishing an extensive "employment verification system,"$ 1324a(a)(1), designed to deny employment to aliens who
(a) are not lawfully present in the United States, or (b) arenot lawfully authorized to work in the United States,

$ 1324a(h)(3).3 This verification system is critical to the

3 For an alien to be "authorized" to work in the United States, he
or she must possess "a valid social security account number card,"

$ 1324a(b)(C)(i), or "other documentation evidencing authorization of employment in the United States which the Attorney General finds, by regulation, to be acceptable for purposes of this section," $ 1324a(b)(C)(ii). See

IRCA regime. To enforce it, IRCA mandates that employ-ers verify the identity and eligibility of all new hires by

examining specified documents before they begin work.$ 1324a(b). If an alien applicant is unable to present the
required documentation, the unauthorized alien cannot behired. $ 1324a(a)(1).

Similarly, if an employer unknowingly hires an unauthor-ized alien, or if the alien becomes unauthorized while employed, the employer is compelled to discharge the workerupon discovery of the worker's undocumented status.

$ 1324a(a)(2). Employers who violate IRCA are punished bycivil fines, $ 1324a(e)(4)(A), and may be subject to criminal
prosecution, $ 1324a(f)(1). IRCA also makes it a crime foran unauthorized alien to subvert the employer verification
system by tendering fraudulent documents. $ 1324c(a). Itthus prohibits aliens from using or attempting to use "any
forged, counterfeit, altered, or falsely made document" or"any document lawfully issued to or with respect to a person
other than the possessor" for purposes of obtaining employ-ment in the United States. $$ 1324c(a)(1)-(3). Aliens who
use or attempt to use such documents are subject to finesand criminal prosecution. 18 U. S. C. $ 1546(b). There is no
dispute that Castro's use of false documents to obtain em-ployment with Hoffman violated these provisions.

Under the IRCA regime, it is impossible for an undocu-mented alien to obtain employment in the United States
without some party directly contravening explicit congres-sional policies. Either the undocumented alien tenders
fraudulent identification, which subverts the cornerstone ofIRCA's enforcement mechanism, or the employer knowingly
hires the undocumented alien in direct contradiction of itsIRCA obligations. The Board asks that we overlook this

also $ 1324a(h)(3)(B) (defining "unauthorized alien" as any alien "[not] authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General").
Regulations implementing these provisions are set forth at 8 CFR $ 274a
(2001).

fact and allow it to award backpay to an illegal alien foryears of work not performed, for wages that could not lawfully have been earned, and for a job obtained in the firstinstance by a criminal fraud. We find, however, that awarding backpay to illegal aliens runs counter to policies underly-ing IRCA, policies the Board has no authority to enforce or
administer. Therefore, as we have consistently held in likecircumstances, the award lies beyond the bounds of the
Board's remedial discretion.The Board contends that awarding limited backpay to
Castro "reasonably accommodates" IRCA, because, in theBoard's view, such an award is not "inconsistent" with IRCA.
Brief for Respondent 29-42. The Board argues that be-cause the backpay period was closed as of the date Hoffman
learned of Castro's illegal status, Hoffman could have em-ployed Castro during the backpay period without violating
IRCA. Id., at 37. The Board further argues that whileIRCA criminalized the misuse of documents, "it did not make
violators ineligible for back pay awards or other compensa-tion flowing from employment secured by the misuse of such
documents." Id., at 38. This latter statement, of course,proves little: The mutiny statute in Southern S. S. Co., and
the INA in Sure-Tan, were likewise understandably silentwith respect to such things as backpay awards under the
NLRA. What matters here, and what sinks both of theBoard's claims, is that Congress has expressly made it criminally punishable for an alien to obtain employment with falsedocuments. There is no reason to think that Congress nonetheless intended to permit backpay where but for an employ-er's unfair labor practices, an alien-employee would have
remained in the United States illegally, and continued towork illegally, all the while successfully evading apprehension by immigration authorities.4 Far from "accommo4 Justice Breyer contends otherwise, pointing to a single Committee

dating" IRCA, the Board's position, recognizing employermisconduct but discounting the misconduct of illegal alien

employees, subverts it.Indeed, awarding backpay in a case like this not only trivializes the immigration laws, it also condones and encouragesfuture violations. The Board admits that had the INS detained Castro, or had Castro obeyed the law and departed toMexico, Castro would have lost his right to backpay. See
Brief for Respondent 7-8 (citing A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil Buyers
Group, Inc., 320 N. L. R. B., at 416). Cf. INS v. NationalCenter for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S., at 196, n. 11

("[U]ndocumented aliens taken into custody are not entitledto work") (construing 8 CFR $ 103.6(a) (1991)). Castro thus
qualifies for the Board's award only by remaining inside theUnited States illegally. See, e. g., A. P. R. A. Fuel Buyers
Group, 134 F. 3d, at 62, n. 4 (Jacobs, J., concurring in partand dissenting in part) ("Considering that NLRB proceedings can span a whole decade, this is no small inducement toprolong illegal presence in the country"). Similarly, Castro
cannot mitigate damages, a duty our cases require, see Surerather slender reed, e. g., Bank One Chicago, N. A. v. Midwest Bank &
Trust Co., 516 U. S. 264, 279 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). Even assuming that a Committee Report can
shed light on what Congress intended in IRCA, the Report cited by Justice Breyer says nothing about the Board's authority to award backpay
to illegal aliens. The Board in fact initially read the Report as stating
Congress' view that such awards are foreclosed. Memorandum GC 88-9
from Office of General Counsel, NLRB, Reinstatement and Backpay
Remedies for Discriminatees Who Are "Undocumented Aliens," 1988
WL 236182, *3 (Sept. 1, 1988) ("[T]he relevant committee report points
out [that] Sure-Tan was the existing law and that decision itself limited
the remedial powers of the NLRB. Clearly, Congress did not intend to
overrule Sure-Tan"). Other courts have observed that the Report
"merely endorses the first holding of Sure-Tan that undocumented aliens
are employees within the meaning of the NLRA." Del Rey Tortilleria,
Inc., 976 F. 2d, at 1121 (citation omitted). Our first holding in Sure-Tan
is not at issue here and does not bear at all on the scope of Board remedies
with respect to undocumented workers.

without triggering new IRCA violations, either by tendering
false documents to employers or by finding employers willing
to ignore IRCA and hire illegal workers. The Board here
has failed to even consider this tension. See 326 N. L. R. B.,
at 1063, n. 10 (finding that Castro adequately mitigated damages through interim work with no mention of ALJ findings
that Castro secured interim work with false documents).5

We therefore conclude that allowing the Board to award
backpay to illegal aliens would unduly trench upon explicit
statutory prohibitions critical to federal immigration policy,
as expressed in IRCA. It would encourage the successful
evasion of apprehension by immigration authorities, condone
prior violations of the immigration laws, and encourage
future violations. However broad the Board's discretion to

Justice Breyer says that we should nonetheless defer to the Government's view that the Board's remedy is entirely consistent with IRCA.
Post, at 161 (dissenting opinion). But such deference would be contrary
to Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB, 316 U. S. 31, 40-46 (1942), where the Government told us that the Board's remedy was entirely consistent with the
federal maritime laws, and NLRB v. Bildisco & Bildisco, 465 U. S. 513,
529-532 (1984), where the Government told us that the Board's remedy
was entirely consistent with the Bankruptcy Code, and Sure-Tan, 467
U. S., at 892-894, 902-905, where the Government told us that the Board's
remedy was entirely consistent with the INA. See also Carpenters v.
NLRB, 357 U. S. 93, 108-110 (1958) (rejecting Government position that
we should defer to the Board's interpretation of the Interstate Commerce
Act). We did not defer to the Government's position in any of these cases,
and there is even less basis for doing so here since IRCA--unlike the
maritime statutes, the Bankruptcy Code, or the INA--not only speaks
directly to matters of employment but expressly criminalizes the only employment relationship at issue in this case.

fashion remedies when dealing only with the NLRA, it is notso unbounded as to authorize this sort of an award.

Lack of authority to award backpay does not mean thatthe employer gets off scot-free. The Board here has already
imposed other significant sanctions against Hoffman--sanc-tions Hoffman does not challenge. See supra, at 140.
These include orders that Hoffman cease and desist its viola-tions of the NLRA, and that it conspicuously post a notice
to employees setting forth their rights under the NLRA anddetailing its prior unfair practices. 306 N. L. R. B., at 100-
101. Hoffman will be subject to contempt proceedingsshould it fail to comply with these orders.

NLRB v. WarrenCo., 350 U. S. 107, 112-113 (1955) (Congress gave the Board

civil contempt power to enforce compliance with the Board'sorders). We have deemed such "traditional remedies" sufficient to effectuate national labor policy regardless ofwhether the "spur and catalyst" of backpay accompanies
them. Sure-Tan, 467 U. S., at 904. See also id., at 904, n. 13("This threat of contempt sanctions . . . provides a significant
deterrent against future violations of the [NLRA]"). As weconcluded in

Sure-Tan, "in light of the practical workingsof the immigration laws," any "perceived deficienc[y] in the

NLRA's existing remedial arsenal" must be "addressed bycongressional action," not the courts. Id., at 904. In light
of IRCA, this statement is even truer today.6The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
6 Because the Board is precluded from imposing punitive remedies, Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U. S. 7, 9-12 (1940), it is an open question
whether awarding backpay to undocumented aliens, who have no entitlement to work in the United States at all, might constitute a prohibited
punitive remedy against an employer. See Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc. v.
NLRB, 976 F. 2d, at 1119 (finding that undocumented workers discharged

I cannot agree that the backpay award before us "runscounter to," or "trenches upon," national immigration policy.

Ante, at 147, 149 (citing the Immigration Reform and ControlAct of 1986 (IRCA)). As all the relevant agencies (including
the Department of Justice) have told us, the National LaborRelations Board's limited backpay order will not interfere
with the implementation of immigration policy. Rather, itreasonably helps to deter unlawful activity that

both laborlaws and immigration laws seek to prevent. Consequently,

the order is lawful. See ante, at 142 (recognizing "broad"scope of Board's remedial authority).

The Court does not deny that the employer in this casedismissed an employee for trying to organize a union--a

crude and obvious violation of the labor laws. See 29U. S. C. $ 158(a)(3) (1994 ed.); NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 398 (1983). And it cannot denythat the Board has especially broad discretion in choosing an
appropriate remedy for addressing such violations. NLRBv.

its choice of remedy must therefore be given special respectby reviewing courts"). Nor can it deny that in such circumstances backpay awards serve critically important remedialpurposes. NLRB v. J. H. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U. S. 258,
263 (1969). Those purposes involve more than victim com-pensation; they also include deterrence, i. e., discouraging

those individuals who have suffered harm' ") (quoting Local 512, Warehouse and Office Workers Union v. NLRB, 795 F. 2d, at 725 (Beezer, J.,

grounds, we do not address whether the award at issue here is " `punitive'

employers from violating the Nation's labor laws. See ante,at 152 (recognizing the deterrent purposes of the National

Labor Relations Act (NLRA)); Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467U. S. 883, 904, n. 13 (1984) (same).

Without the possibility of the deterrence that backpay pro-vides, the Board can impose only future-oriented obligations
upon law-violating employers--for it has no other weapons
in its remedial arsenal. Ante, at 152. And in the absenceof the backpay weapon, employers could conclude that they

can violate the labor laws at least once with impunity. See
A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc., 320 N. L. R. B. 408,
415, n. 38 (1995) (without potential backpay order employer
might simply discharge employees who show interest in
a union "secure in the knowledge" that only penalties
were requirements "to cease and desist and post a notice");
cf. Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB, 414 U. S. 168, 185
(1973); cf. also EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 296,
n. 11 (2002) (backpay award provides important incentive to
report illegal employer conduct); Albemarle Paper Co. v.
Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 417-418 (1975) ("It is the reasonably
certain prospect of a backpay award" that leads employers
to "shun practices of dubious legality"). Hence the backpay
remedy is necessary; it helps make labor law enforcement
credible; it makes clear that violating the labor laws will
not pay.

Where in the immigration laws can the Court find a "policy" that might warrant taking from the Board this critically
important remedial power? Certainly not in any statutory
language. The immigration statutes say that an employer
may not knowingly employ an illegal alien, that an alien may
not submit false documents, and that the employer must verify documentation. See 8 U. S. C. $$ 1324a(a)(1), 1324a(b);
18 U. S. C. $ 1546(b)(1). They provide specific penalties, including criminal penalties, for violations. Ibid.; 8 U. S. C.

$$ 1324a(e)(4), 1324a(f)(1). But the statutes' language itself
does not explicitly state how a violation is to effect the en535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
forcement of other laws, such as the labor laws. What is tohappen, for example, when an employer hires, or an alien

works, in violation of these provisions? Must the alien for-feit all pay earned? May the employer ignore the labor
laws? More to the point, may the employer violate thoselaws with impunity, at least once--secure in the knowledge
that the Board cannot assess a monetary penalty? The immigration statutes' language simply does not say.Nor can the Court comfortably rest its conclusion upon

the immigration laws' purposes. For one thing, the generalpurpose of the immigration statute's employment prohibition
is to diminish the attractive force of employment, which like
a "magnet" pulls illegal immigrants toward the United
States. H. R. Rep. No. 99-682, pt. 1, p. 45 (1986). To permit the Board to award backpay could not significantly increase the strength of this magnetic force, for so speculative
a future possibility could not realistically influence an individual's decision to migrate illegally. See A. P. R. A. Fuel
Oil Buyers Group, Inc., supra, at 410-415 (no significant influence from so speculative a factor); Patel v. Quality Inn
South, 846 F. 2d 700, 704 (CA11 1988) (aliens enter the country "in the hope of getting a job," not gaining "the protection
of our labor laws"); Peterson v. Neme, 222 Va. 477, 482, 281
S. E. 2d 869, 872 (1981) (same); Arteaga v. Literski, 83 Wis.
2d 128, 132, 265 N. W. 2d 148, 150 (1978) (same); H. R. Rep.
No. 99-682, at 45 (same).

To deny the Board the power to award backpay, however,
might very well increase the strength of this magnetic force.
That denial lowers the cost to the employer of an initial labor
law violation (provided, of course, that the only victims are
illegal aliens). It thereby increases the employer's incentive
to find and to hire illegal-alien employees. Were the Board
forbidden to assess backpay against a knowing employer--a
circumstance not before us today, see 237 F. 3d 639, 648
(CADC 2001)--this perverse economic incentive, which runs
directly contrary to the immigration statute's basic objective,

would be obvious and serious. But even if limited to caseswhere the employer did not know of the employee's status,

the incentive may prove significant--for, as the Board hastold us, the Court's rule offers employers immunity in borderline cases, thereby encouraging them to take risks, i. e.,to hire with a wink and a nod those potentially unlawful
aliens whose unlawful employment (given the Court's views)
ultimately will lower the costs of labor law violations. SeeBrief for Respondent 30-32; Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 47; cf. also

General Accounting Office, Garment Industry: Efforts to Ad-dress the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops 8 (GAO/
HEHS-95-29, Nov. 1994) (noting a higher incidence of labor
violations in areas with large populations of undocumented
aliens). The Court has recognized these considerations in
stating that the labor laws must apply to illegal aliens in
order to ensure that "there will be no advantage under the
NLRA in preferring illegal aliens" and therefore there will
be "fewer incentives for aliens themselves to enter." SureTan, supra, at 893-894. The Court today accomplishes the
precise opposite.

The immigration law's specific labor-law-related purposes
also favor preservation, not elimination, of the Board's backpay powers. See A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc.,
supra, at 414 (immigration law seeks to combat the problem
of aliens' willingness to "work in substandard conditions and
for starvation wages"); cf. also Sure-Tan, 467 U. S., at 893
("[E]nforcement of the NLRA . . . is compatible with the
policies" of the Immigration and Nationality Act). As I just
mentioned and as this Court has held, the immigration law
foresees application of the Nation's labor laws to protect
"workers who are illegal immigrants." Id., at 891-893; H. R.
Rep. No. 99-682, at 58. And a policy of applying the labor
laws must encompass a policy of enforcing the labor laws
effectively. Otherwise, as Justice Kennedy once put
the matter, "we would leave helpless the very persons who
most need protection from exploitative employer practices."

NLRB v. Apollo Tire Co., 604 F. 2d 1180, 1184 (CA9 1979)(concurring opinion). That presumably is why those in Congress who wrote the immigration statute stated explicitlyand unequivocally that the immigration statute does

not take
from the Board any of its remedial authority. H. R. Rep.No. 99-682, at 58 (IRCA does not "undermine or diminish

in any way labor protections in existing law, or . . . limit
the powers of federal or state labor relations boards . . . toremedy unfair practices committed against undocumented

employees").Neither does precedent help the Court. Indeed, in

ABF
Freight System, Inc. v. NLRB, 510 U. S. 317 (1994), this
Court upheld an award of backpay to an unlawfully discharged employee guilty of a serious crime, namely, perjury
committed during the Board's enforcement proceedings.
Id., at 323. See also id., at 326-331 (Scalia, J., concurring
in judgment while stressing seriousness of misconduct).
The Court unanimously held that the Board retained "broad
discretion" to remedy the labor law violation through a backpay award, while leaving enforcement of the criminal law to
ordinary perjury-related civil and criminal penalties. See
id., at 325; see also 18 U. S. C. $ 1621 (criminal penalties for
perjury).

The Court, trying to distinguish ABF Freight, says that
the Court there left open "whether the Board could award
backpay to an employee who engaged in `serious misconduct'
unrelated to internal Board proceedings." Ante, at 146.
But the Court does not explain why (assuming misconduct

Court adds that the Board order in ABF Freight "did not

federal agencies." Ante, at 146. But it does not explainwhy this matters when, as here, the Attorney General,

whose Department--through the Immigration and Natural-ization Service--administers the immigration statutes,

supports the Board's order. Nor does it explain why the per-jury statute at issue in

ABF Freight was not a "statute . . .
administered by" another "agenc[y]." See 510 U. S., at 329
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (noting Department ofJustice officials' responsibility for prosecuting perjury).

The Court concludes that the employee misconduct atissue in

ABF Freight, "though serious, was not at all analogous to misconduct that renders an underlying employment relationship illegal." Ante, at 146. But this conclusion rests upon an implicit assumption--the assumption that
the immigration laws' ban on employment is not compatible
with a backpay award. And that assumption, as I have tried
to explain, is not justified. See supra, at 155-157.

At the same time, the two earlier cases upon which the
Court relies, NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306
U. S. 240 (1939), and Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB, 316 U. S.
31, 47 (1942), offer little support for its conclusion. The
Court correctly characterizes both cases as ones in which
this Court set aside the Board's remedy (more specifically,
reinstatement). Ante, at 142-144. But the Court does not
focus upon the underlying circumstances--which in those
cases were very different from the circumstances present
here. In both earlier cases, the employer had committed an
independent unfair labor practice--in the one by creating a
company union, Fansteel, supra, at 250, in the other by refusing to recognize the employees' elected representative,
Southern S. S. Co., supra, at 32-36, 48-49. In both cases,
the employees had responded with unlawful acts of their
own--a sit-in and a mutiny. Fansteel, supra, at 252; Southern S. S. Co., supra, at 48. And in both cases, the Court
held that the employees' own unlawful conduct provided the
employer with "good cause" for discharge, severing any con535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
nection to the earlier unfair labor practice that might other-wise have justified reinstatement and backpay.

Fansteel,
supra, at 254-259; Southern S. S. Co., supra, at 47-49.By way of contrast, the present case concerns a discharge

that was not for "good cause." The discharge did not severany connection with an unfair labor practice. Indeed, the
discharge was the unfair labor practice. Hence a determination that backpay was inappropriate in the former circum-stances (involving a

justifiable discharge) tells us next to
nothing about the appropriateness as a legal remedy in thelatter (involving an

unjustifiable discharge), the circumstances present here.

The Court also refers to the statement in Sure-Tan, Inc.
v. NLRB, 467 U. S., at 903, that "employees must be deemed
`unavailable' for work (and the accrual of backpay therefore
tolled) during any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the United States." The
Court, however, does not rely upon this statement as determining its conclusion. See ante, at 146-147. And it is right
not to do so. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330,
341 (1979) ("[L]anguage of an opinion" must be "read in context" and not "parsed" like a statute). Sure-Tan involved
an order reinstating (with backpay) illegal aliens who had
left the country and returned to Mexico. 467 U. S., at 888-
889. In order to collect the backpay to which the order entitled them, the aliens would have had to reenter the country
illegally. Consequently, the order itself could not have been
enforced without leading to a violation of criminal law. Id.,
at 903. Nothing in the Court's opinion suggests that the
Court intended its statement to reach to circumstances different from and not at issue in Sure-Tan, where an order,
such as the order before us, does not require the alien to
engage in further illegal behavior.

Finally, the Court cannot reasonably rely upon the award's
negative features taken together. The Court summarizes
those negative features when it says that the Board "asks

535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
160 HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v. NLRB

Breyer, J., dissenting
that we . . . award backpay to an illegal alien [1] for years ofwork not performed, [2] for wages that could not lawfully

have been earned, and [3] for a job obtained in the first in-stance by a criminal fraud."

Ante, at 148-149. The first of
these features has little persuasive force, given the facts that(1) backpay ordinarily and necessarily is awarded to a discharged employee who may not find other work, and (2) the
Board is able to tailor an alien's backpay award to avoidrewarding that alien for his legal inability to mitigate damages by obtaining lawful employment elsewhere. See, e. g.,
Sure-Tan, supra, at 901-902, n. 11 (basing backpay on "representative employee"); A. P. R. A. Fuel, 320 N. L. R. B.,
at 416 (providing backpay for reasonable period); 326
N. L. R. B., at 1062 (cutting off backpay when employer
learned of unlawful status).

Neither can the remaining two features--unlawfully
earned wages and criminal fraud--prove determinative, for
they tell us only a small portion of the relevant story. After
all, the same backpay award that compensates an employee
in the circumstances the Court describes also requires an
employer who has violated the labor laws to make a meaningful monetary payment. Considered from this equally important perspective, the award simply requires that employer to pay an employee whom the employer believed could
lawfully have worked in the United States, (1) for years of
work that he would have performed, (2) for a portion of the
wages that he would have earned, and (3) for a job that the
employee would have held--had that employer not unlawfully dismissed the employee for union organizing. In ignoring these latter features of the award, the Court undermines
the public policies that underlie the Nation's labor laws.

Of course, the Court believes it is necessary to do so in
order to vindicate what it sees as conflicting immigration law
policies. I have explained why I believe the latter policies
do not conflict. See supra, at 155-157. But even were I
wrong, the law requires the Court to respect the Board's

conclusion, rather than to substitute its own independentview of the matter for that of the Board. The Board

reached its conclusion after carefully considering both laborlaw and immigration law. 326 N. L. R. B., at 1060-1062; see
A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc., supra, at 412-414.In doing so the Board has acted "with a discriminating
awareness of the consequences of its action" on the immigra-tion laws.

Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,371 U. S. 156, 174 (1962). The Attorney General, charged

with immigration law enforcement, has told us that theBoard is right. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1324a(e) (Immigration and
Naturalization Service placed within the Department of Jus-tice, under authority of Attorney General who is charged

And the Board's position is, at the least, a reasonable one.Consequently, it is lawful.

MICKENS v. TAYLOR, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 00-9285. Argued November 5, 2001--Decided March 27, 2002
A Virginia jury convicted petitioner of the premeditated murder of Timothy Hall during or following the commission of an attempted forcible
sodomy, and sentenced petitioner to death. Petitioner filed a federal
habeas petition alleging, inter alia, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because one of his court-appointed attorneys had a conflict of interest at trial. Petitioner's lead attorney, Bryan Saunders, had
represented Hall on assault and concealed-weapons charges at the time
of the murder. The same juvenile court judge who dismissed the
charges against Hall later appointed Saunders to represent petitioner.
Saunders did not disclose to the court, his co-counsel, or petitioner that
he had previously represented Hall. The District Court denied habeas
relief, and an en banc majority of the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The
majority rejected petitioner's argument that the juvenile court judge's
failure to inquire into a potential conflict either mandated automatic
reversal of his conviction or relieved him of the burden of showing that
a conflict of interest adversely affected his representation. The court
concluded that petitioner had not demonstrated adverse effect.

Held: In order to demonstrate a Sixth Amendment violation where the

trial court fails to inquire into a potential conflict of interest about which
it knew or reasonably should have known, a defendant must establish
that a conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel's performance.
Pp. 166-176.

(a) A defendant alleging ineffective assistance generally must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694. An exception to this general
rule presumes a probable effect upon the outcome where assistance of
counsel has been denied entirely or during a critical stage of the proceeding. The Court has held in several cases that "circumstances of
that magnitude," United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 659, n. 26, may
also arise when the defendant's attorney actively represented conflicting
interests. In Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475, the Court created
an automatic reversal rule where counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict. In Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335,

535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

163Cite as: 535 U. S. 162 (2002)
Syllabus
the Court declined to extend Holloway and held that, absent objection,
a defendant must demonstrate that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation, 446 U. S., at 348-349. Finally, in Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S. 261, the Court granted certiorari to
consider an equal-protection violation, but then remanded for the trial
court to determine whether a conflict of interest that the record
strongly suggested actually existed, id., at 273. Pp. 166-170.

(b) This Court rejects petitioner's argument that the remand instruction in Wood, directing the trial court to grant a new hearing if it determined that "an actual conflict of interest existed," 450 U. S., at 273, established that where the trial judge neglects a duty to inquire into a
potential conflict the defendant, to obtain reversal, need only show that
his lawyer was subject to a conflict of interest, not that the conflict
adversely affected counsel's performance. As used in the remand instruction, "an actual conflict of interest" meant precisely a conflict that
affected counsel's performance--as opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties. It was shorthand for Sullivan's statement that
"a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the
adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order
to obtain relief," 446 U. S., at 349-350 (emphasis added). The notion
that Wood created a new rule sub silentio is implausible. Moreover,
petitioner's proposed rule of automatic reversal makes little policy
sense. Thus, to void the conviction petitioner had to establish, at a
minimum, that the conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel's
performance. The Fourth Circuit having found no such effect, the denial of habeas relief must be affirmed. Pp. 170-174.

(c) The case was presented and argued on the assumption that (absent
some exception for failure to inquire) Sullivan would be applicable to a
conflict rooted in counsel's obligations to former clients. The Court
does not rule upon the correctness of that assumption. Pp. 174-176.

The question presented in this case is what a defendantmust show in order to demonstrate a Sixth Amendment violation where the trial court fails to inquire into a potentialconflict of interest about which it knew or reasonably should
have known. I

In 1993, a Virginia jury convicted petitioner Mickens ofthe premeditated murder of Timothy Hall during or following the commission of an attempted forcible sodomy. Find-ing the murder outrageously and wantonly vile, it sentenced
petitioner to death. In June 1998, Mickens filed a petitionfor writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and
Supp. V), in the United States District Court for the EasternDistrict of Virginia, alleging, inter alia, that he was denied
effective assistance of counsel because one of his court-appointed attorneys had a conflict of interest at trial. Federal habeas counsel had discovered that petitioner's lead trialattorney, Bryan Saunders, was representing Hall (the victim) on assault and concealed-weapons charges at the timeof the murder. Saunders had been appointed to represent
Hall, a juvenile, on March 20, 1992, and had met with himonce for 15 to 30 minutes some time the following week.
Hall's body was discovered on March 30, 1992, and four days

Opinion of the Court
later a juvenile court judge dismissed the charges againsthim, noting on the docket sheet that Hall was deceased.

The one-page docket sheet also listed Saunders as Hall'scounsel. On April 6, 1992, the same judge appointed Saunders to represent petitioner. Saunders did not disclose tothe court, his co-counsel, or petitioner that he had previously
represented Hall. Under Virginia law, juvenile case files are
confidential and may not generally be disclosed without acourt order, see Va. Code Ann. $ 16.1-305 (1999), but petitioner learned about Saunders' prior representation whena clerk mistakenly produced Hall's file to federal habeas
counsel.

The District Court held an evidentiary hearing and denied
petitioner's habeas petition. A divided panel of the Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, 227 F. 3d 203
(2000), and the Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc,
240 F. 3d 348 (2001). As an initial matter, the 7-to-3 en banc
majority determined that petitioner's failure to raise his
conflict-of-interest claim in state court did not preclude review, concluding that petitioner had established cause and
that the "inquiry as to prejudice for purposes of excusing
[petitioner's] default . . . incorporates the test for evaluating
his underlying conflict of interest claim." Id., at 356-357.
On the merits, the Court of Appeals assumed that the juvenile court judge had neglected a duty to inquire into a potential conflict, but rejected petitioner's argument that this
failure either mandated automatic reversal of his conviction
or relieved him of the burden of showing that a conflict of
interest adversely affected his representation. Relying on
Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), the court held that
a defendant must show "both an actual conflict of interest
and an adverse effect even if the trial court failed to inquire
into a potential conflict about which it reasonably should
have known," 240 F. 3d, at 355-356. Concluding that petitioner had not demonstrated adverse effect, id., at 360, it
affirmed the District Court's denial of habeas relief. We

granted a stay of execution of petitioner's sentence andgranted certiorari. 532 U. S. 970 (2001).

The Sixth Amendment provides that a criminal defendantshall have the right to "the Assistance of Counsel for his

defence." This right has been accorded, we have said, "notfor its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability
of the accused to receive a fair trial." United States v.Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984). It follows from this that
assistance which is ineffective in preserving fairness doesnot meet the constitutional mandate, see

Strickland v. Wash-ington, 466 U. S. 668, 685-686 (1984); and it also follows that

defects in assistance that have no probable effect upon thetrial's outcome do not establish a constitutional violation.
As a general matter, a defendant alleging a Sixth Amend-ment violation must demonstrate "a reasonable probability
that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of theproceeding would have been different." Id., at 694.

There is an exception to this general rule. We havespared the defendant the need of showing probable effect
upon the outcome, and have simply presumed such effect,where assistance of counsel has been denied entirely or during a critical stage of the proceeding. When that has oc-curred, the likelihood that the verdict is unreliable is so high
that a case-by-case inquiry is unnecessary. See Cronic,
supra, at 658-659; see also Geders v. United States, 425 U. S.80, 91 (1976); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344-345

(1963). But only in "circumstances of that magnitude" dowe forgo individual inquiry into whether counsel's inadequate performance undermined the reliability of the verdict.Cronic, supra, at 659, n. 26.

We have held in several cases that "circumstances of thatmagnitude" may also arise when the defendant's attorney
actively represented conflicting interests. The nub of thequestion before us is whether the principle established by
these cases provides an exception to the general rule of

Opinion of the Court
Strickland under the circumstances of the present case. Toanswer that question, we must examine those cases in some

detail.1In Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475 (1978), defense
counsel had objected that he could not adequately representthe divergent interests of three codefendants. Id., at 478-
480. Without inquiry, the trial court had denied counsel'smotions for the appointment of separate counsel and had
refused to allow counsel to cross-examine any of the defend-ants on behalf of the other two. The

Holloway Court de-ferred to the judgment of counsel regarding the existence of

a disabling conflict, recognizing that a defense attorney is inthe best position to determine when a conflict exists, that he
has an ethical obligation to advise the court of any problem,and that his declarations to the court are "virtually made

1 Justice Breyer rejects Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475 (1978),
Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), and Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S.
261 (1981), as "a sensible [and] coherent framework for dealing with" this
case, post, at 209 (dissenting opinion), and proposes instead the "categorical rule," post, at 211, that when a "breakdown in the criminal justice
system creates . . . the appearance that the proceeding will not reliably
serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt and innocence,
and the resulting criminal punishment will not be regarded as fundamentally fair," ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), reversal must be decreed without proof of prejudice. This seems to us less a categorical rule
of decision than a restatement of the issue to be decided. Holloway, Sullivan, and Wood establish the framework that they do precisely because
that framework is thought to identify the situations in which the conviction will reasonably not be regarded as fundamentally fair. We believe it
eminently performs that function in the case at hand, and that Justice
Breyer is mistaken to think otherwise. But if he does think otherwise,
a proper regard for the judicial function--and especially for the function
of this Court, which must lay down rules that can be followed in the innumerable cases we are unable to review--would counsel that he propose
some other "sensible [and] coherent framework," rather than merely saying that prior representation of the victim, plus the capital nature of the
case, plus judicial appointment of the counsel, see post, at 210, strikes him
as producing a result that will not be regarded as fundamentally fair.
This is not a rule of law but expression of an ad hoc "fairness" judgment
(with which we disagree).

under oath." Id., at 485-486 (internal quotation marksomitted). Holloway presumed, moreover, that the conflict,

"which [the defendant] and his counsel tried to avoid bytimely objections to the joint representation," id., at 490, undermined the adversarial process. The presumption wasjustified because joint representation of conflicting interests
is inherently suspect, and because counsel's conflicting obli-gations to multiple defendants "effectively sea[l] his lips on
crucial matters" and make it difficult to measure the preciseharm arising from counsel's errors.

Id., at 489-490. Hol-loway thus creates an automatic reversal rule only where

defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over histimely objection, unless the trial court has determined that
there is no conflict. Id., at 488 ("[W]henever a trial courtimproperly requires joint representation over timely objection reversal is automatic").In Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), the respondent
was one of three defendants accused of murder who weretried separately, represented by the same counsel. Neither
counsel nor anyone else objected to the multiple representa-tion, and counsel's opening argument at Sullivan's trial suggested that the interests of the defendants were aligned.
Id., at 347-348. We declined to extend Holloway's auto-matic reversal rule to this situation and held that, absent

objection, a defendant must demonstrate that "a conflict ofinterest actually affected the adequacy of his representation." 446 U. S., at 348-349. In addition to describing thedefendant's burden of proof, Sullivan addressed separately
a trial court's duty to inquire into the propriety of a multiplerepresentation, construing Holloway to require inquiry only
when "the trial court knows or reasonably should know thata particular conflict exists," 446 U. S., at 347

suggests that a trial court must scrutinize representation by appointed
counsel more closely than representation by retained counsel. Post, at

Opinion of the Court
to be confused with when the trial court is aware of a vague,
unspecified possibility of conflict, such as that which "inheres
in almost every instance of multiple representation," id., at
348. In Sullivan, no "special circumstances" triggered the
trial court's duty to inquire. Id., at 346.

Finally, in Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S. 261 (1981), three
indigent defendants convicted of distributing obscene materials had their probation revoked for failure to make the requisite $500 monthly payments on their $5,000 fines. We
granted certiorari to consider whether this violated the
Equal Protection Clause, but during the course of our consideration certain disturbing circumstances came to our attention: At the probation-revocation hearing (as at all times
since their arrest) the defendants had been represented by
the lawyer for their employer (the owner of the business that
purveyed the obscenity), and their employer paid the attorney's fees. The employer had promised his employees he
would pay their fines, and had generally kept that promise
but had not done so in these defendants' case. This record
suggested that the employer's interest in establishing a favorable equal-protection precedent (reducing the fines he
would have to pay for his indigent employees in the future)
diverged from the defendants' interest in obtaining leniency
or paying lesser fines to avoid imprisonment. Moreover, the
possibility that counsel was actively representing the conflicting interests of employer and defendants "was sufficiently apparent at the time of the revocation hearing to impose upon the court a duty to inquire further." Id., at 272.

the Sixth Amendment draws such a distinction. "A proper respect for
the Sixth Amendment disarms [the] contention that defendants who retain
their own lawyers are entitled to less protection than defendants for whom
the State appoints counsel . . . . The vital guarantee of the Sixth Amendment would stand for little if the often uninformed decision to retain a
particular lawyer could reduce or forfeit the defendant's entitlement to
constitutional protection." Sullivan, supra, at 344.

Opinion of the Court
Because "[o]n the record before us, we [could not] be surewhether counsel was influenced in his basic strategic decisions by the interests of the employer who hired him," ibid.,we remanded for the trial court "to determine whether the
conflict of interest that this record strongly suggests actually
existed," id., at 273.

Petitioner argues that the remand instruction in Wood established an "unambiguous rule" that where the trial judge
neglects a duty to inquire into a potential conflict, the defendant, to obtain reversal of the judgment, need only show
that his lawyer was subject to a conflict of interest, and need
not show that the conflict adversely affected counsel's performance. Brief for Petitioner 21.3 He relies upon the lan3 Petitioner no longer argues, as he did below and as Justice Souter
does now, post, at 202 (dissenting opinion), that the Sixth Amendment
requires reversal of his conviction without further inquiry into whether
the potential conflict that the judge should have investigated was real.
Compare 240 F. 3d 348, 357 (CA4 2001) (en banc), with Tr. of Oral Arg.
23-25. Some Courts of Appeals have read a footnote in Wood v. Georgia,
450 U. S., at 272, n. 18, as establishing that outright reversal is mandated
when the trial court neglects a duty to inquire into a potential conflict of
interest. See, e. g., Campbell v. Rice, 265 F. 3d 878, 884-885, 888 (CA9
2001); Ciak v. United States, 59 F. 3d 296, 302 (CA2 1995). But see Brien
v. United States, 695 F. 2d 10, 15, n. 10 (CA1 1982). The Wood footnote
says that Sullivan does not preclude "raising . . . a conflict-of-interest
problem that is apparent in the record" and that "Sullivan mandates a
reversal when the trial court has failed to make [the requisite] inquiry."
Wood, supra, at 272, n. 18. These statements were made in response to
the dissent's contention that the majority opinion had "gone beyond"
Cuyler v. Sullivan, see 450 U. S., at 272, n. 18, in reaching a conflict-ofinterest due process claim that had been raised neither in the petition for
certiorari nor before the state courts, see id., at 280 (White, J., dissenting).
To the extent the "mandates a reversal" statement goes beyond the assertion of mere jurisdiction to reverse, it is dictum--and dictum inconsistent
with the disposition in Wood, which was not to reverse but to vacate and
remand for the trial court to conduct the inquiry it had omitted.

Justice Souter labors to suggest that the Wood remand order is part
of "a coherent scheme," post, at 194, in which automatic reversal is re535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
guage in the remand instruction directing the trial court togrant a new revocation hearing if it determines that "an

actual conflict of interest existed," Wood, supra, at 273,without requiring a further determination that the conflict

adversely affected counsel's performance. As used in the
remand instruction, however, we think "an actual conflict of
interest" meant precisely a conflict that affected counsel's
performance--as opposed to a mere theoretical division of
loyalties. It was shorthand for the statement in Sullivan
that "a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not
demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief." 446 U. S.,
at 349-350 (emphasis added).4 This is the only interpretaquired when the trial judge fails to inquire into a potential conflict that
was apparent before the proceeding was "held or completed," but a defendant must demonstrate adverse effect when the judge fails to inquire
into a conflict that was not apparent before the end of the proceeding, post,
at 202. The problem with this carefully concealed "coherent scheme" (no
case has ever mentioned it) is that in Wood itself the court did not decree
automatic reversal, even though it found that "the possibility of a conflict
of interest was sufficiently apparent at the time of the revocation hearing
to impose upon the court a duty to inquire further." 450 U. S., at 272
(second emphasis added). Indeed, the State had actually notified the
judge of a potential conflict of interest " `[d]uring the probation revocation
hearing.' " Id., at 272, and n. 20. Justice Souter's statement that "the
signs that a conflict may have occurred were clear to the judge at the close
of the probation revocation proceeding," post, at 201--when it became apparent that counsel had neglected the "strategy more obviously in the
defendants' interest, of requesting the court to reduce the fines or defer
their collection," post, at 198--would more accurately be phrased "the effect of the conflict upon counsel's performance was clear to the judge at
the close of the probation revocation proceeding."

4 Justice Stevens asserts that this reading (and presumably Justice

Souter's reading as well, post, at 201), is wrong, post, at 186-187; that
Wood only requires petitioner to show that a real conflict existed, not
that it affected counsel's performance, post, at 187. This is so because we
"unambiguously stated" that a conviction must be reversed whenever the
trial court fails to investigate a potential conflict, post, at 186-187 (citing

Opinion of the Court
tion consistent with the Wood Court's earlier description ofwhy it could not decide the case without a remand: "On the

record before us, we cannot be sure whether counsel wasinfluenced in his basic strategic decisions by the interests
of the employer who hired him. If this was the case, thedue process rights of petitioners were not respected . . . ."
450 U. S., at 272 (emphasis added). The notion that Woodcreated a new rule

sub silentio--and in a case where certio-rari had been granted on an entirely different question, and

the parties had neither briefed nor argued the conflict-of-interest issue--is implausible.

5

Petitioner's proposed rule of automatic reversal whenthere existed a conflict that did not affect counsel's performance, but the trial judge failed to make the Sullivan-mandated inquiry, makes little policy sense. As discussed,
the rule applied when the trial judge is not aware of the
Wood footnote). As we have explained earlier, n. 3, supra, this dictum
simply contradicts the remand order in Wood.

5 We have used "actual conflict of interest" elsewhere to mean what was

required to be shown in Sullivan. See United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.
648, 662, n. 31 (1984) ("[W]e have presumed prejudice when counsel labors
under an actual conflict of interest . . . . See Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S.
335 (1980)"). And we have used "conflict of interest" to mean a division
of loyalties that affected counsel's performance. In Holloway, 435 U. S.,
at 482, we described our earlier opinion in Glasser v. United States, 315
U. S. 60 (1942), as follows:

"The record disclosed that Stewart failed to cross-examine a Government witness whose testimony linked Glasser with the conspiracy and
failed to object to the admission of arguably inadmissible evidence. This
failure was viewed by the Court as a result of Stewart's desire to protect
Kretske's interests, and was thus `indicative of Stewart's struggle to serve
two masters . . . .' [315 U. S.], at 75. After identifying this conflict of
interests, the Court declined to inquire whether the prejudice flowing from
it was harmless and instead ordered Glasser's conviction reversed." (Emphasis added.)

Thus, the Sullivan standard is not properly read as requiring inquiry into
actual conflict as something separate and apart from adverse effect. An
"actual conflict," for Sixth Amendment purposes, is a conflict of interest
that adversely affects counsel's performance.

Opinion of the Court
conflict (and thus not obligated to inquire) is that prejudicewill be presumed only if the conflict has significantly affected

counsel's performance--thereby rendering the verdict unre-liable, even though

Strickland prejudice cannot be shown.
See Sullivan, supra, at 348-349. The trial court's aware-ness of a potential conflict neither renders it more likely that

counsel's performance was significantly affected nor in any
other way renders the verdict unreliable. Cf. United Statesv.

Cronic, 466 U. S., at 662, n. 31. Nor does the trial judge's
failure to make the Sullivan-mandated inquiry often make itharder for reviewing courts to determine conflict and effect,

particularly since those courts may rely on evidence and testimony whose importance only becomes established at the
trial.

Nor, finally, is automatic reversal simply an appropriate
means of enforcing Sullivan's mandate of inquiry. Despite
Justice Souter's belief that there must be a threat of sanction (to wit, the risk of conferring a windfall upon the defendant) in order to induce "resolutely obdurate" trial judges to
follow the law, post, at 208, we do not presume that judges
are as careless or as partial as those police officers who need
the incentive of the exclusionary rule, see United States v.
Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 916-917 (1984). And in any event, the
Sullivan standard, which requires proof of effect upon representation but (once such effect is shown) presumes prejudice,
already creates an "incentive" to inquire into a potential conflict. In those cases where the potential conflict is in fact an
actual one, only inquiry will enable the judge to avoid all
possibility of reversal by either seeking waiver or replacing
a conflicted attorney. We doubt that the deterrence of "judicial dereliction" that would be achieved by an automatic reversal rule is significantly greater.

Since this was not a case in which (as in Holloway) counsel
protested his inability simultaneously to represent multiple
defendants; and since the trial court's failure to make the
Sullivan-mandated inquiry does not reduce the petitioner's

burden of proof; it was at least necessary, to void the convic-tion, for petitioner to establish that the conflict of interest

adversely affected his counsel's performance. The Court ofAppeals having found no such effect, see 240 F. 3d, at 360,
the denial of habeas relief must be affirmed.

III
Lest today's holding be misconstrued, we note that theonly question presented was the effect of a trial court's failure to inquire into a potential conflict upon the Sullivan rulethat deficient performance of counsel must be shown. The
case was presented and argued on the assumption that (ab-sent some exception for failure to inquire) Sullivan would
be applicable--requiring a showing of defective perform-ance, but not requiring in addition (as Strickland does in
other ineffectiveness-of-counsel cases), a showing of probableeffect upon the outcome of trial. That assumption was not
unreasonable in light of the holdings of Courts of Appeals,which have applied Sullivan "unblinkingly" to "all kinds of
alleged attorney ethical conflicts," Beets v. Scott, 65 F. 3d1258, 1266 (CA5 1995) (en banc). They have invoked the
Sullivan standard not only when (as here) there is a conflictrooted in counsel's obligations to former clients, see, e. g.,
Perillo v. Johnson, 205 F. 3d 775, 797-799 (CA5 2000);
Freund v. Butterworth, 165 F. 3d 839, 858-860 (CA11 1999);Mannhalt v. Reed, 847 F. 2d 576, 580 (CA9 1988); United

States v. Young, 644 F. 2d 1008, 1013 (CA4 1981), but evenwhen representation of the defendant somehow implicates
counsel's personal or financial interests, including a bookdeal, United States v. Hearst, 638 F. 2d 1190, 1193 (CA9
1980), a job with the prosecutor's office, Garcia v. Bunnell,33 F. 3d 1193, 1194-1195, 1198, n. 4 (CA9 1994), the teaching
of classes to Internal Revenue Service agents, United Statesv. Michaud, 925 F. 2d 37, 40-42 (CA1 1991), a romantic "entanglement" with the prosecutor, Summerlin v. Stewart, 267F. 3d 926, 935-941 (CA9 2001), or fear of antagonizing the

Opinion of the Court
trial judge, United States v. Sayan, 968 F. 2d 55, 64-65(CADC 1992).

It must be said, however, that the language of Sullivanitself does not clearly establish, or indeed even support, such
expansive application. "[U]ntil," it said, "a defendant showsthat his counsel actively represented conflicting interests,
he has not established the constitutional predicate for hisclaim of ineffective assistance." 446 U. S., at 350 (emphasis
added). Both Sullivan itself, see id., at 348-349, and Holloway, see 435 U. S., at 490-491, stressed the high probabil-ity of prejudice arising from multiple concurrent representation, and the difficulty of proving that prejudice. See alsoGeer, Representation of Multiple Criminal Defendants: Conflicts of Interest and the Professional Responsibilities of theDefense Attorney, 62 Minn. L. Rev. 119, 125-140 (1978); Lowenthal, Joint Representation in Criminal Cases: A CriticalAppraisal, 64 Va. L. Rev. 939, 941-950 (1978). Not all attorney conflicts present comparable difficulties. Thus, the Fed-eral Rules of Criminal Procedure treat concurrent representation and prior representation differently, requiring a trialcourt to inquire into the likelihood of conflict whenever
jointly charged defendants are represented by a single attor-ney (Rule 44(c)), but not when counsel previously represented another defendant in a substantially related matter,even where the trial court is aware of the prior representation.6 See Sullivan, supra, at 346, n. 10 (citing the Rule).

6 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 44(c) provides:
"Whenever two or more defendants have been jointly charged pursuant
to Rule 8(b) or have been joined for trial pursuant to Rule 13, and are
represented by the same retained or assigned counsel or by retained or
assigned counsel who are associated in the practice of law, the court shall
promptly inquire with respect to such joint representation and shall personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance of
counsel, including separate representation. Unless it appears that there
is good cause to believe no conflict of interest is likely to arise, the court
shall take such measures as may be appropriate to protect each defendant's right to counsel."

Kennedy, J., concurring
This is not to suggest that one ethical duty is more or less
important than another. The purpose of our Holloway and
Sullivan exceptions from the ordinary requirements of
Strickland, however, is not to enforce the Canons of Legal
Ethics, but to apply needed prophylaxis in situations where
Strickland itself is evidently inadequate to assure vindication of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
See Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 165 (1986) ("[B]reach of
an ethical standard does not necessarily make out a denial of
the Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel").
In resolving this case on the grounds on which it was presented to us, we do not rule upon the need for the Sullivan
prophylaxis in cases of successive representation. Whether
Sullivan should be extended to such cases remains, as far
as the jurisprudence of this Court is concerned, an open
question.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
concurring.

In its comprehensive analysis the Court has said all that
is necessary to address the issues raised by the question presented, and I join the opinion in full. The trial judge's
failure to inquire into a suspected conflict is not the kind
of error requiring a presumption of prejudice. We did not
grant certiorari on a second question presented by petitioner: whether, if we rejected his proposed presumption, he
had nonetheless established that a conflict of interest adversely affected his representation. I write separately to
emphasize that the facts of this case well illustrate why a
wooden rule requiring reversal is inappropriate for cases
like this one.

At petitioner's request, the District Court conducted anevidentiary hearing on the conflict claim and issued a thorough opinion, which found that counsel's brief representationof the victim had no effect whatsoever on the course of petitioner's trial. See Mickens v. Greene, 74 F. Supp. 2d 586(ED Va. 1999). The District Court's findings depend upon
credibility judgments made after hearing the testimony of
petitioner's counsel, Bryan Saunders, and other witnesses.As a reviewing court, our role is not to speculate about counsel's motives or about the plausibility of alternative litigationstrategies. Our role is to defer to the District Court's factual findings unless we can conclude they are clearly erroneous. See Lackawanna County District Attorney v. Coss,
532 U. S. 394, 406 (2001) (opinion of O'Connor, J.). The District Court found that Saunders did not believe he had any
obligation to his former client, Timothy Hall, that would
interfere with the litigation. See 74 F. Supp. 2d, at 606
("[T]he Court concludes that, as a factual matter, Saunders
did not believe that any continuing duties to a former client
might interfere with his consideration of all facts and options
for his current client" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). Although the District Court concluded
that Saunders probably did learn some matters that were
confidential, it found that nothing the attorney learned was
relevant to the subsequent murder case. See ibid. ("[T]he
record here confirms that Saunders did not learn any confidential information from Hall that was relevant to Mickens'
defense either on the merits or at sentencing" (emphasis deleted)). Indeed, even if Saunders had learned relevant information, the District Court found that he labored under
the impression he had no continuing duty at all to his deceased client. See id., at 605 ("[T]he record here reflects
that, as far as Saunders was concerned, his allegiance to Hall,
`[e]nded when I walked in the courtroom and they told me
he was dead and the case was gone' ") (quoting Hearing
Tr. 156-157, 218 (Jan. 13, 1999)). While Saunders' belief

may have been mistaken, it establishes that the prior repre-sentation did not influence the choices he made during the

course of the trial. This conclusion is a good example ofwhy a case-by-case inquiry is required, rather than simply
adopting an automatic rule of reversal.Petitioner's description of roads not taken would entail
two degrees of speculation. We would be required to assume that Saunders believed he had a continuing duty to thevictim, and we then would be required to consider whether

in this hypothetical case, the counsel would have beenblocked from pursuing an alternative defense strategy. The
District Court concluded that the prosecution's case, coupled
with the defendant's insistence on testifying, foreclosed the
strategies suggested by petitioner after the fact. According
to the District Court, there was no plausible argument that
the victim consented to sexual relations with his murderer,
given the bruises on the victim's neck, blood marks showing
the victim was stabbed before or during sexual intercourse,
and, most important, petitioner's insistence on testifying at
trial that he had never met the victim. See 74 F. Supp. 2d,
at 607 ("[T]he record shows that other facts foreclosed presentation of consent as a plausible alternative defense strategy"). The basic defense at the guilt phase was that petitioner was not at the scene; this is hardly consistent with the
theory that there was a consensual encounter.

The District Court said the same for counsel's alleged dereliction at the sentencing phase. Saunders' failure to attack
the character of the 17-year-old victim and his mother had
nothing to do with the putative conflict of interest. This
strategy was rejected as likely to backfire, not only by Saunders, but also by his co-counsel, who owed no duty to Hall.
See id., at 608 ("[T]he record here dispels the contention that
the failure to use negative information about Hall is attributable to any conflict of interest on the part of Saunders").
These facts, and others relied upon by the District Court,
provide compelling evidence that a theoretical conflict does

not establish a constitutional violation, even when the con-flict is one about which the trial judge should have known.

The constitutional question must turn on whether trialcounsel had a conflict of interest that hampered the representation, not on whether the trial judge should have been moreassiduous in taking prophylactic measures. If it were otherwise, the judge's duty would not be limited to cases wherethe attorney is suspected of harboring a conflict of interest.
The Sixth Amendment protects the defendant against an in-effective attorney, as well as a conflicted one. See

Strick-land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 685-686 (1984). It would

be a major departure to say that the trial judge must stepin every time defense counsel appears to be providing ineffective assistance, and indeed, there is no precedent to sup-port this proposition. As the Sixth Amendment guarantees
the defendant the assistance of counsel, the infringement ofthat right must depend on a deficiency of the lawyer, not of
the trial judge. There is no reason to presume this guaran-tee unfulfilled when the purported conflict has had no effect
on the representation.With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
This case raises three uniquely important questions abouta fundamental component of our criminal justice system--

the constitutional right of a person accused of a capital of-fense to have the effective assistance of counsel for his defense.1 The first is whether a capital defendant's attorney

1 The Sixth Amendment provides: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his
defence." This protection is applicable to state, as well as federal, criminal proceedings. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). We have
long recognized the paramount importance of the right to effective assistance of counsel. United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 653-654 (1984)
(" `Of all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented
by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects his ability to assert
any other rights he may have' " (citation omitted)).

Stevens, J., dissenting
has a duty to disclose that he was representing the defendant's alleged victim at the time of the murder. Second, is
whether, assuming disclosure of the prior representation, the
capital defendant has a right to refuse the appointment of
the conflicted attorney. Third, is whether the trial judge,
who knows or should know of such prior representation, has
a duty to obtain the defendant's consent before appointing
that lawyer to represent him. Ultimately, the question presented by this case is whether, if these duties exist and if all
of them are violated, there exist "circumstances that are so
likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their
effect in a particular case is unjustified." United States v.
Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984).

I
The first critical stage in the defense of a capital case is
the series of pretrial meetings between the accused and his
counsel when they decide how the case should be defended.
A lawyer cannot possibly determine how best to represent a
new client unless that client is willing to provide the lawyer
with a truthful account of the relevant facts. When an indigent defendant first meets his newly appointed counsel, he
will often falsely maintain his complete innocence. Truthful
disclosures of embarrassing or incriminating facts are contingent on the development of the client's confidence in the undivided loyalty of the lawyer. Quite obviously, knowledge
that the lawyer represented the victim would be a substantial obstacle to the development of such confidence.

It is equally true that a lawyer's decision to conceal such
an important fact from his new client would have comparable
ramifications. The suppression of communication and truncated investigation that would unavoidably follow from such
a decision would also make it difficult, if not altogether impossible, to establish the necessary level of trust that should

characterize the "delicacy of relation" between attorneyand client.

In this very case, it is likely that Mickens misled his coun-sel, Bryan Saunders, given the fact that Mickens gave false

testimony at his trial denying any involvement in the crimedespite the overwhelming evidence that he had killed Timothy Hall after a sexual encounter. In retrospect, it seemsobvious that the death penalty might have been avoided by
acknowledging Mickens' involvement, but emphasizing theevidence suggesting that their sexual encounter was consensual. Mickens' habeas counsel garnered evidence suggest-ing that Hall was a male prostitute, App. 137, 149, 162, 169;
that the area where Hall was killed was known for prostitu-tion,

id., at 169-170; and that there was no evidence that Hallwas forced to the secluded area where he was ultimately

murdered. An unconflicted attorney could have put for-ward a defense tending to show that Mickens killed Hall only
after the two engaged in consensual sex, but Saunders of-fered no such defense. This was a crucial omission--a finding of forcible sodomy was an absolute prerequisite to Mick-ens' eligibility for the death penalty.

3 Of course, since that

2 Williams v. Reed, 29 F. Cas. 1386, 1390 (No. 17,733) (CC Me. 1824).
Discussing the necessity of full disclosure to the preservation of the
lawyer-client relationship, Justice Story stated: "I agree to the doctrine
urged at the bar, as to the delicacy of the relation of client and attorney,
and the duty of a full, frank, and free disclosure by the latter of every
circumstance, which may be presumed to be material, not merely to the
interests, but to the fair exercise of the judgment, of the client."

3 At the guilt phase, the trial court judge instructed Mickens' jury as

follows: "If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the killing occurred in the commission of, or subsequent to, attempted forcible sodomy . . . [but do find a malicious, willful,
deliberate, premeditated killing], then you shall find the defendant guilty
of first degree murder. If you find the defendant guilty of first degree
murder, then you shall fix his punishment at: (1) Imprisonment for life;
or (2) A specific term of imprisonment, but not less than twenty [20]
years . . . ." App. 58-59.

strategy would have led to conviction of a noncapital offense,counsel would have been unable to persuade the defendant

to divulge the information necessary to support such a de-fense and then ultimately to endorse the strategy unless he
had earned the complete confidence of his client.Saunders' concealment of essential information about his
prior representation of the victim was a severe lapse in hisprofessional duty. The lawyer's duty to disclose his representation of a client related to the instant charge is not onlyintuitively obvious, it is as old as the profession. Consider
this straightforward comment made by Justice Story in 1824:

"An attorney is bound to disclose to his client every ad-verse retainer, and even every prior retainer, which may

affect the discretion of the latter. No man can be sup-posed to be indifferent to the knowledge of facts, which
work directly on his interests, or bear on the freedom ofhis choice of counsel. When a client employs an attorney, he has a right to presume, if the latter be silent onthe point, that he has no engagements, which interfere,
in any degree, with his exclusive devotion to the causeconfided to him; that he has no interest, which may betray his judgment, or endanger his fidelity." Williamsv. Reed, 29 F. Cas. 1386, 1390 (No. 17,733) (CC Me.).

Mickens' lawyer's violation of this fundamental obligation ofdisclosure is indefensible. The relevance of Saunders' prior
representation of Hall to the new appointment was far tooimportant to be concealed.

II
If the defendant is found guilty of a capital offense, theensuing proceedings that determine whether he will be put

to death are critical in every sense of the word. At thoseproceedings, testimony about the impact of the crime on the
victim, including testimony about the character of the victim,may have a critical effect on the jury's decision.

Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991). Because a lawyer's fidu-ciary relationship with his deceased client survives the client's death, Swidler & Berlin v. United States, 524 U. S. 399(1998), Saunders necessarily labored under conflicting obligations that were irreconcilable. He had a duty to protect thereputation and confidences of his deceased client, and a duty
to impeach the impact evidence presented by the prosecutor.4Saunders' conflicting obligations to his deceased client, on
the one hand, and to his living client, on the other, wereunquestionably sufficient to give Mickens the right to insist
on different representation.5 For the "right to counsel guar-anteed by the Constitution contemplates the services of an
attorney devoted solely to the interests of his client," Von
Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U. S. 708, 725 (1948).6 Moreover, inmy judgment, the right to conflict-free counsel is just as

firmly protected by the Constitution as the defendant's right

4 For example, at the time of Hall's death, Saunders was representing
Hall in juvenile court for charges arising out of an incident involving Hall's
mother. She had sworn out a warrant for Hall's arrest charging him with
assault and battery. Despite knowledge of this, Mickens' lawyer offered
no rebuttal to the victim-impact statement submitted by Hall's mother
that " `all [she] lived for was that boy.' " Id., at 297.

5 A group of experts in legal ethics, acting as amici curiae, submit that

the conflict in issue in this case would be nonwaivable pursuant to the
standard articulated in the ABA Ann. Model Rules of Professional Conduct (4th ed. 1999) (hereinafter Model Rule). Brief for Legal Ethicists
et al. as Amici Curiae 16 ("[T]he standard test to determine if a conflict
is non-waiveable is whether a `disinterested lawyer would conclude that
the client should not agree to the representation under the circumstances' " (quoting Model Rule 1.7, Comment 5)). Unfortunately, because
Mickens was not informed of the fact that his appointed attorney was the
lawyer of the alleged victim, the questions whether Mickens would have
waived this conflict and consented to the appointment, or whether governing standards of professional responsibility would have precluded him
from doing so, remain unanswered.

6 Although the conflict in this case is plainly intolerable, I, of course, do

not suggest that every conflict, or every violation of the code of ethics, is
a violation of the Constitution.

critical stage of a criminal trial. At that point in the pro-ceeding, by definition, the defendant has no lawyer to protect
his interests and must rely entirely on the judge. For thatreason it is "the solemn duty of a . . . judge before whom a
defendant appears without counsel to make a thorough in-quiry and to take all steps necessary to insure the fullest
protection of this constitutional right at every stage of theproceedings." Von Moltke, 332 U. S., at 722.

This duty with respect to indigent defendants is far moreimperative than the judge's duty to investigate the possibility of a conflict that arises when retained counsel representseither multiple or successive defendants. It is true that in
a situation of retained counsel, "[u]nless the trial court knowsor reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists,
the court need not initiate an inquiry." Cuyler v. Sullivan,446 U. S. 335, 347 (1980).

8 But when, as was true in this

7 "[W]hen a defendant chooses to have a lawyer manage and present his
case, law and tradition may allocate to the counsel the power to make
binding decisions of trial strategy in many areas. . . . This allocation can
only be justified, however, by the defendant's consent, at the outset, to
accept counsel as his representative. An unwanted counsel `represents'
the defendant only through a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction. Unless the accused has acquiesced in such representation, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for, in a
very real sense, it is not his defense." 422 U. S., at 820-821.

8 Part III of the Court's opinion is a foray into an issue that is not implicated by the question presented. In dicta, the Court states that Sullivan
may not even apply in the first place to successive representations. Ante,
at 175-176. Most Courts of Appeals, however, have applied Sullivan to
claims of successive representation as well as to some insidious conflicts
arising from a lawyer's self-interest. See cases cited ante, at 174-175.
We have done the same. See Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S. 261 (1981) (applying Sullivan to a conflict stemming from a third-party payment arrange535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
case, the judge is not merely reviewing the permissibility ofthe defendants' choice of counsel, but is responsible for making the choice herself, and when she knows or should knowthat a conflict does exist, the duty to make a thorough inquiry is manifest and unqualified.9 Indeed, under far lesscompelling circumstances, we squarely held that when a record discloses the "possibility of a conflict" between the inter-ests of the defendants and the interests of the party paying
their counsel's fees, the Constitution imposes a duty of in-quiry on the state-court judge even when no objection was
made. Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S. 261, 267, 272 (1981).

Mickens had a constitutional right to the services of anattorney devoted solely to his interests. That right was violated. The lawyer who did represent him had a duty to dis-close his prior representation of the victim to Mickens and
to the trial judge. That duty was violated. When Mickenshad no counsel, the trial judge had a duty to "make a thorough inquiry and to take all steps necessary to insure thefullest protection of " his right to counsel.

Von Moltke, 332

ment). Neither we nor the Courts of Appeals have applied this standard
"unblinkingly," as the Court accuses, ante, at 174, but rather have relied
upon principled reason. When a conflict of interest, whether multiple,
successive, or otherwise, poses so substantial a risk that a lawyer's representation would be materially and adversely affected by diverging interests or loyalties and the trial court judge knows of this and yet fails to
inquire, it is a "[c]ircumstanc[e] of [such] magnitude" that "the likelihood
that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without
inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial." Cronic, 466 U. S., at 659-660.

9 There is no dispute before us as to the appointing judge's knowledge.

The court below assumed, arguendo, that the judge who, upon Hall's death,
dismissed Saunders from his representation of Hall and who then three
days later appointed Saunders to represent Mickens in the killing of Hall
"reasonably should have known that Saunders labored under a potential
conflict of interest arising from his previous representation of Hall." 240
F. 3d 348, 357 (CA4 2001). This assumption has not been challenged.

186 MICKENS v. TAYLOR

Stevens, J., dissenting
U. S., at 722. Despite knowledge of the lawyer's prior rep-resentation, she violated that duty.

We will never know whether Mickens would have receivedthe death penalty if those violations had not occurred nor
precisely what effect they had on Saunders' representationof Mickens.

10 We do know that he did not receive the kind

of representation that the Constitution guarantees. IfMickens had been represented by an attorney-impostor who

never passed a bar examination, we might also be unable todetermine whether the impostor's educational shortcomings
" `actually affected the adequacy of his representation.' "
Ante, at 171 (emphasis deleted). We would, however, surelyset aside his conviction if the person who had represented

him was not a real lawyer. Four compelling reasons makesetting aside the conviction the proper remedy in this case.

First, it is the remedy dictated by our holdings in Hol-loway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475 (1978), Cuyler v. Sullivan,
446 U. S. 335 (1980), and Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S. 261(1981). In this line of precedent, our focus was properly
upon the duty of the trial court judge to inquire into a poten-tial conflict. This duty was triggered either via defense
counsel's objection, as was the case in Holloway, or someother "special circumstances" whereby the serious potential
for conflict was brought to the attention of the trial courtjudge.

Sullivan, 446 U. S., at 346. As we unambiguouslystated in Wood, "Sullivan mandates a reversal when the

trial court has failed to make an inquiry even though it`knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict

10 I disagree with the Court's assertion that the inquiry mandated by
Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), will not aid in the determination
of conflict and effect. Ante, at 171. As we have stated, "the evil [of
conflict-ridden counsel] is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to
refrain from doing, . . . [making it] difficult to judge intelligently the impact of a conflict on the attorney's representation of a client." Holloway
v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475, 490-491 (1978). An adequate inquiry by the
appointing or trial court judge will augment the record thereby making it
easier to evaluate the impact of the conflict.

exists.' " 450 U. S., at 272, n. 18. It is thus wrong for theCourt to interpret Justice Powell's language as referring

only to a division of loyalties "that affected counsel's per-formance." Ante, at 171, and n. 3 (emphasis deleted).

11

Wood nowhere hints of this meaning of "actual conflict ofinterest" 450 U. S., at 273, nor does it reference Sullivan

in "shorthand," ante, at 171. Rather, Wood cites Sullivanexplicitly in order to make a factual distinction: In a circumstance, such as in Wood, in which the judge knows or shouldknow of the conflict, no showing of adverse effect is required.
But when, as in Sullivan, the judge lacked this knowledge,such a showing is required.

Wood, 450 U. S., at 272-274.12

11 The Court concedes that if Mickens' attorney had objected to the appointment based upon the conflict of interest and the trial court judge had
failed to inquire, then reversal without inquiry into adverse effect would
be required. Ante, at 173-174. The Court, in addition to ignoring the
mandate of Wood, reads Sullivan too narrowly. In Sullivan we did not
ask only whether an objection was made in order to ascertain whether
the trial court had a duty to inquire. Rather, we stated that "[n]othing
in the circumstances of this case indicates that the trial court had a duty
to inquire whether there was a conflict of interest. The provision of separate trials for Sullivan and his codefendants significantly reduced the potential for a divergence in their interests. No participant in Sullivan's
trial ever objected to the multiple representation. . . . On these facts,
we conclude that the Sixth Amendment imposed upon the trial court no
affirmative duty to inquire into the propriety of multiple representation."
446 U. S., at 347-348.

It is also counter to our precedent to treat all Sixth Amendment challenges involving conflicts of interest categorically, without inquiry into the
surrounding factual circumstances. In Cronic, we cited Holloway as an
example of a case involving "surrounding circumstances [making] it so
unlikely that any lawyer could provide effective assistance that ineffectiveness was properly presumed without inquiry into actual performance
at trial." Cronic, 466 U. S., at 661, and n. 28. The surrounding circumstances in the present case were far more egregious than those requiring
reversal in either Holloway or Wood.

12 Because the appointing judge knew of the conflict, there is no need in

this case to decide what should be done when the judge neither knows,
nor should know, about the existence of an intolerable conflict. Nevertheless the Court argues that it makes little sense to reverse automatically

188 MICKENS v. TAYLOR

Stevens, J., dissenting
Second, it is the only remedy that responds to the real
possibility that Mickens would not have received the death
penalty if he had been represented by conflict-free counsel
during the critical stage of the proceeding in which he first
met with his lawyer. We should presume that the lawyer
for the victim of a brutal homicide is incapable of establishing the kind of relationship with the defendant that is essential to effective representation.

Third, it is the only remedy that is consistent with the
legal profession's historic and universal condemnation of the
representation of conflicting interests without the full disclosure and consent of all interested parties.13 The Court's
novel and nai"ve assumption that a lawyer's divided loyalties

upon a showing of actual conflict when the trial court judge knows (or
reasonably should know) of a potential conflict and yet has failed to inquire, but not to do so when the trial court judge does not know of the
conflict. Ante, at 172-173. Although it is true that the defendant faces
the same potential for harm as a result of a conflict in either instance, in
the former case the court committed the error and in the latter the harm
is entirely attributable to the misconduct of defense counsel. A requirement that the defendant show adverse effect when the court committed
no error surely does not justify such a requirement when the court did
err. It is the Court's rule that leads to an anomalous result. Under the
Court's analysis, if defense counsel objects to the appointment, reversal
without inquiry into adverse effect is required. Ante, at 173-174. But
counsel's failure to object posed a greater--not a lesser--threat to Mickens' Sixth Amendment right. Had Saunders objected to the appointment,
Mickens would at least have been apprised of the conflict.

13 Every state bar in the country has an ethical rule prohibiting a lawyer

from undertaking a representation that involves a conflict of interest
unless the client has waived the conflict. University Publications of
America, National Reporter on Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Vols. I-IV (2001) (reprinting the professional responsibility codes for
the 50 States). See also Model Rule 1.7, at 91-92, Comments 3 and 4 ("As
a general proposition, loyalty to a client prohibits undertaking representation directly adverse to that client without that client's consent. . . . Loyalty to a client is also impaired when a lawyer cannot consider, recommend
or carry out an appropriate course of action for the client because of the
lawyer's other responsibilities or interests").

are acceptable unless it can be proved that they actually af-fected counsel's performance is demeaning to the profession.

Finally, "justice must satisfy the appearance of justice."
Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11, 14 (1954). Setting aside
Mickens' conviction is the only remedy that can maintainpublic confidence in the fairness of the procedures employed

in capital cases. Death is a different kind of punishment
from any other that may be imposed in this country. "Fromthe point of view of the defendant, it is different in both its

severity and its finality. From the point of view of society,the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its
citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimatestate action. It is of vital importance to the defendant and
to the community that any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion." Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357-
358 (1977). A rule that allows the State to foist a murder
victim's lawyer onto his accused is not only capricious; it poisons the integrity of our adversary system of justice.

I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, dissenting.
A judge who knows or should know that counsel for a
criminal defendant facing, or engaged in, trial has a potential
conflict of interests is obliged to enquire into the potential
conflict and assess its threat to the fairness of the proceeding. See Wheat v. United States, 486 U. S. 153, 160 (1988);
Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S. 261, 272 (1981); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 347 (1980). Cf. Holloway v. Arkansas,
435 U. S. 475, 484 (1978). Unless the judge finds that the
risk of inadequate representation is too remote for further
concern, or finds that the defendant has intelligently assumed the risk and waived any potential Sixth or Fourteenth
Amendment claim of inadequate counsel, the court must see
that the lawyer is replaced. See ibid.; Glasser v. United
States, 315 U. S. 60, 70 (1942). Cf. Wheat, supra, at 162; Ad535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

visory Committee's Notes on 1979 Amendments to Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 44(c), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 1655.

The District Judge reviewing the federal habeas petition
in this case found that the state judge who appointed Bryan
Saunders to represent petitioner Mickens on a capital murder charge knew or should have known that obligations
stemming from Saunders's prior representation of the victim, Timothy Hall, potentially conflicted with duties entailed
by defending Mickens.1 Mickens v. Greene, 74 F. Supp. 2d
586, 613-615 (ED Va. 1999). The state judge was therefore
obliged to look further into the extent of the risk and, if
necessary, either secure Mickens's knowing and intelligent
assumption of the risk or appoint a different lawyer. The
state judge, however, did nothing to discharge her constitutional duty of care. Id., at 614. In the one case in which
we have devised a remedy for such judicial dereliction, we
held that the ensuing judgment of conviction must be reversed and the defendant afforded a new trial. Holloway,

1 The parties do not dispute that the appointing judge in this case knew
or reasonably should have known that Saunders had represented Hall on
assault and battery charges brought against him by his mother and a separate concealed-weapon charge at the time of his murder. Lodging to App.
390, 393. The name "BRYAN SAUNDERS," in large, handwritten letters, was prominently visible as the appointed lawyer on a one-page docket
sheet four inches above where the judge signed her name and wrote: "Remove from docket. Def[endant] deceased." Id., at 390. The same judge
then called Saunders the next business day to ask if he would "do her a
favor" and represent the only person charged with having killed the victim. App. 142. And, if that were not enough, Mickens's arrest warrants,
which were apparently before the judge when she appointed Saunders,
charged Mickens with the murder, " `on or about March 30, 1992,' " of
" `Timothy Jason Hall, white male, age 17.' " Mickens v. Greene, 74 F.
Supp. 2d 586, 614 (ED Va. 1999). The juvenile-court judge, whom circumstances had thrust into the unusual position of having to appoint counsel in a notorious capital case, certainly knew or had reason to know of
the possibility that Saunders's 14-day representation of the murder victim,
up to the start of the previous business day, may have created a risk of
impairing his representation of Mickens in his upcoming murder trial.

supra, at 491; see also Wood, supra, at 272, n. 18. Thatshould be the result here.

I
The Court today holds, instead, that Mickens should bedenied this remedy because Saunders failed to employ a formal objection as a means of bringing home to the appointingjudge the risk of conflict.

Ante, at 173-174. Without anobjection, the majority holds, Mickens should get no relief

absent a showing that the risk turned into an actual conflictwith adverse effect on the representation provided to Mickens at trial. Ibid. But why should an objection matterwhen even without an objection the state judge knew or
should have known of the risk and was therefore obliged toenquire further? What would an objection have added to
the obligation the state judge failed to honor? The majoritysays that in circumstances like those now before us, we have
already held such an objection necessary for reversal, absentproof of actual conflict with adverse effect, so that this case
calls simply for the application of precedent, albeit precedentnot very clearly stated.

Ante, at 171-172.The majority's position is error, resting on a mistaken

reading of our cases. Three are on point, Holloway v.Arkansas, supra; Cuyler v. Sullivan, supra; and Wood v.
Georgia, supra.In

Holloway, a trial judge appointed one public defenderto represent three criminal defendants tried jointly. 435

U. S., at 477. Three weeks before trial, counsel moved forseparate representation; the court held a hearing and denied
the motion. Ibid. The lawyer moved again for appoint-ment of separate counsel before the jury was empaneled,
on the ground that one or two of the defendants were consid-ering testifying at trial, in which event the one lawyer's ability to cross-examine would be inhibited. Id., at 478. Thecourt again denied his motion. Ibid. After the prosecution
rested, counsel objected to the joint representation a thirdtime, advising the court that all three defendants had de535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
cided to testify; again the court refused to appoint separate
lawyers. Id., at 478-480. The defendants gave inconsistent testimony and were convicted on all counts. Id., at 481.

This Court held that the motions apprised the trial judge
of a "risk" that continuing the joint representation would
subject defense counsel in the pending trial to the impossible
obligations of simultaneously furthering the conflicting interests of the several defendants, id., at 484, and we reversed
the convictions on the basis of the judge's failure to respond
to the prospective conflict, without any further showing of
harm, id., at 491. In particular, we rejected the argument
that a defendant tried subject to such a disclosed risk should
have to show actual prejudice caused by subsequent conflict.
Id., at 488. We pointed out that conflicts created by multiple representation characteristically deterred a lawyer from
taking some step that he would have taken if unconflicted,
and we explained that the consequent absence of footprints
would often render proof of prejudice virtually impossible.
Id., at 489-491.

Next came Sullivan, involving multiple representation by
two retained lawyers of three defendants jointly indicted but
separately tried, 446 U. S., at 337. Sullivan, the defendant
at the first trial, had consented to joint representation by the
same lawyers retained by the two other accused, because
he could not afford counsel of his own. Ibid. Sullivan was
convicted of murder; the other two were acquitted in their
subsequent trials. Id., at 338. Counsel made no objection
to the multiple representation before or during trial, ibid.;
nor did the convicted defendant argue that the trial judge
otherwise knew or should have known of the risk described
in Holloway, that counsel's representation might be impaired
by conflicting obligations to the defendants to be tried later,
446 U. S., at 343.

This Court held that multiple representation did not raise
enough risk of impaired representation in a coming trial to

535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

193Cite as: 535 U. S. 162 (2002)
Souter, J., dissenting
trigger a trial court's duty to enquire further, in the absenceof "special circumstances."

2 Id., at 346. The most obvious

special circumstance would be an objection. See Holloway,supra, at 488. Indeed, because multiple representation was

not suspect per se, and because counsel was in the best posi-tion to anticipate a risk of conflict, the Court spoke at one
point as though nothing but an objection would place a courton notice of a prospective conflict.

Sullivan, 446 U. S., at348 ("[A] defendant who raised no objection at trial must

demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely af-fected his lawyer's performance" (footnote omitted)). But
the Court also explained that courts must rely on counsel in"large measure," id., at 347, that is, not exclusively, and it
spoke in general terms of a duty to enquire that arises when"the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists," 3 ibid. (footnote omitted). Accord2 The constitutional rule binding the state courts is thus more lenient
than Rule 44(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which
provides:

"Whenever two or more defendants have been jointly charged pursuant
to Rule 8(b) or have been joined for trial pursuant to Rule 13, and are
represented by the same retained or assigned counsel or by retained or
assigned counsel who are associated in the practice of law, the court shall
promptly inquire with respect to such joint representation and shall personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance of
counsel, including separate representation. Unless it appears that there
is good cause to believe no conflict of interest is likely to arise, the court
shall take such measures as may be appropriate to protect each defendant's right to counsel."

See Wheat v. United States, 486 U. S. 153, 161 (1988).
3 By "particular conflict" the Court was clearly referring to a risk of

conflict detectable on the horizon rather than an "actual conflict" that had
already adversely affected the defendant's representation. The Court
had just cited and quoted Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475 (1978),
which held that the judge was obligated to enquire into the risk of a prospective conflict, id., at 484. This reading is confirmed by the Sullivan
Court's subsequent terminology: Because the trial judge in Sullivan had
had no duty to enquire into "a particular conflict" upon notice of multiple

535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN
194 MICKENS v. TAYLOR

Souter, J., dissenting
ingly, the Court did not rest the result simply on the failure
of counsel to object, but said instead that "[n]othing in the
circumstances of this case indicates that the trial court had
a duty to inquire whether there was a conflict of interest,"
ibid. For that reason, it held respondent bound to show
"that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of
his representation." Id., at 349.

The different burdens on the Holloway and Sullivan defendants are consistent features of a coherent scheme for
dealing with the problem of conflicted defense counsel; a prospective risk of conflict subject to judicial notice is treated
differently from a retrospective claim that a completed proceeding was tainted by conflict, although the trial judge had
not been derelict in any duty to guard against it. When
the problem comes to the trial court's attention before any
potential conflict has become actual, the court has a duty to
act prospectively to assess the risk and, if the risk is not too
remote, to eliminate it or to render it acceptable through
a defendant's knowing and intelligent waiver. This duty is
something more than the general responsibility to rule without committing legal error; it is an affirmative obligation to
investigate a disclosed possibility that defense counsel will
be unable to act with uncompromised loyalty to his client.
It was the judge's failure to fulfill that duty of care to enquire
further and do what might be necessary that the Holloway
Court remedied by vacating the defendant's subsequent conviction. 435 U. S., at 487, 491. The error occurred when
the judge failed to act, and the remedy restored the defendrepresentation alone, the convicted defendant could get no relief without
showing "actual conflict" with "adverse effect." 446 U. S., at 347-350.

Of course, a judge who gets wind of conflict during trial may have to
enquire in both directions: prospectively to assess the risk of conflict if the
lawyer remains in place; if there is no such risk requiring removal and
mistrial, conversely, the judge may have to enquire retrospectively to see
whether a conflict has actually affected the defendant adversely. See
infra, at 202.

Souter, J., dissenting
ant to the position he would have occupied if the judge hadtaken reasonable steps to fulfill his obligation. But when

the problem of conflict comes to judicial attention not pro-spectively, but only after the fact, the defendant must show
an actual conflict with adverse consequence to him in orderto get relief.

Sullivan, supra, at 349. Fairness requires
nothing more, for no judge was at fault in allowing a trial to
proceed even though fraught with hidden risk.In light of what the majority holds today, it bears repeating that, in this coherent scheme established by Hollowayand

Sullivan, there is nothing legally crucial about an objection by defense counsel to tell a trial judge that conflicting
interests may impair the adequacy of counsel's representation. Counsel's objection in Holloway was important as a
fact sufficient to put the judge on notice that he should enquire. In most multiple-representation cases, it will take
just such an objection to alert a trial judge to prospective
conflict, and the Sullivan Court reaffirmed that the judge is
obliged to take reasonable prospective action whenever a
timely objection is made. 446 U. S., at 346. But the Court
also indicated that an objection is not required as a matter
of law: "Unless the trial court knows or reasonably should
know that a particular conflict exists, the court need not initiate an enquiry." Id., at 347. The Court made this clear
beyond cavil 10 months later when Justice Powell, the same
Justice who wrote the Sullivan opinion, explained in Wood
v. Georgia that Sullivan "mandates a reversal when the trial
court has failed to make an inquiry even though it `knows or
reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists.' "
450 U. S., at 272, n. 18 (emphasis in original).

Since the District Court in this case found that the state
judge was on notice of a prospective potential conflict, 74
F. Supp. 2d, at 613-615, this case calls for nothing more than
the application of the prospective notice rule announced and
exemplified by Holloway and confirmed in Sullivan and
Wood. The remedy for the judge's dereliction of duty

196 MICKENS v. TAYLOR

Souter, J., dissenting
should be an order vacating the conviction and affording anew trial.

But in the majority's eyes, this conclusion takes insuffi-cient account of

Wood, whatever may have been the sensible
scheme staked out by Holloway and Sullivan, with a defend-ant's burden turning on whether a court was apprised of a

conflicts problem prospectively or retrospectively. The majority says that Wood holds that the distinction is betweencases where counsel objected and all other cases, regardless

of whether a trial court was put on notice prospectively insome way other than by an objection on the record. See
ante, at 172-174. In Wood, according to the majority, the
trial court had notice, there was no objection on the record,
and the defendant was required to show actual conflict and
adverse effect.

Wood is not easy to read, and I believe the majority misreads it. The first step toward seeing where the majority
goes wrong is to recall that the Court in Wood said outright
what I quoted before, that Sullivan "mandates a reversal
when the trial court has failed to make an inquiry even
though it `knows or reasonably should know that a particular
conflict exists.' " 450 U. S., at 272, n. 18. This statement of
a trial judge's obligation, like the statement in Sullivan that
it quoted, 446 U. S., at 347, said nothing about the need for
an objection on the record. True, says the majority, but the
statement was dictum to be disregarded as "inconsistent"
with Wood's holding. Ante, at 168-169, n. 2. This is a polite way of saying that the Wood Court did not know what it
was doing; that it stated the general rule of reversal for failure to enquire when on notice (as in Holloway), but then
turned around and held that such a failure called for reversal
only when the defendant demonstrated an actual conflict (as
in Sullivan).

This is not what happened. Wood did not hold that in the
absence of objection, the Sullivan rule governs even when a
judge is prospectively on notice of a risk of conflicted counsel.

Careful attention to Wood shows that the case did not involve prospective notice of risk unrealized, and that it held
nothing about the general rule to govern in such circumstances. What Wood did decide was how to deal with a possible conflict of interests that becomes known to the trial
court only at the conclusion of the trial proceeding at which
it may have occurred, and becomes known not to a later
habeas court but to the judge who handed down sentences
at trial, set probation 19 months later after appeals were
exhausted, and held a probation revocation proceeding 4
months after that.4

The Wood defendants were convicted of distributing obscene material as employees of an adult bookstore and theater, after trials at which they were defended by privately
retained counsel. 450 U. S., at 262-263. They were each
ordered to pay fines and sentenced to 12-month prison terms
that were suspended in favor of probation on the condition
that they pay their fines in installments, which they failed to
do. Id., at 263-264. The Wood Court indicated that by the
end of the proceeding to determine whether probation should
be revoked because of the defendants' failure to pay, the
judge was on notice that defense counsel might have been
laboring under a conflict between the interests of the defendant employees and those of their employer, possibly as early
as the time the sentences were originally handed down
nearly two years earlier, App. 11-16 in Wood v. Georgia, O. T.
1979, No. 79-6027 (Mar. 18, 1977, sentencing). See Wood,
450 U. S., at 272 ("at the revocation hearing, or at earlier
stages of the proceedings below"). The fines were so high
that the original sentencing assumption must have been that
the store and theater owner would pay them; defense counsel
was paid by the employer, at least during the trial; the State

pointed out a possible conflict to the judge; 5 and counsel was
attacking the fines with an equal protection argument, which
weakened the strategy more obviously in the defendants' interest, of requesting the court to reduce the fines or defer
their collection. Id., at 272-273. This was enough, according to the Wood Court, to tell the judge that defense counsel
may have been acting to further the owner's desire for a
test case on equal protection, rather than the defendants'
interests in avoiding ruinous fines or incarceration. Ibid.

What is significant is that, as this Court thus described
the circumstances putting the judge on notice, they were not
complete until the revocation hearing was finished (nearly

the conflict in issue here, and so, from the Wood Court's perspective, the
State's objection, though a relevant fact in alerting the judge like the fact
of multiple representation in Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), was
not sufficient to put the judge on notice of his constitutional duty to enquire into a "particular conflict," id., at 347. State's counsel suggested
that in arguing for forgiveness of fines owing to inability to pay, defense
counsel was merely trying to protect the employer from an obligation to
the defendants to pay the fines. App. A to Brief in Opposition in Wood
v. Georgia, O. T. 1979, No. 79-6027, at 14-15, 27-28 (transcript of Jan. 26,
1979, probation revocation hearing). But as to forgiveness of the fines,
the interests of the employer and defendants were aligned; the State's
lawyer argued to the court nonetheless that counsel's allegiance to the
employer prevented him from pressing the employer to honor its obligation to pay, and suggested to the judge that he should appoint separate
counsel to enforce it. Id., at 14. The judge did enquire into this alleged
conflict and accepted defense counsel's rejoinder that such a conflict was
not relevant to a hearing on whether probation should be revoked for
inability to pay and that any such agreement to pay fines for violating the
law would surely be unenforceable as a matter of public policy. Id., at
14-17. The majority is thus mistaken in its claim that the State's objection sufficed to put the court on notice of a duty to enquire as to the
particular conflict of interest to the Wood Court, see ante, at 170-171, n. 3,
unless the majority means to say that mention of any imagined conflict is
sufficient to put a judge on notice of a duty to enquire into the full universe
of possible conflicts.

two years after sentencing) and the judge knew that the law-yer was relying heavily on equal protection instead of arguments for leniency to help the defendants. The Court notedthat counsel stated he had sent a letter to the trial court
after sentencing, saying the fines were more than the defend-ants could afford, id., at 268, n. 13, a move obviously in the
defendants' interest. On the other hand, a reference to"equal protection," which the Court could have taken as a
reflection of the employer's interest, did not occur until thevery end of the revocation hearing. See App. A to Brief in
Opposition in Wood v. Georgia, O. T. 1979, No. 79-6027, at 72(transcript of Jan. 26, 1979, probation revocation hearing).

The Wood Court also knew that a motion stressing equalprotection was not filed by defense counsel until two weeks

after the revocation hearing, on the day before probation wasto be revoked and the defendants locked up, App. 35-36 in
Wood v. Georgia, O. T. 1979, No. 79-6027 (Joint Motions toModify Conditions of Probation Order--Filed Feb. 12, 1979).
450 U. S., at 268. Since, in the Court's view, counsel's em-phasis on the equal protection claim was one of the facts that

6 At one point, about a quarter of the way into the hearing, defense
counsel said: "And I think the universal rule is in the United States, because of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution,
legal protection, you cannot, or should not, lock up an accused for failure
to pay a fine; because of his inability or her inability to pay the fine, if that
person, and this is a crucial point, Your Honor, if that person, like to quote
from Bennett versus Harper, was incapable of paying the fine, rather than
refusing and neglecting to do so." App. A to Brief in Opposition in Wood
v. Georgia, O. T. 1979, No. 79-6027, at 19. Defense counsel also cited two
equal protection decisions of this Court, Tate v. Short, 401 U. S. 395 (1971),
and Williams v. Illinois, 399 U. S. 235 (1970); it may very well be that he
meant to say "equal protection" rather than "legal protection" or the latter
was in fact a garbled transcription, but it seems unlikely that the Wood
Court was referring to this statement when it said counsel "was pressing
a constitutional attack rather than making the arguments for leniency,"
450 U. S., at 272, because it was made to supplement, not replace, appeals
to leniency based on the specific financial situations of the individual
defendants.

together put the judge on notice of something amiss, andsince the record shows that it was not clear that counsel was

favoring the equal protection argument until, at the earliest,the very close of the revocation hearing, and more likely the
day he filed his motion two weeks later, the Court could onlyhave meant that the judge was put on notice of a conflict that
may actually have occurred, not of a potential conflict thatmight occur later.

7 At that point, as the Court saw it, there

were only two further facts the judge would have needed toknow to determine whether there had been an actual disqualifying conflict, and those were whether a concern for theinterest of the employer had weakened the lawyer's arguments for leniency, and whether the defendants had beeninformed of the conflict and waived their rights to unconflicted counsel.This Court, of course, was in no position to resolve these
remaining issues in the first instance. Whether the lawyer'sfailure to press more aggressively for leniency was caused
by a conflicting interest, for example, had never been ex-plored at the trial level and there was no record to consult
on the point.8 In deciding what to do, the Wood Court had

7 The phrasing of the remand instruction confirms the conclusion that
the Wood Court perceived the duty to enquire neglected by the judge as
retrospective in nature: The "[state] court [on remand] should hold a hearing to determine whether the conflict of interest that this record strongly
suggests actually existed at the time of the probation revocation or earlier." Id., at 273. From the Court's vantage point, another compelling
reason for suspecting a conflict of interests was the fact that the employer
apparently paid for the appeal, in which counsel argued the equal protection question only, id., at 267, n. 11; but, of course, this would have been
unknown to the judge at the revocation hearing.

8 There was certainly cause for reasonable disagreement on the issue.

As Justice White pointed out, absent relevant evidence in the record, it
was reasonable that the employer might have refused to pay because the
defendants were no longer employees, or because it no longer owned adult
establishments. Id., at 282-283, and n. 9 (dissenting opinion). Indeed,
counsel said that he was no longer paid by the employer for his representa535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

two established procedural models to look to: Holloway'sprocedure of vacating judgment

9 when a judge had failed to

enquire into a prospective conflict, and Sullivan's procedureof determining whether the conflict that may well have occurred had actually occurred with some adverse effect.Treating the case as more like Sullivan and remanding
was obviously the correct choice. Wood was not like Holloway, in which the judge was put on notice of a risk beforetrial, that is, a prospective possibility of conflict. It was,

rather, much closer to Sullivan, since any notice to a courtwent only to a conflict, if there was one, that had pervaded
a completed trial proceeding extending over two years. Theonly difference between Wood and Sullivan was that, in
Wood, the signs that a conflict may have occurred were clearto the judge at the close of the probation revocation proceeding, whereas the claim of conflict in Sullivan was not raiseduntil after judgment in a separate habeas proceeding, see
446 U. S., at 338. The duty of the Wood judge could onlyhave been to enquire into the past (what had happened two
years earlier at sentencing, the setting of probation 19
months later, the ensuing failures to pay, and the testimonythat had already been given at the revocation hearing), just

like the responsibility of the state and federal habeas courtsreviewing the record in

Sullivan in postconviction proceedings, see 446 U. S., at 338-339. Since the Wood judge's dutywas unlike the

Holloway judge's obligation to take care for
the future, it would have made no sense for the Wood Courtto impose a

Holloway remedy.
The disposition in Wood therefore raises no doubt aboutthe consistency of the

Wood Court. Contrary to the majorition of the defendants once they were put on probation, id., at 281, n. 7
(White, J., dissenting).

9 In this case, the order would have been to vacate the commitment

order based on the probation violation, and perhaps even the antecedent
fine. See id., at 274, n. 21 (majority opinion).

ty's conclusion, see ante, at 168-169, n. 2, there was no tension at all between acknowledging the rule of reversal to be
applied when a judge fails to enquire into a known risk of
prospective conflict, Wood, 450 U. S., at 272, n. 18, while at
the same time sending the Wood case itself back for a determination about actual, past conflict, id., at 273-274. Wood
simply followed and confirmed the pre-existing scheme established by Holloway and Sullivan. When a risk of conflict appears before a proceeding has been held or completed
and a judge fails to make a prospective enquiry, the remedy
is to vacate any subsequent judgment against the defendant.
See Holloway, 435 U. S., at 491. When the possibility of
conflict does not appear until a proceeding is over and any
enquiry must be retrospective, a defendant must show actual
conflict with adverse effect. See Sullivan, supra, at 349.

Wood, then, does not affect the conclusion that would be
reached here on the basis of Holloway and Sullivan. This
case comes to us with the finding that the judge who appointed Saunders knew or should have known of the risk
that he would be conflicted owing to his prior appointment
to represent the victim of the crime, 74 F. Supp. 2d, at 613-
615; see n. 1, supra. We should, therefore, follow the law
settled until today, in vacating the conviction and affording
Mickens a new trial.

II

Since the majority will not leave the law as it is, however,
the question is whether there is any merit in the rule it now
adopts, of treating breaches of a judge's duty to enquire into
prospective conflicts differently depending on whether defense counsel explicitly objected. There is not. The distinction is irrational on its face, it creates a scheme of incentives to judicial vigilance that is weakest in those cases
presenting the greatest risk of conflict and unfair trial, and
it reduces the so-called judicial duty to enquire into so many
empty words.

The most obvious reason to reject the majority's rulestarts with the accepted view that a trial judge placed on

notice of a risk of prospective conflict has an obligation thenand there to do something about it,

Holloway, supra, at 484.
The majority does not expressly repudiate that duty, see
ante, at 167-168, which is too clear for cavil. It should go
without saying that the best time to deal with a known
threat to the basic guarantee of fair trial is before the trialhas proceeded to become unfair. See

Holloway, supra, at
484; Glasser, 315 U. S., at 76. Cf. Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S.375, 386-387 (1966) ( judge's duty to conduct hearing as to

competency to stand trial). It would be absurd, after all, to
suggest that a judge should sit quiescent in the face of an
apparent risk that a lawyer's conflict will render representation illusory and the formal trial a waste of time, emotion,
and a good deal of public money. And as if that were not
bad enough, a failure to act early raises the specter, confronted by the Holloway Court, that failures on the part of
conflicted counsel will elude demonstration after the fact,
simply because they so often consist of what did not happen.
435 U. S., at 490-492. While a defendant can fairly be saddled with the characteristically difficult burden of proving
adverse effects of conflicted decisions after the fact when the
judicial system was not to blame in tolerating the risk of
conflict, the burden is indefensible when a judge was on notice of the risk but did nothing.

With so much at stake, why should it matter how a judge
learns whatever it is that would point out the risk to anyone paying attention? Of course an objection from a
conscientious lawyer suffices to put a court on notice, as
it did in Holloway; and probably in the run of multiplerepresentation cases nothing short of objection will raise the
specter of trouble. But sometimes a wide-awake judge will
not need any formal objection to see a risk of conflict, as the
federal habeas court's finding in this very case shows. 74
F. Supp. 2d, at 613-615. Why, then, pretend contrary to fact

Souter, J., dissenting
that a judge can never perceive a risk unless a lawyer pointsit out? Why excuse a judge's breach of judicial duty just

because a lawyer has fallen down in his own ethics or is shorton competence? Transforming the factually sufficient trigger of a formal objection into a legal necessity for respondingto any breach of judicial duty is irrational.

Nor is that irrationality mitigated by the Government's
effort to analogize the majority's objection requirement tothe general rule that in the absence of plain error litigants

get no relief from error without objection. The Governmentas

amicus argues for making a formal objection crucial because judges are not the only ones obliged to take care for
the integrity of the system; defendants and their counsel
need inducements to help the courts with timely warnings.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9, 26-27. The
fallacy of the Government's argument, however, has been on
the books since Wood was decided. See 450 U. S., at 265,
n. 5 ("It is unlikely that [the lawyer on whom the conflict of
interest charge focused] would concede that he had continued
improperly to act as counsel"). The objection requirement
works elsewhere because the objecting lawyer believes that
he sights an error being committed by the judge or opposing
counsel. See, e. g., United States v. Vonn, ante, at 72-73
(error in judge's Rule 11 plea colloquy). That is hardly the
motive to depend on when the risk of error, if there is one,
is being created by the lawyer himself in acting subject to a
risk of conflict, 227 F. 3d 203, 213-217 (CA4 2000), vacated
en banc, 240 F. 3d 348 (CA4 2001). The law on conflicted
counsel has to face the fact that one of our leading cases
arose after a trial in which counsel may well have kept silent
about conflicts not out of obtuseness or inattention, but for
the sake of deliberately favoring a third party's interest over
the clients, and this very case comes to us with reason to
suspect that Saunders suppressed his conflicts for the sake
of a second fee in a case getting public attention. While the
perceptive and conscientious lawyer (as in Holloway) needs

nothing more than ethical duty to induce an objection, thevenal lawyer is not apt to be reformed by a general rule that

says his client will have an easier time reversing a convictiondown the road if the lawyer calls attention to his own
venality.10The irrationality of taxing defendants with a heavier burden for silent lawyers naturally produces an equally irrational scheme of incentives operating on the judges. Thejudge's duty independent of objection, as described in

Sullivan and Wood, is made concrete by reversal for failure tohonor it. The plain fact is that the specter of reversal for

failure to enquire into risk is an incentive to trial judges tokeep their eyes peeled for lawyers who wittingly or otherwise play loose with loyalty to their clients and the funda-mental guarantee of a fair trial. See

Wheat, 486 U. S., at
161. Cf. Pate, supra, at 386-387 (reversal as remedy forstate trial judge's failure to discharge duty to ensure competency to stand trial). That incentive is needed least when
defense counsel points out the risk with a formal objection,

10 The Government contends that not requiring a showing of adverse
effect in no-objection cases would "provide the defense with a disincentive
to bring conflicts to the attention of the trial court, since remaining silent
could afford a defendant with a reliable ground for reversal in the event
of conviction." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. This argument, of course, has no force whatsoever in the case of the venal conflicted
lawyer who remains silent out of personal self-interest or the obtuse lawyer who stays silent because he could not recognize a conflict if his own
life depended on it. And these are precisely the lawyers presenting the
danger in no-objection cases; the savvy and ethical lawyer would comply
with his professional duty to disclose conflict concerns to the court. But
even assuming the unlikely case of a savvy lawyer who recognizes a potential conflict and does not know for sure whether to object timely on that
basis as a matter of professional ethics, an objection on the record is still
the most reliable factually sufficient trigger of the judicial duty to enquire,
dereliction of which would result in a reversal, and it is therefore beyond
the realm of reasonable conjecture to suggest that such a lawyer would
forgo an objection on the chance that a court in postconviction proceedings
may find an alternative factual basis giving rise to a duty to enquire.

and needed most with the lawyer who keeps risk to himself,quite possibly out of self-interest. Under the majority's

rule, however, it is precisely in the latter situation that thejudge's incentive to take care is at its ebb. With no objection on record, a convicted defendant can get no relief with-out showing adverse effect, minimizing the possibility of a
later reversal and the consequent inducement to judicialcare.

11 This makes no sense.

The Court's rule makes no sense unless, that is, the realpoint of this case is to eliminate the judge's constitutional

duty entirely in no-objection cases, for that is certainly thepractical consequence of today's holding. The defendant has
the same burden to prove adverse effect (and the prospectof reversal is the same) whether the judge has no reason to
know of any risk or every reason to know about it short of

11 Lest anyone be wary that a rule requiring reversal for failure to enquire when on notice would be too onerous a check on trial judges, a survey of Courts of Appeals already applying the Holloway rule in noobjection cases shows a commendable measure of restraint and respect for
the circumstances of fellow judges in state and federal trial courts, finding
the duty to enquire violated only in truly outrageous cases. See, e. g.,
Campbell v. Rice, 265 F. 3d 878, 887-888 (CA9 2001) (reversing conviction
under Holloway when trial judge failed to enquire after the prosecutor
indicated defense counsel had just been arraigned by the prosecutor's office on felony drug charges); United States v. Rogers, 209 F. 3d 139, 145-
146 (CA2 2000) (reversing conviction when District Court failed to enquire
on notice that counsel for defendant alleging police misconduct was a police commissioner); United States v. Allen, 831 F. 2d 1487, 1495-1496 (CA9
1987) (finding Magistrate Judge had reasonably enquired into joint representation of 17 codefendants who entered a group guilty plea, but reversing because the District Court failed to enquire when defense counsel later
gave the court a list "rank[ing] the defendants by their relative culpability"). Under the majority's rule, the defendants in each of these cases
should have proved that there was an actual conflict of interests that adversely affected their representation. Particularly galling in light of the
first two cases is the majority's surprising and unnecessary intimation that
this Court's conflicts jurisprudence should not be available or is somehow
less important to those who allege conflicts in contexts other than multiple
representation. See ante, at 175.

explicit objection.12 In that latter case, the duty explicitlydescribed in Sullivan and Wood becomes just a matter of

words, devoid of sanction; it ceases to be any duty at all.As that duty vanishes, so does the sensible regime under
which a defendant's burden on conflict claims took account ofthe opportunities to ensure against conflicted counsel in the
first place. Convicted defendants had two alternative avenues to show entitlement to relief. A defendant might, first,point to facts indicating that a judge knew or should have

known of a " `particular conflict,' " Wood, 450 U. S., at 272,n. 18 (quoting

Sullivan, 446 U. S., at 347), before that risk
had a chance to play itself out with an adverse result. If hecould not carry the burden to show that the trial judge had

fallen down in the duty to guard against conflicts prospec12 Requiring a criminal defendant to prove a conflict's adverse effect in
all no-objection cases only makes sense on the Court's presumption that
the Sixth Amendment right against ineffective assistance of counsel is at
its core nothing more than a utilitarian right against unprofessional errors
that have detectable effects on outcome. See ante, at 166 ("[I]t also follows that defects in assistance that have no probable effect upon the trial's
outcome do not establish a constitutional violation"). On this view, the
exception in Holloway for objection cases turns solely on the theory that
"harm" can safely be presumed when counsel objects to no avail at the
sign of danger. See ante, at 168. But this Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 693-694 (1984), held that a specific "outcomedeterminative standard" is "not quite appropriate" and spoke instead of
the Sixth Amendment right as one against assistance of counsel that "undermines the reliability of the result of the proceeding," id., at 693, or
"confidence in the outcome," id., at 694. And the Holloway Court said
that once a conflict objection is made and unheeded, the conviction "must
be reversed . . . even if no particular prejudice is shown and even if the
defendant was clearly guilty." 435 U. S., at 489 (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). What is clear from Strickland and Holloway is
that the right against ineffective assistance of counsel has as much to do
with public confidence in the professionalism of lawyers as with the results
of legal proceedings. A revelation that a trusted advocate could not place
his client's interest above the interests of self and others in the satisfaction
of his professional responsibilities will destroy that confidence, regardless
of outcome.

tively, the defendant was required to show, from the perspec-tive of an observer looking back after the allegedly conflicted

representation, that there was an actual conflict of interestswith an adverse effect. The first route was preventive,
meant to avoid the waste of costly after-the-fact litigationwhere the risk was clear and easily avoidable by a reasonably
vigilant trial judge; the second was retrospective, with a
markedly heavier burden justified when the judiciary wasnot at fault, but at least alleviated by dispensing with any

need to show prejudice. Today, the former system has beenskewed against recognizing judicial responsibility. The
judge's duty applies only when a Holloway objection fails toinduce a resolutely obdurate judge to take action upon the
explicit complaint of a lawyer facing impossible demands.In place of the forsaken judicial obligation, we can expect
more time-consuming post-trial litigation like this, and if thiscase is any guide, the added time and expense are unlikely
to purchase much confidence in the judicial system.13

I respectfully dissent.

13 Whether adverse effect was shown was not the question accepted, and
I will not address the issue beyond noting that the case for an adverse
effect appears compelling in at least two respects. Before trial, Saunders
admittedly failed even to discuss with Mickens a trial strategy of reasonable doubt about the forcible sex element, without which death was not a
sentencing option. App. 211-213; see also id., at 219. In that vein, Saunders apparently failed to follow leads by looking for evidence that the
victim had engaged in prostitution, even though the victim's body was
found on a mattress in an area where illicit sex was common. Id., at
202-217; Lodging to App. 397-398. There may be doubt whether these
failures were the result of incompetence or litigation strategy rather than
a conflicting duty of loyalty to the victim or to self to avoid professional
censure for failing to disclose the conflict risk to Mickens (though strategic
choice seems unlikely given that Saunders did not even raise the possibility of a consent defense as an option to be considered). But there is little
doubt as to the course of the second instance of alleged adverse effect:
Saunders knew for a fact that the victim's mother had initiated charges of
assault and battery against her son just before he died because Saunders
had been appointed to defend him on those very charges, id., at 390 and

The Commonwealth of Virginia seeks to put the petitioner,Walter Mickens, Jr., to death after having appointed to represent him as his counsel a lawyer who, at the time of themurder, was representing the very person Mickens was accused of killing. I believe that, in a case such as this one, acategorical approach is warranted and automatic reversal is
required. To put the matter in language this Court has pre-viously used: By appointing this lawyer to represent Mickens, the Commonwealth created a "structural defect affect-ing the framework within which the trial [and sentencing]
proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial processitself."

Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991).The parties spend a great deal of time disputing how this

Court's precedents of Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475(1978), Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), and Wood v.
Georgia, 450 U. S. 261 (1981), resolve the case. Those prece-dents involve the significance of a trial judge's "failure to
inquire" if that judge "knew or should have known" of a "po-tential" conflict. The majority and dissenting opinions dispute the meaning of these cases as well. Although I expressno view at this time about how our precedents should treat
most ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims involving analleged conflict of interest (or, for that matter, whether
Holloway, Sullivan, and Wood provide a sensible or coher-ent framework for dealing with those cases at all), I am convinced that this case is not governed by those precedents,for the following reasons.

210 MICKENS v. TAYLOR

Breyer, J., dissenting
First, this is the kind of representational incompatibilitythat is egregious on its face. Mickens was represented by

the murder victim's lawyer; that lawyer had represented thevictim on a criminal matter; and that lawyer's representation
of the victim had continued until one business day before thelawyer was appointed to represent the defendant.

Second, the conflict is exacerbated by the fact that it occurred in a capital murder case. In a capital case, the evi-dence submitted by both sides regarding the victim's character may easily tip the scale of the jury's choice between lifeor death. Yet even with extensive investigation in post-trial
proceedings, it will often prove difficult, if not impossible, to
determine whether the prior representation affected defense
counsel's decisions regarding, for example: which avenues to
take when investigating the victim's background; which witnesses to call; what type of impeachment to undertake;
which arguments to make to the jury; what language to use
to characterize the victim; and, as a general matter, what
basic strategy to adopt at the sentencing stage. Given the
subtle forms that prejudice might take, the consequent difficulty of proving actual prejudice, and the significant likelihood that it will nonetheless occur when the same lawyer
represents both accused killer and victim, the cost of litigating the existence of actual prejudice in a particular case cannot be easily justified. Cf. United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.
648, 657-658 (1984) (explaining the need for categorical approach in the event of "actual breakdown of the adversarial
process").

Third, the Commonwealth itself created the conflict in the
first place. Indeed, it was the same judge who dismissed
the case against the victim who then appointed the victim's
lawyer to represent Mickens one business day later. In
light of the judge's active role in bringing about the incompatible representation, I am not sure why the concept of a
judge's "duty to inquire" is thought to be central to this case.
No "inquiry" by the trial judge could have shed more light

on the conflict than was obvious on the face of the matter,namely, that the lawyer who would represent Mickens today

is the same lawyer who yesterday represented Mickens' al-leged victim in a criminal case.

This kind of breakdown in the criminal justice system cre-ates, at a minimum, the appearance that the proceeding will
not " `reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determina-tion of guilt or innocence,' " and the resulting " `criminal punishment' " will not " `be regarded as fundamentally fair.' "
Fulminante, supra, at 310. This appearance, together withthe likelihood of prejudice in the typical case, is serious

enough to warrant a categorical rule--a rule that does notrequire proof of prejudice in the individual case.

The Commonwealth complains that this argument "reliesheavily on the immediate visceral impact of learning that a
lawyer previously represented the victim of his current cli-ent." Brief for Respondent 34. And that is so. The "visceral impact," however, arises out of the obvious, unusualnature of the conflict. It arises from the fact that the Commonwealth seeks to execute a defendant, having providedthat defendant with a lawyer who, only yesterday, represented the victim. In my view, to carry out a death sen-tence so obtained would invariably "diminis[h] faith" in the
fairness and integrity of our criminal justice system. Youngv.

United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787,811-812 (1987) (plurality opinion). Cf. United States v.

Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 736 (1993) (need to correct errors thatseriously affect the " `fairness, integrity or public reputation
of judicial proceedings' "). That is to say, it would diminishthat public confidence in the criminal justice system upon
which the successful functioning of that system continuesto depend.

I therefore dissent.

BARNHART, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY

v. WALTON

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 00-1937. Argued January 16, 2002--Decided March 27, 2002
The Social Security Act authorizes payment of Title II disability insurance

benefits and Title XVI Supplemental Security Income to individuals
who have an "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by
reason of any medically determinable . . . impairment . . . which has
lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less
than 12 months." 42 U. S. C. $ 423(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added); accord,

$ 1382c(a)(3)(A). The Social Security Administration (Agency) denied
benefits to respondent Walton, finding that his "inability" to engage in
substantial gainful activity lasted only 11 months. The District Court
affirmed, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the 12-month
duration requirement modifies "impairment" not "inability," that the
statute leaves no doubt that no similar duration requirement relates to
an "inability," and that therefore Walton was entitled to benefits despite
Agency regulations restricting them to those unable to work for 12
months. The court decided further that Walton qualified for benefits
because, prior to his return to work, his "inability" would have been
"expected" to last 12 months. It conceded that the Agency had made
Walton's actual return to work within 12 months of his onset date and
before the Agency's decision date determinative on this point, 20 CFR

$$ 404.1520(b), 1592(d)(2), but found that the regulations conflicted with
the statute. It noted that Walton's work simply counted as part of a
9-month trial work period during which persons "entitled" to Title II
benefits may work without loss of benefits, 42 U. S. C. $ 422(c).

Held: The Agency's interpretations of the statute fall within its lawful

interpretative authority. Pp. 217-225.

(a) The Agency's reading of the term "inability" is reasonable. The
statute requires both an "inability" to engage in any substantial gainful
activity and an "impairment" providing "reason" for the "inability," adding that the "impairment" must last or be expected to last not less than
12 months. The Agency has determined in both its formal regulations
and its interpretation of those regulations that the "inability" must last
the same amount of time. Courts grant considerable leeway to an
agency's interpretation of its own regulations, and the Agency has properly interpreted its regulation here. Thus, this Court must decide

Syllabus
(1) whether the statute unambiguously forbids that interpretation, and
if not, (2) whether the interpretation exceeds permissible bounds.
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837, 843. First, the Act does not unambiguously forbid the regulation. That the statute's 12-month phrase modifies only "impairment"
shows only that the provision says nothing explicitly about the "inability's" duration. Such silence normally creates, but does not resolve, ambiguity. Second, the Agency's construction is permissible. It supplies
a duration requirement, which the statute demands, in a way that consistently reconciles the statutory "impairment" and "inability" language.
The Agency's regulations also reflect the Agency's own longstanding
interpretation, which should be accorded particular deference, North
Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512, 522, n. 12. Finally, Congress
has frequently amended or reenacted the relevant provisions without
change. Walton's claim that Title II's 5-month waiting period for entitlement protects against a claimant with a chronic, but only briefly disabling, disease shows, at most, that the Agency could have chosen other
reasonable time periods. Moreover, Title XVI has no such period, yet
Walton offers no explanation why its identical definitional language
should be interpreted differently in a closely related context. Walton's
argument that the Agency's interpretation should be disregarded because its formal regulations were only recently enacted is also rejected.
E. g., Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741. And
the Agency's longstanding interpretation is not automatically deprived
of the judicial deference otherwise its due because it was previously
reached through means less formal than notice-and-comment rulemaking. Chevron, supra, at 843. Pp. 217-222.

(b) Also consistent with the statute is the Agency's regulation providing that "[y]ou are not entitled to a trial work period" if "you perform
work . . . within 12 months of the onset of the impairment . . . and before
the date of any . . . decision finding . . . you . . . disabled," 20 CFR

$ 404.1592(d)(2) (emphasis added). The statute is ambiguous, and the
regulation treats a pre-Agency-decision actual return to work as if it
were determinative of the "can be expected to last" question. The statute's complexity, the vast number of claims it engenders, and the consequent need for agency expertise and administrative experience lead the
Court to read the statute as delegating to the Agency considerable
authority to fill in matters of detail related to its administration. See
Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, 43-44. The interpretation
at issue is such a matter. Pp. 222-225.

Kathryn L. Pryor argued the cause for respondent. Withher on the brief was James W. Speer.*

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Social Security Act authorizes payment of disabilityinsurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income to individuals with disabilities. See 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42U. S. C. $ 401 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V) (Title II disability
insurance benefits); $ 1381 et seq. (Title XVI supplementalsecurity income). For both types of benefits the Act defines
the key term "disability" as an

"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity
by reason of any medically determinable physical ormental

impairment which can be expected to resultin death or which has lasted or can be expected to last

for a continuous period of not less than 12 months."$ 423(d)(1)(A) (1994 ed.) (Title II) (emphasis added); accord, $ 1382c(a)(3)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (Title XVI).
This case presents two questions about the Social SecurityAdministration's interpretation of this definition.

First, the Social Security Administration (which we shallcall the Agency) reads the term "inability" as including a "12
month" requirement. In its view, the "inability" (to engagein any substantial gainful activity) must last, or must be ex*Rochelle Bobroff, Michael Schuster, and Robert E. Rains filed a brief

Opinion of the Court
pected to last, for at least 12 months. Second, the Agencyreads the term "expected to last" as applicable only when

the "inability" has not yet lasted 12 months. In the case ofa later Agency determination--where the "inability" did not
last 12 months--the Agency will automatically assume thatthe claimant failed to meet the duration requirement. It
will not look back to decide hypothetically whether, despitethe claimant's actual return to work before 12 months expired, the "inability" nonetheless might have been expectedto last that long.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held boththese interpretations of the statute unlawful. We hold, to
the contrary, that both fall within the Agency's lawful inter-pretive authority. See

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Consequently, we reverse. I

In 1996 Cleveland Walton, the respondent, applied for bothTitle II disability insurance benefits and Title XVI Supplemental Security Income. The Agency found that (1) by Oc-tober 31, 1994, Walton had developed a serious mental illness
involving both schizophrenia and associated depression;(2) the illness caused him then to lose his job as a full-time
teacher; (3) by mid-1995 he began to work again part timeas a cashier; and (4) by December 1995 he was working as a
cashier full time.The Agency concluded that Walton's mental illness had
prevented him from engaging in any significant work, i. e.,from "engag[ing] in any substantial gainful activity," for 11
months--from October 31, 1994 (when he lost his teachingjob) until the end of September 1995 (when he earned income
sufficient to rise to the level of "substantial gainful activity").See 20 CFR $$ 404.1574, 416.974 (2001). And because the
statute demanded an "inability to engage in any substantialgainful activity" lasting 12, not 11, months, Walton was not
entitled to benefits.

216 BARNHART v. WALTON

Opinion of the Court
Walton sought court review. The District Court affirmedthe Agency's decision, but the Court of Appeals for the

Fourth Circuit reversed. Walton v. Apfel, 235 F. 3d 184,186-187 (2000). The court said that the statute's 12-month
duration requirement modifies the word "impairment," notthe word "inability."

Id., at 189. It added that the statute's "language . . . leaves no doubt" that there is no similar
"duration requirement" related to an "inability" (to engagein substantial gainful activity).

Ibid. It concluded that, because the statute's language "speaks clearly" and is "unam-biguous," Walton was entitled to receive benefits despite

agency regulations restricting benefits to those unable to
work for a 12-month period. Ibid.

The court went on to decide that, in any event, Walton
qualified because, prior to Walton's return to work, one
would have "expected" his "inability" to last 12 months. Id.,
at 189-190. It conceded that the Agency had made Walton's
actual return to work determinative on this point. See 20
CFR $$ 404.1520(b), 1592(d)(2) (2001). But it found unlawful
the Agency regulations that gave the Agency the benefit of
hindsight--on the ground that they conflicted with the statute's clear command. 235 F. 3d, at 190.

For either reason, the Fourth Circuit concluded, Walton
became "entitled" to Title II benefits no later than April
1995, five months after the onset of his illness. See 42
U. S. C. $$ 423(a)(1)(D)(i), 423(a)(1)(D)(ii) (providing for a
5-month "waiting period" before a claimant is "entitled" to
benefits), 423(c)(2)(A) (1994 ed.). It added that Walton's
later work as a cashier was legally beside the point. That
work simply counted as part of a 9-month "trial work period," which the statute grants to those "entitled" to Title II
benefits, and which it permits them to perform without loss
of benefits. $ 422(c).

The Government sought certiorari. It pointed out that
the Fourth Circuit's first holding conflicts with those of other
Circuits, compare 235 F. 3d, at 189-190, with Titus v. Sulli535US1 Unit: $U35 [09-18-03 16:14:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

van, 4 F. 3d 590, 594-595 (CA8 1993), and Alexander v. Rich-ardson, 451 F. 2d 1185 (CA10 1971). It added that the

Fourth Circuit's views were contrary to well-settled law andwould create additional Social Security costs of $80 billion
over 10 years. We granted the writ. We now reverse.

II
The statutory definition of "disability" has two parts.First, it requires a certain kind of "inability," namely, an "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity." Sec-ond, it requires an "impairment," namely, a "physical or mental impairment," which provides "reason" for the "inability."The statute adds that the "impairment" must be one that
"has lasted or can be expected to last . . . not less than 12months." But what about the "inability"? Must it also last
(or be expected to last) for the same amount of time?The Agency has answered this question in the affirmative.
Acting pursuant to statutory rulemaking authority, 42U. S. C. $$ 405(a) (Title II), 1383(d)(1) (Title XVI), it has promulgated formal regulations that state that a claimant is notdisabled "regardless of [his] medical condition," if he is doing
"substantial gainful activity." 20 CFR $ 404.1520(b) (2001).And the Agency has interpreted this regulation to mean that
the claimant is not disabled if "within 12 months after theonset of an impairment . . . the impairment no longer prevents substantial gainful activity." 65 Fed. Reg. 42774(2000). Courts grant an agency's interpretation of its own
regulations considerable legal leeway. Auer v. Robbins, 519U. S. 452, 461 (1997);

Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16-17(1965). And no one here denies that the Agency has properly interpreted its own regulation.Consequently, the legal question before us is whether the
Agency's interpretation of the statute is lawful. This Courthas previously said that, if the statute speaks clearly "to the
precise question at issue," we "must give effect to the un-ambiguously expressed intent of Congress."

218 BARNHART v. WALTON

Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 842-843. If, however, the statute "is silent or am-biguous with respect to the specific issue," we must sustain

the Agency's interpretation if it is "based on a permissibleconstruction" of the Act.

Id., at 843. Hence we must decide (1) whether the statute unambiguously forbids theAgency's interpretation, and, if not, (2) whether the interpretation, for other reasons, exceeds the bounds of the permissible. Ibid.; see also United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S.218, 227 (2001).

First, the statute does not unambiguously forbid the regu-lation. The Fourth Circuit believed the contrary primarily
for a linguistic reason. It pointed out that, linguisticallyspeaking, the statute's "12-month" phrase modifies only the
word "impairment," not the word "inability." And to thatextent we agree. After all, the statute, in parallel phrasing,
uses the words "which can be expected to result in death."And that structurally parallel phrase makes sense in reference to an "impairment," but makes no sense in reference tothe "inability."

Nonetheless, this linguistic point is insufficient. It shows
that the particular statutory provision says nothing explic-itly about the "inability's" duration. But such silence, after

all, normally creates ambiguity. It does not resolve it.Moreover, a nearby provision of the statute says that an

"individual shall be determined to be under a disabilityonly if his . . . impairment . . . [is] of such severity that
he is not only unable to do his previous work butcannot . . . engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy." 42
U. S. C. $ 423(d)(2)(A) (Title II); accord, $ 1382c(a)(3)(B)
(Title XVI).

In other words, the statute, in the two provisions, specifies
that the "impairment" must last 12 months and also be severe enough to prevent the claimant from engaging in virtually any "substantial gainful work." The statute, we con535US1 Unit: $U35 [09-18-03 16:14:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

219Cite as: 535 U. S. 212 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
cede, nowhere explicitly says that the "impairment" must be
that severe (i. e., severe enough to prevent "substantial gainful work") for 12 months. But that is a fair inference fromthe language. See Brief for AARP et al. as

Amici Curiae
13 (conceding that an impairment must remain of "disablingseverity" for 12 months). At the very least the statute is

ambiguous in that respect. And, if so, then it is an equally
fair inference that the "inability" must last 12 months. Thatis because the latter statement (

i. e., that the claimant must
be unable to "engage in any substantial gainful activity" fora year) is the virtual equivalent of the former statement

(i. e., that the "impairment" must remain severe enough to
prevent the claimant from engaging in "substantial gainful
work" for a year). It simply rephrases the same point in a
slightly different way.

Second, the Agency's construction is "permissible." The
interpretation makes considerable sense in terms of the statute's basic objectives. The statute demands some duration
requirement. No one claims that the statute would permit
an individual with a chronic illness--say, high blood pressure--to qualify for benefits if that illness, while itself lasting
for a year, were to permit a claimant to return to work after
only a week, or perhaps even a day, away from the job. The
Agency's interpretation supplies a duration requirement,
which the statute demands, while doing so in a way that
consistently reconciles the statutory "impairment" and "inability" language.

In addition, the Agency's regulations reflect the Agency's
own longstanding interpretation. See Social Security Ruling 82-52, p. 106 (cum. ed. 1982) ("In considering `duration,'
it is the inability to engage in [substantial gainful activity]
that must last the required 12-month period"); Disability
Insurance State Manual $ 316 (Sept. 9, 1965), Government
Lodging, Tab C, $ 316 ("Duration of impairment refers to

of " an impairment); OASI Disability Insurance Letter No. 39(Jan. 22, 1957),

id., Tab A, p. 1 (duration requirement refers
to the "expected duration of the medical impairment" at a"level of severity sufficient to preclude" substantial gainful

activity"). And this Court will normally accord particulardeference to an agency interpretation of "longstanding" duration. North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512, 522,
n. 12 (1982).Finally, Congress has frequently amended or reenacted

the relevant provisions without change. E. g., Social Secu-rity Amendments of 1965, $ 303(a)(1), 79 Stat. 366; see also
S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. I, pp. 98-99 (1965)
("[T]he committee's bill . . . provide[s] for the payment of
disability benefits for an insured worker who has been or can
be expected to be totally disabled throughout a continuous
period of 12 calendar months" (emphasis added)); id., at 98
(rejecting effort to provide benefits to those with "shortterm, temporary disabilit[ies]," defined as inability to work
for six months); H. R. Rep. No. 92-231, p. 56 (1971) ("No benefit is payable, however, unless the disability is expected to
last (or has lasted) at least 12 consecutive months" (emphasis
added)); S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 49 (1967)
("The committee also believes . . . that an individual who
does substantial gainful work despite an impairment or impairments that otherwise might be considered disabling is
not disabled for purposes of establishing a period of disability"). These circumstances provide further evidence--if
more is needed--that Congress intended the Agency's interpretation, or at least understood the interpretation as statutorily permissible. Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n
v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 845-846 (1986).

Walton points in reply to Title II language stating that
a claimant who is "under a disability . . . shall be entitled
to a . . . benefit . . . beginning with the first month
after" a "waiting period" of "five consecutive calendar
months . . . throughout which" he "has been under a disa535US1 Unit: $U35 [09-18-03 16:14:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

221Cite as: 535 U. S. 212 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
bility." 42 U. S. C. $$ 423(a)(1)(D)(i), 423(c)(2)(A). He addsthat this 5-month "waiting period" assures a lengthy period

of time during which the applicant (who must be "under adisability" throughout) has been unable to work. And it
thereby provides ironclad protection against the claimantwho suffers a chronic, but only briefly disabling, disease, such
as the claimant who suffers high blood pressure in our earlier
example. See supra, at 219. This claim does not help Wal-ton, however, for it shows, at most, that the Agency might

have chosen other reasonable time periods--a matter notdisputed. Regardless, Walton's "waiting period" argument
could work only in respect to Title II, not Title XVI. Title
XVI has no waiting period, though it uses identical definitional language. And Walton does not explain why we
should interpret the same statutory words differently in
closely related contexts. See Department of Revenue of
Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332, 342 (1994)
(" `[I]dentical words used in different parts of the same act
are intended to have the same meaning' " (quoting Sorenson
v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986) (some internal quotation marks omitted)).

Walton also asks us to disregard the Agency's interpretation of its formal regulations on the ground that the Agency
only recently enacted those regulations, perhaps in response
to this litigation. We have previously rejected similar arguments. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S.
735, 741 (1996); United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 835-
836, n. 21 (1984).

Regardless, the Agency's interpretation is one of long
standing. See supra, at 220. And the fact that the Agency
previously reached its interpretation through means less formal than "notice and comment" rulemaking, see 5 U. S. C.

$ 553, does not automatically deprive that interpretation of
the judicial deference otherwise its due. Cf. Chevron, 467
U. S., at 843 (stating, without delineation of means, that the

(1974))). If this Court's opinion in Christensen v. HarrisCounty, 529 U. S. 576 (2000), suggested an absolute rule to
the contrary, our later opinion in United States v. MeadCorp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001), denied the suggestion. Id., at
230-231 ("[T]he want of " notice and comment "does not de-cide the case"). Indeed,

Mead pointed to instances in whichthe Court has applied Chevron deference to agency interpretations that did not emerge out of notice-and-comment rule-making. 533 U. S., at 230-231 (citing NationsBank of N. C.,
N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251, 256-257 (1995)). It indicated that whether a court should give
such deference depends in significant part upon the interpre-tive method used and the nature of the question at issue.
533 U. S., at 229-231. And it discussed at length why Chev-ron did not require deference in the circumstances there
present--a discussion that would have been superfluous hadthe presence or absence of notice-and-comment rulemaking
been dispositive. 533 U. S., at 231-234.In this case, the interstitial nature of the legal question,
the related expertise of the Agency, the importance ofthe question to administration of the statute, the complexity
of that administration, and the careful consideration theAgency has given the question over a long period of time
all indicate that Chevron provides the appropriate legal lensthrough which to view the legality of the Agency interpretation here at issue. See United States v. Mead Corp., supra;cf. also 1 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise

$$ 1.7, 3.3 (3d ed. 1994).For these reasons, we find the Agency's interpretation
lawful. III

Walton's second claim is more complex. For purposes ofmaking that claim, Walton assumes what we have just decided, namely, that the statute's "12 month" duration require535US1 Unit: $U35 [09-18-03 16:14:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

223Cite as: 535 U. S. 212 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
ments apply to both the "impairment" and the "inability" towork requirements. Walton also concedes that he returned

to work after 11 months. But Walton claims that his workfrom month 11 to month 12 does not count against him because it is part of a "trial work" period that the statutegrants to those "entitled" to Title II benefits. See 42
U. S. C. $ 422(c). And Walton adds, he was "entitle[d]" to
benefits because--even though he returned to work after 11months--his "impairment" and his "inability" to work were

nonetheless "expected to last" for at least "12 months" beforehe returned to work.

To illustrate Walton's argument, we simplify the actual circumstances. We imagine: (1) On January 1, Year One, Walton developed (a) a severe impairment, which (b) made him
unable to work; (2) Eleven (not twelve) months later, on December 1, Year One, Walton returned to work; (3) On July 1,
Year Two, the Agency adjudicated, and denied, Walton's
claim for benefits. Walton argues that, even though he returned to work after 11 months, had the Agency looked at
the matter, not ex post, but as if it were looking prior to his
return to work, the Agency would have had to conclude that
both his "impairment" and his "inability" to work "can be
expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12
months." $ 423(d)(1)(A). He consequently satisfied the 12-
month duration requirement and became "entitled" to benefits before he returned to work; he was in turn entitled to a
"trial work" period; and his subsequent work as a cashier,
being "trial work," should not count against him.

The Agency's regulations plainly reject this view of the
statute. They say, "You are not entitled to a trial work period" if "you perform work . . . within 12 months of the onset
of the impairment(s) . . . and before the date of any notice of
determination or decision finding . . . you . . . disabled." 20
CFR $ 404.1592(d)(2) (2001). This regulation means that the
Agency, deciding before the end of Year One, might have
found that Walton's impairment (or inability to work) "can

Opinion of the Court
be expected to last" for 12 months. But the Agency, decid-ing after Year One in which Walton in fact returned to

work, would not ask whether his impairment (or inability towork)

could have been expected to last 12 months.
The legal question is whether this Agency regulation isconsistent with the statute. The Court of Appeals, accepting Walton's view, concluded that it is not. It said that the
Agency's rules--permitting the use of hindsight when re-viewing claims--are inconsistent with the statute's plain

language, 235 F. 3d, at 191. And, here, other courts haveagreed. See

Salamalekis v. Commissioner of Soc. Sec., 221
F. 3d 828 (CA6 2000); Newton v. Chater, 92 F. 3d 688 (CA81996);

Walker v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 943
F. 2d 1257 (CA10 1991); McDonald v. Bowen, 818 F. 2d 559(CA7 1986).

Nonetheless, we believe that Agency regulation is lawful.See

Chevron, supra, at 843. The statute is ambiguous. It
says nothing about how the Agency, when it adjudicates amatter after Year One, is to treat an earlier return to work.

Its language "can be expected to last" 12 months, 42 U. S. C.

$ 423(d)(1)(A), simply does not say as of what time the lawmeasures the "expectation." Indeed, from a linguistic perspective, the phrase "can be expected" foresees a decisionmaker who is looking into the future, not a decisionmaker
who is in the future, looking back into the past in order to see
what then "was," "could be," or "could have been" expected.
And read in context, the purpose of the phrase "can be expected to last" might be one of permitting the Agency to
award benefits before 12 months have expired, not one of
denying the Agency the benefit of hindsight. See 65 Fed.
Reg., at 42780; cf. also S. Rep. No. 404, at 99.

At the same time, the Agency's regulation seems a reasonable, hence permissible, interpretation of the statute. In effect it treats a pre-Agency-decision actual return to work,
e. g., Walton's return in December Year One, as if it were
determinative of the expectation question. With Year
Two's hindsight, Walton's "inability" to work "can" not "be

225Cite as: 535 U. S. 212 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
expected to last 12 months." And use of that hindsight
avoids the need for the Year Two decisionmaker in effect to
answer a highly unwieldy question in what grammarians
might call the pluperfect future tense.

Of course, administrators and judges are capable of answering hypothetical questions of this kind. But here the
question concerns what must be a contrary-to-fact speculation about the future. It is a speculation that, however
often raised, would rarely prove easy to resolve. And the
statute's purpose does not demand its resolution. Indeed,
one might ask why, other things being equal, a claimant who
returns to work too early ordinarily to qualify for benefits
nonetheless should qualify if, but only if, that return was a
kind of medical surprise. Of course, as Walton says, such
a rule would help encourage (or at least not discourage) a
claimant's early return to work. See generally S. Rep.
No. 1856, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 15-16 (1960). But the statute
does not demand that the Agency make of this desirable end
an overriding interpretive principle. And the Agency has
recognized and addressed the problem of work disincentives
in other ways. See, e. g., 20 CFR $$ 404.1574(c), 404.1575(d)
(2001).

The statute's complexity, the vast number of claims that
it engenders, and the consequent need for agency expertise
and administrative experience lead us to read the statute
as delegating to the Agency considerable authority to fill
in, through interpretation, matters of detail related to its
administration. See Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S.
34, 43-44 (1981). The interpretation at issue here is such
a matter. The statute's language is ambiguous. And the
Agency's interpretation is reasonable.

We conclude that the Agency's regulation is lawful.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

I join all but Part II of the Court's opinion.I agree that deference is owed to regulations of the Social
Security Administration (SSA) interpreting the definition of"disability," 42 U. S. C. $$ 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A) (1994
ed. and Supp. V). See 65 Fed. Reg. 42774 (2000). As theCourt acknowledges, the recency of these regulations is
irrelevant, see ante, at 220-221 (citing Smiley v. Citibank(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741 (1996); United
States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 835-836, n. 21 (1984)).I would therefore not go on, as the Court does,

ante, at 219-222, to address the SSA's prior interpretation of the definition of "disability" in a 1982 Social Security Ruling, a 1965Disability Insurance State Manual, and a 1957 OASI Disability Insurance Letter.I do not believe, to begin with, that "particular deference"
is owed "to an agency interpretation of `longstanding' dura-tion," ante, at 220. That notion is an anachronism--a relic
of the pre-Chevron days, when there was thought to be onlyone "correct" interpretation of a statutory text. A "longstanding" agency interpretation, particularly one that dated
back to the very origins of the statute, was more likelyto reflect the single correct meaning. See,

e. g., Watt v.
Alaska, 451 U. S. 259, 272-273 (1981). But once it is ac-cepted, as it was in

Chevron, that there is a range of permissible interpretations, and that the agency is free to movefrom one to another, so long as the most recent interpretation is reasonable its antiquity should make no difference.Cf.

Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 186-187 (1991); Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467U. S. 837, 863-864 (1984).

If, however, the Court does wish to credit the SSA's earlierinterpretations--both for the purpose of giving the agency's
position "particular deference" and for the purpose of relying
upon congressional reenactment with presumed knowledge

Opinion of Scalia, J.
of the agency position, see ante, at 219-220--then I think theCourt should state why those interpretations were authoritative enough (or whatever-else-enough Mead requires) toqualify for deference. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533
U. S. 218 (2001). I of course agree that more than notice-and-comment rulemaking qualifies, see ante, at 221-222, but
that concession alone does not validate the Social SecurityRuling, the Disability Insurance State Manual, and the OASI
Disability Insurance Letter. (Only the latter two, I mightpoint out, antedate the congressional reenactments upon
which the Court relies.)The SSA's recently enacted regulations emerged from
notice-and-comment rulemaking and merit deference. Nomore need be said.

SAO PAULO STATE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC

OF BRAZIL v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO., INC.,

et al.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the fifth circuit

No. 01-835. Decided April 1, 2002
Respondents moved the District Judge in this tobacco-products liability

case to recuse himself under 28 U. S. C. $ 455(a) because, before his appointment to the bench, his name appeared on a motion to file an amicus
brief by the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association (LTLA) in the similar
Gilboy suit against some of the same defendants. As he had done in a
companion case, Republic of Panama I, the judge refused to disqualify
himself on the grounds that he was erroneously listed as LTLA president on the Gilboy motion when he no longer held that post, and that
he took no part in preparation or approval of the Gilboy brief. In Republic of Panama I, the judge found it unsurprising that he was unaware of the brief because the LTLA affixed its president's name to all
motions to file amicus briefs. The Fifth Circuit reversed, citing its
prior decision reversing the judge's order denying recusal in Republic
of Panama I.

Held: The Fifth Circuit's decision is inconsistent with Liljeberg v. Health

Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S. 847, which stated that $ 455(a) requires judicial recusal "if a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would expect that the judge would have actual knowledge" of
his interest or bias in the case, id., at 861 (internal quotation marks
omitted and emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit considered what a reasonable person would believe without knowing that the judge's name
was added mistakenly and without his knowledge to a pro forma motion
to file an amicus brief in a separate controversy. The decision whether
his impartiality might reasonably be questioned should not have been
made in disregard of the facts that he took no part in the preparation
or approval of the amicus brief and that he was only vaguely aware of
that brief. When those facts are taken into account, it is self-evident
that a reasonable person would not believe that he had any interest
or bias.

Certiorari granted; 250 F. 3d 315, reversed and remanded.

Section 455(a) of 28 U. S. C. (1994 ed.) provides that ajudge "shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which

his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." In thistobacco-products liability case, the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit held that $ 455(a) required disqualification of aDistrict Judge whose name appeared erroneously, prior to
his appointment to the bench, on a motion to file an amicusbrief in a similar suit against some of the same defendants.
Republic of Panama v. American Tobacco Co., 250 F. 3d 315(2001)

(per curiam) (Republic of Panama II). We grantthe writ of certiorari and reverse.

Petitioner, Sao Paulo State, brought this suit against re-spondent tobacco companies in Louisiana state court. It alleged that respondents had conspired to conceal the healthrisks of smoking, thereby preventing it from adopting policies that would have reduced smoking by Sao Paulo citi-zens. It seeks compensation for the costs of treating their
smoking-related health problems. The suit was removed tothe United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Louisiana and assigned to District Judge Carl J. Barbier, who
had presided over a companion case, Republic of Panama v.
American Tobacco Co., No. 98-3279, 1999 WL 350030 (EDLa., May 28, 1999)

(Republic of Panama I), vacated and remanded, 217 F. 3d 343 (CA5 2000). As in that case, respond-ents filed a motion seeking Judge Barbier's recusal under

$ 455(a) because of his involvement, prior to appointment tothe bench, in a similar suit against some of the respondents.

Almost nine years before the present suit was commenced,Judge Barbier's name appeared on a motion to file an

amicus
curiae brief in Gilboy v. American Tobacco Co., 582 So. 2d1263 (La. 1991). The motion was submitted by the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association (LTLA), and erroneouslylisted Judge Barbier as the association's president, a position
from which he had retired about six months earlier. The
motion also correctly listed as a member of the LTLA's

St. Martin, who represents petitioner in the case before us.
The amicus brief itself--which did not list either Judge

the defendants failed to warn consumers about these dangers. Brief for LTLA as Amicus Curiae in No. 90-C-2686
(La. Sup. Ct.), App. to Brief in Opposition 9a; Gilboy, supra,

Respondents argued that Judge Barbier's association with
the Gilboy amicus brief created an "appearance of partiality" requiring disqualification under $ 455(a). Brief in Opposition 3. Judge Barbier disagreed. Adopting his reasons
for denying recusal in Republic of Panama I, he refused to
disqualify himself because his name appeared in error on the
motion to file the amicus brief and because he took no part

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, citingits prior decision reversing Judge Barbier's order denying
recusal in Republic of Panama I. In that case, the FifthCircuit said:

"The fact that Judge Barbier's name was listed on a mo-tion to file an amicus brief which asserted similar allegations against tobacco companies to the ones made inthis case may lead a reasonable person to doubt his impartiality. Also, Judge Barbier was listed on this filingwith the attorney who is currently representing the Republic of Panama. The trial judge's assertions that he
did not participate directly in the writing or researchingof the amicus brief do not dissipate the doubts that a

reasonable person would probably have about the court'simpartiality. We acknowledge that this is a close case
for recusal." 217 F. 3d, at 347.
Judge Parker concurred, agreeing that the court was boundby its decision in

Republic of Panama I, but arguing that
that decision was "erroneous because it requires recusal on
the basis of a judge's public statements on the law madeprior to becoming a judge . . . ."

Republic of Panama II,
supra, at 318. Rehearing en banc was denied over the dis-sent of six judges, who argued that the decision below

amounts to an "issue recusal" rule, requiring disqualificationwhenever a judge has pre-judicial association with a legal
position. 265 F. 3d 299, 306 (2001) ( joint dissent of Wienerand Parker, JJ.).

We need not consider the argument advanced by the dissenting judges, since this case is easily disposed of on other
grounds. The Fifth Circuit's decision is inconsistent with
Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S. 847
(1988), which stated that $ 455(a) requires judicial recusal

considered what a reasonable person would believe withoutknowing (or giving due weight to the fact) that the judge's
name was added mistakenly and without his knowledge toa

pro forma motion to file an amicus brief in a separatecontroversy. Although Judge Barbier was indeed a leader

of the LTLA at that time (he was a member of the associa-tion's executive committee), he took no part in the preparation or approval of the amicus brief; indeed, he was only"vaguely aware" of the case. Tr. of Status Conf. 8, App. to
Pet. for Cert. 54a. The decision whether his "impartialitymight reasonably be questioned" should not have been made
in disregard of these facts; and when they are taken intoaccount we think it self-evident that a reasonable person
would not believe he had any interest or bias.Accordingly, we grant the petition for certiorari, reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the casefor proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al. v.FREE SPEECH COALITION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-795. Argued October 30, 2001--Decided April 16, 2002
The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) expands the federal prohibition on child pornography to include not only pornographic
images made using actual children, 18 U. S. C. $ 2256(8)(A), but also
"any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or
computer or computer-generated image or picture," that "is, or appears
to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct," $ 2256(8)(B),
and any sexually explicit image that is "advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the
impression" it depicts "a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,"

$ 2256(8)(D). Thus, $ 2256(8)(B) bans a range of sexually explicit images, sometimes called "virtual child pornography," that appear to depict minors but were produced by means other than using real children,
such as through the use of youthful-looking adults or computer-imaging
technology. Section 2256(8)(D) is aimed at preventing the production
or distribution of pornographic material pandered as child pornography.
Fearing that the CPPA threatened their activities, respondents, an
adult-entertainment trade association and others, filed this suit alleging
that the "appears to be" and "conveys the impression" provisions are
overbroad and vague, chilling production of works protected by the
First Amendment. The District Court disagreed and granted the Government summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Generally, pornography can be banned only if it is obscene under Miller v.
California, 413 U. S. 15, but pornography depicting actual children can
be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene because of the
State's interest in protecting the children exploited by the production
process, New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 758, and in prosecuting those
who promote such sexual exploitation, id., at 761. The Ninth Circuit
held the CPPA invalid on its face, finding it to be substantially overbroad because it bans materials that are neither obscene under Miller
nor produced by the exploitation of real children as in Ferber.

Held: The prohibitions of $$ 2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) are overbroad and

unconstitutional. Pp. 244-258.

(a) Section 2256(8)(B) covers materials beyond the categories recognized in Ferber and Miller, and the reasons the Government offers in

535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
support of limiting the freedom of speech have no justification in this
Court's precedents or First Amendment law. Pp. 244-256.

(1) The CPPA is inconsistent with Miller. It extends to images
that are not obscene under the Miller standard, which requires the
Government to prove that the work in question, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community standards, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value, 413 U. S., at 24. Materials need not appeal to the prurient interest under the CPPA, which proscribes any depiction of sexually explicit
activity, no matter how it is presented. It is not necessary, moreover,
that the image be patently offensive. Pictures of what appear to be
17-year-olds engaging in sexually explicit activity do not in every case
contravene community standards. The CPPA also prohibits speech
having serious redeeming value, proscribing the visual depiction of
an idea--that of teenagers engaging in sexual activity--that is a fact
of modern society and has been a theme in art and literature for centuries. A number of acclaimed movies, filmed without any child actors,
explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions.
If those movies contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity
within the statutory definition, their possessor would be subject to
severe punishment without inquiry into the literary value of the work.
This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: A work's
artistic merit does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene.
See, e. g., Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U. S. 413, 419. Under Miller,
redeeming value is judged by considering the work as a whole. Where
the scene is part of the narrative, the work itself does not for this reason
become obscene, even though the scene in isolation might be offensive.
See Kois v. Wisconsin, 408 U. S. 229, 231 (per curiam). The CPPA
cannot be read to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link
between its prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the obscenity definition. Pp. 244-249.

(2) The CPPA finds no support in Ferber. The Court rejects the
Government's argument that speech prohibited by the CPPA is virtually indistinguishable from material that may be banned under Ferber.
That case upheld a prohibition on the distribution and sale of child
pornography, as well as its production, because these acts were "intrinsically related" to the sexual abuse of children in two ways. 458
U. S., at 759. First, as a permanent record of a child's abuse, the continued circulation itself would harm the child who had participated.
See id., at 759, and n. 10. Second, because the traffic in child pornography was an economic motive for its production, the State had
an interest in closing the distribution network. Id., at 760. Under

535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
236 ASHCROFT v. FREE SPEECH COALITION

Syllabus
either rationale, the speech had what the Court in effect held was a
proximate link to the crime from which it came. In contrast to the
speech in Ferber, speech that is itself the record of sexual abuse, the
CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by
its production. Virtual child pornography is not "intrinsically related"
to the sexual abuse of children. While the Government asserts that
the images can lead to actual instances of child abuse, the causal link
is contingent and indirect. The harm does not necessarily follow from
the speech, but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts. The Government's argument that these indirect
harms are sufficient because, as Ferber acknowledged, child pornography rarely can be valuable speech, see id., at 762, suffers from two flaws.
First, Ferber's judgment about child pornography was based upon how
it was made, not on what it communicated. The case reaffirmed that
where the speech is neither obscene nor the product of sexual abuse,
it does not fall outside the First Amendment's protection. See id., at
764-765. Second, Ferber did not hold that child pornography is by
definition without value. It recognized some works in this category
might have significant value, see id., at 761, but relied on virtual images--the very images prohibited by the CPPA--as an alternative
and permissible means of expression, id., at 763. Because Ferber relied on the distinction between actual and virtual child pornography
as supporting its holding, it provides no support for a statute that eliminates the distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as well.
Pp. 249-251.

(3) The Court rejects other arguments offered by the Government
to justify the CPPA's prohibitions. The contention that the CPPA is
necessary because pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to
seduce children runs afoul of the principle that speech within the
rights of adults to hear may not be silenced completely in an attempt to
shield children from it. See, e. g., Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.
v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 130-131. That the evil in question depends upon
the actor's unlawful conduct, defined as criminal quite apart from any
link to the speech in question, establishes that the speech ban is not
narrowly drawn. The argument that virtual child pornography whets
pedophiles' appetites and encourages them to engage in illegal conduct
is unavailing because the mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it, Stanley v. Georgia,
394 U. S. 557, 566, absent some showing of a direct connection between
the speech and imminent illegal conduct, see, e. g., Brandenburg v. Ohio,
395 U. S. 444, 447 (per curiam). The argument that eliminating the
market for pornography produced using real children necessitates a
prohibition on virtual images as well is somewhat implausible because

Syllabus
few pornographers would risk prosecution for abusing real children
if fictional, computerized images would suffice. Moreover, even if the
market deterrence theory were persuasive, the argument cannot justify
the CPPA because, here, there is no underlying crime at all. Finally,
the First Amendment is turned upside down by the argument that,
because it is difficult to distinguish between images made using real
children and those produced by computer imaging, both kinds of images
must be prohibited. The overbreadth doctrine prohibits the Government from banning unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is prohibited or chilled in the process. See Broadrick v.
Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612. The Government's rejoinder that the
CPPA should be read not as a prohibition on speech but as a measure
shifting the burden to the accused to prove the speech is lawful raises
serious constitutional difficulties. The Government misplaces its reliance on $ 2252A(c), which creates an affirmative defense allowing a
defendant to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by showing
that the materials were produced using only adults and were not otherwise distributed in a manner conveying the impression that they depicted real children. Even if an affirmative defense can save a statute
from First Amendment challenge, here the defense is insufficient because it does not apply to possession or to images created by computer
imaging, even where the defendant could demonstrate no children were
harmed in producing the images. Thus, the defense leaves unprotected
a substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government's interest in
distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones.
Pp. 251-256.

(b) Section 2256(8)(D) is also substantially overbroad. The Court
disagrees with the Government's view that the only difference between
that provision and $ 2256(8)(B)'s "appears to be" provision is that

$ 2256(8)(D) requires the jury to assess the material at issue in light of
the manner in which it is promoted, but that the determination would
still depend principally upon the prohibited work's content. The "conveys the impression" provision requires little judgment about the image's content; the work must be sexually explicit, but otherwise the
content is irrelevant. Even if a film contains no sexually explicit scenes
involving minors, it could be treated as child pornography if the title
and trailers convey the impression that such scenes will be found in the
movie. The determination turns on how the speech is presented, not
on what is depicted. The Government's other arguments in support
of the CPPA do not bear on $ 2256(8)(D). The materials, for instance,
are not likely to be confused for child pornography in a criminal trial.
Pandering may be relevant, as an evidentiary matter, to the question
whether particular materials are obscene. See Ginzburg v. United

States, 383 U. S. 463, 474. Where a defendant engages in the "commercial exploitation" of erotica solely for the sake of prurient appeal,
id., at 466, the context created may be relevant to evaluating whether
the materials are obscene. Section 2256(8)(D), however, prohibits a
substantial amount of speech that falls outside Ginzburg's rationale.
Proscribed material is tainted and unlawful in the hands of all who receive it, though they bear no responsibility for how it was marketed,
sold, or described. The statute, furthermore, does not require that the
context be part of an effort at "commercial exploitation." Thus, the
CPPA does more than prohibit pandering. It bans possession of material pandered as child pornography by someone earlier in the distribution chain, as well as a sexually explicit film that contains no youthful
actors but has been packaged to suggest a prohibited movie. Possession is a crime even when the possessor knows the movie was mislabeled. The First Amendment requires a more precise restriction.

Opinion of the Court
look like minors or by using computer imaging. The newtechnology, according to Congress, makes it possible to

create realistic images of children who do not exist. SeeCongressional Findings, notes following 18 U. S. C. $ 2251.

By prohibiting child pornography that does not depictan actual child, the statute goes beyond

New York v. Ferber,
458 U. S. 747 (1982), which distinguished child pornography
from other sexually explicit speech because of the State'sinterest in protecting the children exploited by the production process. See id., at 758. As a general rule, por-nography can be banned only if obscene, but under

Ferber,
pornography showing minors can be proscribed whether
or not the images are obscene under the definition set forth
in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973). Ferber recognized that "[t]he Miller standard, like all general definitions
of what may be banned as obscene, does not reflect the
State's particular and more compelling interest in prosecuting those who promote the sexual exploitation of children."
458 U. S., at 761.

While we have not had occasion to consider the question,
we may assume that the apparent age of persons engaged
in sexual conduct is relevant to whether a depiction offends
community standards. Pictures of young children engaged
in certain acts might be obscene where similar depictions of
adults, or perhaps even older adolescents, would not. The
CPPA, however, is not directed at speech that is obscene;
Congress has proscribed those materials through a separate
statute. 18 U. S. C. $$ 1460-1466. Like the law in Ferber,
the CPPA seeks to reach beyond obscenity, and it makes no
attempt to conform to the Miller standard. For instance,
the statute would reach visual depictions, such as movies,
even if they have redeeming social value.

The principal question to be resolved, then, is whether
the CPPA is constitutional where it proscribes a significant
universe of speech that is neither obscene under Miller nor
child pornography under Ferber.

Opinion of the Court

I
Before 1996, Congress defined child pornography as thetype of depictions at issue in

Ferber, images made usingactual minors. 18 U. S. C. $ 2252 (1994 ed.). The CPPA retains that prohibition at 18 U. S. C. $ 2256(8)(A) and addsthree other prohibited categories of speech, of which the
first, $ 2256(8)(B), and the third, $ 2256(8)(D), are at issue inthis case. Section 2256(8)(B) prohibits "any visual depiction,
including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer orcomputer-generated image or picture," that "is, or appears to
be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." Theprohibition on "any visual depiction" does not depend at all
on how the image is produced. The section captures a rangeof depictions, sometimes called "virtual child pornography,"
which include computer-generated images, as well as imagesproduced by more traditional means. For instance, the literal terms of the statute embrace a Renaissance paintingdepicting a scene from classical mythology, a "picture" that
"appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit con-duct." The statute also prohibits Hollywood movies, filmed
without any child actors, if a jury believes an actor "appearsto be" a minor engaging in "actual or simulated . . . sexual
intercourse." $ 2256(2).These images do not involve, let alone harm, any children
in the production process; but Congress decided the materi-als threaten children in other, less direct, ways. Pedophiles
might use the materials to encourage children to participatein sexual activity. "[A] child who is reluctant to engage in
sexual activity with an adult, or to pose for sexually explicitphotographs, can sometimes be convinced by viewing depictions of other children `having fun' participating in suchactivity." Congressional Finding (3), notes following $ 2251.
Furthermore, pedophiles might "whet their own sexual ap-petites" with the pornographic images, "thereby increasing
the creation and distribution of child pornography and thesexual abuse and exploitation of actual children."

Id., Find535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ings (4), (10)(B). Under these rationales, harm flows fromthe content of the images, not from the means of their production. In addition, Congress identified another problemcreated by computer-generated images: Their existence can
make it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use realminors. See

id., Finding (6)(A). As imaging technology
improves, Congress found, it becomes more difficult to prove
that a particular picture was produced using actual children.To ensure that defendants possessing child pornography

using real minors cannot evade prosecution, Congress ex-tended the ban to virtual child pornography.

Section 2256(8)(C) prohibits a more common and lower
tech means of creating virtual images, known as computer
morphing. Rather than creating original images, pornographers can alter innocent pictures of real children so that the
children appear to be engaged in sexual activity. Although
morphed images may fall within the definition of virtual
child pornography, they implicate the interests of real children and are in that sense closer to the images in Ferber.
Respondents do not challenge this provision, and we do not
consider it.

Respondents do challenge $ 2256(8)(D). Like the text of
the "appears to be" provision, the sweep of this provision
is quite broad. Section 2256(8)(D) defines child pornography
to include any sexually explicit image that was "advertised,
promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a
manner that conveys the impression" it depicts "a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct." One Committee
Report identified the provision as directed at sexually explicit images pandered as child pornography. See S. Rep.
No. 104-358, p. 22 (1996) ("This provision prevents child
pornographers and pedophiles from exploiting prurient interests in child sexuality and sexual activity through the
production or distribution of pornographic material which is
intentionally pandered as child pornography"). The statute
is not so limited in its reach, however, as it punishes even

Opinion of the Court
those possessors who took no part in pandering. Once awork has been described as child pornography, the taint remains on the speech in the hands of subsequent possessors,making possession unlawful even though the content otherwise would not be objectionable.Fearing that the CPPA threatened the activities of its
members, respondent Free Speech Coalition and others challenged the statute in the United States District Court forthe Northern District of California. The Coalition, a California trade association for the adult-entertainment indus-try, alleged that its members did not use minors in their
sexually explicit works, but they believed some of these
materials might fall within the CPPA's expanded definition
of child pornography. The other respondents are Bold Type,
Inc., the publisher of a book advocating the nudist lifestyle; Jim Gingerich, a painter of nudes; and Ron Raffaelli,
a photographer specializing in erotic images. Respondents
alleged that the "appears to be" and "conveys the impression" provisions are overbroad and vague, chilling them from
producing works protected by the First Amendment. The
District Court disagreed and granted summary judgment
to the Government. The court dismissed the overbreadth
claim because it was "highly unlikely" that any "adaptations
of sexual works like `Romeo and Juliet,' . . . will be treated
as `criminal contraband.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a-63a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. See
198 F. 3d 1083 (1999). The court reasoned that the Government could not prohibit speech because of its tendency to
persuade viewers to commit illegal acts. The court held the
CPPA to be substantially overbroad because it bans materials that are neither obscene nor produced by the exploitation
of real children as in New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747 (1982).
Judge Ferguson dissented on the ground that virtual images,
like obscenity and real child pornography, should be treated
as a category of speech unprotected by the First Amendment. 198 F. 3d, at 1097. The Court of Appeals voted to

Opinion of the Court
deny the petition for rehearing en banc, over the dissent ofthree judges. See 220 F. 3d 1113 (2000).

While the Ninth Circuit found the CPPA invalid on itsface, four other Courts of Appeals have sustained it. See
United States v. Fox, 248 F. 3d 394 (CA5 2001); United Statesv. Mento, 231 F. 3d 912 (CA4 2000); United States v. Acheson,
195 F. 3d 645 (CA11 1999); United States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61 (CA1), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 844 (1999). We granted
certiorari. 531 U. S. 1124 (2001).

II
The First Amendment commands, "Congress shall makeno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." The government may violate this mandate in many ways, e. g., Ro-senberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.
819 (1995); Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1 (1990), buta law imposing criminal penalties on protected speech is a
stark example of speech suppression. The CPPA's penaltiesare indeed severe. A first offender may be imprisoned for
15 years. $ 2252A(b)(1). A repeat offender faces a prisonsentence of not less than 5 years and not more than 30 years
in prison. Ibid. While even minor punishments can chillprotected speech, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705
(1977), this case provides a textbook example of why we per-mit facial challenges to statutes that burden expression.
With these severe penalties in force, few legitimate movieproducers or book publishers, or few other speakers in any
capacity, would risk distributing images in or near the un-certain reach of this law. The Constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech withinthe First Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under
this principle, the CPPA is unconstitutional on its face ifit prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression.
See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973).The sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an
act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people. In

Opinion of the Court
its legislative findings, Congress recognized that there aresubcultures of persons who harbor illicit desires for children

and commit criminal acts to gratify the impulses. See Con-gressional Findings, notes following $ 2251; see also U. S.
Dept. of Health and Human Services, Administration onChildren, Youth and Families, Child Maltreatment 1999
(estimating that 93,000 children were victims of sexual abuse
in 1999). Congress also found that surrounding the seriousoffenders are those who flirt with these impulses and trade

pictures and written accounts of sexual activity with youngchildren.

Congress may pass valid laws to protect children from
abuse, and it has. E. g., 18 U. S. C. $$ 2241, 2251. The prospect of crime, however, by itself does not justify laws suppressing protected speech. See Kingsley Int'l Pictures
Corp. v. Regents of Univ. of N. Y., 360 U. S. 684, 689 (1959)
("Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to
prevent crime are education and punishment for violations
of the law, not abridgment of the rights of free speech"
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). It is also
well established that speech may not be prohibited because
it concerns subjects offending our sensibilities. See FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 745 (1978) ("[T]he fact
that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it"); see also Reno v. American Civil
Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874 (1997) ("In evaluating the
free speech rights of adults, we have made it perfectly clear
that `[s]exual expression which is indecent but not obscene is
protected by the First Amendment' ") (quoting Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989));
Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977)
("[T]he fact that protected speech may be offensive to some
does not justify its suppression").

As a general principle, the First Amendment bars the
government from dictating what we see or read or speak
or hear. The freedom of speech has its limits; it does not

Opinion of the Court
embrace certain categories of speech, including defamation,incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real

children. See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y.
State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring). While these categories may be pro-hibited without violating the First Amendment, none of

them includes the speech prohibited by the CPPA. In his
dissent from the opinion of the Court of Appeals, JudgeFerguson recognized this to be the law and proposed that

virtual child pornography should be regarded as an addi-tional category of unprotected speech. See 198 F. 3d, at
1101. It would be necessary for us to take this step to
uphold the statute.

As we have noted, the CPPA is much more than a supplement to the existing federal prohibition on obscenity.
Under Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), the Government must prove that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light
of community standards, and lacks serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value. Id., at 24. The CPPA, however, extends to images that appear to depict a minor engaging in sexually explicit activity without regard to the
Miller requirements. The materials need not appeal to the
prurient interest. Any depiction of sexually explicit activity, no matter how it is presented, is proscribed. The
CPPA applies to a picture in a psychology manual, as well
as a movie depicting the horrors of sexual abuse. It is not
necessary, moreover, that the image be patently offensive.
Pictures of what appear to be 17-year-olds engaging in sexually explicit activity do not in every case contravene community standards.

The CPPA prohibits speech despite its serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value. The statute proscribes
the visual depiction of an idea--that of teenagers engaging
in sexual activity--that is a fact of modern society and has
been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages.

Opinion of the Court
Under the CPPA, images are prohibited so long as thepersons appear to be under 18 years of age. 18 U. S. C.

$ 2256(1). This is higher than the legal age for marriage inmany States, as well as the age at which persons may consent to sexual relations. See $ 2243(a) (age of consent in thefederal maritime and territorial jurisdiction is 16); U. S. National Survey of State Laws 384-388 (R. Leiter ed., 3d ed.
1999) (48 States permit 16-year-olds to marry with parentalconsent); W. Eskridge & N. Hunter, Sexuality, Gender, and

the Law 1021-1022 (1997) (in 39 States and the Districtof Columbia, the age of consent is 16 or younger). It is, of
course, undeniable that some youths engage in sexual activity before the legal age, either on their own inclination
or because they are victims of sexual abuse.

Both themes--teenage sexual activity and the sexual
abuse of children--have inspired countless literary works.
William Shakespeare created the most famous pair of teenage lovers, one of whom is just 13 years of age. See Romeo
and Juliet, act I, sc. 2, l. 9 ("She hath not seen the change of
fourteen years"). In the drama, Shakespeare portrays the
relationship as something splendid and innocent, but not
juvenile. The work has inspired no less than 40 motion
pictures, some of which suggest that the teenagers consummated their relationship. E. g., Romeo and Juliet (B. Luhrmann director, 1996). Shakespeare may not have written
sexually explicit scenes for the Elizabethan audience, but
were modern directors to adopt a less conventional approach,
that fact alone would not compel the conclusion that the work
was obscene.

Contemporary movies pursue similar themes. Last year's
Academy Awards featured the movie, Traffic, which was
nominated for Best Picture. See Predictable and Less So,
the Academy Award Contenders, N. Y. Times, Feb. 14, 2001,
p. E11. The film portrays a teenager, identified as a 16-
year-old, who becomes addicted to drugs. The viewer sees
the degradation of her addiction, which in the end leads her

Opinion of the Court
to a filthy room to trade sex for drugs. The year before,American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

See "American Beauty" Tops the Oscars, N. Y. Times, Mar.27, 2000, p. E1. In the course of the movie, a teenage girl
engages in sexual relations with her teenage boyfriend, andanother yields herself to the gratification of a middle-aged
man. The film also contains a scene where, although the
movie audience understands the act is not taking place, onecharacter believes he is watching a teenage boy performing

a sexual act on an older man.Our society, like other cultures, has empathy and enduring
fascination with the lives and destinies of the young. Art
and literature express the vital interest we all have in the
formative years we ourselves once knew, when wounds can
be so grievous, disappointment so profound, and mistaken
choices so tragic, but when moral acts and self-fulfillment
are still in reach. Whether or not the films we mention
violate the CPPA, they explore themes within the wide
sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those subjects,
contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within
the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be
subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the work's
redeeming value. This is inconsistent with an essential
First Amendment rule: The artistic merit of a work does not
depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See Book
Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"
v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966)
(plurality opinion) ("[T]he social value of the book can neither be weighed against nor canceled by its prurient appeal
or patent offensiveness"). Under Miller, the First Amendment requires that redeeming value be judged by considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the
narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become
obscene, even though the scene in isolation might be offensive. See Kois v. Wisconsin, 408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972) (per

curiam). For this reason, and the others we have noted,the CPPA cannot be read to prohibit obscenity, because it

lacks the required link between its prohibitions and theaffront to community standards prohibited by the definition
of obscenity.The Government seeks to address this deficiency by arguing that speech prohibited by the CPPA is virtually indistinguishable from child pornography, which may be bannedwithout regard to whether it depicts works of value. See

New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S., at 761. Where the imagesare themselves the product of child sexual abuse,

Ferber
recognized that the State had an interest in stamping it out
without regard to any judgment about its content. Id., at
761, n. 12; see also id., at 775 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("As
drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress
the communication of particular ideas"). The production of
the work, not its content, was the target of the statute. The
fact that a work contained serious literary, artistic, or other
value did not excuse the harm it caused to its child participants. It was simply "unrealistic to equate a community's
toleration for sexually oriented materials with the permissible scope of legislation aimed at protecting children from
sexual exploitation." Id., at 761, n. 12.

Ferber upheld a prohibition on the distribution and sale
of child pornography, as well as its production, because these
acts were "intrinsically related" to the sexual abuse of children in two ways. Id., at 759. First, as a permanent record
of a child's abuse, the continued circulation itself would harm
the child who had participated. Like a defamatory statement, each new publication of the speech would cause new
injury to the child's reputation and emotional well-being.
See id., at 759, and n. 10. Second, because the traffic in child
pornography was an economic motive for its production, the
State had an interest in closing the distribution network.
"The most expeditious if not the only practical method of law
enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material

Opinion of the Court
by imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, ad-vertising, or otherwise promoting the product."

Id., at 760.
Under either rationale, the speech had what the Court ineffect held was a proximate link to the crime from which

it came.Later, in

Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103 (1990), the Court
ruled that these same interests justified a ban on the possession of pornography produced by using children. "Given theimportance of the State's interest in protecting the victims

of child pornography," the State was justified in "attemptingto stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain."
Id., at 110. Osborne also noted the State's interest in preventing child pornography from being used as an aid in the
solicitation of minors. Id., at 111. The Court, however, anchored its holding in the concern for the participants, those
whom it called the "victims of child pornography." Id., at
110. It did not suggest that, absent this concern, other governmental interests would suffice. See infra, at 251-253.

In contrast to the speech in Ferber, speech that itself is
the record of sexual abuse, the CPPA prohibits speech that
records no crime and creates no victims by its production.
Virtual child pornography is not "intrinsically related" to the
sexual abuse of children, as were the materials in Ferber.
458 U. S., at 759. While the Government asserts that the
images can lead to actual instances of child abuse, see infra,
at 251-254, the causal link is contingent and indirect. The
harm does not necessarily follow from the speech, but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts.

The Government says these indirect harms are sufficient
because, as Ferber acknowledged, child pornography rarely
can be valuable speech. See 458 U. S., at 762 ("The value
of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct is
exceedingly modest, if not de minimis"). This argument,
however, suffers from two flaws. First, Ferber's judg535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

251Cite as: 535 U. S. 234 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
ment about child pornography was based upon how it wasmade, not on what it communicated. The case reaffirmed

that where the speech is neither obscene nor the productof sexual abuse, it does not fall outside the protection of the
First Amendment. See id., at 764-765 ("[T]he distributionof descriptions or other depictions of sexual conduct, not
otherwise obscene, which do not involve live performanceor photographic or other visual reproduction of live performances, retains First Amendment protection").The second flaw in the Government's position is that
Ferber did not hold that child pornography is by definitionwithout value. On the contrary, the Court recognized some
works in this category might have significant value, see id.,at 761, but relied on virtual images--the very images prohibited by the CPPA--as an alternative and permissiblemeans of expression: "[I]f it were necessary for literary or
artistic value, a person over the statutory age who perhapslooked younger could be utilized. Simulation outside of the
prohibition of the statute could provide another alternative."Id., at 763. Ferber, then, not only referred to the distinction
between actual and virtual child pornography, it relied onit as a reason supporting its holding. Ferber provides no
support for a statute that eliminates the distinction andmakes the alternative mode criminal as well.

III
The CPPA, for reasons we have explored, is inconsistentwith Miller and finds no support in Ferber. The Government seeks to justify its prohibitions in other ways. It ar-gues that the CPPA is necessary because pedophiles may
use virtual child pornography to seduce children. Thereare many things innocent in themselves, however, such as
cartoons, video games, and candy, that might be used forimmoral purposes, yet we would not expect those to be
prohibited because they can be misused. The Government,of course, may punish adults who provide unsuitable mate535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

rials to children, see Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629
(1968), and it may enforce criminal penalties for unlawful
solicitation. The precedents establish, however, that speech
within the rights of adults to hear may not be silenced completely in an attempt to shield children from it. See Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989).
In Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 381 (1957), the Court
invalidated a statute prohibiting distribution of an indecent
publication because of its tendency to " `incite minors to violent or depraved or immoral acts.' " A unanimous Court
agreed upon the important First Amendment principle that
the State could not "reduce the adult population . . . to
reading only what is fit for children." Id., at 383. We have
reaffirmed this holding. See United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 814 (2000) ("[T]he
objective of shielding children does not suffice to support a
blanket ban if the protection can be accomplished by a less
restrictive alternative"); Reno v. American Civil Liberties
Union, 521 U. S., at 875 (The "governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials . . . does not justify
an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to
adults"); Sable Communications v. FCC, supra, at 130-131
(striking down a ban on "dial-a-porn" messages that had "the
invalid effect of limiting the content of adult telephone conversations to that which is suitable for children to hear").

Here, the Government wants to keep speech from children
not to protect them from its content but to protect them
from those who would commit other crimes. The principle,
however, remains the same: The Government cannot ban
speech fit for adults simply because it may fall into the hands
of children. The evil in question depends upon the actor's
unlawful conduct, conduct defined as criminal quite apart
from any link to the speech in question. This establishes
that the speech ban is not narrowly drawn. The objective
is to prohibit illegal conduct, but this restriction goes well

535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

253Cite as: 535 U. S. 234 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
beyond that interest by restricting the speech available tolaw-abiding adults.

The Government submits further that virtual child por-nography whets the appetites of pedophiles and encourages
them to engage in illegal conduct. This rationale cannotsustain the provision in question. The mere tendency of
speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason
for banning it. The government "cannot constitutionallypremise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person's private thoughts." Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557,566 (1969). First Amendment freedoms are most in danger
when the government seeks to control thought or to justify
its laws for that impermissible end. The right to think is
the beginning of freedom, and speech must be protected from
the government because speech is the beginning of thought.

To preserve these freedoms, and to protect speech for
its own sake, the Court's First Amendment cases draw vital
distinctions between words and deeds, between ideas and
conduct. See Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp., 360 U. S., at
689; see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 529 (2001)
("The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to
impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it"). The government may not prohibit speech
because it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed "at some indefinite future time." Hess v. Indiana,
414 U. S. 105, 108 (1973) (per curiam). The government
may suppress speech for advocating the use of force or a
violation of law only if "such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely
to incite or produce such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio,
395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969) (per curiam). There is here no
attempt, incitement, solicitation, or conspiracy. The Government has shown no more than a remote connection between speech that might encourage thoughts or impulses and
any resulting child abuse. Without a significantly stronger,
more direct connection, the Government may not prohibit

254 ASHCROFT v. FREE SPEECH COALITION

Opinion of the Court
speech on the ground that it may encourage pedophiles to
engage in illegal conduct.

The Government next argues that its objective of eliminating the market for pornography produced using real
children necessitates a prohibition on virtual images as well.
Virtual images, the Government contends, are indistinguishable from real ones; they are part of the same market
and are often exchanged. In this way, it is said, virtual images promote the trafficking in works produced through the
exploitation of real children. The hypothesis is somewhat
implausible. If virtual images were identical to illegal child
pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the
market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would risk prosecution by abusing real children
if fictional, computerized images would suffice.

In the case of the material covered by Ferber, the creation
of the speech is itself the crime of child abuse; the prohibition deters the crime by removing the profit motive. See
Osborne, 495 U. S., at 109-110. Even where there is an
underlying crime, however, the Court has not allowed the
suppression of speech in all cases. E. g., Bartnicki, supra,
at 529 (market deterrence would not justify law prohibiting
a radio commentator from distributing speech that had been
unlawfully intercepted). We need not consider where to
strike the balance in this case, because here, there is no
underlying crime at all. Even if the Government's market
deterrence theory were persuasive in some contexts, it
would not justify this statute.

Finally, the Government says that the possibility of producing images by using computer imaging makes it very
difficult for it to prosecute those who produce pornography
by using real children. Experts, we are told, may have difficulty in saying whether the pictures were made by using
real children or by using computer imaging. The necessary
solution, the argument runs, is to prohibit both kinds of im535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

255Cite as: 535 U. S. 234 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
ages. The argument, in essence, is that protected speech
may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech. This
analysis turns the First Amendment upside down.

The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the
means to suppress unlawful speech. Protected speech does
not become unprotected merely because it resembles the
latter. The Constitution requires the reverse. "[T]he possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech
to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech of others may be muted . . . ." Broadrick
v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S., at 612. The overbreadth doctrine
prohibits the Government from banning unprotected speech
if a substantial amount of protected speech is prohibited or
chilled in the process.

To avoid the force of this objection, the Government would
have us read the CPPA not as a measure suppressing speech
but as a law shifting the burden to the accused to prove
the speech is lawful. In this connection, the Government
relies on an affirmative defense under the statute, which
allows a defendant to avoid conviction for nonpossession
offenses by showing that the materials were produced using
only adults and were not otherwise distributed in a manner
conveying the impression that they depicted real children.
See 18 U. S. C. $ 2252A(c).

The Government raises serious constitutional difficulties
by seeking to impose on the defendant the burden of proving
his speech is not unlawful. An affirmative defense applies
only after prosecution has begun, and the speaker must
himself prove, on pain of a felony conviction, that his conduct falls within the affirmative defense. In cases under
the CPPA, the evidentiary burden is not trivial. Where the
defendant is not the producer of the work, he may have no
way of establishing the identity, or even the existence, of
the actors. If the evidentiary issue is a serious problem for
the Government, as it asserts, it will be at least as difficult

535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
256 ASHCROFT v. FREE SPEECH COALITION

Opinion of the Court
for the innocent possessor. The statute, moreover, appliesto work created before 1996, and the producers themselves

may not have preserved the records necessary to meet theburden of proof. Failure to establish the defense can lead
to a felony conviction.We need not decide, however, whether the Government
could impose this burden on a speaker. Even if an affirmative defense can save a statute from First Amendment chal-lenge, here the defense is incomplete and insufficient, even

on its own terms. It allows persons to be convicted in someinstances where they can prove children were not exploited
in the production. A defendant charged with possessing,
as opposed to distributing, proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the film depicts only adult actors.
See ibid. So while the affirmative defense may protect a
movie producer from prosecution for the act of distribution,
that same producer, and all other persons in the subsequent
distribution chain, could be liable for possessing the prohibited work. Furthermore, the affirmative defense provides
no protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging, or through other means that do not involve
the use of adult actors who appear to be minors. See ibid.
In these cases, the defendant can demonstrate no children
were harmed in producing the images, yet the affirmative
defense would not bar the prosecution. For this reason, the
affirmative defense cannot save the statute, for it leaves
unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the
Government's interest in distinguishing images produced
using real children from virtual ones.

In sum, $ 2256(8)(B) covers materials beyond the categories recognized in Ferber and Miller, and the reasons the
Government offers in support of limiting the freedom of
speech have no justification in our precedents or in the law
of the First Amendment. The provision abridges the freedom to engage in a substantial amount of lawful speech.
For this reason, it is overbroad and unconstitutional.

IV
Respondents challenge $ 2256(8)(D) as well. This provi-sion bans depictions of sexually explicit conduct that are

"advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributedin such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging insexually explicit conduct." The parties treat the section as
nearly identical to the provision prohibiting materials thatappear to be child pornography. In the Government's view,
the difference between the two is that "the `conveys the im-pression' provision requires the jury to assess the material
at issue in light of the manner in which it is promoted."Brief for Petitioners 18, n. 3. The Government's assumption, however, is that the determination would still dependprincipally upon the content of the prohibited work.

We disagree with this view. The CPPA prohibits sexuallyexplicit materials that "conve[y] the impression" they depict
minors. While that phrase may sound like the "appears tobe" prohibition in $ 2256(8)(B), it requires little judgment
about the content of the image. Under $ 2256(8)(D), thework must be sexually explicit, but otherwise the content
is irrelevant. Even if a film contains no sexually explicitscenes involving minors, it could be treated as child pornography if the title and trailers convey the impression thatthe scenes would be found in the movie. The determination turns on how the speech is presented, not on what isdepicted. While the legislative findings address at length
the problems posed by materials that look like child pornog-raphy, they are silent on the evils posed by images simply
pandered that way.The Government does not offer a serious defense of this
provision, and the other arguments it makes in support ofthe CPPA do not bear on $ 2256(8)(D). The materials, for
instance, are not likely to be confused for child pornog-raphy in a criminal trial. The Court has recognized that
pandering may be relevant, as an evidentiary matter, to

535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
258 ASHCROFT v. FREE SPEECH COALITION

Opinion of the Court
the question whether particular materials are obscene. SeeGinzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463, 474 (1966) ("[I]n

close cases evidence of pandering may be probative with re-spect to the nature of the material in question and thus
satisfy the [obscenity] test"). Where a defendant engagesin the "commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the
sake of their prurient appeal," id., at 466, the context heor she creates may itself be relevant to the evaluation of
the materials.Section 2256(8)(D), however, prohibits a substantial
amount of speech that falls outside Ginzburg's rationale.Materials falling within the proscription are tainted and
unlawful in the hands of all who receive it, though they bearno responsibility for how it was marketed, sold, or described.
The statute, furthermore, does not require that the contextbe part of an effort at "commercial exploitation."

Ibid. Asa consequence, the CPPA does more than prohibit pandering.

It prohibits possession of material described, or pandered,as child pornography by someone earlier in the distribution chain. The provision prohibits a sexually explicit filmcontaining no youthful actors, just because it is placed in a
box suggesting a prohibited movie. Possession is a crimeeven when the possessor knows the movie was mislabeled.
The First Amendment requires a more precise restriction.For this reason, $ 2256(8)(D) is substantially overbroad and
in violation of the First Amendment.

V
For the reasons we have set forth, the prohibitions of$$ 2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) are overbroad and unconstitutional. Having reached this conclusion, we need not ad-dress respondents' further contention that the provisions
are unconstitutional because of vague statutory language.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
In my view, the Government's most persuasive assertedinterest in support of the Child Pornography Prevention Act

of 1996 (CPPA), 18 U. S. C. $ 2251 et seq., is the prosecutionrationale--that persons who possess and disseminate pornographic images of real children may escape conviction byclaiming that the images are computer generated, thereby
raising a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. See Brief forPetitioners 37. At this time, however, the Government asserts only that defendants raise such defenses, not that theyhave done so successfully. In fact, the Government points
to no case in which a defendant has been acquitted based ona "computer-generated images" defense. See id., at 37-38,
and n. 8. While this speculative interest cannot supportthe broad reach of the CPPA, technology may evolve to the
point where it becomes impossible to enforce actual childpornography laws because the Government cannot prove
that certain pornographic images are of real children. Inthe event this occurs, the Government should not be foreclosed from enacting a regulation of virtual child pornogra-phy that contains an appropriate affirmative defense or some
other narrowly drawn restriction.

The Court suggests that the Government's interest in en-forcing prohibitions against real child pornography cannot

justify prohibitions on virtual child pornography, because"[t]his analysis turns the First Amendment upside down.
The Government may not suppress lawful speech as themeans to suppress unlawful speech."

Ante, at 255. But
if technological advances thwart prosecution of "unlawfulspeech," the Government may well have a compelling interest in barring or otherwise regulating some narrow cate-gory of "lawful speech" in order to enforce effectively laws
against pornography made through the abuse of real chil-dren. The Court does leave open the possibility that a more
complete affirmative defense could save a statute's constitutionality, see ante, at 256, implicitly accepting that some

regulation of virtual child pornography might be constitu-tional. I would not prejudge, however, whether a more

complete affirmative defense is the only way to narrowlytailor a criminal statute that prohibits the possession and
dissemination of virtual child pornography. Thus, I concurin the judgment of the Court.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join as to Part II, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), 18
U. S. C. $ 2251 et seq., proscribes the "knowin[g]" reproduc-tion, distribution, sale, reception, or possession of images

that fall under the statute's definition of child pornography,$ 2252A(a). Possession is punishable by up to 5 years in
prison for a first offense, $ 2252A(b), and all other transgressions are punishable by up to 15 years in prison for a first
offense, $ 2252A(a). The CPPA defines child pornography to
include "any visual depiction . . . of sexually explicit conduct"
where "such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct," $ 2256(8)(B) (emphasis
added), or "such visual depiction is advertised, promoted,
presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that
conveys the impression that the material is or contains a
visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct," $ 2256(8)(D) (emphasis added). The statute defines
"sexually explicit conduct" as "actual or simulated--. . . sexual intercourse . . . ; . . . bestiality; . . . masturbation; . . .
sadistic or masochistic abuse; or . . . lascivious exhibition of
the genitals or pubic area of any person." $ 2256(2).

The CPPA provides for two affirmative defenses. First,
a defendant is not liable for possession if the defendant possesses less than three proscribed images and promptly destroys such images or reports the matter to law enforcement.

$ 2252A(d). Second, a defendant is not liable for the remaining acts proscribed in $ 2252A(a) if the images involved were

produced using only adult subjects and are not presented in
such a manner as to "convey the impression" they contain
depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

$ 2252A(c).

This litigation involves a facial challenge to the CPPA's
prohibitions of pornographic images that "appea[r] to be . . .
of a minor" and of material that "conveys the impression"
that it contains pornographic images of minors. While I
agree with the Court's judgment that the First Amendment
requires that the latter prohibition be struck down, I
disagree with its decision to strike down the former prohibition in its entirety. The "appears to be . . . of a minor"
language in $ 2256(8)(B) covers two categories of speech: pornographic images of adults that look like children ("youthful
adult pornography") and pornographic images of children
created wholly on a computer, without using any actual children ("virtual child pornography"). The Court concludes,
correctly, that the CPPA's ban on youthful adult pornography is overbroad. In my view, however, respondents fail to
present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the ban on
virtual child pornography is overbroad. Because invalidation due to overbreadth is such "strong medicine," Broadrick
v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 613 (1973), I would strike down
the prohibition of pornography that "appears to be" of minors only insofar as it is applied to the class of youthful
adult pornography.

I

Respondents assert that the CPPA's prohibitions of youthful adult pornography, virtual child pornography, and material that "conveys the impression" that it contains actual
child pornography are overbroad, that the prohibitions are
content-based regulations not narrowly tailored to serve a
compelling Government interest, and that the prohibitions
are unconstitutionally vague. The Government not only disagrees with these specific contentions, but also requests that

262 ASHCROFT v. FREE SPEECH COALITION

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the Court exclude youthful adult and virtual child pornography from the protection of the First Amendment.

I agree with the Court's decision not to grant this request.
Because the Government may already prohibit obscenity
without violating the First Amendment, see Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 23 (1973), what the Government asks
this Court to rule is that it may also prohibit youthful adult
and virtual child pornography that is merely indecent without violating that Amendment. Although such pornography
looks like the material at issue in New York v. Ferber, 458
U. S. 747 (1982), no children are harmed in the process of
creating such pornography. Id., at 759. Therefore, Ferber
does not support the Government's ban on youthful adult
and virtual child pornography. See ante, at 249-251. The
Government argues that, even if the production of such pornography does not directly harm children, this material aids
and abets child abuse. See ante, at 251-254. The Court
correctly concludes that the causal connection between pornographic images that "appear" to include minors and actual
child abuse is not strong enough to justify withdrawing First
Amendment protection for such speech. See ante, at 250.

I also agree with the Court's decision to strike down the
CPPA's ban on material presented in a manner that "conveys
the impression" that it contains pornographic depictions of
actual children ("actual child pornography"). 18 U. S. C.

$ 2256(8)(D). The Government fails to explain how this ban
serves any compelling state interest. Any speech covered
by $ 2256(8)(D) that is obscene, actual child pornography, or
otherwise indecent is prohibited by other federal statutes.
See $$ 1460-1466 (obscenity), 2256(8)(A), (B) (actual child
pornography), 2256(8)(B) (youthful adult and virtual child
pornography). The Court concludes that $ 2256(8)(D) is
overbroad, but its reasoning also persuades me that the
provision is not narrowly tailored. See ante, at 257-258.
The provision therefore fails strict scrutiny. United States

v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813(2000).

Finally, I agree with the Court that the CPPA's ban onyouthful adult pornography is overbroad. The Court provides several examples of movies that, although possessingserious literary, artistic, or political value and employing
only adult actors to perform simulated sexual conduct, fallunder the CPPA's proscription on images that "appea[r] to
be . . . of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct," 18U. S. C. $ 2256(8)(B). See

ante, at 247-248 (citing Romeo andJuliet, Traffic, and American Beauty). Individuals or businesses found to possess just three such films have no defenseto criminal liability under the CPPA. $ 2252A(d).

II
I disagree with the Court, however, that the CPPA's prohi-bition of virtual child pornography is overbroad. Before I

reach that issue, there are two preliminary questions:whether the ban on virtual child pornography fails strict
scrutiny and whether that ban is unconstitutionally vague.I would answer both in the negative.

The Court has long recognized that the Government has acompelling interest in protecting our Nation's children. See
Ferber, supra, at 756-757 (citing cases). This interest ispromoted by efforts directed against sexual offenders and
actual child pornography. These efforts, in turn, are sup-ported by the CPPA's ban on virtual child pornography.

fully employed this tactic. See, e. g., United States v. Fox,248 F. 3d 394 (CA5 2001);

United States v. Vig, 167 F. 3d 443
(CA8 1999); United States v. Kimbrough, 69 F. 3d 723 (CA51995);

United States v. Coleman, 54 M. J. 869 (Army Ct.
Crim. App. 2001). But, given the rapid pace of advances incomputer-graphics technology, the Government's concern is

reasonable. Computer-generated images lodged with the
Court by amici curiae National Law Center for Childrenand Families et al. bear a remarkable likeness to actual

human beings. Anyone who has seen, for example, the filmFinal Fantasy: The Spirits Within (H. Sakaguchi and M. Sakakibara directors, 2001) can understand the Government's
concern. Moreover, this Court's cases do not require Congress to wait for harm to occur before it can legislate against
it. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S.
180, 212 (1997).

Respondents argue that, even if the Government has a
compelling interest to justify banning virtual child pornography, the "appears to be . . . of a minor" language is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989). They
assert that the CPPA would capture even cartoon sketches
or statues of children that were sexually suggestive. Such
images surely could not be used, for instance, to seduce children. I agree. A better interpretation of "appears to
be . . . of " is "virtually indistinguishable from"--an interpretation that would not cover the examples respondents provide. Not only does the text of the statute comfortably bear
this narrowing interpretation, the interpretation comports
with the language that Congress repeatedly used in its findings of fact. See, e. g., Congressional Finding (8), notes following 18 U. S. C. $ 2251 (discussing how "visual depictions
produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or
other means, including by computer, which are virtually

indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from photographic images of actual children" may whet the appetites of

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
child molesters). See also id., Findings (5), (12). Finally,to the extent that the phrase "appears to be . . . of " is ambiguous, the narrowing interpretation avoids constitutionalproblems such as overbreadth and lack of narrow tailoring.
See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932).Reading the statute only to bar images that are virtually
indistinguishable from actual children would not only assure
that the ban on virtual child pornography is narrowly tai-lored, but would also assuage any fears that the "appears

to be . . . of a minor" language is vague. The narrow read-ing greatly limits any risks from " `discriminatory enforcement.' " Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S.
844, 872 (1997). Respondents maintain that the "virtually
indistinguishable from" language is also vague because it
begs the question: from whose perspective? This problem is
exaggerated. This Court has never required "mathematical
certainty" or " `meticulous specificity' " from the language of
a statute. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 110
(1972).

The Court concludes that the CPPA's ban on virtual child
pornography is overbroad. The basis for this holding is unclear. Although a content-based regulation may serve a
compelling state interest, and be as narrowly tailored as possible while substantially serving that interest, the regulation
may unintentionally ensnare speech that has serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value or that does not threaten
the harms sought to be combated by the Government. If
so, litigants may challenge the regulation on its face as overbroad, but in doing so they bear the heavy burden of demonstrating that the regulation forbids a substantial amount
of valuable or harmless speech. See Reno, supra, at 896
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting
in part) (citing Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 615). Respondents
have not made such a demonstration. Respondents provide
no examples of films or other materials that are wholly computer generated and contain images that "appea[r] to be . . .

of minors" engaging in indecent conduct, but that have seri-ous value or do not facilitate child abuse. Their overbreadth

challenge therefore fails. III

Although in my view the CPPA's ban on youthful adultpornography appears to violate the First Amendment, the
ban on virtual child pornography does not. It is true thatboth bans are authorized by the same text: The statute's
definition of child pornography to include depictions that"appea[r] to be" of children in sexually explicit poses. 18
U. S. C. $ 2256(8)(B). Invalidating a statute due to over-breadth, however, is an extreme remedy, one that should be
employed "sparingly and only as a last resort." Broadrick,
supra, at 613. We have observed that "[i]t is not the usualjudicial practice, . . . nor do we consider it generally desirable, to proceed to an overbreadth issue unnecessarily."Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.
469, 484-485 (1989).Heeding this caution, I would strike the "appears to be"
provision only insofar as it is applied to the subset of casesinvolving youthful adult pornography. This approach is
similar to that taken in United States v. Grace, 461 U. S.171 (1983), which considered the constitutionality of a federal
statute that makes it unlawful to "parade, stand, or move inprocessions or assemblages in the Supreme Court Building
or grounds, or to display therein any flag, banner, or devicedesigned or adapted to bring into public notice any party,
organization, or movement." 40 U. S. C. $ 13k (1994 ed.).The term "Supreme Court . . . grounds" technically includes
the sidewalks surrounding the Court, but because sidewalkshave traditionally been considered a public forum, the Court
held the statute unconstitutional only when applied tosidewalks.

Although 18 U. S. C. $ 2256(8)(B) does not distinguish be-tween youthful adult and virtual child pornography, the
CPPA elsewhere draws a line between these two classes of

535US1 Unit: $U38 [09-18-03 16:25:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
speech. The statute provides an affirmative defense forthose who produce, distribute, or receive pornographic images of individuals who are actually adults, $ 2252A(c), butnot for those with pornographic images that are wholly computer generated. This is not surprising given that the legis-lative findings enacted by Congress contain no mention of
youthful adult pornography. Those findings focus explicitly
only on actual child pornography and virtual child pornogra-phy. See,

e. g., Finding (9), notes following $ 2251 ("[T]he
danger to children who are seduced and molested with theaid of child sex pictures is just as great when the child pornographer or child molester uses visual depictions of childsexual activity produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or other means, including by computer, as when the
material consists of unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct"). Drawing a line around, and striking just, the CPPA's ban on youthful adult pornography not only is consistent with Congress'
understanding of the categories of speech encompassed by

$ 2256(8)(B), but also preserves the CPPA's prohibition of the
material that Congress found most dangerous to children.

In sum, I would strike down the CPPA's ban on material
that "conveys the impression" that it contains actual child
pornography, but uphold the ban on pornographic depictions
that "appea[r] to be" of minors so long as it is not applied to
youthful adult pornography.

I agree with Part II of Justice O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

" `accord substantial deference to the predictive judgmentsof Congress' " in First Amendment cases).

I also agree with Justice O'Connor that serious FirstAmendment concerns would arise were the Government
ever to prosecute someone for simple distribution or posses-sion of a film with literary or artistic value, such as Traffic
or American Beauty. Ante, at 262-263 (opinion concurringin judgment in part and dissenting in part). I write separately, however, because the Child Pornography PreventionAct of 1996 (CPPA), 18 U. S. C. $ 2251

et seq., need not beconstrued to reach such materials.

We normally do not strike down a statute on First Amend-ment grounds "when a limiting construction has been or
could be placed on the challenged statute." Broadrick v.Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 613 (1973). See, e. g., New York v.
Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 769 (1982) (appreciating "the wide-reaching effects of striking down a statute on its face"); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 760 (1974) ("This Court has . . .repeatedly expressed its reluctance to strike down a statute
on its face where there were a substantial number of sit-uations to which it might be validly applied"). This case
should be treated no differently.Other than computer-generated images that are virtually
indistinguishable from real children engaged in sexually ex-plicit conduct, the CPPA can be limited so as not to reach
any material that was not already unprotected before the
CPPA. The CPPA's definition of "sexually explicit conduct"is quite explicit in this regard. It makes clear that the statute only reaches "visual depictions" of:

"[A]ctual or simulated . . . sexual intercourse, including
genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal,whether between persons of the same or opposite

sex; . . . bestiality; . . . masturbation; . . . sadistic ormasochistic abuse; or . . . lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person." 18 U. S. C. $ 2256(2).

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
The Court and Justice O'Connor suggest that this verygraphic definition reaches the depiction of youthful looking

adult actors engaged in suggestive sexual activity, presum-ably because the definition extends to "simulated" intercourse. Ante, at 247-248 (majority opinion); ante, at 263(opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part). Read as a whole, however, I think the definitionreaches only the sort of "hard core of child pornography"
that we found without protection in Ferber, supra, at 773-774. So construed, the CPPA bans visual depictions of
youthful looking adult actors engaged in actual sexual activ-ity; mere

suggestions of sexual activity, such as youthfullooking adult actors squirming under a blanket, are more

akin to written descriptions than visual depictions, and thusfall outside the purview of the statute.

1

The reference to "simulated" has been part of the defini-tion of "sexually explicit conduct" since the statute was first

passed. See Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploi-tation Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-225, 92 Stat. 7. But the inclusion of "simulated" conduct, alongside "actual" conduct, doesnot change the "hard core" nature of the image banned. The
reference to "simulated" conduct simply brings within thestatute's reach depictions of hardcore pornography that are
"made to look genuine," Webster's Ninth New CollegiateDictionary 1099 (1983)--including the main target of the
CPPA, computer-generated images virtually indistinguish-able from real children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
Neither actual conduct nor simulated conduct, however, isproperly construed to reach depictions such as those in a film
portrayal of Romeo and Juliet, ante, at 247-248 (majorityopinion); ante, at 263 (O'C

in part and dissenting in part), which are far removed fromthe hardcore pornographic depictions that Congress intended to reach.Indeed, we should be loath to construe a statute as banning film portrayals of Shakespearian tragedies, withoutsome indication--from text or legislative history--that such
a result was intended. In fact, Congress explicitly in-structed that such a reading of the CPPA would be wholly
unwarranted. As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuithas observed:

"[T]he legislative record, which makes plain that the[CPPA] was intended to target only a narrow class of
images--visual depictions `which are virtually indistin-guishable to unsuspecting viewers from unretouched
photographs of actual children engaging in identical
sexual conduct.' " United States v. Hilton, 167 F. 3d61, 72 (1999) (quoting S. Rep. No. 104-358, pt. I, p. 7

(1996)).
Judge Ferguson similarly observed in his dissent in the
Court of Appeals in this case:

"From reading the legislative history, it becomes clearthat the CPPA merely extends the existing prohibitions on `real' child pornography to a narrow class ofcomputer-generated pictures easily mistaken for real
photographs of real children." Free Speech Coalition
v. Reno, 198 F. 3d 1083, 1102 (CA9 1999).

See also S. Rep. No. 104-358, pt. IV(C), at 21 ("[The CPPA]does not, and is not intended to, apply to a depiction

produced using adults engaging i[n] sexually explicit con-duct, even where a depicted individual may appear to be a
minor" (emphasis in original)); id., pt. I, at 7 ("[The CPPA]addresses the problem of `high-tech kiddie porn' "). We

This narrow reading of "sexually explicit conduct" not onlyaccords with the text of the CPPA and the intentions of Congress; it is exactly how the phrase was understood prior tothe broadening gloss the Court gives it today. Indeed, had
"sexually explicit conduct" been thought to reach the sort ofmaterial the Court says it does, then films such as Traffic
and American Beauty would not have been made the waythey were.

Ante, at 247-248 (discussing these films' por-trayals of youthful looking adult actors engaged in sexually

suggestive conduct). Traffic won its Academy Award in2001. American Beauty won its Academy Award in 2000.
But the CPPA has been on the books, and has been enforced,since 1996. The chill felt by the Court, ante, at 244 ("[F]ew
legitimate movie producers . . . would risk distributing im-ages in or near the uncertain reach of this law"), has apparently never been felt by those who actually make movies.To the extent the CPPA prohibits possession or distribution of materials that "convey the impression" of a child en-gaged in sexually explicit conduct, that prohibition can and
should be limited to reach "the sordid business of pandering"which lies outside the bounds of First Amendment protection. Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463, 467 (1966);
e. g., id., at 472 (conduct that "deliberately emphasized thesexually provocative aspects of the work, in order to catch

the salaciously disposed," may lose First Amendment protec-tion); United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,
529 U. S. 803, 831-832 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (collect-ing cases). This is how the Government asks us to construe
the statute, Brief for Petitioners 18, and n. 3; Tr. of Oral Arg.27, and it is the most plausible reading of the text, which
prohibits only materials "advertised, promoted, presented,
described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the

impression that the material is or contains a visual depictionof a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 18

U. S. C. $ 2256(8)(D) (emphasis added).The First Amendment may protect the video shopowner
or film distributor who promotes material as "entertaining"or "acclaimed" regardless of whether the material contains
depictions of youthful looking adult actors engaged in nonobscene but sexually suggestive conduct. The First Amend-ment does not, however, protect the panderer. Thus, materials promoted as conveying the impression that they depictactual minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct do not
escape regulation merely because they might warrant First
Amendment protection if promoted in a different manner.
See Ginzburg, supra, at 474-476; cf. Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378
U. S. 184, 201 (1964) (Warren, C. J., dissenting) ("In my opinion, the use to which various materials are put--not just
the words and pictures themselves--must be considered in
determining whether or not the materials are obscene").
I would construe "conveys the impression" as limited to the
panderer, which makes the statute entirely consistent with
Ginzburg and other cases.

The Court says that "conveys the impression" goes well
beyond Ginzburg to "prohibi[t] [the] possession of material
described, or pandered, as child pornography by someone
earlier in the distribution chain." Ante, at 258. The
Court's concern is that an individual who merely possesses
protected materials (such as videocassettes of Traffic or
American Beauty) might offend the CPPA regardless of
whether the individual actually intended to possess materials containing unprotected images. Ante, at 248; see also
ante, at 263 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part) ("Individuals or businesses found to
possess just three such films have no defense to criminal liability under the CPPA").

This concern is a legitimate one, but there is, again,
no need or reason to construe the statute this way. In

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
X-Citement Video, supra, we faced a provision of the Protec-tion of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, the

precursor to the CPPA, which lent itself much less than thepresent statute to attributing a "knowingly" requirement to
the contents of the possessed visual depictions. We heldthat such a requirement nonetheless applied, so that the Government would have to prove that a person charged withpossessing child pornography actually knew that the materials contained depictions of real minors engaged in sexuallyexplicit conduct. 513 U. S., at 77-78. In light of this holding, and consistent with the narrow class of images the CPPAis intended to prohibit, the CPPA can be construed to prohibit only the knowing possession of materials actually con-taining visual depictions of real minors engaged in sexually
explicit conduct, or computer-generated images virtually in-distinguishable from real minors engaged in sexually explicit
conduct. The mere possession of materials containing onlysuggestive depictions of youthful looking adult actors need
not be so included.In sum, while potentially impermissible applications of

the CPPA may exist, I doubt that they would be "substantial. . . in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."
Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 615. The aim of ensuring the en-forceability of our Nation's child pornography laws is a compelling one. The CPPA is targeted to this aim by extendingthe definition of child pornography to reach computergenerated images that are virtually indistinguishable fromreal children engaged in sexually explicit conduct. The
statute need not be read to do any more than precisely this,which is not offensive to the First Amendment.

For these reasons, I would construe the CPPA in a mannerconsistent with the First Amendment, reverse the Court of
Appeals' judgment, and uphold the statute in its entirety.

274 OCTOBER TERM, 2001

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. CRAFT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 00-1831. Argued January 14, 2002--Decided April 17, 2002
When respondent's husband failed to pay federal income tax liabilities assessed against him, a federal tax lien attached to "all [of his] property
and rights to property." 26 U. S. C. $ 6321. After the notice of the lien
was filed, respondent and her husband jointly executed a quitclaim deed
purporting to transfer to her his interest in a piece of real property in
Michigan that they owned as tenants by the entirety. Subsequently,
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agreed to release the lien and allow
respondent to sell the property with half the net proceeds to be held in
escrow pending determination of the Government's interest in the property. She brought this action to quiet title to the escrowed proceeds.
The Government claimed, among other things, that its lien had attached
to the husband's interest in the tenancy by the entirety. The District
Court granted the Government summary judgment, but the Sixth Circuit held that no lien attached because the husband had no separate
interest in the entireties property under Michigan law, and remanded
the case for consideration of an alternative claim not at issue here. In
affirming the District Court's decision on remand, the Sixth Circuit held
that its prior opinion on the issue whether the lien attached to the husband's entireties property was the law of the case.

Held: The husband's interests in the entireties property constitute "property" or "rights to property" to which a federal tax lien may attach.
Pp. 278-289.

(a) Because the federal tax lien statute itself creates no property
rights, United States v. Bess, 357 U. S. 51, 55, this Court looks initially
to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the property
the Government seeks to reach and then to federal law to determine
whether such state-delineated rights qualify as property or rights to
property under $ 6321, Drye v. United States, 528 U. S. 49, 58. A common idiom describes property as a "bundle of sticks"--a collection of
individual rights which, in certain combinations, constitute property.
State law determines which sticks are in a person's bundle, but federal
law determines whether those sticks constitute property for federal tax
lien purposes. In looking to state law, this Court must consider the
substance of the state law rights, not the labels the State gives them or
the conclusions it draws from them. Pp. 278-279.

Syllabus
(b) Michigan law gave respondent's husband, among other rights, the
right to use the entireties property, the right to exclude others from it,
the right of survivorship, the right to become a tenant in common with
equal shares upon divorce, the right to sell the property with respondent's consent and to receive half the proceeds from such a sale, the right
to encumber the property with respondent's consent, and the right to
block respondent from selling or encumbering the property unilaterally. Pp. 279-282.

(c) The rights Michigan law granted respondent's husband qualify as
"property" or "rights to property" under $ 6321. The broad statutory
language authorizing the tax lien reveals that Congress meant to reach
every property interest that a taxpayer might have. United States v.
National Bank of Commerce, 472 U. S. 713, 719-720. The husband's
rights of use, exclusion, and income alone may be sufficient to subject
his entireties interest to the lien, for they gave him a substantial degree
of control over the property. See Drye, supra, at 61. He also had the
right to alienate the property with respondent's consent. The unilateral alienation stick is not essential to "property." Federal tax liens
may attach to property that cannot be unilaterally alienated, United
States v. Rodgers, 461 U. S. 677, and excluding such property would
exempt a rather large amount of what is commonly thought of as property. A number of the sticks in respondent's husband's bundle were
presently existing, so it is not necessary to consider whether his survivorship right alone, which respondent claims is an expectancy, would
qualify as property or rights to property. Were this Court to reach a
contrary conclusion, the entireties property would belong to no one for

$ 6321 purposes because respondent had no more interest in the property than her husband. Such a result seems absurd and would allow
spouses to shield their property from federal taxation by classifying
it as entireties property, facilitating abuse of the federal tax system.
Legislative history does not support respondent's position that Congress
did not intend that a federal tax lien attach to an entireties property
interest. And the common-law background of the tax lien statute's enactment is not enough to overcome the broad language Congress actually used. Pp. 283-288.

(d) That Michigan makes a different choice with respect to state law
creditors does not dictate the choice here. Because $ 6321's interpretation is a federal question, this Court is in no way bound by state courts'
answers to similar questions involving state law. Pp. 288-289.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case raises the question whether a tenant by the en-tirety possesses "property" or "rights to property" to which

a federal tax lien may attach. 26 U. S. C. $ 6321. Relyingon the state law fiction that a tenant by the entirety has no
separate interest in entireties property, the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that such property is exempt from the tax lien. We conclude that, despitethe fiction, each tenant possesses individual rights in the estate sufficient to constitute "property" or "rights to prop-erty" for the purposes of the lien, and reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals. I

In 1988, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed$482,446 in unpaid income tax liabilities against Don Craft,
the husband of respondent Sandra L. Craft, for failure to filefederal income tax returns for the years 1979 through 1986.

quitclaim deed purporting to transfer the husband's interestin the property to respondent for one dollar.

Ibid. When
respondent attempted to sell the property a few years later,a title search revealed the lien. The IRS agreed to release

the lien and allow the sale with the stipulation that half ofthe net proceeds be held in escrow pending determination of

Respondent brought this action to quiet title to the es-crowed proceeds. The Government claimed that its lien had

attached to the husband's interest in the tenancy by the en-tirety. It further asserted that the transfer of the property
to respondent was invalid as a fraud on creditors. Id., at

motion for summary judgment, holding that the federal tax
lien attached at the moment of the transfer to respondent,
which terminated the tenancy by the entirety and entitled
the Government to one-half of the value of the property.
No. 1:93-CV-306, 1994 WL 669680, *3 (WD Mich., Sept. 12,
1994).

Both parties appealed. The Sixth Circuit held that the
tax lien did not attach to the property because under Michigan state law, the husband had no separate interest in property held as a tenant by the entirety. 140 F. 3d 638, 643
(1998). It remanded to the District Court to consider the
Government's alternative claim that the conveyance should
be set aside as fraudulent. Id., at 644.

On remand, the District Court concluded that where, as
here, state law makes property exempt from the claims of
creditors, no fraudulent conveyance can occur. 65 F. Supp.
2d 651, 657-658 (WD Mich. 1999). It found, however, that
respondent's husband's use of nonexempt funds to pay the
mortgage on the entireties property, which placed them beyond the reach of creditors, constituted a fraudulent act
under state law, and the court awarded the IRS a share of
the proceeds of the sale of the property equal to that amount.
Id., at 659.

278 UNITED STATES v. CRAFT

Opinion of the Court
Both parties appealed the District Court's decision, theGovernment again claiming that its lien attached to the

husband's interest in the entireties property. The Court ofAppeals held that the prior panel's opinion was law of the
case on that issue. 233 F. 3d 358, 363-369 (CA6 2000). Italso affirmed the District Court's determination that the
husband's mortgage payments were fraudulent. Id., at369-375.

We granted certiorari to consider the Government's claimthat respondent's husband had a separate interest in the entireties property to which the federal tax lien attached. 533U. S. 976 (2001).

II
Whether the interests of respondent's husband in the prop-erty he held as a tenant by the entirety constitutes "property

and rights to property" for the purposes of the federal taxlien statute, 26 U. S. C. $ 6321, is ultimately a question of federal law. The answer to this federal question, however,largely depends upon state law. The federal tax lien statute
itself "creates no property rights but merely attaches conse-quences, federally defined, to rights created under state
law." United States v. Bess, 357 U. S. 51, 55 (1958); see alsoUnited States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472 U. S. 713,
722 (1985). Accordingly, "[w]e look initially to state law todetermine what rights the taxpayer has in the property the
Government seeks to reach, then to federal law to determinewhether the taxpayer's state-delineated rights qualify as
`property' or `rights to property' within the compass of thefederal tax lien legislation."

Drye v. United States, 528U. S. 49, 58 (1999).

A common idiom describes property as a "bundle ofsticks"--a collection of individual rights which, in certain
combinations, constitute property. See B. Cardozo, Para-doxes of Legal Science 129 (1928) (reprint 2000); see also
Dickman v. Commissioner, 465 U. S. 330, 336 (1984). Statelaw determines only which sticks are in a person's bundle.

279Cite as: 535 U. S. 274 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Whether those sticks qualify as "property" for purposes ofthe federal tax lien statute is a question of federal law.

In looking to state law, we must be careful to consider thesubstance of the rights state law provides, not merely the
labels the State gives these rights or the conclusions it drawsfrom them. Such state law labels are irrelevant to the federal question of which bundles of rights constitute propertythat may be attached by a federal tax lien. In

Drye v.United States, supra, we considered a situation where state

law allowed an heir subject to a federal tax lien to disclaimhis interest in the estate. The state law also provided that
such a disclaimer would "creat[e] the legal fiction" that theheir had predeceased the decedent and would correspondingly be deemed to have had no property interest in the es-tate. Id., at 53. We unanimously held that this state law
fiction did not control the federal question and looked insteadto the realities of the heir's interest. We concluded that,
despite the State's characterization, the heir possessed a"right to property" in the estate--the right to accept the
inheritance or pass it along to another--to which the federallien could attach.

Id., at 59-61.

III
We turn first to the question of what rights respondent'shusband had in the entireties property by virtue of state

law. In order to understand these rights, the tenancy bythe entirety must first be placed in some context.

English common law provided three legal structures forthe concurrent ownership of property that have survived
into modern times: tenancy in common, joint tenancy, andtenancy by the entirety. 1 G. Thompson, Real Property

$ 4.06(g) (D. Thomas ed. 1994) (hereinafter Thompson). Thetenancy in common is now the most common form of concurrent ownership. 7 R. Powell & P. Rohan, Real Property$ 51.01[3] (M. Wolf ed. 2001) (hereinafter Powell). The common law characterized tenants in common as each owning

535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
280 UNITED STATES v. CRAFT

Opinion of the Court
a separate fractional share in undivided property. Id.,$ 50.01[1]. Tenants in common may each unilaterally alienate their shares through sale or gift or place encumbrancesupon these shares. They also have the power to pass these
shares to their heirs upon death. Tenants in common havemany other rights in the property, including the right to
use the property, to exclude third parties from it, and
to receive a portion of any income produced from it. Id.,$$ 50.03-50.06.

Joint tenancies were the predominant form of concurrentownership at common law, and still persist in some States
today. 4 Thompson $ 31.05. The common law characterized
each joint tenant as possessing the entire estate, rather than
a fractional share: "[J]oint-tenants have one and the same
interest . . . held by one and the same undivided possession."
2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 180
(1766). Joint tenants possess many of the rights enjoyed by
tenants in common: the right to use, to exclude, and to enjoy
a share of the property's income. The main difference between a joint tenancy and a tenancy in common is that a joint
tenant also has a right of automatic inheritance known as
"survivorship." Upon the death of one joint tenant, that
tenant's share in the property does not pass through will or
the rules of intestate succession; rather, the remaining tenant or tenants automatically inherit it. Id., at 183; 7 Powell

$ 51.01[3]. Joint tenants' right to alienate their individual
shares is also somewhat different. In order for one tenant
to alienate his or her individual interest in the tenancy, the
estate must first be severed--that is, converted to a tenancy
in common with each tenant possessing an equal fractional
share. Id., $ 51.04[1]. Most States allowing joint tenancies
facilitate alienation, however, by allowing severance to automatically accompany a conveyance of that interest or any
other overt act indicating an intent to sever. Ibid.

A tenancy by the entirety is a unique sort of concurrent
ownership that can only exist between married persons. 4

Opinion of the Court
Thompson $ 33.02. Because of the common-law fiction thatthe husband and wife were one person at law (that person,

practically speaking, was the husband, see J. Cribbet et al.,Cases and Materials on Property 329 (6th ed. 1990)), Blackstone did not characterize the tenancy by the entirety as aform of concurrent ownership at all. Instead, he thought
that entireties property was a form of single ownership by
the marital unity. Orth, Tenancy by the Entirety: TheStrange Career of the Common-Law Marital Estate, 1997

B. Y. U. L. Rev. 35, 38-39. Neither spouse was consideredto own any individual interest in the estate; rather, it belonged to the couple.

Like joint tenants, tenants by the entirety enjoy the right
of survivorship. Also like a joint tenancy, unilateral alienation of a spouse's interest in entireties property is typically
not possible without severance. Unlike joint tenancies,
however, tenancies by the entirety cannot easily be severed
unilaterally. 4 Thompson $ 33.08(b). Typically, severance
requires the consent of both spouses, id., $ 33.08(a), or the
ending of the marriage in divorce, id., $ 33.08(d). At common law, all of the other rights associated with the entireties
property belonged to the husband: as the head of the household, he could control the use of the property and the exclusion of others from it and enjoy all of the income produced
from it. Id., $ 33.05. The husband's control of the property
was so extensive that, despite the rules on alienation, the
common law eventually provided that he could unilaterally
alienate entireties property without severance subject only
to the wife's survivorship interest. Orth, supra, at 40-41.

With the passage of the Married Women's Property Acts
in the late 19th century granting women distinct rights with
respect to marital property, most States either abolished the
tenancy by the entirety or altered it significantly. 7 Powell

$ 52.01[2]. Michigan's version of the estate is typical of the
modern tenancy by the entirety. Following Blackstone,
Michigan characterizes its tenancy by the entirety as creat535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
282 UNITED STATES v. CRAFT

Opinion of the Court
ing no individual rights whatsoever: "It is well settled underthe law of this State that one tenant by the entirety has no

interest separable from that of the other . . . . Each isvested with an entire title."

Long v. Earle, 277 Mich. 505,
517, 269 N. W. 577, 581 (1936). And yet, in Michigan, eachtenant by the entirety possesses the right of survivorship.

Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $ 554.872(g) (West Supp. 1997),
recodified at $ 700.2901(2)(g) (West Supp. Pamphlet 2001).Each spouse--the wife as well as the husband--may also use

the property, exclude third parties from it, and receive anequal share of the income produced by it. See $ 557.71
(West 1988). Neither spouse may unilaterally alienate or
encumber the property, Long v. Earle, supra, at 517, 269
N. W., at 581; Rogers v. Rogers, 136 Mich. App. 125, 134, 356
N. W. 2d 288, 292 (1984), although this may be accomplished
with mutual consent, Eadus v. Hunter, 249 Mich. 190, 228
N. W. 782 (1930). Divorce ends the tenancy by the entirety, generally giving each spouse an equal interest in
the property as a tenant in common, unless the divorce decree specifies otherwise. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $ 552.102
(West 1988).

In determining whether respondent's husband possessed
"property" or "rights to property" within the meaning of 26
U. S. C. $ 6321, we look to the individual rights created by
these state law rules. According to Michigan law, respondent's husband had, among other rights, the following rights
with respect to the entireties property: the right to use the
property, the right to exclude third parties from it, the right
to a share of income produced from it, the right of survivorship, the right to become a tenant in common with equal
shares upon divorce, the right to sell the property with
the respondent's consent and to receive half the proceeds
from such a sale, the right to place an encumbrance on the
property with the respondent's consent, and the right to
block respondent from selling or encumbering the property
unilaterally.

Opinion of the Court

IV
We turn now to the federal question of whether the rightsMichigan law granted to respondent's husband as a tenant

by the entirety qualify as "property" or "rights to property"under $ 6321. The statutory language authorizing the tax
lien "is broad and reveals on its face that Congress meant toreach every interest in property that a taxpayer might
have." United States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472U. S., at 719-720. "Stronger language could hardly have
been selected to reveal a purpose to assure the collection oftaxes."

Glass City Bank v. United States, 326 U. S. 265,267 (1945). We conclude that the husband's rights in the

entireties property fall within this broad statutory language.Michigan law grants a tenant by the entirety some of the
most essential property rights: the right to use the property,to receive income produced by it, and to exclude others from
it. See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 384 (1994)("[T]he right to exclude others" is " `one of the most essential
sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly character-ized as property' " (quoting

Kaiser Aetna v. United States,444 U. S. 164, 176 (1979))); Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 435 (1982) (including "use" asone of the "[p]roperty rights in a physical thing"). These
rights alone may be sufficient to subject the husband's inter-est in the entireties property to the federal tax lien. They
gave him a substantial degree of control over the entiretiesproperty, and, as we noted in

Drye, "in determining whethera federal taxpayer's state-law rights constitute `property' or

`rights to property,' [t]he important consideration is thebreadth of the control the [taxpayer] could exercise over the
property." 528 U. S., at 61 (some internal quotation marksomitted).

The husband's rights in the estate, however, went beyonduse, exclusion, and income. He also possessed the right to
alienate (or otherwise encumber) the property with the con-sent of respondent, his wife.

Loretto, supra, at 435 (the

535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
284 UNITED STATES v. CRAFT

Opinion of the Court
right to "dispose" of an item is a property right). It is true,as respondent notes, that he lacked the right to unilaterally

alienate the property, a right that is often in the bundle ofproperty rights. See also

post, at 296-297 (Thomas, J., dissenting). There is no reason to believe, however, that thisone stick--the right of unilateral alienation--is essential to

the category of "property."

This Court has already stated that federal tax liens mayattach to property that cannot be unilaterally alienated. In

United States v. Rodgers, 461 U. S. 677 (1983), we consideredthe Federal Government's power to foreclose homestead
property attached by a federal tax lien. Texas law provided
that " `the owner or claimant of the property claimed as
homestead [may not], if married, sell or abandon the homestead without the consent of the other spouse.' " Id., at 684-
685 (quoting Tex. Const., Art. 16, $ 50). We nonetheless
stated that "[i]n the homestead context . . . , there is no
doubt . . . that not only do both spouses (rather than neither)
have an independent interest in the homestead property, but
that a federal tax lien can at least attach to each of those
interests." 461 U. S., at 703, n. 31; cf. Drye, supra, at 60,
n. 7 (noting that "an interest in a spendthrift trust has been
held to constitute ` "property" for purposes of $ 6321' even
though the beneficiary may not transfer that interest to
third parties").

Excluding property from a federal tax lien simply because
the taxpayer does not have the power to unilaterally alienate
it would, moreover, exempt a rather large amount of what is
commonly thought of as property. It would exempt not only
the type of property discussed in Rodgers, but also some
community property. Community property States often
provide that real community property cannot be alienated
without the consent of both spouses. See, e. g., Ariz. Rev.
Stat. Ann. $ 25-214(C) (2000); Cal. Fam. Code Ann. $ 1102
(West 1994); Idaho Code $ 32-912 (1996); La. Civ. Code Ann.,
Art. 2347 (West Supp. 2002); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 123.230(3)

Opinion of the Court
(Supp. 2001); N. M. Stat. Ann. $ 40-3-13 (1999); Wash. Rev.Code $ 26.16.030(3) (1994). Accordingly, the fact that respondent's husband could not unilaterally alienate the prop-erty does not preclude him from possessing "property and
rights to property" for the purposes of $ 6321.Respondent's husband also possessed the right of survivorship--the right to automatically inherit the whole of the estate should his wife predecease him. Respondent arguesthat this interest was merely an expectancy, which we suggested in Drye would not constitute "property" for the pur-poses of a federal tax lien. 528 U. S., at 60, n. 7 ("[We do
not mean to suggest] that an expectancy that has pecuniary
value . . . would fall within $ 6321 prior to the time it ripens
into a present estate"). Drye did not decide this question,
however, nor do we need to do so here. As we have discussed above, a number of the sticks in respondent's husband's bundle were presently existing. It is therefore not
necessary to decide whether the right to survivorship alone
would qualify as "property" or "rights to property" under

$ 6321.

That the rights of respondent's husband in the entireties
property constitute "property" or "rights to property" "belonging to" him is further underscored by the fact that, if
the conclusion were otherwise, the entireties property would
belong to no one for the purposes of $ 6321. Respondent had
no more interest in the property than her husband; if neither
of them had a property interest in the entireties property,
who did? This result not only seems absurd, but would also
allow spouses to shield their property from federal taxation
by classifying it as entireties property, facilitating abuse of
the federal tax system. Johnson, After Drye: The Likely
Attachment of the Federal Tax Lien to Tenancy-by-theEntireties Interests, 75 Ind. L. J. 1163, 1171 (2000).

Justice Scalia's and Justice Thomas' dissents claim
that the conclusion that the husband possessed an interest
in the entireties property to which the federal tax lien could

535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
286 UNITED STATES v. CRAFT

Opinion of the Court
attach is in conflict with the rules for tax liens relating to
partnership property. See post, at 289 (opinion of Scalia,
J.); see also post, at 295-296, n. 4 (opinion of Thomas, J.).
This is not so. As the authorities cited by Justice Thomas
reflect, the federal tax lien does attach to an individual partner's interest in the partnership, that is, to the fair market
value of his or her share in the partnership assets. Ibid.
(citing B. Bittker & M. McMahon, Federal Income Taxation
of Individuals || 44.5[4][a] (2d ed. 1995 and 2000 Cum. Supp.));
see also 1 A. Bromberg & L. Ribstein, Partnership $ 3.05(d)
(2002-1 Supp.) (hereinafter Bromberg & Ribstein) (citing
Uniform Partnership Act $ 28, 6 U. L. A. 744 (1995)). As a
holder of this lien, the Federal Government is entitled to
"receive . . . the profits to which the assigning partner would
otherwise be entitled," including predissolution distributions
and the proceeds from dissolution. Uniform Partnership
Act $ 27(1), id., at 736.

There is, however, a difference between the treatment of
entireties property and partnership assets. The Federal
Government may not compel the sale of partnership assets
(although it may foreclose on the partner's interest, 1 Bromberg & Ribstein $ 3.05(d)(3)(iv)). It is this difference that
is reflected in Justice Scalia's assertion that partnership
property cannot be encumbered by an individual partner's
debts. See post, at 289. This disparity in treatment between the two forms of ownership, however, arises from our
decision in United States v. Rodgers, supra (holding that the
Government may foreclose on property even where the coowners lack the right of unilateral alienation), and not our
holding today. In this case, it is instead the dissenters' theory that departs from partnership law, as it would hold that
the Federal Government's lien does not attach to the husband's interest in the entireties property at all, whereas the
lien may attach to an individual's interest in partnership
property.

Opinion of the Court
Respondent argues that, whether or not we would con-clude that respondent's husband had an interest in the entireties property, legislative history indicates that Congressdid not intend that a federal tax lien should attach to such
an interest. In 1954, the Senate rejected a proposed amend-ment to the tax lien statute that would have provided that
the lien attach to "property or rights to property (including
the interest of such person as tenant by the entirety)."S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 575 (1954). We have

elsewhere held, however, that failed legislative proposals are"a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute," Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 650 (1990), reasoning
that " `[c]ongressional inaction lacks persuasive significance
because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn
from such inaction, including the inference that the existing
legislation already incorporated the offered change.' " Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 187 (1994). This case exemplifies
the risk of relying on such legislative history. As we noted
in United States v. Rodgers, 461 U. S., at 704, n. 31, some
legislative history surrounding the 1954 amendment indicates that the House intended the amendment to be nothing
more than a "clarification" of existing law, and that the Senate rejected the amendment only because it found it "superfluous." See H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., A406
(1954) (noting that the amendment would "clarif[y] the term
`property and rights to property' by expressly including
therein the interest of the delinquent taxpayer in an estate
by the entirety"); S. Rep. No. 1622, at 575 ("It is not clear
what change in existing law would be made by the parenthetical phrase. The deletion of the phrase is intended to
continue the existing law").

The same ambiguity that plagues the legislative history
accompanies the common-law background of Congress' enactment of the tax lien statute. Respondent argues that

535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
288 UNITED STATES v. CRAFT

Opinion of the Court
Congress could not have intended the passage of the federaltax lien statute to alter the generally accepted rule that liens

could not attach to entireties property. See Astoria Fed.
Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991)
("[W]here a common-law principle is well established . . . thecourts may take it as given that Congress has legislated with

an expectation that the principle will apply except `when a
statutory purpose to the contrary is evident' "). Thecommon-law rule was not so well established with respect to

the application of a federal tax lien that we must assumethat Congress considered the impact of its enactment on the
question now before us. There was not much of a commonlaw background on the question of the application of federal
tax liens, as the first court of appeals cases dealing with the
application of such a lien did not arise until the 1950's.
United States v. Hutcherson, 188 F. 2d 326 (CA8 1951); Raffaele v. Granger, 196 F. 2d 620 (CA3 1952). This background
is not sufficient to overcome the broad statutory language
Congress did enact, authorizing the lien to attach to "all
property and rights to property" a taxpayer might have.

We therefore conclude that respondent's husband's interest
in the entireties property constituted "property" or "rights
to property" for the purposes of the federal tax lien statute.
We recognize that Michigan makes a different choice with
respect to state law creditors: "[L]and held by husband and
wife as tenants by entirety is not subject to levy under execution on judgment rendered against either husband or wife
alone." Sanford v. Bertrau, 204 Mich. 244, 247, 169 N. W.
880, 881 (1918). But that by no means dictates our choice.
The interpretation of 26 U. S. C. $ 6321 is a federal question,
and in answering that question we are in no way bound by
state courts' answers to similar questions involving state
law. As we elsewhere have held, " `exempt status under
state law does not bind the federal collector.' " Drye v.
United States, 528 U. S., at 59. See also Rodgers, supra,
at 701 (clarifying that the Supremacy Clause "provides the

underpinning for the Federal Government's right to sweepaside state-created exemptions").

V
We express no view as to the proper valuation of respond-ent's husband's interest in the entireties property, leaving

this for the Sixth Circuit to determine on remand. We note,however, that insofar as the amount is dependent upon
whether the 1989 conveyance was fraudulent, see post, at290, n. 1 (

Thomas, J., dissenting), this case is somewhatanomalous. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's

judgment that this conveyance was not fraudulent, and theGovernment has not sought certiorari review of that determination. Since the District Court's judgment was basedon the notion that, because the federal tax lien could not
attach to the property, transferring it could not constitute anattempt to evade the Government creditor, 65 F. Supp. 2d,
at 657-659, in future cases, the fraudulent conveyance ques-tion will no doubt be answered differently.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit is accordingly reversed, and the case is
remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.

I join Justice Thomas's dissent, which points out (to norelevant response from the Court) that a State's decision to
treat the marital partnership as a separate legal entity,whose property cannot be encumbered by the debts of its
individual members, is no more novel and no more "artificial"than a State's decision to treat the commercial partnership
as a separate legal entity, whose property cannot be encum-bered by the debts of its individual members.

I write separately to observe that the Court nullifies (inso-far as federal taxes are concerned, at least) a form of prop535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

erty ownership that was of particular benefit to the stay-at-home spouse or mother. She is overwhelmingly likely to be

the survivor that obtains title to the unencumbered prop-erty; and she (as opposed to her business-world husband) is
overwhelmingly unlikely to be the source of the individualindebtedness against which a tenancy by the entirety protects. It is regrettable that the Court has eliminated a largepart of this traditional protection retained by many States.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

The Court today allows the Internal Revenue Service(IRS) to reach proceeds from the sale of real property that

did not belong to the taxpayer, respondent's husband, DonCraft,

of the lien" created by 26 U. S. C. $ 6321. Ante, at 276. TheCourt does not contest that the tax liability the IRS seeks
to satisfy is Mr. Craft's alone, and does not claim that, underMichigan law, real property held as a tenancy by the entirety
belongs to either spouse individually. Nor does the Court

terminated the entirety estate. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $ 557.101 (West
1988); see also United States v. Certain Real Property Located at 2525
Leroy Lane, 910 F. 2d 343, 351 (CA6 1990). The District Court and Court
of Appeals both held that the transfer did not constitute a fraudulent conveyance, a ruling the Government has not appealed. The IRS is undoubtedly entitled to any proceeds that Mr. Craft received or to which he was
entitled from the 1989 conveyance of the tenancy by the entirety property
for $1; at that point the tenancy by the entirety estate was destroyed and
at least half of the proceeds, or 50 cents, was "property" or "rights to
property" "belonging to" Mr. Craft. By contrast, the proceeds that the
IRS claims here are from Mrs. Craft's 1992 sale of the property to a third
party. At the time of the sale, she owned the property in fee simple, and
accordingly Mr. Craft neither received nor was entitled to these funds.

suggest that the federal tax lien attaches to particular"rights to property" held individually by Mr. Craft. Rather,

borrowing the metaphor of "property as a `bundle of sticks'--a collection of individual rights which, in certain combinations, constitute property," ante, at 278, the Court proposesthat so long as sufficient "sticks" in the bundle of "rights to
property" "belong to" a delinquent taxpayer, the lien canattach as if the property itself belonged to the taxpayer,
ante, at 285.This amorphous construct ignores the primacy of state law
in defining property interests, eviscerates the statutory dis-tinction between "property" and "rights to property" drawn
by $ 6321, and conflicts with an unbroken line of authorityfrom this Court, the lower courts, and the IRS. Its application is all the more unsupportable in this case because, in myview, it is highly unlikely that the limited individual "rights
to property" recognized in a tenancy by the entirety underMichigan law are themselves subject to lien. I would affirm
the Court of Appeals and hold that Mr. Craft did not have"property" or "rights to property" to which the federal tax
lien could attach. I

Title 26 U. S. C. $ 6321 provides that a federal tax lien at-taches to "all property and rights to property, whether real
or personal, belonging to" a delinquent taxpayer. It is un-contested that a federal tax lien itself "creates no property
rights but merely attaches consequences, federally defined,to rights created under state law." United States v. Bess,
357 U. S. 51, 55 (1958) (construing the 1939 version of thefederal tax lien statute). Consequently, the Government's
lien under $ 6321 "cannot extend beyond the property inter-ests held by the delinquent taxpayer," United States v.
Rodgers, 461 U. S. 677, 690-691 (1983), under state law. Be-fore today, no one disputed that the IRS, by operation of

$ 6321, "steps into the taxpayer's shoes," and has the samerights as the taxpayer in property or rights to property sub535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

A
If the Grand Rapids property "belong[ed] to" Mr. Craft
under state law prior to the termination of the tenancy by
the entirety, the federal tax lien would have attached to the
Grand Rapids property. But that is not this case. As the
Court recognizes, pursuant to Michigan law, as under English common law, property held as a tenancy by the entirety
does not belong to either spouse, but to a single entity composed of the married persons. See ante, at 280-282. Neither spouse has "any separate interest in such an estate."
Sanford v. Bertrau, 204 Mich. 244, 249, 169 N. W. 880, 882
(1918); see also Long v. Earle, 277 Mich. 505, 517, 269 N. W.
577, 581 (1936) ("Each [spouse] is vested with an entire title
and as against the one who attempts alone to convey or incumber such real estate, the other has an absolute title").
An entireties estate constitutes an indivisible "sole tenancy."
See Budwit v. Herr, 339 Mich. 265, 272, 63 N. W. 2d 841, 844
(1954); see also Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497, 501
(1930) ("[T]he tenants constitute a unit; neither can dispose
of any part of the estate without the consent of the other;
and the whole continues in the survivor"). Because Michigan does not recognize a separate spousal interest in the
Grand Rapids property, it did not "belong" to either respondent or her husband individually when the IRS asserted its
lien for Mr. Craft's individual tax liability. Thus, the property was not property to which the federal tax lien could
attach for Mr. Craft's tax liability.

Thomas, J., dissenting
The Court does not dispute this characterization of Michi-gan's law with respect to the essential attributes of the tenancy by the entirety estate. However, relying on Drye v.
United States, 528 U. S. 49, 59 (1999), which in turn relied
upon United States v. Irvine, 511 U. S. 224 (1994), and United
States v. Mitchell, 403 U. S. 190 (1971), the Court suggests
that Michigan's definition of the tenancy by the entirety estate should be overlooked because federal tax law is not con-trolled by state legal fictions concerning property ownership.

Ante, at 279. But the Court misapprehends the applicationof

Drye to this case.
Drye, like Irvine and Mitchell before it, was concerned
not with whether state law recognized "property" as belonging to the taxpayer in the first place, but rather with
whether state laws could disclaim or exempt such property
from federal tax liability after the property interest was created. Drye held only that a state-law disclaimer could not
retroactively undo a vested right in an estate that the taxpayer already held, and that a federal lien therefore attached
to the taxpayer's interest in the estate. 528 U. S., at 61 (recognizing that a disclaimer does not restore the status quo
ante because the heir "determines who will receive the property--himself if he does not disclaim, a known other if he
does"). Similarly, in Irvine, the Court held that a state law
allowing an individual to disclaim a gift could not force the
Court to be "struck blind" to the fact that the transfer of
"property" or "property rights" for which the gift tax was
due had already occurred; "state property transfer rules do
not transfer into federal taxation rules." 511 U. S., at 239-
240 (emphasis added). See also Mitchell, supra, at 204
(holding that right to renounce a marital interest under state
law does not indicate that the taxpayer had no right to property before the renunciation).

Extending this Court's "state law fiction" jurisprudence to
determine whether property or rights to property exist
under state law in the first place works a sea change in the

Thomas, J., dissenting
role States have traditionally played in "creating and defin-ing" property interests. By erasing the careful line between state laws that purport to disclaim or exempt prop-erty interests after the fact, which the federal tax lien does
not respect, and state laws' definition of property and prop-erty rights, which the federal tax lien does respect, the
Court does not follow Drye, but rather creates a new federalcommon law of property. This contravenes the previously
settled rule that the definition and scope of property is leftto the States. See

Aquilino, supra, at 513, n. 3 (recognizingunsoundness of leaving the definition of property interests

to a nebulous body of federal law, "because it ignores thelong-established role that the States have played in creating
property interests and places upon the courts the task ofattempting to ascertain a taxpayer's property rights under
an undefined rule of federal law").

B
That the Grand Rapids property does not belong toMr. Craft under Michigan law does not end the inquiry, however, since the federal tax lien attaches not only to "prop-erty" but also to any "rights to property" belonging to the
taxpayer. While the Court concludes that a laundry list of"rights to property" belonged to Mr. Craft as a tenant by the
entirety,2 it does not suggest that the tax lien attached toany of these particular rights.

3 Instead, the Court gathers

2 The parties disagree as to whether Michigan law recognizes the "rights
to property" identified by the Court as individual rights "belonging to"
each tenant in entireties property. Without deciding a question better
resolved by the Michigan courts, for the purposes of this case I will assume, arguendo, that Michigan law recognizes separate interests in these
"rights to property."

3 Nor does the Court explain how such "rights to property" survived the

destruction of the tenancy by the entirety, although, for all intents and
purposes, it acknowledges that such rights as it identifies exist by virtue
of the tenancy by the entirety estate. Even Judge Ryan's concurrence in
the Sixth Circuit's first ruling in this matter is best read as making the

these rights together and opines that there were sufficientsticks to form a bundle, so that "respondent's husband's interest in the entireties property constituted `property' or`rights to property' for the purposes of the federal tax lien
statute." Ante, at 288, 285.But the Court's "sticks in a bundle" metaphor collapses
precisely because of the distinction expressly drawn by thestatute, which distinguishes between "property" and "rights
to property." The Court refrains from ever stating whetherthis case involves "property" or "rights to property" even
though $ 6321 specifically provides that the federal tax lienattaches to "property" and "rights to property" "belonging
to" the delinquent taxpayer, and not to an imprecise con-struct of "individual rights in the estate sufficient to constitute `property' or `rights to property' for the purposes of thelien."

Federal Government's right to execute its lien dependent upon the factual
finding that the conveyance was a fraudulent transaction. See 140 F. 3d
638, 648-649 (1998).

4 The Court's reasoning that because a taxpayer has rights to property

a federal tax lien can attach not only to those rights but also to the property itself could have far-reaching consequences. As illustration, in the
partnership setting as elsewhere, the Government's lien under $ 6321
places the Government in no better position than the taxpayer to whom
the property belonged: "[F]or example, the lien for a partner's unpaid
income taxes attaches to his interest in the firm, not to the firm's assets."
Bittker || 44.5[4][a]. Though partnership property currently is "not subject to attachment or execution, except on a claim against the partnership," Rev. Rul. 73-24, 1973-1 Cum. Bull. 602; cf. United States v.
Kaufman, 267 U. S. 408 (1925), under the logic of the Court's opinion
partnership property could be attached for the tax liability of an individual partner. Like a tenant in a tenancy by the entirety, the partner has
significant rights to use, enjoy, and control the partnership property in
conjunction with his partners. I see no principled way to distinguish
between the propriety of attaching the federal tax lien to partnership
property to satisfy the tax liability of a partner, in contravention of current practice, and the propriety of attaching the federal tax lien to tenancy
by the entirety property in order to satisfy the tax liability of one spouse,
also in contravention of current practice. I do not doubt that a tax lien

Thomas, J., dissenting
Rather than adopt the majority's approach, I would ask
specifically, as the statute does, whether Mr. Craft had any
particular "rights to property" to which the federal tax lien
could attach. He did not.5 Such "rights to property" that
have been subject to the $ 6321 lien are valuable and "pecuniary," i. e., they can be attached, and levied upon or sold by
the Government.6 Drye, 528 U. S., at 58-60, and n. 7. With
such rights subject to lien, the taxpayer's interest has "ripen[ed] into a present estate" of some form and is more than
a mere expectancy, id., at 60, n. 7, and thus the taxpayer
has an apparent right "to channel that value to [another],"
id., at 61.

In contrast, a tenant in a tenancy by the entirety not only
lacks a present divisible vested interest in the property and
control with respect to the sale, encumbrance, and transfer
of the property, but also does not possess the ability to devise
any portion of the property because it is subject to the other's indestructible right of survivorship. Rogers v. Rogers,

may attach to a partner's partnership interest to satisfy his individual tax
liability, but it is well settled that the lien does not, thereby, attach to
property belonging to the partnership. The problem for the IRS in this
case is that, unlike a partnership interest, such limited rights that
Mr. Craft had in the Grand Rapids property are not the kind of rights to
property to which a lien can attach, and the Grand Rapids property itself
never "belong[ed] to" him under Michigan law.

5 Even such rights as Mr. Craft arguably had in the Grand Rapids property bear no resemblance to those to which a federal tax lien has ever
attached. See W. Elliott, Federal Tax Collections, Liens, and Levies
|||| 9.09[3][a]-[f] (2d ed. 1995 and 2000 Cum. Supp.) (hereinafter Elliott)
(listing examples of rights to property to which a federal tax lien attaches,
such as the right to compel payment; the right to withdraw money from a
bank account, or to receive money from accounts receivable; wages earned
but not paid; installment payments under a contract of sale of real estate;
annuity payments; a beneficiary's rights to payment under a spendthrift
trust; a liquor license; an easement; the taxpayer's interest in a timeshare;
options; the taxpayer's interest in an employee benefit plan or individual
retirement account).

(1984). This latter fact makes the property significantly different from community property, where each spouse has
a present one-half vested interest in the whole, which may
be devised by will or otherwise to a person other than
the spouse. See 4 G. Thompson, Real Property $ 37.14(a)
(D. Thomas ed. 1994) (noting that a married person's power

to devise one-half of the community property is "consistent
with the fundamental characteristic of community property":
"community ownership means that each spouse owns 50% of
each community asset").7 See also Drye, 528 U. S., at 61
("[I]n determining whether a federal taxpayer's state-law
rights constitute `property' or `rights to property,' the

important consideration is the breadth of the control the
taxpayer could exercise over the property" (emphasis added,
citation and brackets omitted)).

It is clear that some of the individual rights of a tenant in
entireties property are primarily personal, dependent upon
the taxpayer's status as a spouse, and similarly not susceptible to a tax lien. For example, the right to use the property
in conjunction with one's spouse and to exclude all others
appears particularly ill suited to being transferred to another, see ibid., and to lack "exchangeable value," id., at 56.

Nor do other identified rights rise to the level of "rights
to property" to which a $ 6321 lien can attach, because they
represent, at most, a contingent future interest, or an "expectancy" that has not "ripen[ed] into a present estate."
Id., at 60, n. 7 ("Nor do we mean to suggest that an expec7 And it is similarly different from the situation in United States v.
Rodgers, 461 U. S. 677 (1983), where the question was not whether a
vested property interest in the family home to which the federal tax lien
could attach "belong[ed] to" the taxpayer. Rather, in Rodgers, the only
question was whether the federal tax lien for the husband's tax liability
could be foreclosed against the property under 26 U. S. C. $ 7403, despite
his wife's homestead right under state law. See 461 U. S., at 701-703,

tancy that has pecuniary value and is transferable understate law would fall within $ 6321 prior to the time it ripens

into a present estate"). Cf. Bess, 357 U. S., at 55-56 (holdingthat no federal tax lien could attach to proceeds of the taxpayer's life insurance policy because "[i]t would be anoma-lous to view as `property' subject to lien proceeds never
within the insured's reach to enjoy"). By way of example,
the survivorship right wholly depends upon one spouse out-living the other, at which time the survivor gains "substantial rights, in respect of the property, theretofore never en-joyed by [the] survivor."

Tyler, 281 U. S., at 503. While
the Court explains that it is "not necessary to decide
whether the right to survivorship alone would qualify as
`property' or `rights to property' " under $ 6321, ante, at 285,
the facts of this case demonstrate that it would not. Even
assuming both that the right of survivability continued after
the demise of the tenancy estate and that the tax lien could
attach to such a contingent future right, creating a lienable
interest upon the death of the nonliable spouse, it would not
help the IRS here; respondent's husband predeceased her in
1998, and there is no right of survivorship at issue in this
case.

Similarly, while one spouse might escape the absolute limitations on individual action with respect to tenancy by the
entirety property by obtaining the right to one-half of the
property upon divorce, or by agreeing with the other spouse
to sever the tenancy by the entirety, neither instance is an
event of sufficient certainty to constitute a "right to property" for purposes of $ 6321. Finally, while the federal tax
lien could arguably have attached to a tenant's right to any
"rents, products, income, or profits" of real property held as
tenants by the entirety, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $ 557.71
(West 1988), the Grand Rapids property created no rents,
products, income, or profits for the tax lien to attach to.

In any event, all such rights to property, dependent as
they are upon the existence of the tenancy by the entirety

estate, were likely destroyed by the quitclaim deed that sev-ered the tenancy. See n. 1, supra. Unlike a lien attached

to the property itself, which would survive a conveyance, alien attached to a "right to property" falls squarely within
the maxim that "the tax collector not only steps into thetaxpayer's shoes but must go barefoot if the shoes wear out."
Bittker || 44.5[4][a] (noting that "a state judgment termi-nating the taxpayer's rights to an asset also extinguishes
the federal tax lien attached thereto"). See also Elliott|| 9.09[3][d][i] (explaining that while a tax lien may attach to
a taxpayer's option on property, if the option terminates, theGovernment's lien rights would terminate as well).

Accordingly, I conclude that Mr. Craft had neither "prop-erty" nor "rights to property" to which the federal tax lien
could attach. II

That the federal tax lien did not attach to the Grand Rap-ids property is further supported by the consensus among
the lower courts. For more than 50 years, every federalcourt reviewing tenancies by the entirety in States with a
similar understanding of tenancy by the entirety as Michiganhas concluded that a federal tax lien cannot attach to such
property to satisfy an individual spouse's tax liability.8 This

That the Court fails to so much as mention this consensus,let alone address it or give any reason for overruling it, is

Finally, while the majority characterizes Michigan's viewthat the tenancy by the entirety property does not belong to

the individual spouses as a "state law fiction," ante, at 276,our precedents, including

Drye, 528 U. S., at 58-60, hold thatstate, not federal, law defines property interests. Ownership by "the marriage" is admittedly a fiction of sorts, butso is a partnership or corporation. There is no basis for ignoring this fiction so long as federal law does not define prop-erty, particularly since the tenancy by the entirety property
remains subject to lien for the tax liability of both tenants.Nor do I accept the Court's unsupported assumption that
its holding today is necessary because a contrary resultwould "facilitat[e] abuse of the federal tax system."

Ante,at 285. The Government created this straw man, Brief for

United States 30-32, suggesting that the property transferfrom the tenancy by the entirety to respondent was somehow
improper, see id., at 30-31, n. 20 (characterizing scope of"[t]he tax avoidance scheme sanctioned by the court of appeals in this case"), even though it chose not to appeal thelower court's contrary assessment. But the longstanding
consensus in the lower courts that tenancy by the entiretyproperty is

not subject to lien for the tax liability of onespouse, combined with the Government's failure to adduce

any evidence that this has led to wholesale tax fraud by mar-ried individuals, suggests that the Court's policy rationale
for its holding is simply unsound.Just as I am unwilling to overturn this Court's longstanding precedent that States define and create property rightsand forms of ownership, Aquilino, 363 U. S., at 513, n. 3, I am
equally unwilling to redefine or dismiss as fictional forms ofproperty ownership that the State has recognized in favor
of an amorphous federal common-law definition of property.I respectfully dissent.

TAHOE-SIERRA PRESERVATION COUNCIL, INC.,

et al. v. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNINGAGENCY

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-1167. Argued January 7, 2002--Decided April 23, 2002
Respondent Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) imposed two moratoria, totaling 32 months, on development in the Lake Tahoe Basin while
formulating a comprehensive land-use plan for the area. Petitioners,
real estate owners affected by the moratoria and an association representing such owners, filed parallel suits, later consolidated, claiming
that TRPA's actions constituted a taking of their property without
just compensation. The District Court found that TRPA had not effected a "partial taking" under the analysis set out in Penn Central
Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104; however, it concluded that
the moratoria did constitute a taking under the categorical rule announced in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003,
because TRPA temporarily deprived petitioners of all economically
viable use of their land. On appeal, TRPA successfully challenged the
District Court's takings determination. Finding that the only question in this facial challenge was whether Lucas' rule applied, the Ninth
Circuit held that because the regulations had only a temporary impact
on petitioners' fee interest, no categorical taking had occurred; that
Lucas applied to the relatively rare case in which a regulation permanently denies all productive use of an entire parcel, whereas the moratoria involved only a temporal slice of the fee interest; and that First
English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los
Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, concerned the question whether compensation
is an appropriate remedy for a temporary taking, not whether or
when such a taking has occurred. The court also concluded that Penn
Central's ad hoc balancing approach was the proper framework for
analyzing whether a taking had occurred, but that petitioners had not
challenged the District Court's conclusion that they could not make out

Held: The moratoria ordered by TRPA are not per se takings of property

requiring compensation under the Takings Clause. Pp. 321-343.

(a) Although this Court's physical takings jurisprudence, for the most
part, involves the straightforward application of per se rules, its regulatory takings jurisprudence is characterized by "essentially ad hoc,

factual inquiries," Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 124, designed to allow
"careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances,"
Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606, 636 (O'Connor, J., concurring).
The longstanding distinction between physical and regulatory takings
makes it inappropriate to treat precedent from one as controlling on
the other. Petitioners rely on First English and Lucas--both regulatory takings cases--to argue for a categorical rule that whenever the
government imposes a deprivation of all economically viable use of
property, no matter how brief, it effects a taking. In First English,
482 U. S., at 315, 318, 321, the Court addressed the separate remedial
question of how compensation is measured once a regulatory taking
is established, but not the different and prior question whether the
temporary regulation was in fact a taking. To the extent that the
Court referenced that antecedent question, it recognized that a regulation temporarily denying an owner all use of her property might not
constitute a taking if the denial was part of the State's authority to
enact safety regulations, or if it were one of the normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and
the like. Thus, First English did not approve, and implicitly rejected,
petitioners' categorical approach. Nor is Lucas dispositive of the question presented. Its categorical rule--requiring compensation when a
regulation permanently deprives an owner of "all economically beneficial uses" of his land, 505 U. S., at 1019--does not answer the question whether a regulation prohibiting any economic use of land for
32 months must be compensated. Petitioners attempt to bring this
case under the rule in Lucas by focusing exclusively on the property
during the moratoria is unavailing. This Court has consistently rejected such an approach to the "denominator" question. See, e. g., Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 497. To
sever a 32-month segment from the remainder of each fee simple estate
and then ask whether that segment has been taken in its entirety would
ignore Penn Central's admonition to focus on "the parcel as a whole,"
438 U. S., at 130-131. Both dimensions of a real property interest--the
metes and bounds describing its geographic dimensions and the term
of years describing its temporal aspect--must be considered when viewing the interest in its entirety. A permanent deprivation of all use is
a taking of the parcel as a whole, but a temporary restriction causing a diminution in value is not, for the property will recover value
when the prohibition is lifted. Lucas was carved out for the "extraordinary case" in which a regulation permanently deprives property
of all use; the default rule remains that a fact specific inquiry is required
in the regulatory taking context. Nevertheless, the Court will consider
petitioners' argument that the interest in protecting property owners

from bearing public burdens "which, in all fairness and justice, should
be borne by the public as a whole," Armstrong v. United States, 364
U. S. 40, 49, justifies creating a new categorical rule. Pp. 321-332.

(b) "Fairness and justice" will not be better served by a categorical
rule that any deprivation of all economic use, no matter how brief, constitutes a compensable taking. That rule would apply to numerous
normal delays in obtaining, e. g., building permits, and would require
changes in practices that have long been considered permissible exercises of the police power. Such an important change in the law should
be the product of legislative rulemaking, not adjudication. More importantly, for the reasons set out in Justice O'Connor's concurring
opinion in Palazzolo, 533 U. S., at 636, the better approach to a temporary regulatory taking claim requires careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances--only one of which is the length
of the delay. A narrower rule excluding normal delays in processing
permits, or covering only delays of more than a year, would have a less
severe impact on prevailing practices, but would still impose serious
constraints on the planning process. Moratoria are an essential tool
of successful development. The interest in informed decisionmaking
counsels against adopting a per se rule that would treat such interim
measures as takings regardless of the planners' good faith, the landowners' reasonable expectations, or the moratorium's actual impact
on property values. The financial constraints of compensating property owners during a moratorium may force officials to rush through
the planning process or abandon the practice altogether. And the interest in protecting the decisional process is even stronger when an agency
is developing a regional plan than when it is considering a permit for
a single parcel. Here, TRPA obtained the benefit of comments and
criticisms from interested parties during its deliberations, but a categorical rule tied to the deliberations' length would likely create added
pressure on decisionmakers to quickly resolve land-use questions, disadvantaging landowners and interest groups less organized or familiar
with the planning process. Moreover, with a temporary development
ban, there is less risk that individual landowners will be singled out to
bear a special burden that should be shared by the public as a whole.
It may be true that a moratorium lasting more than one year should be
viewed with special skepticism, but the District Court found that the
instant delay was not unreasonable. The restriction's duration is one
factor for a court to consider in appraising regulatory takings claims,
but with respect to that factor, the temptation to adopt per se rules in
either direction must be resisted. Pp. 333-342.

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented is whether a moratorium on de-velopment imposed during the process of devising a comprehensive land-use plan constitutes a per se taking of prop-erty requiring compensation under the Takings Clause of
the United States Constitution.1 This case actually involvestwo moratoria ordered by respondent Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to maintain the status quo while study-ing the impact of development on Lake Tahoe and designing a strategy for environmentally sound growth. The first,Ordinance 81-5, was effective from August 24, 1981, until
August 26, 1983, whereas the second more restrictive Reso-lution 83-21 was in effect from August 27, 1983, until April
25, 1984. As a result of these two directives, virtually alldevelopment on a substantial portion of the property subject to TRPA's jurisdiction was prohibited for a period of32 months. Although the question we decide relates only
to that 32-month period, a brief description of the eventsleading up to the moratoria and a comment on the two perThomas F. Reilly of Massachusetts, Mike McGrath of Montana, John J.

manent plans that TRPA adopted thereafter will clarifythe narrow scope of our holding.

I
The relevant facts are undisputed. The Court of Appeals,while reversing the District Court on a question of law,

accepted all of its findings of fact, and no party challengesthose findings. All agree that Lake Tahoe is "uniquely
beautiful," 34 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1230 (Nev. 1999), that Presi-dent Clinton was right to call it a " `national treasure that
must be protected and preserved,' " ibid., and that MarkTwain aptly described the clarity of its waters as " `not
merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so,' " ibid.(emphasis added) (quoting M. Twain, Roughing It 174-175
(1872)).Lake Tahoe's exceptional clarity is attributed to the absence of algae that obscures the waters of most other lakes.Historically, the lack of nitrogen and phosphorous, which
nourish the growth of algae, has ensured the transparencyof its waters.

2 Unfortunately, the lake's pristine state has

deteriorated rapidly over the past 40 years; increased landdevelopment in the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin) has threatened the " `noble sheet of blue water' " beloved by Twainand countless others. 34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1230. As the District Court found, "[d]ramatic decreases in clarity first beganto be noted in the late 1950's/early 1960's, shortly after development at the lake began in earnest." Id., at 1231. Thelake's unsurpassed beauty, it seems, is the wellspring of its
undoing.

2 According to a Senate Report: "Only two other sizable lakes in the
world are of comparable quality--Crater Lake in Oregon, which is protected as part of the Crater Lake National Park, and Lake Baikal in the
[former] Soviet Union. Only Lake Tahoe, however, is so readily accessible
from large metropolitan centers and is so adaptable to urban development." S. Rep. No. 91-510, pp. 3-4 (1969).

308 TAHOE-SIERRA PRESERVATION COUNCIL, INC. v.

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court

The upsurge of development in the area has caused "in-creased nutrient loading of the lake largely because of the

increase in impervious coverage of land in the Basin result-ing from that development." Ibid.

"Impervious coverage--such as asphalt, concrete, build-ings, and even packed dirt--prevents precipitation from
being absorbed by the soil. Instead, the water isgathered and concentrated by such coverage. Larger
amounts of water flowing off a driveway or a roof havemore erosive force than scattered raindrops falling over
a dispersed area--especially one covered with indige-nous vegetation, which softens the impact of the raindrops themselves." Ibid.
Given this trend, the District Court predicted that "unlessthe process is stopped, the lake will lose its clarity and

its trademark blue color, becoming green and opaque foreternity."

3

Those areas in the Basin that have steeper slopes producemore runoff; therefore, they are usually considered "high

hazard" lands. Moreover, certain areas near streams orwetlands known as "Stream Environment Zones" (SEZs)
are especially vulnerable to the impact of development be-cause, in their natural state, they act as filters for much
of the debris that runoff carries. Because "[t]he most ob-vious response to this problem . . . is to restrict development around the lake--especially in SEZ lands, as well as inareas already naturally prone to runoff," id., at 1232, conservation efforts have focused on controlling growth in thesehigh hazard areas.

In the 1960's, when the problems associated with theburgeoning development began to receive significant atten3 The District Court added: "Or at least, for a very, very long time. Estimates are that, should the lake turn green, it could take over 700 years
for it to return to its natural state, if that were ever possible at all." 34

Opinion of the Court
tion, jurisdiction over the Basin, which occupies 501 square
miles, was shared by the States of California and Nevada,
five counties, several municipalities, and the Forest Service
of the Federal Government. In 1968, the legislatures of the
two States adopted the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact,
see 1968 Cal. Stats. no. 998, p. 1900, $ 1; 1968 Nev. Stats. p. 4,
which Congress approved in 1969, Pub. L. 91-148, 83 Stat.
360. The compact set goals for the protection and preservation of the lake and created TRPA as the agency assigned
"to coordinate and regulate development in the Basin and
to conserve its natural resources." Lake Country Estates,
Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391, 394
(1979).

Pursuant to the compact, in 1972 TRPA adopted a Land
Use Ordinance that divided the land in the Basin into seven
"land capability districts," based largely on steepness but
also taking into consideration other factors affecting runoff.
Each district was assigned a "land coverage coefficient--a
recommended limit on the percentage of such land that could
be covered by impervious surface." Those limits ranged
from 1% for districts 1 and 2 to 30% for districts 6 and 7.
Land in districts 1, 2, and 3 is characterized as "high hazard"
or "sensitive," while land in districts 4, 5, 6, and 7 is "low
hazard" or "non-sensitive." The SEZ lands, though often
treated as a separate category, were actually a subcategory
of district 1. 34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1232.

Unfortunately, the 1972 ordinance allowed numerous exceptions and did not significantly limit the construction of
new residential housing. California became so dissatisfied
with TRPA that it withdrew its financial support and unilaterally imposed stricter regulations on the part of the
Basin located in California. Eventually the two States, with
the approval of Congress and the President, adopted an extensive amendment to the compact that became effective
on December 19, 1980. Pub. L. 96-551, 94 Stat. 3233; Cal.

The 1980 Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Compact) re-defined the structure, functions, and voting procedures of
TRPA, App. 37, 94 Stat. 3235-3238; 34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1233,and directed it to develop regional "environmental threshold carrying capacities"--a term that embraced "standards
for air quality, water quality, soil conservation, vegetationpreservation and noise." 94 Stat. 3235, 3239. The Compact

provided that TRPA "shall adopt" those standards within18 months, and that "[w]ithin 1 year after" their adoption
(i. e., by June 19, 1983), it "shall" adopt an amended regionalplan that achieves and maintains those carrying capacities.
Id., at 3240. The Compact also contained a finding by thelegislatures of California and Nevada "that in order to
make effective the regional plan as revised by [TRPA], it isnecessary to halt temporarily works of development in the
region which might otherwise absorb the entire capability
of the region for further development or direct it out of
harmony with the ultimate plan." Id., at 3243. Accordingly, for the period prior to the adoption of the final plan
("or until May 1, 1983, whichever is earlier"), the Compact
itself prohibited the development of new subdivisions, condominiums, and apartment buildings, and also prohibited each
city and county in the Basin from granting any more permits
in 1981, 1982, or 1983 than had been granted in 1978.4

During this period TRPA was also working on the development of a regional water quality plan to comply with
the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 1288 (1994 ed.). Despite

4 App. 104-107. This moratorium did not apply to rights that had
vested before the effective date of the 1980 Compact. Id., at 107-108.
Two months after the 1980 Compact became effective, TRPA adopted
its Ordinance 81-1 broadly defining the term "project" to include the
construction of any new residence and requiring owners of land in districts 1, 2, or 3, to get a permit from TRPA before beginning construction
of homes on their property. 34 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1233 (Nev. 1999).

Opinion of the Court
the fact that TRPA performed these obligations in "goodfaith and to the best of its ability," 34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1233,

after a few months it concluded that it could not meet thedeadlines in the Compact. On June 25, 1981, it therefore
enacted Ordinance 81-5 imposing the first of the two mora-toria on development that petitioners challenge in this proceeding. The ordinance provided that it would become effective on August 24, 1981, and remain in effect pending theadoption of the permanent plan required by the Compact.

App. 159, 191.The District Court made a detailed analysis of the ordinance, noting that it might even prohibit hiking or picnicking on SEZ lands, but construed it as essentially banning any construction or other activity that involved the
removal of vegetation or the creation of land coverage on all
SEZ lands, as well as on class 1, 2, and 3 lands in California.
34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1233-1235. Some permits could be obtained for such construction in Nevada if certain findings
were made. Id., at 1235. It is undisputed, however, that
Ordinance 81-5 prohibited the construction of any new residences on SEZ lands in either State and on class 1, 2, and 3
lands in California.

Given the complexity of the task of defining "environmental threshold carrying capacities" and the division of
opinion within TRPA's governing board, the District Court
found that it was "unsurprising" that TRPA failed to adopt
those thresholds until August 26, 1982, roughly two months
after the Compact deadline. Ibid. Under a liberal reading
of the Compact, TRPA then had until August 26, 1983, to
adopt a new regional plan. 94 Stat. 3240. "Unfortunately,
but again not surprisingly, no regional plan was in place as
of that date." 34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1235. TRPA therefore
adopted Resolution 83-21, "which completely suspended all
project reviews and approvals, including the acceptance of
new proposals," and which remained in effect until a new
regional plan was adopted on April 26, 1984. Thus, Resolu535US2 Unit: $U40 [09-27-03 14:48:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion 83-21 imposed an 8-month moratorium prohibiting allconstruction on high hazard lands in either State. In combination, Ordinance 81-5 and Resolution 83-21 effectivelyprohibited all construction on sensitive lands in California
and on all SEZ lands in the entire Basin for 32 months,and on sensitive lands in Nevada (other than SEZ lands) for
eight months. It is these two moratoria that are at issue inthis case.

On the same day that the 1984 plan was adopted, the Stateof California filed an action seeking to enjoin its implementation on the ground that it failed to establish land-use con-trols sufficiently stringent to protect the Basin.

Id., at 1236.The District Court entered an injunction that was upheld

by the Court of Appeals and remained in effect until a com-pletely revised plan was adopted in 1987. Both the 1984
injunction and the 1987 plan contained provisions thatprohibited new construction on sensitive lands in the Basin.
As the case comes to us, however, we have no occasion toconsider the validity of those provisions.

II
Approximately two months after the adoption of the 1984plan, petitioners filed parallel actions against TRPA and

other defendants in federal courts in Nevada and Californiathat were ultimately consolidated for trial in the District
of Nevada. The petitioners include the Tahoe-Sierra Pres-ervation Council, Inc., a nonprofit membership corporation
representing about 2,000 owners of both improved and unim-proved parcels of real estate in the Lake Tahoe Basin, and a
class of some 400 individual owners of vacant lots locatedeither on SEZ lands or in other parts of districts 1, 2, or 3.
Those individuals purchased their properties prior to the
effective date of the 1980 Compact, App. 34, primarily forthe purpose of constructing "at a time of their choosing" a

single-family home "to serve as a permanent, retirement or

Opinion of the Court
vacation residence," id., at 36. When they made those pur-chases, they did so with the understanding that such construction was authorized provided that "they complied withall reasonable requirements for building."

Ibid.5
Petitioners' complaints gave rise to protracted litigation
that has produced four opinions by the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit and several published District Court
opinions.6 For present purposes, however, we need only
describe those courts' disposition of the claim that three
actions taken by TRPA--Ordinance 81-5, Resolution 83-21,
and the 1984 regional plan--constituted takings of petitioners' property without just compensation.7 Indeed, the
challenge to the 1984 plan is not before us because both
the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that it
was the federal injunction against implementing that plan,
rather than the plan itself, that caused the post-1984 injuries
that petitioners allegedly suffered, and those rulings are not
encompassed within our limited grant of certiorari.8 Thus,

5 As explained, supra, at 309, the petitioners who purchased land after
the 1972 compact did so amidst a heavily regulated zoning scheme. Their

property was already classified as part of land capability districts 1, 2,
and 3, or SEZ land. And each land classification was subject to regulations as to the degree of artificial disturbance the land could safely
sustain.

1484 (1992).

7 In 1991, petitioners amended their complaint to allege that the adoption of the 1987 plan also constituted an unconstitutional taking. Ultimately both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that this
claim was barred by California's 1-year statute of limitations and Nevada's
2-year statute of limitations. See 216 F. 3d, at 785-789. Although the
validity of the 1987 plan is not before us, we note that other litigants
have challenged certain applications of that plan. See Suitum v. Tahoe
Regional Planning Agency, 520 U. S. 725 (1997).

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court

we limit our discussion to the lower courts' disposition of the
claims based on the 2-year moratorium (Ordinance 81-5) and
the ensuing 8-month moratorium (Resolution 83-21).

The District Court began its constitutional analysis by
identifying the distinction between a direct government
appropriation of property without just compensation and a
government regulation that imposes such a severe restriction on the owner's use of her property that it produces
"nearly the same result as a direct appropriation." 34 F.
Supp. 2d, at 1238. The court noted that all of the claims in
this case "are of the `regulatory takings' variety." Id., at
1239. Citing our decision in Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447
U. S. 255 (1980), it then stated that a "regulation will constitute a taking when either: (1) it does not substantially
advance a legitimate state interest; or (2) it denies the
owner economically viable use of her land." 34 F. Supp.
2d, at 1239. The District Court rejected the first alternative based on its finding that "further development on high
hazard lands such as [petitioners'] would lead to significant
additional damage to the lake." Id., at 1240.9 With respect

injuries, post, at 343-345. Petitioners, however, do not challenge the
Court of Appeals' holding on causation in their briefs on the merits, presumably because they understood when we granted certiorari on the question "[w]hether the Court of Appeals properly determined that a temporary moratorium on land development does not constitute a taking of
property requiring compensation under the Takings Clause of the United
States Constitution," 533 U. S. 948 (2001), we were only interested in the
narrow question decided today. Throughout the District Court and Court
of Appeals decisions the phrase "temporary moratorium" refers to two
things and two things only: Ordinance 81-5 and Resolution 83-21. The
dissent's novel theory of causation was not briefed, nor was it discussed
during oral argument.

9 As the District Court explained: "There is a direct connection between the potential development of plaintiffs' lands and the harm the lake
would suffer as a result thereof. Further, there has been no suggestion
by the plaintiffs that any less severe response would have adequately
addressed the problems the lake was facing. Thus it is difficult to see

Opinion of the Court
to the second alternative, the court first considered whether
the analysis adopted in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New
York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978), would lead to the conclusion
that TRPA had effected a "partial taking," and then whether
those actions had effected a "total taking." 10

Emphasizing the temporary nature of the regulations, the
testimony that the "average holding time of a lot in the
Tahoe area between lot purchase and home construction is
twenty-five years," and the failure of petitioners to offer
specific evidence of harm, the District Court concluded that
"consideration of the Penn Central factors clearly leads to
the conclusion that there was no taking." 34 F. Supp. 2d,
at 1240. In the absence of evidence regarding any of the
individual plaintiffs, the court evaluated the "average" purchasers' intent and found that such purchasers "did not have
reasonable, investment-backed expectations that they would
be able to build single-family homes on their land within the
six-year period involved in this lawsuit." Id., at 1241.11

how a more proportional response could have been adopted. Given that
TRPA's actions had widespread application, and were not aimed at an individual landowner, the plaintiffs would appear to bear the burden of proof
on this point. They have not met this burden--nor have they really attempted to do so. Although unwilling to stipulate to the fact that TRPA's
actions substantially advanced a legitimate state interest, the plaintiffs
did not seriously contest the matter at trial." 34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1240
(citation omitted).

10 The Penn Central analysis involves "a complex of factors including

the regulation's economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the
regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations,
and the character of the government action." Palazzolo v. Rhode Island,
533 U. S. 606, 617 (2001).

11 The court stated that petitioners "had plenty of time to build before

the restrictions went into effect--and almost everyone in the Tahoe Basin
knew in the late 1970s that a crackdown on development was in the
works." In addition, the court found "the fact that no evidence was introduced regarding the specific diminution in value of any of the plaintiffs'
individual properties clearly weighs against a finding that there was a
partial taking of the plaintiffs' property." 34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1241.

Opinion of the Court

The District Court had more difficulty with the "totaltaking" issue. Although it was satisfied that petitioners'

property did retain some value during the moratoria,12 itfound that they had been temporarily deprived of "all economically viable use of their land." Id., at 1245. The courtconcluded that those actions therefore constituted "categorical" takings under our decision in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992). It rejectedTRPA's response that Ordinance 81-5 and Resolution 83-

21 were "reasonable temporary planning moratoria" thatshould be excluded from Lucas' categorical approach. The
court thought it "fairly clear" that such interim actionswould not have been viewed as takings prior to our decisions in Lucas and First English Evangelical LutheranChurch of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304
(1987), because "[z]oning boards, cities, counties and otheragencies used them all the time to `maintain the status quo
pending study and governmental decision making.' " 34 F.Supp. 2d, at 1248-1249 (quoting

Williams v. Central, 907P. 2d 701, 706 (Colo. App. 1995)). After expressing uncertainty as to whether those cases required a holding thatmoratoria on development automatically effect takings, the
court concluded that TRPA's actions did so, partly becauseneither the ordinance nor the resolution, even though intended to be temporary from the beginning, contained an

average price of over $19,000 and 45 parcels in Nevada at an average

petitioners for the 32-month period from August 24, 1981, toApril 25, 1984, and to those owning class 1, 2, or 3 property

Both parties appealed. TRPA successfully challenged theDistrict Court's takings determination, and petitioners unsuccessfully challenged the dismissal of their claims basedon the 1984 and 1987 plans. Petitioners did not, however,
challenge the District Court's findings or conclusions con-cerning its application of

Penn Central. With respect to thetwo moratoria, the Ninth Circuit noted that petitioners had

expressly disavowed an argument "that the regulations con-stitute a taking under the ad hoc balancing approach described in Penn Central" and that they did not "dispute thatthe restrictions imposed on their properties are appropriate
means of securing the purpose set forth in the Compact." 14Accordingly, the only question before the court was "whether
the rule set forth in Lucas applies--that is, whether a cate13 Ordinance 81-5 specified that it would terminate when the regional
plan became finalized. And Resolution 83-21 was limited to 90 days, but
was renewed for an additional term. Nevertheless, the District Court
distinguished these measures from true "temporary" moratoria because
there was no fixed date for when they would terminate. 34 F. Supp. 2d,
at 1250-1251.

the district court's latter holding, but the plaintiffs did not appeal the
former. And even if arguments regarding the Penn Central test were
fairly encompassed by the defendants' appeal, the plaintiffs have stated
explicitly on this appeal that they do not argue that the regulations constitute a taking under the ad hoc balancing approach described in Penn
Central." Ibid.

gorical taking occurred because Ordinance 81-5 and Reso-lution 83-21 denied the plaintiffs `all economically beneficial or productive use of land.' " 216 F. 3d 764, 773 (2000).Moreover, because petitioners brought only a facial challenge, the narrow inquiry before the Court of Appeals waswhether the mere enactment of the regulations constituted
a taking.

Contrary to the District Court, the Court of Appeals heldthat because the regulations had only a temporary impact

on petitioners' fee interest in the properties, no categoricaltaking had occurred. It reasoned:

"Property interests may have many different dimensions. For example, the dimensions of a property interest may include a physical dimension (which de-scribes the size and shape of the property in question),

a functional dimension (which describes the extent towhich an owner may use or dispose of the property in
question), and a temporal dimension (which describesthe duration of the property interest). At base, the
plaintiffs' argument is that we should conceptuallysever each plaintiff 's fee interest into discrete segments
in at least one of these dimensions--the temporal one--and treat each of those segments as separate and distinct property interests for purposes of takings analysis.
Under this theory, they argue that there was a cate-gorical taking of one of those temporal segments."

Id., at 774.
Putting to one side "cases of physical invasion or occupa-tion,"

ibid., the court read our cases involving regulatory
taking claims to focus on the impact of a regulation on the
parcel as a whole. In its view a "planning regulation that
prevents the development of a parcel for a temporary period of time is conceptually no different than a land-use
restriction that permanently denies all use on a discrete
portion of property, or that permanently restricts a type

of use across all of the parcel." Id., at 776. In each situa-tion, a regulation that affects only a portion of the parcel--

whether limited by time, use, or space--does not deprive theowner of all economically beneficial use.

15

The Court of Appeals distinguished Lucas as applying tothe " `relatively rare' " case in which a regulation denies all

productive use of an entire parcel, whereas the moratoria
involve only a "temporal `slice' " of the fee interest and aform of regulation that is widespread and well established.

216 F. 3d, at 773-774. It also rejected petitioners' argumentthat our decision in

First English was controlling. According to the Court of Appeals, First English concerned thequestion whether compensation is an appropriate remedy for

a temporary taking and not whether or when such a takinghas occurred. 216 F. 3d, at 778. Faced squarely with the
question whether a taking had occurred, the court held that
Penn Central was the appropriate framework for analysis.
Petitioners, however, had failed to challenge the District

15 The Court of Appeals added:
"Each of these three types of regulation will have an impact on the parcel's
value, because each will affect an aspect of the owner's `use' of the property--by restricting when the `use' may occur, where the `use' may occur,
or how the `use' may occur. Prior to Agins [v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S.
255 (1980)], the Court had already rejected takings challenges to regulations eliminating all `use' on a portion of the property, and to regulations
restricting the type of `use' across the breadth of the property. See Penn

Opinion of the Court

Court's conclusion that they could not make out a takingclaim under the Penn Central factors.

Over the dissent of five judges, the Ninth Circuit denied apetition for rehearing en banc. 228 F. 3d 998 (2000). In the
dissenters' opinion, the panel's holding was not faithful tothis Court's decisions in First English and Lucas, nor to Justice Holmes admonition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon,260 U. S. 393, 416 (1922), that " `a strong public desire to
improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achiev-ing the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way
of paying for the change.' " 228 F. 3d, at 1003. Becauseof the importance of the case, we granted certiorari limited
to the question stated at the beginning of this opinion. 533U. S. 948 (2001). We now affirm.

III
Petitioners make only a facial attack on Ordinance 81-5and Resolution 83-21. They contend that the mere enactment of a temporary regulation that, while in effect, deniesa property owner all viable economic use of her property
gives rise to an unqualified constitutional obligation to com-pensate her for the value of its use during that period.
Hence, they "face an uphill battle," Keystone Bituminous
Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 495 (1987), thatis made especially steep by their desire for a categorical

rule requiring compensation whenever the governmentimposes such a moratorium on development. Under their
proposed rule, there is no need to evaluate the landowners'investment-backed expectations, the actual impact of the
regulation on any individual, the importance of the publicinterest served by the regulation, or the reasons for imposing the temporary restriction. For petitioners, it isenough that a regulation imposes a temporary deprivation--
no matter how brief--of all economically viable use to trig-ger a

per se rule that a taking has occurred. Petitionersassert that our opinions in

First English and Lucas have

already endorsed their view, and that it is a logical applica-tion of the principle that the Takings Clause was "designed

to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bearburdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne
by the public as a whole." Armstrong v. United States, 364U. S. 40, 49 (1960).

We shall first explain why our cases do not support theirproposed categorical rule--indeed, fairly read, they implicitly reject it. Next, we shall explain why the Armstrongprinciple requires rejection of that rule as well as the less
extreme position advanced by petitioners at oral argument.In our view the answer to the abstract question whether
a temporary moratorium effects a taking is neither "yes,always" nor "no, never"; the answer depends upon the particular circumstances of the case.16 Resisting "[t]he temp-tation to adopt what amount to

per se rules in either direc-tion," Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606, 636 (2001)

(O'Connor, J., concurring), we conclude that the circum-stances in this case are best analyzed within the

Penn Cen-tral framework.

IV
The text of the Fifth Amendment itself provides a basisfor drawing a distinction between physical takings and regulatory takings. Its plain language requires the payment ofcompensation whenever the government acquires private
property for a public purpose, whether the acquisition isthe result of a condemnation proceeding or a physical appropriation. But the Constitution contains no comparablereference to regulations that prohibit a property owner from

16 Despite our clear refusal to hold that a moratorium never effects a
taking, The Chief Justice accuses us of "allow[ing] the government to
`. . . take private property without paying for it,' " post, at 349. It may
be true that under a Penn Central analysis petitioners' land was taken
and compensation would be due. But petitioners failed to challenge the
District Court's conclusion that there was no taking under Penn Central.

making certain uses of her private property.17 Our juris-prudence involving condemnations and physical takings is

as old as the Republic and, for the most part, involves thestraightforward application of per se rules. Our regulatory takings jurisprudence, in contrast, is of more recentvintage and is characterized by "essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries," Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 124, designed toallow "careful examination and weighing of all the relevant
circumstances." Palazzolo, 533 U. S., at 636 (O'Connor, J.,concurring).

When the government physically takes possession of aninterest in property for some public purpose, it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner, United Statesv.

Pewee Coal Co., 341 U. S. 114, 115 (1951), regardless ofwhether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire

parcel or merely a part thereof. Thus, compensation ismandated when a leasehold is taken and the government
occupies the property for its own purposes, even though thatuse is temporary.

United States v. General Motors Corp.,323 U. S. 373 (1945); United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327

17 In determining whether government action affecting property is an
unconstitutional deprivation of ownership rights under the Just Compensation Clause, a court must interpret the word "taken." When the
government condemns or physically appropriates the property, the fact
of a taking is typically obvious and undisputed. When, however, the
owner contends a taking has occurred because a law or regulation imposes restrictions so severe that they are tantamount to a condemnation
or appropriation, the predicate of a taking is not self-evident, and the
analysis is more complex.

This longstanding distinction between acquisitions of property for public use, on the one hand, and regulations prohibiting private uses, on the other, makes it inappropriate
to treat cases involving physical takings as controlling
precedents for the evaluation of a claim that there has been
a "regulatory taking," 18 and vice versa. For the same reason that we do not ask whether a physical appropriation
advances a substantial government interest or whether it
deprives the owner of all economically valuable use, we
do not apply our precedent from the physical takings con18 To illustrate the importance of the distinction, the Court in Loretto,
458 U. S., at 430, compared two wartime takings cases, United States v.
Pewee Coal Co., 341 U. S. 114, 116 (1951), in which there had been an
"actual taking of possession and control" of a coal mine, and United States
v. Central Eureka Mining Co., 357 U. S. 155 (1958), in which, "by contrast,
the Court found no taking where the Government had issued a wartime
order requiring nonessential gold mines to cease operations . . . ." 458
U. S., at 431. Loretto then relied on this distinction in dismissing the
argument that our discussion of the physical taking at issue in the case
would affect landlord-tenant laws. "So long as these regulations do not
require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a portion of his
building by a third party, they will be analyzed under the multifactor
inquiry generally applicable to nonpossessory governmental activity."

text to regulatory takings claims. Land-use regulations
are ubiquitous and most of them impact property values
in some tangential way--often in completely unanticipated
ways. Treating them all as per se takings would transform
government regulation into a luxury few governments could
afford. By contrast, physical appropriations are relatively
rare, easily identified, and usually represent a greater affront to individual property rights.19 "This case does not
present the `classi[c] taking' in which the government directly appropriates private property for its own use," Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 522 (1998); instead
the interference with property rights "arises from some
public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of eco19 According to The Chief Justice's dissent, even a temporary, useprohibiting regulation should be governed by our physical takings cases
because, under Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003,
1017 (1992), "from the landowner's point of view," the moratorium is the
functional equivalent of a forced leasehold, post, at 348. Of course, from
both the landowner's and the government's standpoint there are critical
differences between a leasehold and a moratorium. Condemnation of a
leasehold gives the government possession of the property, the right
to admit and exclude others, and the right to use it for a public purpose.
A regulatory taking, by contrast, does not give the government any right
to use the property, nor does it dispossess the owner or affect her right to
exclude others.

The Chief Justice stretches Lucas' "equivalence" language too far.
For even a regulation that constitutes only a minor infringement on property may, from the landowner's perspective, be the functional equivalent
of an appropriation. Lucas carved out a narrow exception to the rules
governing regulatory takings for the "extraordinary circumstance" of a
permanent deprivation of all beneficial use. The exception was only
partially justified based on the "equivalence" theory cited by The Chief
Justice's dissent. It was also justified on the theory that, in the "relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of
all economically beneficial uses," it is less realistic to assume that the regulation will secure an "average reciprocity of advantage," or that government could not go on if required to pay for every such restriction. 505
U. S., at 1017-1018. But as we explain, infra, at 339-341, these assumptions hold true in the context of a moratorium.

nomic life to promote the common good," Penn Central, 438U. S., at 124.

Perhaps recognizing this fundamental distinction, peti-tioners wisely do not place all their emphasis on analogies
to physical takings cases. Instead, they rely principally onour decision in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,
505 U. S. 1003 (1992)--a regulatory takings case that, never-theless, applied a categorical rule--to argue that the

PennCentral framework is inapplicable here. A brief review of

some of the cases that led to our decision in Lucas, however,will help to explain why the holding in that case does not
answer the question presented here.As we noted in Lucas, it was Justice Holmes' opinion in
Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922),20that gave birth to our regulatory takings jurisprudence.

21

20 The case involved "a bill in equity brought by the defendants in error
to prevent the Pennsylvania Coal Company from mining under their property in such way as to remove the supports and cause a subsidence of the
surface and of their house." Mahon, 260 U. S., at 412. Mahon sought to
prevent Pennsylvania Coal from mining under his property by relying
on a state statute, which prohibited any mining that could undermine the
foundation of a home. The company challenged the statute as a taking
of its interest in the coal without compensation.

21 In Lucas, we explained: "Prior to Justice Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), it was generally thought
that the Takings Clause reached only a `direct appropriation' of property,
Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent
of a `practical ouster of [the owner's] possession,' Transportation Co. v.
Chicago, 99 U. S. 635, 642 (1879) . . . . Justice Holmes recognized in
Mahon, however, that if the protection against physical appropriations
of private property was to be meaningfully enforced, the government's
power to redefine the range of interests included in the ownership of property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 U. S., at
414-415. If, instead, the uses of private property were subject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, `the natural
tendency of human nature [would be] to extend the qualification more
and more until at last private property disappear[ed].' Id., at 415. These
considerations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that, `while
property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too

Opinion of the Court

In subsequent opinions we have repeatedly and consistentlyendorsed Holmes' observation that "if regulation goes too

far it will be recognized as a taking." Id., at 415. JusticeHolmes did not provide a standard for determining when a
regulation goes "too far," but he did reject the view ex-pressed in Justice Brandeis' dissent that there could not be
a taking because the property remained in the possessionof the owner and had not been appropriated or used by
the public.22 After Mahon, neither a physical appropriationnor a public use has ever been a necessary component of a
"regulatory taking."In the decades following that decision, we have "generally
eschewed" any set formula for determining how far is toofar, choosing instead to engage in " `essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.' " Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1015 (quoting Penn
Central, 438 U. S., at 124). Indeed, we still resist the temp-tation to adopt per se rules in our cases involving partial regulatory takings, preferring to examine "a numberof factors" rather than a simple "mathematically precise"
formula.23 Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court in Penn
far it will be recognized as a taking.' Ibid." 505 U. S., at 1014 (citation
omitted).

22 Justice Brandeis argued: "Every restriction upon the use of property

imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some
right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the
State of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction
imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner. The State does not appropriate it or make any use of
it. The State merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public." Mahon, 260 U. S., at 417 (dissenting opinion).

23 In her concurring opinion in Palazzolo, 533 U. S., at 633, Justice

O'Connor reaffirmed this approach: "Our polestar instead remains the
principles set forth in Penn Central itself and our other cases that govern partial regulatory takings. Under these cases, interference with
investment-backed expectations is one of a number of factors that a

Opinion of the Court
Central did, however, make it clear that even though mul-tiple factors are relevant in the analysis of regulatory takings claims, in such cases we must focus on "the parcel asa whole":

" `Taking' jurisprudence does not divide a single par-cel into discrete segments and attempt to determine
whether rights in a particular segment have been en-tirely abrogated. In deciding whether a particular
governmental action has effected a taking, this Courtfocuses rather both on the character of the action and
on the nature and extent of the interference with rightsin the parcel as a whole--here, the city tax block designated as the `landmark site.' " Id., at 130-131.
This requirement that "the aggregate must be viewed in
its entirety" explains why, for example, a regulation thatprohibited commercial transactions in eagle feathers, but

did not bar other uses or impose any physical invasion orrestraint upon them, was not a taking.

Andrus v. Allard,
444 U. S. 51, 66 (1979). It also clarifies why restrictions on
the use of only limited portions of the parcel, such as setbackordinances,

Gorieb v. Fox, 274 U. S. 603 (1927), or a requirement that coal pillars be left in place to prevent mine sub-sidence,

Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis,
480 U. S., at 498, were not considered regulatory takings.In each of these cases, we affirmed that "where an owner

possesses a full `bundle' of property rights, the destructionof one `strand' of the bundle is not a taking."

328 TAHOE-SIERRA PRESERVATION COUNCIL, INC. v.

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court

While the foregoing cases considered whether particularregulations had "gone too far" and were therefore invalid,

none of them addressed the separate remedial question ofhow compensation is measured once a regulatory taking
is established. In his dissenting opinion in San Diego Gas
& Elec. Co. v. San Diego, 450 U. S. 621, 636 (1981), Justice
Brennan identified that question and explained how he
would answer it:

"The constitutional rule I propose requires that, oncea court finds that a police power regulation has effected

a `taking,' the government entity must pay just compen-sation for the period commencing on the date the regulation first effected the `taking,' and ending on the date
the government entity chooses to rescind or otherwiseamend the regulation."

Id., at 658.

Justice Brennan's proposed rule was subsequently endorsed
by the Court in First English, 482 U. S., at 315, 318, 321.
First English was certainly a significant decision, and nothing that we say today qualifies its holding. Nonetheless, itis important to recognize that we did not address in that

case the quite different and logically prior question whether
the temporary regulation at issue had in fact constituted ataking.

In First English, the Court unambiguously and repeatedlycharacterized the issue to be decided as a "compensation
question" or a "remedial question." Id., at 311 ("The dispo-sition of the case on these grounds isolates the remedial
question for our consideration"); see also id., at 313, 318.And the Court's statement of its holding was equally unambiguous: "We merely hold that where the government's activities have already worked a taking of all use of property, no
subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the
duty to provide compensation for the period during which
the taking was effective." Id., at 321 (emphasis added). In
fact, First English expressly disavowed any ruling on the

329Cite as: 535 U. S. 302 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
merits of the takings issue because the California courtshad decided the remedial question on the assumption that

a taking had been alleged. Id., at 312-313 ("We rejectappellee's suggestion that . . . we must independently evaluate the adequacy of the complaint and resolve the takingsclaim on the merits before we can reach the remedial question"). After our remand, the California courts concluded
that there had not been a taking, First English Evangelical
Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 210 Cal. App.
3d 1353, 258 Cal. Rptr. 893 (1989), and we declined review ofthat decision, 493 U. S. 1056 (1990).

To the extent that the Court in First English referenced
the antecedent takings question, we identified two reasons
why a regulation temporarily denying an owner all use of
her property might not constitute a taking. First, we recognized that "the county might avoid the conclusion that a
compensable taking had occurred by establishing that the
denial of all use was insulated as a part of the State's authority to enact safety regulations." 482 U. S., at 313. Second,
we limited our holding "to the facts presented" and recognized "the quite different questions that would arise in the
case of normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes
in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like which [were]
not before us." Id., at 321. Thus, our decision in First
English surely did not approve, and implicitly rejected, the
categorical submission that petitioners are now advocating.

Similarly, our decision in Lucas is not dispositive of the
question presented. Although Lucas endorsed and applied
a categorical rule, it was not the one that petitioners propose.
Lucas purchased two residential lots in 1988 for $975,000.
These lots were rendered "valueless" by a statute enacted
two years later. The trial court found that a taking had
occurred and ordered compensation of $1,232,387.50, representing the value of the fee simple estate, plus interest.
As the statute read at the time of the trial, it effected a
taking that "was unconditional and permanent." 505 U. S.,

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court

at 1012. While the State's appeal was pending, the statute was amended to authorize exceptions that might have
allowed Lucas to obtain a building permit. Despite the fact
that the amendment gave the State Supreme Court the
opportunity to dispose of the appeal on ripeness grounds,
it resolved the merits of the permanent takings claim and
reversed. Since "Lucas had no reason to proceed on a `temporary taking' theory at trial," we decided the case on the
permanent taking theory that both the trial court and the
State Supreme Court had addressed. Ibid.

The categorical rule that we applied in Lucas states that
compensation is required when a regulation deprives an
owner of "all economically beneficial uses" of his land. Id.,
at 1019. Under that rule, a statute that "wholly eliminated
the value" of Lucas' fee simple title clearly qualified as a
taking. But our holding was limited to "the extraordinary
circumstance when no productive or economically beneficial
use of land is permitted." Id., at 1017. The emphasis on
the word "no" in the text of the opinion was, in effect, reiterated in a footnote explaining that the categorical rule
would not apply if the diminution in value were 95% instead of 100%. Id., at 1019, n. 8.24 Anything less than a
"complete elimination of value," or a "total loss," the Court
acknowledged, would require the kind of analysis applied in
Penn Central. Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1019-1020, n. 8.25

Certainly, our holding that the permanent "obliteration
of the value" of a fee simple estate constitutes a categorical
taking does not answer the question whether a regulation

24 Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment on the basis of the regulation's impact on "reasonable, investment-backed expectations." 505
U. S., at 1034.

25 It is worth noting that Lucas underscores the difference between

physical and regulatory takings. See supra, at 322-325. For under our
physical takings cases it would be irrelevant whether a property owner
maintained 5% of the value of her property so long as there was a physical
appropriation of any of the parcel.

Opinion of the Court
prohibiting any economic use of land for a 32-month periodhas the same legal effect. Petitioners seek to bring this

case under the rule announced in Lucas by arguing that wecan effectively sever a 32-month segment from the remainder of each landowner's fee simple estate, and then askwhether that segment has been taken in its entirety by the
moratoria. Of course, defining the property interest takenin terms of the very regulation being challenged is circular.
With property so divided, every delay would become a totalban; the moratorium and the normal permit process alike
would constitute categorical takings. Petitioners' "concep-tual severance" argument is unavailing because it ignores
Penn Central's admonition that in regulatory takings caseswe must focus on "the parcel as a whole." 438 U. S., at 130-
131. We have consistently rejected such an approach to the"denominator" question. See

Keystone, 480 U. S., at 497.See also Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S.602, 644 (1993) ("To the extent that any portion of property
is taken, that portion is always taken in its entirety; the rele-vant question, however, is whether the property taken is all,
or only a portion of, the parcel in question"). Thus, the Dis-trict Court erred when it disaggregated petitioners' property into temporal segments corresponding to the regula-tions at issue and then analyzed whether petitioners were
deprived of all economically viable use during each period.34 F. Supp. 2d, at 1242-1245. The starting point for the
court's analysis should have been to ask whether there wasa total taking of the entire parcel; if not, then

Penn Centralwas the proper framework.
26

An interest in real property is defined by the metes andbounds that describe its geographic dimensions and the

26 The Chief Justice's dissent makes the same mistake by carving out
a 6-year interest in the property, rather than considering the parcel as a
whole, and treating the regulations covering that segment as analogous to
a total taking under Lucas, post, at 351.

term of years that describes the temporal aspect of the own-er's interest. See Restatement of Property $$ 7-9 (1936).

Both dimensions must be considered if the interest is tobe viewed in its entirety. Hence, a permanent deprivation of the owner's use of the entire area is a taking of"the parcel as a whole," whereas a temporary restriction that
merely causes a diminution in value is not. Logically, a feesimple estate cannot be rendered valueless by a temporary
prohibition on economic use, because the property will re-cover value as soon as the prohibition is lifted. Cf.

Aginsv. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S., at 263, n. 9 ("Even if the appellants' ability to sell their property was limited during thependency of the condemnation proceeding, the appellants
were free to sell or develop their property when the proceed-ings ended. Mere fluctuations in value during the process
of governmental decisionmaking, absent extraordinary delay,are `incidents of ownership. They cannot be considered as
a "taking" in the constitutional sense' " (quoting Danforth v.
United States, 308 U. S. 271, 285 (1939))).Neither Lucas, nor First English, nor any of our other

regulatory takings cases compels us to accept petitioners'categorical submission. In fact, these cases make clear
that the categorical rule in Lucas was carved out for the"extraordinary case" in which a regulation permanently
deprives property of all value; the default rule remains that,in the regulatory taking context, we require a more fact
specific inquiry. Nevertheless, we will consider whetherthe interest in protecting individual property owners from
bearing public burdens "which, in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole," Armstrong v.
United States, 364 U. S., at 49, justifies creating a new rulefor these circumstances.

27

27 Armstrong, like Lucas, was a case that involved the "total destruction
by the Government of all value" in a specific property interest. 364 U. S.,
at 48-49. It is nevertheless perfectly clear that Justice Black's oft-quoted
comment about the underlying purpose of the guarantee that private prop535US2 Unit: $U40 [09-27-03 14:48:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

V
Considerations of "fairness and justice" arguably couldsupport the conclusion that TRPA's moratoria were takings

of petitioners' property based on any of seven differenttheories. First, even though we have not previously done
so, we might now announce a categorical rule that, in theinterest of fairness and justice, compensation is required
whenever government temporarily deprives an owner of all
economically viable use of her property. Second, we couldcraft a narrower rule that would cover all temporary landuse restrictions except those "normal delays in obtainingbuilding permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances,
and the like" which were put to one side in our opinion in
First English, 482 U. S., at 321. Third, we could adopt arule like the one suggested by an

amicus supporting petitioners that would "allow a short fixed period for delib-erations to take place without compensation--say maximum

one year--after which the just compensation requirements"would "kick in."

28 Fourth, with the benefit of hindsight, we

might characterize the successive actions of TRPA as a"series of rolling moratoria" that were the functional equivalent of a permanent taking.29 Fifth, were it not for the find-ings of the District Court that TRPA acted diligently and in
good faith, we might have concluded that the agency was
stalling in order to avoid promulgating the environmentalthreshold carrying capacities and regional plan mandated by

the 1980 Compact. Cf. Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at
erty shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation applies
to partial takings as well as total takings.

28 Brief for the Institute for Justice as Amicus Curiae 30. Although

amicus describes the 1-year cutoff proposal as the "better approach by
far," ibid., its primary argument is that Penn Central should be overruled, id., at 20 ("All partial takings by way of land use restriction should
be subject to the same prima facie rules for compensation as a physical
occupation for a limited period of time").

Opinion of the Court

Monterey, Ltd., 526 U. S. 687, 698 (1999). Sixth, apart from
the District Court's finding that TRPA's actions represented
a proportional response to a serious risk of harm to the lake,
petitioners might have argued that the moratoria did not
substantially advance a legitimate state interest, see Agins
and Monterey. Finally, if petitioners had challenged the application of the moratoria to their individual parcels, instead
of making a facial challenge, some of them might have prevailed under a Penn Central analysis.

As the case comes to us, however, none of the last four
theories is available. The "rolling moratoria" theory was
presented in the petition for certiorari, but our order granting review did not encompass that issue, 533 U. S. 948 (2001);
the case was tried in the District Court and reviewed in the
Court of Appeals on the theory that each of the two moratoria was a separate taking, one for a 2-year period and the
other for an 8-month period. 216 F. 3d, at 769. And, as we
have already noted, recovery on either a bad faith theory or
a theory that the state interests were insubstantial is foreclosed by the District Court's unchallenged findings of fact.
Recovery under a Penn Central analysis is also foreclosed
both because petitioners expressly disavowed that theory,
and because they did not appeal from the District Court's
conclusion that the evidence would not support it. Nonetheless, each of the three per se theories is fairly encompassed
within the question that we decided to answer.

With respect to these theories, the ultimate constitutional
question is whether the concepts of "fairness and justice"
that underlie the Takings Clause will be better served by
one of these categorical rules or by a Penn Central inquiry
into all of the relevant circumstances in particular cases.
From that perspective, the extreme categorical rule that
any deprivation of all economic use, no matter how brief,
constitutes a compensable taking surely cannot be sustained.
Petitioners' broad submission would apply to numerous

Opinion of the Court
"normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in
zoning ordinances, variances, and the like," 482 U. S., at 321,
as well as to orders temporarily prohibiting access to crime
scenes, businesses that violate health codes, fire-damaged
buildings, or other areas that we cannot now foresee. Such
a rule would undoubtedly require changes in numerous practices that have long been considered permissible exercises
of the police power. As Justice Holmes warned in Mahon,
"[g]overnment hardly could go on if to some extent values
incident to property could not be diminished without paying
for every such change in the general law." 260 U. S., at 413.
A rule that required compensation for every delay in the
use of property would render routine government processes
prohibitively expensive or encourage hasty decisionmaking.
Such an important change in the law should be the product
of legislative rulemaking rather than adjudication.30

More importantly, for reasons set out at some length by
Justice O'Connor in her concurring opinion in Palazzolo
v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S., at 636, we are persuaded that the
better approach to claims that a regulation has effected a
temporary taking "requires careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances." In that opinion,
Justice O'Connor specifically considered the role that the
"temporal relationship between regulatory enactment and
title acquisition" should play in the analysis of a takings
claim. Id., at 632. We have no occasion to address that
particular issue in this case, because it involves a differ30 In addition, we recognize the anomaly that would be created if we
were to apply Penn Central when a landowner is permanently deprived
of 95% of the use of her property, Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1019, n. 8, and yet
find a per se taking anytime the same property owner is deprived of all
use for only five days. Such a scheme would present an odd inversion
of Justice Holmes' adage: "A limit in time, to tide over a passing trouble,
well may justify a law that could not be upheld as a permanent change."

ent temporal relationship--the distinction between a tem-porary restriction and one that is permanent. Her comments on the "fairness and justice" inquiry are, neverthe-less, instructive:

"Today's holding does not mean that the timing of theregulation's enactment relative to the acquisition of title
is immaterial to the Penn Central analysis. Indeed, itwould be just as much error to expunge this consideration from the takings inquiry as it would be to ac-cord it exclusive significance. Our polestar instead remains the principles set forth in Penn Central itself andour other cases that govern partial regulatory takings.
Under these cases, interference with investment-backedexpectations is one of a number of factors that a court
must examine. . . ."The Fifth Amendment forbids the taking of private
property for public use without just compensation. Wehave recognized that this constitutional guarantee is
` "designed to bar Government from forcing some peoplealone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and
justice, should be borne by the public as a whole." '
Penn Central, [438 U. S.], at 123-124 (quoting Arm-strong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960)). The

concepts of `fairness and justice' that underlie theTakings Clause, of course, are less than fully determinate. Accordingly, we have eschewed `any "set for-mula" for determining when "justice and fairness" require that economic injuries caused by public actionbe compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons.'
Penn Central, supra, at 124 (quoting Goldblatt v. Hemp-stead, 369 U. S. 590, 594 (1962)). The outcome instead

Opinion of the Court
In rejecting petitioners' per se rule, we do not hold that thetemporary nature of a land-use restriction precludes finding

that it effects a taking; we simply recognize that it shouldnot be given exclusive significance one way or the other.

A narrower rule that excluded the normal delays asso-ciated with processing permits, or that covered only delays
of more than a year, would certainly have a less severe im-pact on prevailing practices, but it would still impose serious
financial constraints on the planning process.31 Unlike the"extraordinary circumstance" in which the government deprives a property owner of all economic use, Lucas, 505 U. S.,at 1017, moratoria like Ordinance 81-5 and Resolution 83-

21 are used widely among land-use planners to preserve thestatus quo while formulating a more permanent development strategy.32 In fact, the consensus in the planning com31 Petitioners fail to offer a persuasive explanation for why moratoria
should be treated differently from ordinary permit delays. They contend
that a permit applicant need only comply with certain specific requirements in order to receive one and can expect to develop at the end of the
process, whereas there is nothing the landowner subject to a moratorium
can do but wait, with no guarantee that a permit will be granted at the
end of the process. Brief for Petitioners 28. Setting aside the obvious
problem with basing the distinction on a course of events we can only
know after the fact--in the context of a facial challenge--petitioners'
argument breaks down under closer examination because there is no guarantee that a permit will be granted, or that a decision will be made within
a year. See, e. g., Dufau v. United States, 22 Cl. Ct. 156 (1990) (holding
that 16-month delay in granting a permit did not constitute a temporary
taking). Moreover, under petitioners' modified categorical rule, there
would be no per se taking if TRPA simply delayed action on all permits
pending a regional plan. Fairness and justice do not require that TRPA
be penalized for achieving the same result, but with full disclosure.

32 See, e. g., Santa Fe Village Venture v. Albuquerque, 914 F. Supp. 478,

483 (N. M. 1995) (30-month moratorium on development of lands within
the Petroglyph National Monument was not a taking); Williams v. Central, 907 P. 2d 701, 703-706 (Colo. App. 1995) (10-month moratorium on

munity appears to be that moratoria, or "interim develop-ment controls" as they are often called, are an essential tool

that we do not reject a categorical rule in this case because a 32-month

Opinion of the Court
The interest in facilitating informed decisionmaking byregulatory agencies counsels against adopting a per se rule

that would impose such severe costs on their deliberations.Otherwise, the financial constraints of compensating property owners during a moratorium may force officials to rushthrough the planning process or to abandon the practice
altogether. To the extent that communities are forced toabandon using moratoria, landowners will have incentives to
develop their property quickly before a comprehensive plancan be enacted, thereby fostering inefficient and ill-conceived
growth. A finding in the 1980 Compact itself, which pre-sumably was endorsed by all three legislative bodies that
participated in its enactment, attests to the importance of
that concern. 94 Stat. 3243 ("The legislatures of the Statesof California and Nevada find that in order to make effective

the regional plan as revised by the agency, it is necessary tohalt temporarily works of development in the region which
might otherwise absorb the entire capability of the regionfor further development or direct it out of harmony with the
ultimate plan").

As Justice Kennedy explained in his opinion for theCourt in

Palazzolo, it is the interest in informed decisionmaking that underlies our decisions imposing a strictripeness requirement on landowners asserting regulatory

takings claims:

"These cases stand for the important principle that a
landowner may not establish a taking before a land-use authority has the opportunity, using its own reasonable procedures, to decide and explain the reach ofa challenged regulation. Under our ripeness rules a
takings claim based on a law or regulation which isalleged to go too far in burdening property depends
upon the landowner's first having followed reasonable
because we conclude that the Penn Central framework adequately directs
the inquiry to the proper considerations--only one of which is the length
of the delay.

and necessary steps to allow regulatory agencies to ex-ercise their full discretion in considering development

plans for the property, including the opportunity togrant any variances or waivers allowed by law. As a
general rule, until these ordinary processes have beenfollowed the extent of the restriction on property is
not known and a regulatory taking has not yet beenestablished. See

Suitum [v. Tahoe Regional PlanningAgency, 520 U. S. 725, 736, and n. 10 (1997)] (noting

difficulty of demonstrating that `mere enactment' ofregulations restricting land use effects a taking)." 533
U. S., at 620-621.
We would create a perverse system of incentives were we tohold that landowners must wait for a takings claim to ripen

so that planners can make well-reasoned decisions while, atthe same time, holding that those planners must compensate
landowners for the delay.Indeed, the interest in protecting the decisional process
is even stronger when an agency is developing a regionalplan than when it is considering a permit for a single parcel.
In the proceedings involving the Lake Tahoe Basin, for ex-ample, the moratoria enabled TRPA to obtain the benefit of
comments and criticisms from interested parties, such as thepetitioners, during its deliberations.

35 Since a categorical

rule tied to the length of deliberations would likely createadded pressure on decisionmakers to reach a quick resolution

of land-use questions, it would only serve to disadvantagethose landowners and interest groups who are not as or35 Petitioner Preservation Council, "through its authorized representatives, actively participated in the entire TRPA regional planning process

ganized or familiar with the planning process. Moreover,
with a temporary ban on development there is a lesser
risk that individual landowners will be "singled out" to bear
a special burden that should be shared by the public as a
whole. Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S.
825, 835 (1987). At least with a moratorium there is a clear
"reciprocity of advantage," Mahon, 260 U. S., at 415, because
it protects the interests of all affected landowners against
immediate construction that might be inconsistent with the
provisions of the plan that is ultimately adopted. "While
each of us is burdened somewhat by such restrictions, we,
in turn, benefit greatly from the restrictions that are placed
on others." Keystone, 480 U. S., at 491. In fact, there is
reason to believe property values often will continue to increase despite a moratorium. See, e. g., Growth Properties,
Inc. v. Klingbeil Holding Co., 419 F. Supp. 212, 218 (Md.
1976) (noting that land values could be expected to increase
20% during a 5-year moratorium on development). Cf. Forest Properties, Inc. v. United States, 177 F. 3d 1360, 1367
(CA Fed. 1999) (record showed that market value of the entire parcel increased despite denial of permit to fill and develop lake-bottom property). Such an increase makes sense
in this context because property values throughout the Basin
can be expected to reflect the added assurance that Lake
Tahoe will remain in its pristine state. Since in some cases
a 1-year moratorium may not impose a burden at all, we
should not adopt a rule that assumes moratoria always force
individuals to bear a special burden that should be shared by
the public as a whole.

It may well be true that any moratorium that lasts for
more than one year should be viewed with special skepticism. But given the fact that the District Court found that
the 32 months required by TRPA to formulate the 1984 Regional Plan was not unreasonable, we could not possibly conclude that every delay of over one year is constitutionally

Opinion of the Court

unacceptable.36 Formulating a general rule of this kind isa suitable task for state legislatures.

37 In our view, the

duration of the restriction is one of the important factorsthat a court must consider in the appraisal of a regulatory

takings claim, but with respect to that factor as with respectto other factors, the "temptation to adopt what amount to
per se rules in either direction must be resisted." Palazzolo, 533 U. S., at 636 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Theremay be moratoria that last longer than one year which interfere with reasonable investment-backed expectations, butas the District Court's opinion illustrates, petitioners' proposed rule is simply "too blunt an instrument" for identifyingthose cases. Id., at 628. We conclude, therefore, that the
interest in "fairness and justice" will be best served by rely-ing on the familiar Penn Central approach when deciding
cases like this, rather than by attempting to craft a new cate-gorical rule.

36 We note that the temporary restriction that was ultimately upheld in
the First English case lasted for more than six years before it was replaced by a permanent regulation. First English Evangelical Lutheran
Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 210 Cal. App. 3d 1353, 258
Cal. Rptr. 893 (1989).

ordinances with specific time limits. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. $ 65858

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scaliaand

For over half a decade petitioners were prohibited frombuilding homes, or any other structures, on their land. Because the Takings Clause requires the government to paycompensation when it deprives owners of all economically
viable use of their land, see Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992), and because a ban on all de-velopment lasting almost six years does not resemble any

traditional land-use planning device, I dissent.

on any of the petition's specific questions presented, but formulated the

that a temporary moratorium on land development does not constitute a
taking of property requiring compensation under the Takings Clause of
the United States Constitution?" 533 U. S. 948-949 (2001). This Court's
Rule 14(1)(a) provides that a "question presented is deemed to comprise
every subsidiary question fairly included therein." The question of how
long the moratorium on land development lasted is necessarily subsumed
within the question whether the moratorium constituted a taking. Petitioners did not assume otherwise. Their brief on the merits argues that
respondent "effectively blocked all construction for the past two decades."

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

ignores much of the impact of respondent's conduct on peti-tioners. Instead, it relies on the flawed determination of the

Court of Appeals that the relevant time period lasted onlyfrom August 1981 until April 1984.

Ante, at 312, 313-314.
During that period, Ordinance 81-5 and Regulation 83-21prohibited development pending the adoption of a new regional land-use plan. The adoption of the 1984 Regional
Plan (hereinafter Plan or 1984 Plan) did not, however, changeanything from petitioners' standpoint. After the adoption

of the 1984 Plan, petitioners still could make no use of theirland.

The Court of Appeals disregarded this post-April 1984
deprivation on the ground that respondent did not "cause" it.
In a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 action, "the plaintiff must demonstrate
that the defendant's conduct was the actionable cause of the
claimed injury." 216 F. 3d 764, 783 (CA9 2000). Applying
this principle, the Court of Appeals held that the 1984 Plan
did not amount to a taking because the Plan actually allowed
permits to issue for the construction of single-family residences. Those permits were never issued because the District Court immediately issued a temporary restraining
order, and later a permanent injunction that lasted until
1987, prohibiting the approval of any building projects under
the 1984 Plan. Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that
the "1984 Plan itself could not have constituted a taking,"
because it was the injunction, not the Plan, that prohibited
development during this period. Id., at 784. The Court of
Appeals is correct that the 1984 Plan did not cause petitioners' injury. But that is the right answer to the wrong question. The causation question is not limited to whether the
1984 Plan caused petitioners' injury; the question is whether
respondent caused petitioners' injury.

We have never addressed the $ 1983 causation requirement
in the context of a regulatory takings claim, though language
in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104
(1978), suggests that ordinary principles of proximate cause

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
govern the causation inquiry for takings claims. Id., at 124.The causation standard does not require much elaboration in

this case, because respondent was undoubtedly the "movingforce" behind petitioners' inability to build on their land from
August 1984 through 1987. Monell v. New York City Dept.
of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978) ($ 1983 causation
established when government action is the "moving force"
behind the alleged constitutional violation). The injunctionin this case issued because the 1984 Plan did not comply

with the 1980 Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Compact)and regulations issued pursuant to the Compact. And, of
course, respondent is responsible for the Compact and its
regulations.

On August 26, 1982, respondent adopted Resolution 82-11.
That resolution established "environmental thresholds for
water quality, soil conservation, air quality, vegetation preservation, wildlife, fisheries, noise, recreation, and scenic resources." California v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,
766 F. 2d 1308, 1311 (CA9 1985). The District Court enjoined the 1984 Plan in part because the Plan would have
allowed 42,000 metric tons of soil per year to erode from
some of the single-family residences, in excess of the Resolution 82-11 threshold for soil conservation. Id., at 1315;
see also id., at 1312. Another reason the District Court
enjoined the 1984 Plan was that it did not comply with article
V(g) of the Compact, which requires a finding, "with respect
to each project, that the project will not cause the established [environmental] thresholds to be exceeded." Ibid.
Thus, the District Court enjoined the 1984 Plan because the
Plan did not comply with the environmental requirements of
respondent's regulations and of the Compact itself.

Respondent is surely responsible for its own regulations,
and it is also responsible for the Compact as it is the governmental agency charged with administering the Compact.
Compact, Art. I(c), 94 Stat. 3234. It follows that respondent
was the "moving force" behind petitioners' inability to de535US2 Unit: $U40 [09-27-03 14:48:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

velop their land from April 1984 through the enactment ofthe 1987 plan. Without the environmental thresholds established by the Compact and Resolution 82-11, the 1984 Planwould have gone into effect and petitioners would have been
able to build single-family residences. And it was certainlyforeseeable that development projects exceeding the environmental thresholds would be prohibited; indeed, thatwas the very purpose of enacting the thresholds.

Because respondent caused petitioners' inability to usetheir land from 1981 through 1987, that is the appropriate
period of time from which to consider their takings claim.

I now turn to determining whether a ban on all economicdevelopment lasting almost six years is a taking. Lucas reaffirmed our "frequently expressed" view that "when theowner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice
all economically beneficial uses in the name of the commongood, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has
suffered a taking." 505 U. S., at 1019. See also Agins v.City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 258-259 (1980). The District
Court in this case held that the ordinances and resolu-tions in effect between August 24, 1981, and April 25, 1984,
"did in fact deny the plaintiffs all economically viable useof their land." 34 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1245 (Nev. 1999). The
Court of Appeals did not overturn this finding. And the1984 injunction, issued because the environmental thresholds issued by respondent did not permit the developmentof single-family residences, forced petitioners to leave their
land economically idle for at least another three years. TheCourt does not dispute that petitioners were forced to leave
their land economically idle during this period. See ante,at 312. But the Court refuses to apply

Lucas on the groundthat the deprivation was "temporary."

Neither the Takings Clause nor our case law supportssuch a distinction. For one thing, a distinction between

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
"temporary" and "permanent" prohibitions is tenuous. The"temporary" prohibition in this case that the Court finds

is not a taking lasted almost six years.2 The "permanent"prohibition that the Court held to be a taking in Lucas lasted
less than two years. See 505 U. S., at 1011-1012. The "per-manent" prohibition in Lucas lasted less than two years because the law, as it often does, changed. The South CarolinaLegislature in 1990 decided to amend the 1988 Beachfront
Management Act to allow the issuance of " `special permits'for the construction or reconstruction of habitable structures seaward of the baseline." Id., at 1011-1012. Land-use regulations are not irrevocable. And the government
can even abandon condemned land. See United States v.
Dow, 357 U. S. 17, 26 (1958). Under the Court's decisiontoday, the takings question turns entirely on the initial label

given a regulation, a label that is often without much mean-ing. There is every incentive for government to simply
label any prohibition on development "temporary," or tofix a set number of years. As in this case, this initial designation does not preclude the government from repeatedlyextending the "temporary" prohibition into a long-term ban
on all development. The Court now holds that such a desig-nation by the government is conclusive even though in fact
the moratorium greatly exceeds the time initially specified.Apparently, the Court would not view even a 10-year moratorium as a taking under Lucas because the moratorium isnot "permanent."

Our opinion in First English Evangelical Lutheran
Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304(1987), rejects any distinction between temporary and permanent takings when a landowner is deprived of all economi-cally beneficial use of his land.

First English stated that" `temporary takings which, as here, deny a landowner all

use of his property, are not different in kind from permanent

lasted only 32 months, the ban in this case exceeded the ban in Lucas.

takings, for which the Constitution clearly requires compensation." Id., at 318. Because of First English's rule
that "temporary deprivations of use are compensable under
the Takings Clause," the Court in Lucas found nothing
problematic about the later developments that potentially
made the ban on development temporary. 505 U. S., at
1011-1012 (citing First English, supra); see also 505 U. S.,
at 1033 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) ("It is well
established that temporary takings are as protected by the
Constitution as are permanent ones" (citing First English,
supra, at 318)).

More fundamentally, even if a practical distinction between temporary and permanent deprivations were plausible, to treat the two differently in terms of takings law
would be at odds with the justification for the Lucas rule.
The Lucas rule is derived from the fact that a "total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner's point of view,
the equivalent of a physical appropriation." 505 U. S., at
1017. The regulation in Lucas was the "practical equivalence" of a long-term physical appropriation, i. e., a condemnation, so the Fifth Amendment required compensation.
The "practical equivalence," from the landowner's point of
view, of a "temporary" ban on all economic use is a forced
leasehold. For example, assume the following situation: Respondent is contemplating the creation of a National Park
around Lake Tahoe to preserve its scenic beauty. Respondent decides to take a 6-year leasehold over petitioners' property, during which any human activity on the land would be
prohibited, in order to prevent any further destruction to the
area while it was deciding whether to request that the area
be designated a National Park.

Surely that leasehold would require compensation. In a
series of World War II-era cases in which the Government
had condemned leasehold interests in order to support the
war effort, the Government conceded that it was required

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
to pay compensation for the leasehold interest.3 See UnitedStates v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U. S. 372 (1946); United States

v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S. 373, 376 (1945). Frompetitioners' standpoint, what happened in this case is no
different than if the government had taken a 6-year leaseof their property. The Court ignores this "practical equivalence" between respondent's deprivation and the depriva-tion resulting from a leasehold. In so doing, the Court
allows the government to "do by regulation what it cannot dothrough eminent domain--i. e., take private property without paying for it." 228 F. 3d 998, 999 (CA9 2000) (Kozinski,J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).

Instead of acknowledging the "practical equivalence" ofthis case and a condemned leasehold, the Court analogizes
to other areas of takings law in which we have distinguishedbetween regulations and physical appropriations, see

ante,at 321-324. But whatever basis there is for such distinctions in those contexts does not apply when a regulation de-prives a landowner of all economically beneficial use of his
land. In addition to the "practical equivalence" from thelandowner's perspective of such a regulation and a physical
appropriation, we have held that a regulation denying allproductive use of land does not implicate the traditional
justification for differentiating between regulations andphysical appropriations. In "the extraordinary circumstance
when no productive or economically beneficial use of land ispermitted," it is less likely that "the legislature is simply

3 There was no dispute that just compensation was required in those
cases. The disagreement involved how to calculate that compensation.
In United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S. 373 (1945), for example, the issues before the Court were how to value the leasehold interest (i. e., whether the "long-term rental value [should be] the sole measure of the value of such short-term occupancy," id., at 380), whether the
Government had to pay for the respondent's removal of personal property
from the condemned warehouse, and whether the Government had to pay
for the reduction in value of the respondent's equipment and fixtures left
in the warehouse. Id., at 380-381.

`adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life' . . . in amanner that secures an `average reciprocity of advantage'

Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S., at 124,
and Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S., at 415), andmore likely that the property "is being pressed into some

form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious
public harm," Lucas, supra, at 1018.The Court also reads

Lucas as being fundamentally concerned with value, ante, at 329-331, rather than with thedenial of "all economically beneficial or productive use of

land," 505 U. S., at 1015. But Lucas repeatedly discusses
its holding as applying where "no productive or economically
beneficial use of land is permitted." Id., at 1017; see also
ibid. ("[T]otal deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner's point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation"); id., at 1016 ("[T]he Fifth Amendment is violated when
land-use regulation . . . denies an owner economically viable
use of his land"); id., at 1018 ("[T]he functional basis for
permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property
values without compensation . . . does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a
landowner of all economically beneficial uses"); ibid. ("[T]he
fact that regulations that leave the owner of land without
economically beneficial or productive options for its use . . .
carry with them a heightened risk that private property is
being pressed into some form of public service"); id., at 1019
("[W]hen the owner of real property has been called upon to
sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the
common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle,
he has suffered a taking"). Moreover, the Court's position
that value is the sine qua non of the Lucas rule proves too
much. Surely, the land at issue in Lucas retained some market value based on the contingency, which soon came to fruition (see supra, at 347), that the development ban would
be amended.

Lucas is implicated when the government deprives a land-owner of "all economically beneficial or productive use of

land." 505 U. S., at 1015. The District Court found, andthe Court agrees, that the moratorium "temporarily" deprived petitioners of " `all economically viable use of theirland.' " Ante, at 316. Because the rationale for the Lucas
rule applies just as strongly in this case, the "temporary"denial of all viable use of land for six years is a taking.

III
The Court worries that applying Lucas here compels find-ing that an array of traditional, short-term, land-use planning devices are takings. Ante, at 334-335, 337-338. Butsince the beginning of our regulatory takings jurisprudence,
we have recognized that property rights "are enjoyed underan implied limitation."

Mahon, supra, at 413. Thus, inLucas, after holding that the regulation prohibiting all economically beneficial use of the coastal land came within ourcategorical takings rule, we nonetheless inquired into
whether such a result "inhere[d] in the title itself, in therestrictions that background principles of the State's law of
property and nuisance already place upon land ownership."505 U. S., at 1029. Because the regulation at issue in Lucas
purported to be permanent, or at least long term, we con-cluded that the only implied limitation of state property law
that could achieve a similar long-term deprivation of all eco-nomic use would be something "achieved in the courts--by
adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected persons)under the State's law of private nuisance, or by the State
under its complementary power to abate nuisances that af-fect the public generally, or otherwise."

Ibid.When a regulation merely delays a final land-use decision,

we have recognized that there are other background princi-ples of state property law that prevent the delay from being
deemed a taking. We thus noted in First English that ourdiscussion of temporary takings did not apply "in the case

of normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes inzoning ordinances, variances, and the like." 482 U. S., at

321. We reiterated this last Term: "The right to improveproperty, of course, is subject to the reasonable exercise of
state authority, including the enforcement of valid zoningand land-use restrictions." Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533
U. S. 606, 627 (2001). Zoning regulations existed as far backas colonial Boston, see Treanor, The Original Understanding
of the Takings Clause and the Political Process, 95 Colum.L. Rev. 782, 789 (1995), and New York City enacted the first
comprehensive zoning ordinance in 1916, see 1 Anderson'sAmerican Law of Zoning $ 3.07, p. 92 (K. Young rev. 4th ed.
1995). Thus, the short-term delays attendant to zoning andpermit regimes are a longstanding feature of state property
law and part of a landowner's reasonable investment-backedexpectations. See

Lucas, supra, at 1034 (Kennedy, J., con-curring in judgment).

But a moratorium prohibiting all economic use for a periodof six years is not one of the longstanding, implied limitations
of state property law.4 Moratoria are "interim controls onthe use of land that seek to maintain the status quo with
respect to land development in an area by either `freezing'existing land uses or by allowing the issuance of building permits for only certain land uses that would not beinconsistent with a contemplated zoning plan or zoning
change." 1 E. Ziegler, Rathkopf 's The Law of Zoning and

4 Six years is not a "cutoff point," ante, at 338, n. 34; it is the length
involved in this case. And the "explanation" for the conclusion that there
is a taking in this case is the fact that a 6-year moratorium far exceeds
any moratorium authorized under background principles of state property
law. See infra, at 353-354. This case does not require us to undertake
a more exacting study of state property law and discern exactly how long
a moratorium must last before it no longer can be considered an implied limitation of property ownership (assuming, that is, that a moratorium on all development is a background principle of state property law,
see infra, at 353).

Planning $ 13:3, p. 13-6 (4th ed. 2001). Typical moratoria
thus prohibit only certain categories of development, such
as fast-food restaurants, see Schafer v. New Orleans, 743 F.
2d 1086 (CA5 1984), or adult businesses, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986), or all commercial
development, see Arnold Bernhard & Co. v. Planning &
Zoning Comm'n, 194 Conn. 152, 479 A. 2d 801 (1984). Such
moratoria do not implicate Lucas because they do not deprive landowners of all economically beneficial use of their
land. As for moratoria that prohibit all development, these
do not have the lineage of permit and zoning requirements
and thus it is less certain that property is acquired under
the "implied limitation" of a moratorium prohibiting all development. Moreover, unlike a permit system in which it is
expected that a project will be approved so long as certain
conditions are satisfied, a moratorium that prohibits all uses
is by definition contemplating a new land-use plan that would
prohibit all uses.

But this case does not require us to decide as a categorical
matter whether moratoria prohibiting all economic use are
an implied limitation of state property law, because the
duration of this "moratorium" far exceeds that of ordinary
moratoria. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 342, n. 37,
state statutes authorizing the issuance of moratoria often
limit the moratoria's duration. California, where much of
the land at issue in this case is located, provides that a moratorium "shall be of no further force and effect 45 days from
its date of adoption," and caps extension of the moratorium
so that the total duration cannot exceed two years. Cal.
Govt. Code Ann. $ 65858(a) (West Supp. 2002); see also Minn.
Stat. $ 462.355, subd. 4 (2000) (limiting moratoria to 18

years). Another State limits moratoria to 120 days, with
the possibility of a single 6-month extension. Ore. Rev.

(1991).5 Indeed, it has long been understood that moratoriaon development exceeding these short time periods are not
a legitimate planning device. See, e. g., Holdsworth v.Hague, 9 N. J. Misc. 715, 155 A. 892 (1931).

Resolution 83-21 reflected this understanding of the lim-ited duration of moratoria in initially limiting the moratorium in this case to 90 days. But what resulted--a "mora-torium" lasting nearly six years--bears no resemblance to
the short-term nature of traditional moratoria as understoodfrom these background examples of state property law.

Because the prohibition on development of nearly sixyears in this case cannot be said to resemble any "implied
limitation" of state property law, it is a taking that re-quires compensation.

Lake Tahoe is a national treasure, and I do not doubt thatrespondent's efforts at preventing further degradation of the

lake were made in good faith in furtherance of the public
interest. But, as is the case with most governmental actionthat furthers the public interest, the Constitution requires

that the costs and burdens be borne by the public at large,not by a few targeted citizens. Justice Holmes' admonition
of 80 years ago again rings true: "We are in danger of for-getting that a strong public desire to improve the public
condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire bya shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the
change." Mahon, 260 U. S., at 416.

5 These are just some examples of the state laws limiting the duration of moratoria. There are others. See, e. g., Utah Code Ann. $$ 17-27-
404(3)(b)(i)-(ii) (1995) (temporary prohibitions on development "may not
exceed six months in duration," with the possibility of extensions for

no more than "two additional six-month periods"). See also ante, at 337,

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.

I join The Chief Justice's dissent. I write separatelyto address the majority's conclusion that the temporary
moratorium at issue here was not a taking because it wasnot a "taking of `the parcel as a whole.' "

Ante, at 332.
While this questionable rule* has been applied to variousalleged regulatory takings, it was, in my view, rejected in

the context of temporal deprivations of property by First
English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.
County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 318 (1987), which held
that temporary and permanent takings "are not differentin kind" when a landowner is deprived of all beneficial use

of his land. I had thought that First English put to restthe notion that the "relevant denominator" is land's infinite
life. Consequently, a regulation effecting a total depriva-tion of the use of a so-called "temporal slice" of property
is compensable under the Takings Clause unless backgroundprinciples of state property law prevent it from being
deemed a taking; "total deprivation of use is, from the land-owner's point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation." Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505U. S. 1003, 1017 (1992).

A taking is exactly what occurred in this case. No one
seriously doubts that the land-use regulations at issue ren-dered petitioners' land unsusceptible of

any economically
beneficial use. This was true at the inception of the mora*The majority's decision to embrace the "parcel as a whole" doctrine
as settled is puzzling. See, e. g., Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606,

the logic of [the parcel as a whole] rule"); Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1017, n. 7 (1992) (recognizing that "uncertainty
regarding the composition of the denominator in [the Court's] `deprivation'

that the relevant calculus is a "difficult question").

torium, and it remains true today. These individuals andfamilies were deprived of the opportunity to build singlefamily homes as permanent, retirement, or vacation resi-dences on land upon which such construction was authorized
when purchased. The Court assures them that "a tempo-rary prohibition on economic use" cannot be a taking because
"[l]ogically . . . the property will recover value as soon asthe prohibition is lifted."

Ante, at 332. But the "logical"assurance that a "temporary restriction . . . merely causes a

diminution in value," ibid., is cold comfort to the propertyowners in this case or any other. After all, "[i]n the long
run we are all dead." J. Keynes, Monetary Reform 88(1924).

I would hold that regulations prohibiting all productiveuses of property are subject to Lucas' per se rule, regardless
of whether the property so burdened retains theoreticaluseful life and value if, and when, the "temporary" moratorium is lifted. To my mind, such potential future valuebears on the amount of compensation due and has nothing
to do with the question whether there was a taking in thefirst place. It is regrettable that the Court has charted a
markedly different path today.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-344. Argued February 26, 2002--Decided April 29, 2002
Drug compounding is a process by which a pharmacist or doctor combines,

mixes, or alters ingredients to create a medication tailored to an individual patient's needs. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization
Act of 1997 (FDAMA) exempts "compounded drugs" from the Food and
Drug Administration's (FDA) standard drug approval requirements
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), so long as
the providers of the compounded drugs abide by several restrictions,
including that the prescription be "unsolicited," 21 U. S. C. $ 353a(a), and
that the providers "not advertise or promote the compounding of any
particular drug, class of drug, or type of drug," $ 353a(c). Respondents,
a group of licensed pharmacies that specialize in compounding drugs,
sought to enjoin enforcement of the advertising and solicitation provisions, arguing that they violate the First Amendment's free speech
guarantee. The District Court agreed and granted respondents summary judgment, holding that the provisions constitute unconstitutional
restrictions on commercial speech under Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566. Affirming in
relevant part, the Ninth Circuit held that the restrictions in question
fail Central Hudson's test because the Government had not demonstrated that the restrictions would directly advance its interests or that
alternatives less restrictive of speech were unavailable.

Held: The FDAMA's prohibitions on soliciting prescriptions for, and advertising, compounded drugs amount to unconstitutional restrictions on
commercial speech. Pp. 366-377.

(a) For a commercial speech regulation to be constitutionally permissible under the Central Hudson test, the speech in question must concern lawful activity and not be misleading, the asserted governmental
interest to be served by the regulation must be substantial, and the
regulation must "directly advanc[e]" the governmental interest and "not
[be] more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest," 447 U. S.,
at 566. Pp. 366-368.

(b) The Government asserts that three substantial interests underlie
the FDAMA: (1) preserving the effectiveness and integrity of the

535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
358 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Syllabus
FDCA's new drug approval process and the protection of the public
health it provides; (2) preserving the availability of compounded drugs
for patients who, for particularized medical reasons, cannot use commercially available products approved by the FDA; and (3) achieving
the proper balance between those two competing interests. Preserving
the new drug approval process is clearly an important governmental
interest, as is permitting the continuation of the practice of compounding so that patients with particular needs may obtain medications suited to those needs. Because pharmacists do not make enough
money from small-scale compounding to make safety and efficacy testing
of their compounded drugs economically feasible, however, it would not
make sense to require compounded drugs created to meet the unique
needs of individual patients to undergo the entire new drug approval
process. The Government therefore needs to be able to draw a line
between small-scale compounding and large-scale drug manufacturing.
The Government argues that the FDAMA's speech-related provisions
provide just such a line: As long as pharmacists do not advertise particular compounded drugs, they may sell compounded drugs without first
undergoing safety and efficacy testing and obtaining FDA approval.
However, even assuming that the FDAMA's prohibition on advertising
compounded drugs "directly advance[s]" the Government's asserted
interests, the Government has failed to demonstrate that the speech
restrictions are "not more extensive than is necessary to serve [those]
interest[s]." Central Hudson, supra, at 566. If the Government can
achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict commercial
speech, or that restricts less speech, the Government must do so.
E. g., Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 490-491. Several
non-speech-related means of drawing a line between compounding and
large-scale manufacturing might be possible here. For example, the
Government could ban the use of commercial scale manufacturing or
testing equipment in compounding drug products, prohibit pharmacists
from compounding more drugs in anticipation of receiving prescriptions than in response to prescriptions already received, or prohibit
them from offering compounded drugs at wholesale to other state
licensed persons or commercial entities for resale. The Government
has not offered any reason why such possibilities, alone or in combination, would be insufficient to prevent compounding from occurring
on such a scale as to undermine the new drug approval process.
Pp. 368-373.

(c) Even if the Government had argued (as does the dissent) that the
FDAMA's speech-related restrictions were motivated by a fear that advertising compounded drugs would put people who do not need such
drugs at risk by causing them to convince their doctors to prescribe the
drugs anyway, that fear would fail to justify the restrictions. This

535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

359Cite as: 535 U. S. 357 (2002)
Syllabus
concern rests on the questionable assumption that doctors would prescribe unnecessary medications and amounts to a fear that people would
make bad decisions if given truthful information, a notion that the Court
rejected as a justification for an advertising ban in, e. g., Virginia Bd.
of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S.
748, 770. Pp. 373-376.

(d) If the Government's failure to justify its decision to regulate
speech were not enough to convince the Court that the FDAMA's advertising provisions were unconstitutional, the amount of beneficial
speech prohibited by the FDAMA would be. Forbidding the advertisement of compounded drugs would prevent pharmacists with no
interest in mass-producing medications, but who serve clienteles with
special medical needs, from telling the doctors treating those clients
about the alternative drugs available through compounding. For example, a pharmacist serving a children's hospital where many patients are
unable to swallow pills would be prevented from telling the children's
doctors about a new development in compounding that allowed a drug
that was previously available only in pill form to be administered another way. The fact that the FDAMA would prohibit such seemingly
useful speech even though doing so does not appear to directly further
any asserted governmental objective confirms that the prohibition is
unconstitutional. Pp. 376-377.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 127(a) of the Food and Drug Administration Mod-ernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA or Act), 111 Stat. 2328,

21 U. S. C. $ 353a, exempts "compounded drugs" from theFood and Drug Administration's standard drug approval requirements as long as the providers of those drugs abideby several restrictions, including that they refrain from
advertising or promoting particular compounded drugs.Respondents, a group of licensed pharmacies that specialize in compounding drugs, sought to enjoin enforcementof the subsections of the Act dealing with advertising and
solicitation, arguing that those provisions violate the FirstAmendment's free speech guarantee. The District Court
agreed with respondents and granted their motion for sum-mary judgment, holding that the provisions do not meet the
test for acceptable government regulation of commercialspeech set forth in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v.
Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566 (1980). Thecourt invalidated the relevant provisions, severing them
from the rest of $ 127(a).The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in
part and reversed in part, agreeing that the provisions re-garding advertisement and promotion are unconstitutional
but finding them not to be severable from the rest of $ 127(a).Petitioners challenged only the Court of Appeals' constitutional holding in their petition for certiorari, and respond-ents did not file a cross-petition. We therefore address only
the constitutional question, having no occasion to review theCourt of Appeals' severability determination. We conclude,
as did the courts below, that $ 127(a)'s provisions regard-ing advertisement and promotion amount to unconstitutional
restrictions on commercial speech, and we therefore affirm.

a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient.Compounding is typically used to prepare medications that

are not commercially available, such as medication for apatient who is allergic to an ingredient in a mass-produced
product. It is a traditional component of the practice ofpharmacy, see J. Thompson, A Practical Guide to Contemporary Pharmacy Practice 11.3 (1998), and is taught as part
of the standard curriculum at most pharmacy schools, seeAmerican Council on Pharmaceutical Education, Accreditation Standards and Guidelines for the Professional Programin Pharmacy Leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree,
Standard 10(a) (adopted June 14, 1997). Many States specifically regulate compounding practices as part of their
regulation of pharmacies. See, e. g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 16,

$$ 1716.2, 1751 (2002); Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 856, $$ 1-30-8,

Pharmacy, pts. PH 404, PH 702.01 (2002); 22 Tex. Admin.
Code $ 291.36 (2002). Some require all licensed pharmacies to offer compounding services. See, e. g., 49 Pa. Code

$ 27.18(p)(2) (2002); W. Va. Code St. Rules, tit. 15, $ 19.4
(2002). Pharmacists may provide compounded drugs to patients only upon receipt of a valid prescription from a doctor
or other medical practitioner licensed to prescribe medication. See, e. g., Okla. Admin. Code $$ 535:15-10-3, 535:15-
10-9(d) (2001); Colo. State Board of Pharmacy Rule 3.02.10
(2001).

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938
(FDCA), 21 U. S. C. $$ 301-397, regulates drug manufacturing, marketing, and distribution. Section 505(a) of the
FDCA, 52 Stat. 1052, as amended, 76 Stat. 784, provides that

generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientifictraining and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use under the condi-tions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling
thereof." 21 U. S. C. $ 321(p). The FDCA invests the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) with the power to enforce
its requirements. $ 371(a).

For approximately the first 50 years after the enactmentof the FDCA, the FDA generally left regulation of compounding to the States. Pharmacists continued to providepatients with compounded drugs without applying for FDA
approval of those drugs. The FDA eventually became concerned, however, that some pharmacists were manufacturing
and selling drugs under the guise of compounding, thereby
avoiding the FDCA's new drug requirements. In 1992,
in response to this concern, the FDA issued a Compliance
Policy Guide, which announced that the "FDA may, in the
exercise of its enforcement discretion, initiate federal enforcement actions . . . when the scope and nature of a pharmacy's activities raises the kinds of concerns normally associated with a manufacturer and . . . results in significant
violations of the new drug, adulteration, or misbranding
provisions of the Act." Compliance Policy Guide 7132.16
(hereinafter Guide), App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a. The Guide
explained that the "FDA recognizes that pharmacists traditionally have extemporaneously compounded and manipulated reasonable quantities of drugs upon receipt of a
valid prescription for an individually identified patient from
a licensed practitioner," and that such activity was not the
subject of the Guide. Id., at 71a. The Guide said, however,
"that while retail pharmacies . . . are exempted from certain
requirements of the [FDCA], they are not the subject of any
general exemption from the new drug, adulteration, or misbranding provisions" of the FDCA. Id., at 72a. It stated
that the "FDA believes that an increasing number of establishments with retail pharmacy licenses are engaged in

Opinion of the Court
manufacturing, distributing, and promoting unapproved newdrugs for human use in a manner that is clearly outside the

bounds of traditional pharmacy practice and that constituteviolations of the [FDCA]."

Ibid. The Guide expressed
concern that drug products "manufactured and distributedin commercial amounts without [the] FDA's prior approval"

could harm the public health. Id., at 73a.

In light of these considerations, the Guide announced thatit was FDA policy to permit pharmacists to compound drugs

after receipt of a valid prescription for an individual patientor to compound drugs in "very limited quantities" before receipt of a valid prescription if they could document a history
of receiving valid prescriptions "generated solely within an
established professional practitioner-patient-pharmacy relationship" and if they maintained the prescription on file
as required by state law. Id., at 73a-75a. Compounding
in such circumstances was permitted as long as the pharmacy's activities did not raise "the kinds of concerns normally associated with a manufacturer." Id., at 76a. The
Guide listed nine examples of activities that the FDA believed raised such concerns and that would therefore be considered by the agency in determining whether to bring an
enforcement action. These activities included: "[s]oliciting
business (e. g., promoting, advertising, or using salespersons)
to compound specific drug products, product classes, or
therapeutic classes of drug products"; "[c]ompounding, regularly, or in inordinate amounts, drug products that are commercially available . . . and that are essentially generic copies
of commercially available, FDA-approved drug products";
using commercial scale manufacturing or testing equipment
to compound drugs; offering compounded drugs at wholesale;
and "[d]istributing inordinate amounts of compounded products out of state." Id., at 76a-77a. The Guide further
warned that pharmacies could not dispense drugs to third
parties for resale to individual patients without losing their
status as retail entities. Id., at 75a.

364 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Opinion of the Court
Congress turned portions of this policy into law when itenacted the FDAMA in 1997. The FDAMA, which amends

the FDCA, exempts compounded drugs from the FDCA's"new drug" requirements and other requirements provided
the drugs satisfy a number of restrictions. First, they mustbe compounded by a licensed pharmacist or physician in response to a valid prescription for an identified individual
patient, or, if prepared before the receipt of such a pre-scription, they must be made only in "limited quantities"

and in response to a history of the licensed pharmacist's orphysician's receipt of valid prescription orders for that drug
product within an established relationship between the pharmacist, the patient, and the prescriber. 21 U. S. C. $ 353a(a).
Second, the compounded drug must be made from approved ingredients that meet certain manufacturing and
safety standards, $$ 353a(b)(1)(A)-(B), and the compounded
drug may not appear on an FDA list of drug products that
have been withdrawn or removed from the market because
they were found to be unsafe or ineffective, $ 353a(b)(1)(C).
Third, the pharmacist or physician compounding the drug
may not "compound regularly or in inordinate amounts
(as defined by the Secretary) any drug products that are
essentially copies of a commercially available drug product."

$ 353a(b)(1)(D). Fourth, the drug product must not be identified by the FDA as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding in terms of safety or
effectiveness. $ 353a(b)(3)(A). Fifth, in States that have
not entered into a "memorandum of understanding" with the
FDA addressing the distribution of "inordinate amounts" of
compounded drugs in interstate commerce, the pharmacy,
pharmacist, or physician compounding the drug may not
distribute compounded drugs out of state in quantities exceeding five percent of that entity's total prescription orders.

$ 353a(b)(3)(B). Finally, and most relevant for this litigation, the prescription must be "unsolicited," $ 353a(a), and
the pharmacy, licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician

Opinion of the Court
compounding the drug may "not advertise or promote thecompounding of any particular drug, class of drug, or type

of drug," $ 353a(c). The pharmacy, licensed pharmacist, orlicensed physician may, however, "advertise and promote
the compounding service." Ibid.Respondents are a group of licensed pharmacies that specialize in drug compounding. They have prepared promotional materials that they distribute by mail and at medicalconferences to inform patients and physicians of the use and

effectiveness of specific compounded drugs. Fearing thatthey would be prosecuted under the FDAMA if they continued to distribute those materials, respondents filed a
complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, arguing that the Act's requirement that
they refrain from advertising and promoting their products
if they wish to continue compounding violates the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Specifically, they
challenged the requirement that prescriptions for compounded drugs be "unsolicited," 21 U. S. C. $ 353a(a), and
the requirement that pharmacists "not advertise or promote the compounding of any particular drug, class of drug,
or type of drug," $ 353a(c). The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents, finding that the FDAMA's
speech-related provisions constitute unconstitutional restrictions on commercial speech under Central Hudson, 447 U. S.,
at 566, and that their enforcement should therefore be enjoined. Western States Medical Center v. Shalala, 69 F.
Supp. 2d 1288 (Nev. 1999). The District Court, however,
found those provisions to be severable from the rest of

$ 127(a) of the FDAMA, 21 U. S. C. $ 353a, and so left the
Act's other compounding requirements intact.

The Government appealed both the holding that the
speech-related provisions were unconstitutional and the
holding that those provisions were severable from the rest
of $ 127(a). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. Western States Med535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ical Center v. Shalala, 238 F. 3d 1090 (2001). The Courtof Appeals agreed that the FDAMA's advertisement and

solicitation restrictions fail Central Hudson's test for per-missible regulation of commercial speech, finding that the
Government had not demonstrated that the speech restric-tions would directly advance its interests or that alternatives less restrictive of speech were unavailable. The Courtof Appeals disagreed, however, that the speech-related restrictions were severable from the rest of $ 127(a), 21 U. S. C.$ 353a, explaining that the FDAMA's legislative history demonstrated that Congress intended to exempt compoundingfrom the FDCA's requirements only in return for a prohibition on promotion of specific compounded drugs. Accord-ingly, the Court of Appeals invalidated $ 127(a) in its entirety.

We granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 992 (2001), to considerwhether the FDAMA's prohibitions on soliciting prescriptions for, and advertising, compounded drugs violate theFirst Amendment. Because neither party petitioned for
certiorari on the severability issue, we have no occasion toreview that portion of the Court of Appeals' decision. Likewise, the provisions of the FDAMA outside $ 127(a), whichare unrelated to drug compounding, are not an issue here
and so remain unaffected. II

The parties agree that the advertising and soliciting pro-hibited by the FDAMA constitute commercial speech. In
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens ConsumerCouncil, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976), the first case in which we
explicitly held that commercial speech receives First Amend-ment protection, we explained the reasons for this protection: "It is a matter of public interest that [economic] deci-sions, in the aggregate, be intelligent and well-informed. To
this end, the free flow of commercial information is indispen-sable." Id., at 765. Indeed, we recognized that a "particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercialinformation . . . may be as keen, if not keener by far, than

535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
his interest in the day's most urgent political debate." Id.,at 763. We have further emphasized:

"The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of oursocial and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas
and information flourish. Some of the ideas and infor-mation are vital, some of slight worth. But the general
rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the gov-ernment, assess the value of the information presented.
Thus, even a communication that does no more than pro-pose a commercial transaction is entitled to the coverage
of the First Amendment." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S.761, 767 (1993).

Although commercial speech is protected by the FirstAmendment, not all regulation of such speech is unconstitutional. See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 770. In
Central Hudson, supra, we articulated a test for determining whether a particular commercial speech regulationis constitutionally permissible. Under that test we ask as a

threshold matter whether the commercial speech concernsunlawful activity or is misleading. If so, then the speech
is not protected by the First Amendment. If the speech
concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, however,we next ask "whether the asserted governmental interest

is substantial." Id., at 566. If it is, then we "determinewhether the regulation directly advances the governmental
interest asserted," and, finally, "whether it is not moreextensive than is necessary to serve that interest."

Ibid.
Each of these latter three inquiries must be answered in theaffirmative for the regulation to be found constitutional.

Neither party has challenged the appropriateness of applying the Central Hudson framework to the speech-related
provisions at issue here. Although several Members of the
Court have expressed doubts about the Central Hudson
analysis and whether it should apply in particular cases,
see, e. g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v.

III
The Government does not attempt to defend the FDAMA'sspeech-related provisions under the first prong of the Central Hudson test; i. e., it does not argue that the prohibitedadvertisements would be about unlawful activity or would
be misleading. Instead, the Government argues that theFDAMA satisfies the remaining three prongs of the Central
Hudson test.The Government asserts that three substantial interests
underlie the FDAMA. The first is an interest in "pre-serv[ing] the effectiveness and integrity of the FDCA's new
drug approval process and the protection of the public healththat it provides." Brief for Petitioners 19. The second is
an interest in "preserv[ing] the availability of compoundeddrugs for those individual patients who, for particularized
medical reasons, cannot use commercially available prod-ucts that have been approved by the FDA."

Id., at 19-20.Finally, the Government argues that "[a]chieving the proper

balance between those two independently compelling butcompeting interests is itself a substantial governmental interest." Id., at 20.Explaining these interests, the Government argues that
the FDCA's new drug approval requirements are criticalto the public health and safety. It claims that the FDA's

Opinion of the Court
experience with drug regulation demonstrates that proof ofthe safety and effectiveness of a new drug needs to be established by rigorous, scientifically valid clinical studies be-cause impressions of individual doctors, who cannot themselves compile sufficient safety data, cannot be relied upon.The Government also argues that a premarket approval
process, under which manufacturers are required to put their
proposed drugs through tests of safety and effectiveness inorder to obtain FDA approval to market the drugs, is the

best way to guarantee drug safety and effectiveness.While it praises the FDCA's new drug approval process,
the Government also acknowledges that "because obtaining FDA approval for a new drug is a costly process, requiring FDA approval of all drug products compounded by
pharmacies for the particular needs of an individual patient
would, as a practical matter, eliminate the practice of compounding, and thereby eliminate availability of compounded
drugs for those patients who have no alternative treatment."
Id., at 26. The Government argues that eliminating the
practice of compounding drugs for individual patients would
be undesirable because compounding is sometimes critical
to the care of patients with drug allergies, patients who cannot tolerate particular drug delivery systems, and patients
requiring special drug dosages.

Preserving the effectiveness and integrity of the FDCA's
new drug approval process is clearly an important governmental interest, and the Government has every reason
to want as many drugs as possible to be subject to that
approval process. The Government also has an important
interest, however, in permitting the continuation of the
practice of compounding so that patients with particular
needs may obtain medications suited to those needs. And
it would not make sense to require compounded drugs created to meet the unique needs of individual patients to
undergo the testing required for the new drug approval
process. Pharmacists do not make enough money from

535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
370 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Opinion of the Court
small-scale compounding to make safety and efficacy test-ing of their compounded drugs economically feasible, so requiring such testing would force pharmacists to stop provid-ing compounded drugs. Given this, the Government needs
to be able to draw a line between small-scale compoundingand large-scale drug manufacturing. That line must distinguish compounded drugs produced on such a small scale that
they could not undergo safety and efficacy testing from drugsproduced and sold on a large enough scale that they could

undergo such testing and therefore must do so.The Government argues that the FDAMA's speech-related
provisions provide just such a line, i. e., that, in the terms
of Central Hudson, they "directly advanc[e] the governmental interest[s] asserted." 447 U. S., at 566. Those provisions use advertising as the trigger for requiring FDA
approval--essentially, as long as pharmacists do not advertise particular compounded drugs, they may sell compounded drugs without first undergoing safety and efficacy
testing and obtaining FDA approval. If they advertise
their compounded drugs, however, FDA approval is required. The Government explains that traditional (or, in
its view, desirable) compounding responds to a physician's
prescription and an individual patient's particular medical
situation, and that "[a]dvertising the particular products
created in the provision of [such] service (as opposed to advertising the compounding service itself ) is not necessary
to . . . this type of responsive and customized service."
Brief for Petitioners 34. The Government argues that advertising particular products is useful in a broad market
but is not useful when particular products are designed in
response to an individual's "often unique need[s]." Ibid.
The Government contends that, because of this, advertising
is not typically associated with compounding for particular
individuals. In contrast it is typically associated, the Government claims, with large-scale production of a drug for a
substantial market. The Government argues that advertis535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

371Cite as: 535 U. S. 357 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
ing, therefore, is "a fair proxy for actual or intended large-scale manufacturing," and that Congress' decision to limit

the FDAMA's compounding exemption to pharmacies that donot engage in promotional activity was "rationally calculated" to avoid creating " `a loophole that would allow un-regulated drug manufacturing to occur under the guise of
pharmacy compounding.' " Id., at 35 (quoting 143 Cong.
Rec. S9839 (Sept. 24, 1997) (statement of Sen. Kennedy)).The Government seems to believe that without advertising

it would not be possible to market a drug on a large enoughscale to make safety and efficacy testing economically feasible. The Government thus believes that conditioning an
exemption from the FDA approval process on refraining
from advertising is an ideal way to permit compounding
and yet also guarantee that compounding is not conducted
on such a scale as to undermine the FDA approval process.
Assuming it is true that drugs cannot be marketed on a
large scale without advertising, the FDAMA's prohibition
on advertising compounded drugs might indeed "directly
advanc[e]" the Government's interests. Central Hudson,
447 U. S., at 566. Even assuming that it does, however, the
Government has failed to demonstrate that the speech restrictions are "not more extensive than is necessary to
serve [those] interest[s]." Ibid. In previous cases addressing this final prong of the Central Hudson test, we have
made clear that if the Government could achieve its interests
in a manner that does not restrict speech, or that restricts
less speech, the Government must do so. In Rubin v. Coors
Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476 (1995), for example, we found a
law prohibiting beer labels from displaying alcohol content
to be unconstitutional in part because of the availability
of alternatives "such as directly limiting the alcohol content of beers, prohibiting marketing efforts emphasizing high
alcohol strength . . . , or limiting the labeling ban only to
malt liquors." Id., at 490-491. The fact that "all of [these
alternatives] could advance the Government's asserted inter535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
372 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Opinion of the Court
est in a manner less intrusive to . . . First Amendmentrights" indicated that the law was "more extensive than necessary." Id., at 491. See also 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode
Island, 517 U. S., at 507 (plurality opinion) (striking down a
prohibition on advertising the price of alcoholic beveragesin part because "alternative forms of regulation that would

not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely
to achieve the State's goal of promoting temperance").Several non-speech-related means of drawing a line between compounding and large-scale manufacturing mightbe possible here. First, it seems that the Government could
use the very factors the FDA relied on to distinguish compounding from manufacturing in its 1992 Guide. For example, the Government could ban the use of "commercial scale
manufacturing or testing equipment for compounding drug
products." Guide, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a. It could prohibit pharmacists from compounding more drugs in anticipation of receiving prescriptions than in response to prescriptions already received. See ibid. It could prohibit
pharmacists from "[o]ffering compounded drug products at
wholesale to other state licensed persons or commercial entities for resale." Id., at 77a. Alternately, it could limit the
amount of compounded drugs, either by volume or by numbers of prescriptions, that a given pharmacist or pharmacy
sells out of state. See ibid. Another possibility not suggested by the Guide would be capping the amount of any
particular compounded drug, either by drug volume, number
of prescriptions, gross revenue, or profit that a pharmacist
or pharmacy may make or sell in a given period of time. It
might even be sufficient to rely solely on the non-speechrelated provisions of the FDAMA, such as the requirement
that compounding only be conducted in response to a prescription or a history of receiving a prescription, 21 U. S. C.

$ 353a(a), and the limitation on the percentage of a pharmacy's total sales that out-of-state sales of compounded drugs
may represent, $ 353a(b)(3)(B).

Opinion of the Court
The Government has not offered any reason why thesepossibilities, alone or in combination, would be insufficient

to prevent compounding from occurring on such a scaleas to undermine the new drug approval process. Indeed,
there is no hint that the Government even considered theseor any other alternatives. Nowhere in the legislative history of the FDAMA or petitioners' briefs is there any explanation of why the Government believed forbidding ad-vertising was a necessary as opposed to merely convenient

means of achieving its interests. Yet "[i]t is well establishedthat `the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial
speech carries the burden of justifying it.' " Edenfield v.
Fane, 507 U. S., at 770 (quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 71, n. 20 (1983)). The Government
simply has not provided sufficient justification here. If the
First Amendment means anything, it means that regulating
speech must be a last--not first--resort. Yet here it seems
to have been the first strategy the Government thought
to try.

The dissent describes another governmental interest--an
interest in prohibiting the sale of compounded drugs to
"patients who may not clearly need them," post, at 379 (opinion of Breyer, J.)--and argues that "Congress could . . .
conclude that the advertising restrictions `directly advance' "
that interest, post, at 384. Nowhere in its briefs, however,
does the Government argue that this interest motivated
the advertising ban. Although, for the reasons given by the
dissent, Congress conceivably could have enacted the advertising ban to advance this interest, we have generally only
sustained statutes on the basis of hypothesized justifications
when reviewing statutes merely to determine whether they
are rational. See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law
1444-1446 (2d ed. 1988) (describing the "rational basis" or
"conceivable basis" test); see also, e. g., Minnesota v. Clover
Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 466 (1981) (sustaining a
milk packaging regulation under the "rational basis" test

535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
374 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Opinion of the Court
because "the Minnesota Legislature could rationally havedecided that [the regulation] might foster greater use of environmentally desirable alternatives" (emphasis deleted)).The

Central Hudson test is significantly stricter than the
rational basis test, however, requiring the Government notonly to identify specifically "a substantial interest to be

achieved by [the] restrictio[n] on commercial speech," 447
U. S., at 564, but also to prove that the regulation "directlyadvances" that interest and is "not more extensive than is

necessary to serve that interest," id., at 566. The Govern-ment has not met any of these requirements with regard to
the interest the dissent describes.

Even if the Government had argued that the FDAMA's
speech-related restrictions were motivated by a fear that

advertising compounded drugs would put people who do
not need such drugs at risk by causing them to convince
their doctors to prescribe the drugs anyway, that fear would
fail to justify the restrictions. Aside from the fact that this
concern rests on the questionable assumption that doctors
would prescribe unnecessary medications (an assumption the
dissent is willing to make based on one magazine article and
one survey, post, at 383-384, neither of which was relied
upon by the Government), this concern amounts to a fear
that people would make bad decisions if given truthful

information about compounded drugs. See supra, at 368
(explaining that the Government does not claim the advertisements forbidden by the FDAMA would be false or misleading). We have previously rejected the notion that the
Government has an interest in preventing the dissemination
of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information. In Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, the State feared that
if people received price advertising from pharmacists, they
would "choose the low-cost, low-quality service and drive the
`professional' pharmacist out of business" and would "destroy
the pharmacist-customer relationship" by going from one

Opinion of the Court
pharmacist to another. We found these fears insufficient tojustify a ban on such advertising. 425 U. S., at 769. We

explained:

"There is, of course, an alternative to this highly paternalistic approach. That alternative is to assume thatthis information is not in itself harmful, that people will

perceive their own best interests if only they are wellenough informed, and that the best means to that end is
to open the channels of communication rather than toclose them. . . . But the choice among these alternative
approaches is not ours to make or the Virginia GeneralAssembly's. It is precisely this kind of choice, between
the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers
of its misuse if it is freely available, that the FirstAmendment makes for us. Virginia is free to require

whatever professional standards it wishes of its pharma-cists; it may subsidize them or protect them from competition in other ways. . . . But it may not do so by keepingthe public in ignorance of the entirely lawful terms that
competing pharmacists are offering." Id., at 770 (cita-tion omitted).

See also 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S., at503 ("[B]ans against truthful, nonmisleading commercial
speech . . . usually rest solely on the offensive assumptionthat the public will respond `irrationally' to the truth. . . .
The First Amendment directs us to be especially skepticalof regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what
the government perceives to be their own good" (citationomitted)).

Even if the Government had asserted an interest in preventing people who do not need compounded drugs from
obtaining those drugs, the statute does not directly advance that interest. The dissent claims that the Government "must exclude from the area of permitted drug sales . . .
those compounded drugs sought by patients who may not

Opinion of the Court
clearly need them." Post, at 379. Yet the statute does notdirectly forbid such sales. It instead restricts advertising,

of course not just to those who do not need compoundeddrugs, but also to individuals who do need compounded
drugs and their doctors. Although the advertising banmay reduce the demand for compounded drugs from those
who do not need the drugs, it does nothing to prevent such
individuals from obtaining compounded drugs other thanrequiring prescriptions. But if it is appropriate for the

statute to rely on doctors to refrain from prescribing com-pounded drugs to patients who do not need them, it is not
clear why it would not also be appropriate to rely on doctors
to refrain from prescribing compounded drugs to patients
who do not need them in a world where advertising was
permitted.

The dissent may also be suggesting that the Government
has an interest in banning the advertising of compounded
drugs because patients who see such advertisements will be
confused about the drugs' risks. See post, at 387 ("[The
Government] fears the systematic effect . . . of advertisements that will not fully explain the complicated risks at
issue"). This argument is precluded, however, by the fact
that the Government does not argue that the advertisements
are misleading. Even if the Government did argue that it
had an interest in preventing misleading advertisements,
this interest could be satisfied by the far less restrictive alternative of requiring each compounded drug to be labeled
with a warning that the drug had not undergone FDA testing and that its risks were unknown.

If the Government's failure to justify its decision to
regulate speech were not enough to convince us that the
FDAMA's advertising provisions were unconstitutional, the
amount of beneficial speech prohibited by the FDAMA would
be. Forbidding the advertisement of compounded drugs
would affect pharmacists other than those interested in producing drugs on a large scale. It would prevent pharmacists

Thomas, J., concurring
with no interest in mass-producing medications, but who
serve clienteles with special medical needs, from telling the
doctors treating those clients about the alternative drugs
available through compounding. For example, a pharmacist
serving a children's hospital where many patients are unable to swallow pills would be prevented from telling the
children's doctors about a new development in compounding
that allowed a drug that was previously available only in pill
form to be administered another way. Forbidding advertising of particular compounded drugs would also prohibit a
pharmacist from posting a notice informing customers that
if their children refuse to take medications because of the
taste, the pharmacist could change the flavor, and giving examples of medications where flavoring is possible. The fact
that the FDAMA would prohibit such seemingly useful
speech even though doing so does not appear to directly further any asserted governmental objective confirms our belief
that the prohibition is unconstitutional.

Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment
that the speech-related provisions of FDAMA $ 127(a) are
unconstitutional.

So ordered.

I concur because I agree with the Court's application of

378 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Breyer, J., dissenting
Justice Breyer, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Federal law requires strict safety and efficacy testing ofall "new" prescription "drugs." 21 U. S. C. $ 355. See 21

CFR $ 310.3(h) (2002) (defining "new drug" broadly). Thistesting process requires for every "new drug" a preclinical
investigation and three separate clinical tests, includingsmall, controlled studies of healthy and diseased humans as
well as scientific double-blind studies designed to identifyany possible health risk or side effect associated with the
new drug. Practical Guide to Food and Drug Law and Reg-ulation 95-102 (K. Pin

~ a & W. Pines eds. 1998). The objec-tive of this elaborate and time-consuming regulatory regime

is to identify those health risks--both large and small--thata doctor or pharmacist might not otherwise notice.

At the same time, the law exempts from its testingrequirements prescription drugs produced through "compounding"--a process "by which a pharmacist or doctor com-bines, mixes, or alters ingredients to create a medication
tailored to the needs of an individual patient." Ante, at360-361. The exemption is available, however, only if the
pharmacist meets certain specified conditions, including

the condition that the pharmacist not "advertise or promotethe compounding of any

particular drug." 21 U. S. C.

$ 353a(c) (emphasis added).The Court holds that this condition restricts "commercial

speech" in violation of the First Amendment. See Central
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.,
447 U. S. 557, 564 (1980). It concedes that the statutory pro-vision tries to "[p]reserv[e] the effectiveness and integrity of

the . . . new drug approval process," ante, at 369, and itassumes without deciding that the statute might " `directly
advance' " that interest, ante, at 371. It nonetheless findsthe statute unconstitutional because it could advance that
interest in other, less restrictive ways. Ante, at 372-373.
I disagree with this conclusion, and I believe that the Court

Breyer, J., dissenting
seriously undervalues the importance of the Government'sinterest in protecting the health and safety of the American public. I

In my view, the advertising restriction "directly advances"the statute's important safety objective. That objective, as
the Court concedes, is to confine the sale of untested, com-pounded, drugs to where they are medically needed. But to
do so the statute must exclude from the area of permitteddrug sales both (1) those drugs that traditional drug manufacturers might supply after testing--typically drugs capa-ble of being produced in large amounts,

and (2) thosecompounded drugs sought by patients who may not clearly

need them--including compounded drugs produced in smallamounts.

The majority's discussion focuses upon the first exclusion-ary need, but it virtually ignores the second. It describes
the statute's objective simply as drawing a "line" that will"distinguish compounded drugs produced on such a small
scale that they could not undergo safety and efficacy testingfrom drugs produced and sold on a large enough scale that
they could undergo such testing and therefore must do so."Ante, at 370 (emphasis added). This description overlooks
the need for a second line--a line that will distinguish(1) sales of compounded drugs to those who clearly need
them from (2) sales of compounded drugs to those for whoma specially tailored but untested drug is a convenience but
not a medical necessity. That is to say, the statute, in seek-ing to confine distribution of untested tailored drugs, must
look both at the amount supplied (to help decide whetherordinary manufacturers might provide a tested alternative)
and at the nature of demand (to help separate genuine needfrom simple convenience). Cf. 143 Cong. Rec. S9840 (Sept.
24, 1997) (remarks of Sen. Kennedy) (understanding that"some of the conditions are intended to ensure that the volume of compounding does not approach that ordinarily asso535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
ciated with drug manufacturing" while others are "intendedto ensure that the compounded drugs that qualify for the

exemption have appropriate assurances of quality and safetysince [they] would not be subject to the more comprehensive
regulatory requirements that apply to manufactured drugproducts").

This second intermediate objective is logically related
to Congress' primary end--the minimizing of safety risks.The statute's basic exemption from testing requirements

inherently creates risks simply by placing untested drugsin the hands of the consumer. Where an individual has a
specific medical need for a specially tailored drug those risks
are likely offset. But where an untested drug is a convenience, not a necessity, that offset is unlikely to be present.

That presumably is why neither the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor Congress anywhere suggests that all
that matters is the total amount of a particular drug's sales.
That is why the statute's history suggests that the amount
supplied is not the whole story. See S. Rep. No. 105-43,
p. 67 (1997) (statute seeks to assure "continued availability of
compounded drug products as a component of individualized
therapy, . . . while . . . prevent[ing] small-scale manufacturing under the guise of compounding" (emphasis added));
accord, H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-399, p. 94 (1997). That is
why the statute itself, as well as the FDA policy that the
statute reflects, lists several distinguishing factors, of which
advertising is one. See FDA Compliance Policy Guide
7132.16, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a-77a (hereinafter Compliance Policy Guide). And that is likely why,
when faced with the possibility of severing the advertising
restriction from the rest of the statute, the Government argued that the "other conditions in section 353a alone are inadequate to achieve Congress's desired balance among competing interests." See Brief for Appellants in No. 99-17424
(CA9), p. 57. See also id., at 55 (to nullify advertising restrictions would undermine " `finely tuned balance' " achieved

by requiring that "pharmacies refrain from promoting andsoliciting prescriptions for particular compounded drug products until they have been proven safe and effective").Ensuring that the risks associated with compounded drug
prescriptions are offset by the benefits is also why publichealth authorities, testifying in Congress, insisted that the
doctor's prescription represent an individualized determination of need. See, e. g., FDA Reform Legislation: Hear-ings before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Commerce, 104th Cong.,2d Sess., 120 (1996) (hereinafter FDA Reform Legislation)
(statement of Mary K. Pendergast, Deputy Commissioner of
the FDA and Senior Advisor to the Commissioner) (Allowing
traditional compounding is "good medicine" because "an individual physician" was making "an individualized determination for a patient"). See also National Association of Boards
of Pharmacy, Model State Pharmacy Act and Rules, Art. I,

$ 1.05(e) (1996) (hereinafter NABP Model Act) (defining
"[c]ompounding" as involving a prescription "based on the
Practitioner/patient/Pharmacist relationship in the course of
professional practice").

And that, in part, is why federal and state authorities have
long permitted pharmacists to advertise the fact that they
compound drugs, while forbidding the advertisement of individual compounds. See Compliance Policy Guide 76a; Good
Compounding Practices Applicable to State Licensed Pharmacies, NABP Model Act, App. C.2, subpart A (forbidding
pharmacists to "solicit business (e. g., promote, advertise,
or use salespersons) to compound specific drug products").

used by the NABP and at least 13 States reflect similar distinctions. NABP Model Act, Art. I, $$ 105(e), (t), and (u)

These policies and statutory provisions reflect the view
that individualized consideration is more likely present,
and convenience alone is more likely absent, when demand
for a compounding prescription originates with a doctor,
not an advertisement. The restrictions try to assure that
demand is generated doctor-to-patient-to-pharmacist, not
pharmacist-to-advertisement-to-patient-to-doctor. And they
do so in order to diminish the likelihood that those who do
not genuinely need untested compounded drugs will not receive them.

There is considerable evidence that the relevant means--
the advertising restrictions--directly advance this statutory objective. No one denies that the FDA's complex testing system for new drugs--a system that typically relies
upon double-blind or other scientific studies--is more likely
to find, and to assess, small safety risks than are physicians
or pharmacists relying upon impressions and anecdotes.
See supra, at 378.

Nor can anyone deny that compounded drugs carry with
them special risks. After all, compounding is not necessarily a matter of changing a drug's flavor, cf. ante, at 377,
but rather it is a matter of combining different ingredients
in new, untested ways, say, adding a pain medication to an
antihistamine to counteract allergies or increasing the ratio
of approved ingredients in a salve to help the body absorb it

at a faster rate. And the risks associated with the untestedcombination of ingredients or the quicker absorption rate or

the working conditions necessary to change an old drug intoits new form can, for some patients, mean infection, serious
side effects, or even death. See, e. g., J. Thompson, A Practi-cal Guide to Contemporary Pharmacy Practice 11.5 (1998)
(hereinafter Contemporary Pharmacy Practice). Cf. 21
CFR $ 310.3(h)(1) (2002) (considering a drug to be "new" andsubject to the approval process if the "substance which composes such drug" is new); $ 310.3(h)(3) (considering a drug tobe "new" and subject to the approval process if approved
ingredients are combined in new proportions).

There is considerable evidence that consumer oriented advertising will create strong consumer-driven demand for a
particular drug. See, e. g., National Institute for Health
Care Management, Factors Affecting the Growth of Prescription Drug Expenditures iii (July 9, 1999) (three antihistamine manufacturers spent $313 million on advertising
in 1998 and accounted for 90% of prescription drug antihistamine market); Kritz, Ask Your Doctor About . . . Which
of the Many Advertised Allergy Drugs Are Right for You?
Washington Post, June 6, 2000, Health, p. 9 (The manufacturer of the world's top selling allergy drug, the eighth
best-selling drug in the United States, spent almost $140
million in 1999 on advertising); 1999 Prevention Magazine 10
(spending on direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription
medicine increased from $965.2 million in 1997 to $1.33 billion
in 1998).

And there is strong evidence that doctors will often respond affirmatively to a patient's request for a specific drug
that the patient has seen advertised. See id., at 32 (84%
of consumers polled report that doctors accommodate their
request for a specific drug); Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Understanding the Effects of Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising 3 (Nov. 2001) (A foundation survey found that more than one in eight Americans had asked

Breyer, J., dissenting
for--and received--a specific prescription from their doctorin response to an advertisement).

In these circumstances, Congress could reasonably con-clude that doctors will respond affirmatively to a patient's
request for a compounded drug even if the doctor would notnormally prescribe it. When a parent learns that a child's
pill can be administered in liquid form, when a patient learns
that a compounded skin cream has an enhanced penetrationrate, or when an allergy sufferer learns that a compounded

antiinflammatory/allergy medication can alleviate a sinusheadache without the sedative effects of antihistamines, that
parent or patient may well ask for the desired prescription.
And the doctor may well write the prescription even in the
absence of special need--at least if any risk likely to arise
from lack of testing is so small that only scientific testing,
not anecdote or experience, would reveal it. It is consequently not surprising that 71% of the active members of
the American Academy of Family Physicians "believe that
direct-to-consumer advertising pressures physicians into
prescribing drugs that they would not ordinarily prescribe."
Rosenthal, Berndt, Donohue, Frank, & Epstein, Promotion
of Prescription Drugs to Consumers, 346 New Eng. J. Med.
498-505 (2002) (citing Lipsky, The Opinions and Experiences
of Family Physicians Regarding Direct-To-Consumer Advertising, 45 J. Fam. Pract. 495-499 (1997)).

Of course, the added risks in any such individual case may
be small. But those individual risks added together can
significantly affect the public health. At least, the FDA and
Congress could reasonably reach that conclusion. And that
fact, along with the absence of any significant evidence that
the advertising restrictions have prevented doctors from
learning about, or obtaining, compounded drugs, means that
the FDA and Congress could also conclude that the advertising restrictions "directly advance" the statute's safety goal.
They help to assure that demand for an untested compounded drug originates with the doctor, responding to an

Breyer, J., dissenting
individual's special medical needs; they thereby help to restrict the untested drug's distribution to those most likely to
need it; and they thereby advance the statute's safety goals.
There is no reason for this Court, as a matter of constitutional law, to reach a different conclusion.

II
I do not believe that Congress could have achieved its
safety objectives in significantly less restrictive ways. Consider the several alternatives the Court suggests. First, it
says that "the Government could ban the use of `commercial
scale manufacturing or testing equipment for compounding
drug products.' " Ante, at 372. This alternative simply
restricts compounding to drugs produced in small batches.
It would neither limit the total quantity of compounded
drugs produced, nor help in any way to assure the kind of
individualized doctor-patient need determination that the
statute's advertising restriction are designed to help achieve.

Second, the Court says that the Government "could prohibit pharmacists from compounding more drugs in anticipation of receiving prescriptions than in response to prescriptions already received." Ibid. This alternative, while
addressing the issue of quantity, does virtually nothing to
promote the second, need-related statutory objective.

Third, the Court says the Government "could prohibit
pharmacists from `[o]ffering compounded drug products at
wholesale to other state licensed persons or commercial
entities for resale." Ibid. This alternative is open to the
same objection.

Fourth, the Court says the Government "could limit the
amount of compounded drugs, either by volume or by numbers of prescriptions, that a given pharmacist or pharmacy
sells out of state." Ibid. This alternative, applying only
to out-of-state sales, would not significantly restrict sales,
either in respect to amounts or in respect to patient need.

535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
386 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Breyer, J., dissenting
In fact, it could prevent compounded drugs from reachingout-of-state patients who genuinely need them.

Fifth, the Court says that the Government could "ca[p] theamount of any particular compounded drug, either by drug
volume, number of prescriptions, gross revenue, or profit."Ibid. This alternative, like the others, ignores the patientneed problem, while simultaneously threatening to preventcompounded drugs from reaching those who genuinely need
them, say, a patient whose prescription represents one be-yond the arbitrarily imposed quantitative limit.

Sixth, the Court says that the Government could relyupon "non-speech-related provisions of the FDAMA, such
as the requirement that compounding only be conducted inresponse to a prescription."

Ibid. This alternative alsoignores the patient-need problem and was specifically rejected by the Government in the Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit. See supra, at 380-381.

The Court adds that "[t]he Government has not offeredany reason why these possibilities, alone or in combination,
would be insufficient." Ante, at 373. The Government'sfailure to do so may reflect the fact that only the Court,
not any of the respondents, has here suggested that these"alternatives," alone or in combination, would prove sufficient. In fact, the FDA's Compliance Policy Guide, fromwhich the Court draws its first four alternatives, specifically warned that these alternatives alone were insuffi-cient to successfully distinguish traditional compounding
from unacceptable manufacturing. See Compliance PolicyGuide 77a.

III
The Court responds to the claim that advertising com-pounded drugs causes people to obtain drugs that do not

promote their health, by finding it implausible given theneed for a prescription and by suggesting that it is not relevant. The First Amendment, it says, does not permit theGovernment to control the content of advertising, where

535US2 Unit: $U41 [09-24-03 18:37:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

387Cite as: 535 U. S. 357 (2002)
Breyer, J., dissenting
doing so flows from "fear" that "people would make baddecisions if given truthful information about compounded

drugs." Ante, at 374. This response, however, does notfully explain the Government's regulatory rationale; it fails
to take account of considerations that make the claim morethan plausible (if properly stated); and it is inconsistent with
this Court's interpretation of the Constitution.

It is an oversimplification to say that the Government"fear[s]" that doctors or patients "would make bad decisions if given truthful information." Ibid. Rather, theGovernment fears the safety consequences of multiple
compound-drug prescription decisions initiated not by doctors but by pharmacist-to-patient advertising. Those consequences flow from the adverse cumulative effects of multiple individual decisions each of which may seem perfectly
reasonable considered on its own. The Government fears
that, taken together, these apparently rational individual decisions will undermine the safety testing system, thereby
producing overall a net balance of harm. See, e. g., FDA
Reform Legislation 121 (statement of David A. Kessler,
Commissioner of the FDA) (voicing concerns about "quality
controls" and the integrity of the drug-testing system).
Consequently, the Government leaves pharmacists free to
explain through advertisements what compounding is, to advertise that they engage in compounding, and to advise patients to discuss the matter with their physicians. And it
forbids advertising the specific drug in question, not because
it fears the "information" the advertisement provides, but
because it fears the systematic effect, insofar as advertisements solicit business, of advertisements that will not fully
explain the complicated risks at issue. And this latter fear
is more than plausible. See Part I, supra.

I do not deny that the statute restricts the circulation of
some truthful information. It prevents a pharmacist from
including in an advertisement the information that "this
pharmacy will compound Drug X." Nonetheless, this Court

388 THOMPSON v. WESTERN STATES MEDICAL CENTER

Breyer, J., dissenting
has not previously held that commercial advertising restric-tions automatically violate the First Amendment. Rather,

the Court has applied a more flexible test. It has examinedthe restriction's proportionality, the relation between restriction and objective, the fit between ends and means. Indoing so, the Court has asked whether the regulation of commercial speech "directly advances" a "substantial" governmental objective and whether it is "more extensive than isnecessary" to achieve those ends. See

Central Hudson, 447
U. S., at 566. It has done so because it has concluded that,from a constitutional perspective, commercial speech does

not warrant application of the Court's strictest speechprotective tests. And it has reached this conclusion in part
because restrictions on commercial speech do not often repress individual self-expression; they rarely interfere with
the functioning of democratic political processes; and they
often reflect a democratically determined governmental decision to regulate a commercial venture in order to protect,
for example, the consumer, the public health, individual
safety, or the environment. See, e. g., 44 Liquormart, Inc.
v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 499 (1996) ("[T]he State's
power to regulate commercial transactions justifies its concomitant power to regulate commercial speech that is `linked
inextricably' to those transactions"); L. Tribe, American
Constitutional Law $ 12-15, p. 903 (2d ed. 1988) ("[C]ommercial speech doctrine" seeks to accommodate "the right to
speak and hear expression about goods and services" with
"the right of government to regulate the sales of such goods
and services" (emphasis in original)).

I have explained why I believe the statute satisfies this
more flexible test. See Parts I and II, supra. The Court,
in my view, gives insufficient weight to the Government's
regulatory rationale, and too readily assumes the existence
of practical alternatives. It thereby applies the commercial
speech doctrine too strictly. Cf. Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs'
Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 349 (2001) (flexibility necessary

if FDA is to "pursu[e] difficult (and often competing) objec-tives"). See also Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U. S. 173, 188-189 (1979) (Blackmun, J., con-curring) (warning against overly demanding search for less
restrictive alternatives).In my view, the Constitution demands a more lenient
application, an application that reflects the need for dis-tinctions among contexts, forms of regulation, and forms
of speech, and which, in particular, clearly distinguishesbetween "commercial speech" and other forms of speech
demanding stricter constitutional protection. Otherwise, anoverly rigid "commercial speech" doctrine will transform
what ought to be a legislative or regulatory decision aboutthe best way to protect the health and safety of the American public into a constitutional decision prohibiting the legis-lature from enacting necessary protections. As history in
respect to the Due Process Clause shows, any such trans-formation would involve a tragic constitutional misunderstanding. See id., at 189 (Blackmun, J., concurring).

IV
Finally, the majority would hold the statute unconsti-tutional because it prohibits pharmacists from advertising

compounded drugs to doctors. Ante, at 376-377. Doctors,however, obtain information about individual drugs through
many other channels. And there is no indication that re-strictions on commercial advertising have had any negative
effect on the flow of this information. See e. g., Contem-porary Pharmacy Practice 11.4 (compounded drug information "available" and "widely disseminated" through books,journals, monographs, and vendors). Nor, with one exception, have doctors or groups of doctors complained that thestatute will interfere with that flow of information in the
future. But see Brief for Julian M. Whitaker, M.D., et al.as

get "competitively priced compounded drugs as efficientlyas possble").

Regardless, we here consider a facial attack on the statute.The respondents here focus their attack almost entirely
upon consumer-directed advertising. They have not fullyaddressed separate questions involving the effect of advertising restrictions on information received by physicians.I would consequently leave these questions in abeyance.
Considering the statute only insofar as it applies to advertis-ing directed at consumers, I would hold it constitutional.

For these reasons, I dissent.

US AIRWAYS, INC. v. BARNETT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-1250. Argued December 4, 2001--Decided April 29, 2002
After respondent Barnett injured his back while a cargo handler for petitioner US Airways, Inc., he transferred to a less physically demanding
mailroom position. His new position later became open to senioritybased employee bidding under US Airways' seniority system, and employees senior to him planned to bid on the job. US Airways refused
his request to accommodate his disability by allowing him to remain in
the mailroom, and he lost his job. He then filed suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act), which prohibits an
employer from discriminating against "an individual with a disability"
who with "reasonable accommodation" can perform a job's essential
functions, 42 U. S. C. $$ 12112(a) and (b), unless the employer "can
demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of [its] business," $ 12112(b)(5)(A). Finding that
altering a seniority system would result in an "undue hardship" to
both US Airways and its nondisabled employees, the District Court
granted the company summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit reversed,
holding that the seniority system was merely a factor in the undue hardship analysis and that a case-by-case, fact intensive analysis is required
to determine whether any particular assignment would constitute an
undue hardship.

Held: An employer's showing that a requested accommodation conflicts

with seniority rules is ordinarily sufficient to show, as a matter of law,
that an "accommodation" is not "reasonable." However, the employee
remains free to present evidence of special circumstances that makes a
seniority rule exception reasonable in the particular case. Pp. 396-406.

(a) Many lower courts have reconciled the phrases "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship" in a practical way, holding that a
plaintiff/employee (to defeat a defendant/employer's summary judgment
motion) need only show that an "accommodation" seems reasonable on
its face, i. e., ordinarily or in the run of cases. The defendant/employer
then must show special (typically case-specific) circumstances demonstrating undue hardship in the particular circumstances. Neither US
Airways' position--that no accommodation violating a seniority system's
rules is reasonable--nor Barnett's position--that "reasonable accommodation" authorizes a court to consider only the requested accom535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
modation's ability to meet an individual's disability-related needs--is a
proper interpretation of the Act. Pp. 396-402.

(b) Here, the question is whether a proposed accommodation that
would normally be reasonable is rendered unreasonable because the
assignment would violate a seniority system's rules. Ordinarily the answer is "yes." The statute does not require proof on a case-by-case
basis that a seniority system should prevail because it would not be
reasonable in the run of cases that the assignment trump such a system's rules. Analogous case law has recognized the importance of seniority to employee-management relations, finding, e. g., that collectively
bargained seniority trumps the need for reasonable accommodation in
the linguistically similar Rehabilitation Act, see, e. g., Eckles v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 94 F. 3d 1041, 1047-1048. And the relevant seniority
system advantages, and related difficulties resulting from violations
of seniority rules, are not limited to collectively bargained systems, but
also apply to many systems (like the one at issue) unilaterally imposed
by management. A typical seniority system provides important employee benefits by creating, and fulfilling, employee expectations of fair,
uniform treatment--e. g., job security and an opportunity for steady and
predictable advancement based on objective standards--that might be
undermined if an employer were required to show more than the system's existence. Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to undermine seniority systems in such a way. Pp. 402-405.

(c) The plaintiff (here the employee) remains free to show that special
circumstances warrant a finding that, despite the seniority system's
presence, the requested accommodation is reasonable on the particular
facts. Special circumstances might alter the important expectations
created by a seniority system. The plaintiff might show, for example,
that the employer, having retained the right to change the system
unilaterally, exercises the right fairly frequently, reducing employee
expectations that the system will be followed--to the point where the
requested accommodation will not likely make a difference. The plaintiff might also show that the system already contains exceptions such
that, in the circumstances, one further exception is unlikely to matter.
The plaintiff has the burden of showing special circumstances and must
explain why, in the particular case, an exception to the seniority system
can constitute a reasonable accommodation even though in the ordinary
case it cannot. Pp. 405-406.

(d) The lower courts took a different view of this matter, and neither
party has had an opportunity to seek summary judgment in accordance
with the principles set forth here. P. 406.

228 F. 3d 1105, vacated and remanded.

ployer's seniority system. In such a case, does the accom-modation demand trump the seniority system?

In our view, the seniority system will prevail in the runof cases. As we interpret the statute, to show that a requested accommodation conflicts with the rules of a senior-ity system is ordinarily to show that the accommodation
is not "reasonable." Hence such a showing will entitle anemployer/defendant to summary judgment on the question--
unless there is more. The plaintiff remains free to presentevidence of special circumstances that make "reasonable" a
seniority rule exception in the particular case. And sucha showing will defeat the employer's demand for summary
judgment. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e).

I
In 1990, Robert Barnett, the plaintiff and respondent here,injured his back while working in a cargo-handling position

at petitioner US Airways, Inc. He invoked seniority rightsand transferred to a less physically demanding mailroom
position. Under US Airways' seniority system, that posi-tion, like others, periodically became open to senioritybased employee bidding. In 1992, Barnett learned that atleast two employees senior to him intended to bid for the
mailroom job. He asked US Airways to accommodate hisdisability-imposed limitations by making an exception that
would allow him to remain in the mailroom. After per-mitting Barnett to continue his mailroom work for five
months while it considered the matter, US Airways eventu-ally decided not to make an exception. And Barnett lost
his job.Barnett then brought this ADA suit claiming, among
other things, that he was an "individual with a disability"capable of performing the essential functions of the mailroom job, that the mailroom job amounted to a "reasonableaccommodation" of his disability, and that US Airways, in
refusing to assign him the job, unlawfully discriminated

against him. US Airways moved for summary judgment.It supported its motion with appropriate affidavits, Fed.

Rule Civ. Proc. 56, contending that its "well-established"seniority system granted other employees the right to obtain
the mailroom position.The District Court found that the undisputed facts about
seniority warranted summary judgment in US Airways'favor. The Act says that an employer who fails to make
"reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mentallimitations of an [employee] with a disability" discriminates
"unless" the employer "can demonstrate that the accom-modation would impose an

undue hardship on the opera-tion of [its] business." 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis

added). The court said:

"[T]he uncontroverted evidence shows that the USAirseniority system has been in place for `decades' and governs over 14,000 USAir Agents. Moreover, senioritypolicies such as the one at issue in this case are common
to the airline industry. Given this context, it seemsclear that the USAir employees were justified in relying
upon the policy. As such, any significant alteration ofthat policy would result in undue hardship to both the
company and its non-disabled employees." App. to Pet.for Cert. 96a.

An en banc panel of the United States Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit reversed. It said that the presence of
a seniority system is merely "a factor in the undue hardshipanalysis." 228 F. 3d 1105, 1120 (2000). And it held that
"[a] case-by-case fact intensive analysis is required to deter-mine whether any particular reassignment would constitute

whether

Opinion of the Court
even though another employee is entitled to hold theposition under the employer's bona fide and established

seniority system." Brief for Petitioner i.
The Circuits have reached different conclusions about thelegal significance of a seniority system. Compare 228 F. 3d,

at 1120, with EEOC v. Sara Lee Corp., 237 F. 3d 349, 354(CA4 2001). We agreed to answer US Airways' question.

II
In answering the question presented, we must considerthe following statutory provisions. First, the ADA says

that an employer may not "discriminate against a qualifiedindividual with a disability." 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a). Second, the ADA says that a "qualified" individual includes"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of "the relevant "employment position." $ 12111(8) (emphasis
added). Third, the ADA says that "discrimination" includesan employer's "not making reasonable accommodations to
the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwisequalified . . . employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hard-ship on the operation of [its] business." $ 12112(b)(5)(A)
(emphasis added). Fourth, the ADA says that the term" `reasonable accommodation' may include . . . reassignment
to a vacant position." $ 12111(9)(B).The parties interpret this statutory language as applied to
seniority systems in radically different ways. In US Air-ways' view, the fact that an accommodation would violate the
rules of a seniority system always shows that the accommo-dation is not a "reasonable" one. In Barnett's polar opposite
view, a seniority system violation never shows that an ac-commodation sought is not a "reasonable" one. Barnett concedes that a violation of seniority rules might help to showthat the accommodation will work "undue" employer "hardship," but that is a matter for an employer to demonstrate

Opinion of the Court
case by case. We shall initially consider the parties' mainlegal arguments in support of these conflicting positions.

A
US Airways' claim that a seniority system virtuallyalways trumps a conflicting accommodation demand rests

primarily upon its view of how the Act treats workplace"preferences." Insofar as a requested accommodation violates a disability-neutral workplace rule, such as a seniorityrule, it grants the employee with a disability treatment that
other workers could not receive. Yet the Act, US Airwayssays, seeks only "equal" treatment for those with disabilities.
See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(9). It does not, it contends,require an employer to grant preferential treatment.
Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 66 (1990); S. Rep.No. 101-116, pp. 26-27 (1989) (employer has no "obligation
to prefer applicants with disabilities over other applicants"(emphasis added)). Hence it does not require the employer
to grant a request that, in violating a disability-neutral rule,would provide a preference.

While linguistically logical, this argument fails to recog-nize what the Act specifies, namely, that preferences will
sometimes prove necessary to achieve the Act's basic equalopportunity goal. The Act requires preferences in the form
of "reasonable accommodations" that are needed for thosewith disabilities to obtain the same workplace opportunities that those without disabilities automatically enjoy. Bydefinition any special "accommodation" requires the employer to treat an employee with a disability differently,i. e., preferentially. And the fact that the difference in
treatment violates an employer's disability-neutral rulecannot by itself place the accommodation beyond the Act's
potential reach.Were that not so, the "reasonable accommodation" provision could not accomplish its intended objective. Neutraloffice assignment rules would automatically prevent the ac535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
commodation of an employee whose disability-imposed limi-tations require him to work on the ground floor. Neutral

"break-from-work" rules would automatically prevent theaccommodation of an individual who needs additional breaks
from work, perhaps to permit medical visits. Neutral furni-ture budget rules would automatically prevent the accommodation of an individual who needs a different kind of chair
or desk. Many employers will have neutral rules governingthe kinds of actions most needed to reasonably accommodate

a worker with a disability. See 42 U. S. C. $ 12111(9)(b) (set-ting forth examples such as "job restructuring," "part-time
or modified work schedules," "acquisition or modification of
equipment or devices," "and other similar accommodations").
Yet Congress, while providing such examples, said nothing
suggesting that the presence of such neutral rules would
create an automatic exemption. Nor have the lower courts
made any such suggestion. Cf. Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle
Parenterals, Inc., 212 F. 3d 638, 648 (CA1 2000) (requiring
leave beyond that allowed under the company's own leave
policy); Hendricks-Robinson v. Excel Corp., 154 F. 3d 685,
699 (CA7 1998) (requiring exception to employer's neutral
"physical fitness" job requirement).

In sum, the nature of the "reasonable accommodation" requirement, the statutory examples, and the Act's silence
about the exempting effect of neutral rules together convince us that the Act does not create any such automatic
exemption. The simple fact that an accommodation would
provide a "preference"--in the sense that it would permit
the worker with a disability to violate a rule that others
must obey--cannot, in and of itself, automatically show that
the accommodation is not "reasonable." As a result, we reject the position taken by US Airways and Justice Scalia
to the contrary.

US Airways also points to the ADA provisions stating that
a " `reasonable accommodation' may include . . . reassignment
to a vacant position." $ 12111(9)(B) (emphasis added). And

Opinion of the Court
it claims that the fact that an established seniority systemwould assign that position to another worker automatically

and always means that the position is not a "vacant" one.Nothing in the Act, however, suggests that Congress intended the word "vacant" to have a specialized meaning.And in ordinary English, a seniority system can give employees seniority rights allowing them to bid for a "vacant"position. The position in this case was held, at the time
of suit, by Barnett, not by some other worker; and that posi-tion, under the US Airways seniority system, became an
"open" one. Brief for Petitioner 5. Moreover, US Airwayshas said that it "reserves the right to change any and all"
portions of the seniority system at will. Lodging of Re-spondent 2 (US Air Personnel Policy Guide for Agents).
Consequently, we cannot agree with US Airways about theposition's vacancy; nor do we agree that the Act would automatically deny Barnett's accommodation request for thatreason.

Barnett argues that the statutory words "reasonable ac-commodation" mean only "effective accommodation," authorizing a court to consider the requested accommodation'sability to meet an individual's disability-related needs, and
nothing more. On this view, a seniority rule violation, hav-ing nothing to do with the accommodation's effectiveness,
has nothing to do with its "reasonableness." It might, atmost, help to prove an "undue hardship on the operation of
the business." But, he adds, that is a matter that the stat-ute requires the employer to demonstrate, case by case.

In support of this interpretation Barnett points to EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations
stating that "reasonable accommodation means . . . . [m]odifi-cations or adjustments . . . that

enable a qualified individualwith a disability to perform the essential functions of [a] position." 29 CFR $ 1630(o)(ii) (2001) (emphasis added). Seealso H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 66; S. Rep. No. 101-116,

400 US AIRWAYS, INC. v. BARNETT

Opinion of the Court
at 35 (discussing reasonable accommodations in terms of"effectiveness," while discussing costs in terms of "undue

hardship"). Barnett adds that any other view would makethe words "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship" virtual mirror images--creating redundancy in thestatute. And he says that any such other view would create
a practical burden of proof dilemma.

The practical burden of proof dilemma arises, Barnettargues, because the statute imposes the burden of demonstrating an "undue hardship" upon the employer, while theburden of proving "reasonable accommodation" remains
with the plaintiff, here the employee. This allocation seems
sensible in that an employer can more frequently and easily
prove the presence of business hardship than an employee
can prove its absence. But suppose that an employee
must counter a claim of "seniority rule violation" in order
to prove that an "accommodation" request is "reasonable."
Would that not force the employee to prove what is in effect
an absence, i. e., an absence of hardship, despite the statute's insistence that the employer "demonstrate" hardship's
presence?

These arguments do not persuade us that Barnett's legal
interpretation of "reasonable" is correct. For one thing,
in ordinary English the word "reasonable" does not mean
"effective." It is the word "accommodation," not the word
"reasonable," that conveys the need for effectiveness. An
ineffective "modification" or "adjustment" will not accommodate a disabled individual's limitations. Nor does an ordinary English meaning of the term "reasonable accommodation" make of it a simple, redundant mirror image of the
term "undue hardship." The statute refers to an "undue
hardship on the operation of the business." 42 U. S. C.

$ 12112(b)(5)(A). Yet a demand for an effective accommodation could prove unreasonable because of its impact, not on
business operations, but on fellow employees--say, because
it will lead to dismissals, relocations, or modification of em535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ployee benefits to which an employer, looking at the matterfrom the perspective of the business itself, may be relatively indifferent.Neither does the statute's primary purpose require Barnett's special reading. The statute seeks to diminish or toeliminate the stereotypical thought processes, the thoughtless actions, and the hostile reactions that far too often bar
those with disabilities from participating fully in the Nation'slife, including the workplace. See generally $$ 12101(a)

and (b). These objectives demand unprejudiced thoughtand reasonable responsive reaction on the part of employers
and fellow workers alike. They will sometimes require
affirmative conduct to promote entry of disabled people into
the work force. See supra, at 397-398. They do not, however, demand action beyond the realm of the reasonable.

Neither has Congress indicated in the statute, or elsewhere, that the word "reasonable" means no more than
"effective." The EEOC regulations do say that reasonable
accommodations "enable" a person with a disability to perform the essential functions of a task. But that phrasing
simply emphasizes the statutory provision's basic objective.
The regulations do not say that "enable" and "reasonable"
mean the same thing. And as discussed below, no court of
appeals has so read them. But see 228 F. 3d, at 1122-1123
(Gould, J., concurring).

Finally, an ordinary language interpretation of the word
"reasonable" does not create the "burden of proof " dilemma
to which Barnett points. Many of the lower courts, while
rejecting both US Airways' and Barnett's more absolute
views, have reconciled the phrases "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship" in a practical way.

They have held that a plaintiff/employee (to defeat a
defendant/employer's motion for summary judgment) need
only show that an "accommodation" seems reasonable on its
face, i. e., ordinarily or in the run of cases. See, e. g., Reed
v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F. 3d 254, 259 (CA1 2001)

535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
402 US AIRWAYS, INC. v. BARNETT

Opinion of the Court
(plaintiff meets burden on reasonableness by showing that,"at least on the face of things," the accommodation will be

feasible for the employer); Borkowski v. Valley CentralSchool Dist., 63 F. 3d 131, 138 (CA2 1995) (plaintiff satisfies
"burden of production" by showing "plausible accommoda-tion"); Barth v. Gelb, 2 F. 3d 1180, 1187 (CADC 1993) (interpreting parallel language in Rehabilitation Act, stating thatplaintiff need only show he seeks a "

method of accommo-dation that is reasonable in the run of cases" (emphasis in

original)).Once the plaintiff has made this showing, the defendant/
employer then must show special (typically case-specific)circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances. See Reed, supra, at 258 (" `unduehardship inquiry focuses on the hardships imposed . . . in the
context of the particular [employer's] operations' ") (quotingBarth, supra, at 1187); Borkowski, supra, at 138 (after plaintiff makes initial showing, burden falls on employer to showthat particular accommodation "would cause it to suffer an
undue hardship"); Barth, supra, at 1187 ("undue hardshipinquiry focuses on the hardships imposed . . . in the context
of the particular agency's operations").Not every court has used the same language, but their
results are functionally similar. In our opinion, that practi-cal view of the statute, applied consistently with ordinary
summary judgment principles, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56,avoids Barnett's burden of proof dilemma, while reconciling
the two statutory phrases ("reasonable accommodation" and"undue hardship").

III
The question in the present case focuses on the relation-ship between seniority systems and the plaintiff 's need to

show that an "accommodation" seems reasonable on its face,i. e., ordinarily or in the run of cases. We must assume that
the plaintiff, an employee, is an "individual with a disability."He has requested assignment to a mailroom position as a

535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

403Cite as: 535 U. S. 391 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
"reasonable accommodation." We also assume that nor-mally such a request would be reasonable within the meaning of the statute, were it not for one circumstance, namely,that the assignment would violate the rules of a seniority
system. See $ 12111(9) ("reasonable accommodation" mayinclude "reassignment to a vacant position"). Does that circumstance mean that the proposed accommodation is not a"reasonable" one?

In our view, the answer to this question ordinarily is"yes." The statute does not require proof on a case-by-case
basis that a seniority system should prevail. That is be-cause it would not be reasonable in the run of cases that the
assignment in question trump the rules of a seniority sys-tem. To the contrary, it will ordinarily be unreasonable for
the assignment to prevail. A

Several factors support our conclusion that a proposed ac-commodation will not be reasonable in the run of cases.
Analogous case law supports this conclusion, for it has recog-nized the importance of seniority to employee-management
relations. This Court has held that, in the context of aTitle VII religious discrimination case, an employer need not
adapt to an employee's special worship schedule as a "reason-able accommodation" where doing so would conflict with the
seniority rights of other employees. Trans World Airlines,Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U. S. 63, 79-80 (1977). The lower
courts have unanimously found that collectively bargainedseniority trumps the need for reasonable accommodation in
the context of the linguistically similar Rehabilitation Act.See Eckles v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 94 F. 3d 1041, 1047-
1048 (CA7 1996) (collecting cases); Shea v. Tisch, 870 F. 2d786, 790 (CA1 1989); Carter v. Tisch, 822 F. 2d 465, 469 (CA4
1987); Jasany v. United States Postal Service, 755 F. 2d 1244,1251-1252 (CA6 1985). And several Circuits, though differing in their reasoning, have reached a similar conclusion inthe context of seniority and the ADA. See

Rhode Island, 160 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA1 1998); Eckles, supra,
at 1047-1048. All these cases discuss collectively bargainedseniority systems, not systems (like the present system)

which are unilaterally imposed by management. But therelevant seniority system advantages, and related difficulties
that result from violations of seniority rules, are not limited
to collectively bargained systems.For one thing, the typical seniority system provides important employee benefits by creating, and fulfilling, em-ployee expectations of fair, uniform treatment. These benefits include "job security and an opportunity for steady and
predictable advancement based on objective standards."
Brief for Petitioner 32 (citing Fallon & Weiler, Firefighters
v. Stotts: Conflicting Models of Racial Justice, 1984 S. Ct.
Rev. 1, 57-58). See also 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman,
Employment Discrimination Law 72 (3d ed. 1996) ("One of
the most important aspects of competitive seniority is its
use in determining who will be laid off during a reduction in
force"). They include "an element of due process," limiting
"unfairness in personnel decisions." Gersuny, Origins of Seniority Provisions in Collective Bargaining, 33 Lab. L. J. 518,
519 (1982). And they consequently encourage employees to
invest in the employing company, accepting "less than their
value to the firm early in their careers" in return for greater
benefits in later years. J. Baron & D. Kreps, Strategic
Human Resources: Frameworks for General Managers 288
(1999).

Most important for present purposes, to require the typical employer to show more than the existence of a seniority
system might well undermine the employees' expectations of
consistent, uniform treatment--expectations upon which the
seniority system's benefits depend. That is because such a
rule would substitute a complex case-specific "accommodation" decision made by management for the more uniform,
impersonal operation of seniority rules. Such management

Opinion of the Court
decisionmaking, with its inevitable discretionary elements,would involve a matter of the greatest importance to employees, namely, layoffs; it would take place outside, as wellas inside, the confines of a court case; and it might well take
place fairly often. Cf. ADA, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(1) (esti-mating that some 43 million Americans suffer from physical
or mental disabilities). We can find nothing in the statutethat suggests Congress intended to undermine seniority systems in this way. And we consequently conclude that theemployer's showing of violation of the rules of a seniority
system is by itself ordinarily sufficient.

B
The plaintiff (here the employee) nonetheless remains freeto show that special circumstances warrant a finding that,

despite the presence of a seniority system (which the ADAmay not trump in the run of cases), the requested "accommodation" is "reasonable" on the particular facts. That is be-cause special circumstances might alter the important expectations described above. Cf. Borkowski, 63 F. 3d, at 137("[A]n accommodation that imposed burdens that would be
unreasonable for most members of an industry might never-theless be required of an individual defendant in light of that
employer's particular circumstances"). See also Woodmanv.

Runyon, 132 F. 3d 1330, 1343-1344 (CA10 1997). Theplaintiff might show, for example, that the employer, having

retained the right to change the seniority system unilater-ally, exercises that right fairly frequently, reducing employee
expectations that the system will be followed--to the pointwhere one more departure, needed to accommodate an individual with a disability, will not likely make a difference.The plaintiff might show that the system already contains
exceptions such that, in the circumstances, one further ex-ception is unlikely to matter. We do not mean these examples to exhaust the kinds of showings that a plaintiff mightmake. But we do mean to say that the plaintiff must bear

Stevens, J., concurring
the burden of showing special circumstances that make anexception from the seniority system reasonable in the particular case. And to do so, the plaintiff must explain why,in the particular case, an exception to the employer's seniority policy can constitute a "reasonable accommodation" eventhough in the ordinary case it cannot.

IV
In its question presented, US Airways asked us whetherthe ADA requires an employer to assign a disabled employee

to a particular position even though another employee isentitled to that position under the employer's "established
seniority system." We answer that ordinarily the ADAdoes not require that assignment. Hence, a showing that
the assignment would violate the rules of a seniority sys-tem warrants summary judgment for the employer--unless
there is more. The plaintiff must present evidence of that"more," namely, special circumstances surrounding the particular case that demonstrate the assignment is nonethelessreasonable.

Because the lower courts took a different view of the mat-ter, and because neither party has had an opportunity to
seek summary judgment in accordance with the principleswe set forth here, we vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
While I join the Court's opinion, my colleagues' separatewritings prompt these additional comments.

A possible conflict with an employer's seniority system isrelevant to the question whether a disabled employee's requested accommodation is "reasonable" within the meaningof the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. For that

535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., concurring
reason, to the extent that the Court of Appeals concludedthat a seniority system is only relevant to the question

whether a given accommodation would impose an "unduehardship" on an employer, or determined that such a system
has only a minor bearing on the reasonableness inquiry, itmisread the statute.

Although the Court of Appeals did not apply the standardthat the Court endorses today, it correctly rejected the
per se rule that petitioner has pressed upon us and properlyreversed the District Court's entry of summary judgment
for petitioner. The Court of Appeals also correctly heldthat there was a triable issue of fact precluding the entry of
summary judgment with respect to whether petitioner vio-lated the statute by failing to engage in an interactive process concerning respondent's three proposed accommodations.228 F. 3d 1105, 1117 (CA9 2000) (en banc). This latter holding is untouched by the Court's opinion today.Among the questions that I have not been able to answer
on the basis of the limited record that has been presented tous are: (1) whether the mailroom position held by respondent became open for bidding merely in response to a routineairline schedule change,

1 or as the direct consequence of

the layoff of several thousand employees; 2 (2) whether re-spondent's requested accommodation should be viewed as

an assignment to a vacant position,3 or as the maintenanceof the status quo;

4 and (3) exactly what impact the grant of

respondent's request would have had on other employees.5

As I understand the Court's opinion, on remand, respondentwill have the burden of answering these and other questions

in order to overcome the presumption that petitioner'sseniority system justified respondent's discharge.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I agree with portions of the opinion of the Court, but Ifind problematic the Court's test for determining whether

the fact that a job reassignment violates a seniority sys-tem makes the reassignment an unreasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADAor Act), 42 U. S. C. $ 12101

et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V).Although a seniority system plays an important role in the

workplace, for the reasons I explain below, I would prefer tosay that the effect of a seniority system on the reasonableness of a reassignment as an accommodation for purposes ofthe ADA depends on whether the seniority system is legally
enforceable. "Were it possible for me to adhere to [this be-lief] in my vote, and for the Court at the same time to [adopt
a majority rule]," I would do so. Screws v. United States,325 U. S. 91, 134 (1945) (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).
"The Court, however, is divided in opinion," ibid., and if
each Member voted consistently with his or her beliefs, wewould not agree on a resolution of the question presented

in this case. Yet "[s]talemate should not prevail," ibid., par-ticularly in a case in which we are merely interpreting a
statute. Accordingly, in order that the Court may adopt arule, and because I believe the Court's rule will often lead
to the same outcome as the one I would have adopted, I jointhe Court's opinion despite my concerns. Cf.

Bragdon v.
Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 655-656 (1998) (Stevens, J., joined by
Breyer, J., concurring); Olmstead v. L. C., 527 U. S. 581,
607-608 (1999) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment).

The ADA specifically lists "reassignment to a vacant position" as one example of a "reasonable accommodation." 42

535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

409Cite as: 535 U. S. 391 (2002)
O'Connor, J., concurring
U. S. C. $ 12111(9)(B) (1994 ed.). In deciding whether anotherwise reasonable accommodation involving a reassignment is unreasonable because it would require an exceptionto a seniority system, I think the relevant issue is whether
the seniority system prevents the position in question frombeing vacant. The word "vacant" means "not filled or occupied by an incumbent [or] possessor." Webster's Third
New International Dictionary 2527 (1976). In the contextof a workplace, a vacant position is a position in which no

employee currently works and to which no individual hasa legal entitlement. For example, in a workplace without a
seniority system, when an employee ceases working for the
employer, the employee's former position is vacant until a
replacement is hired. Even if the replacement does not
start work immediately, once the replacement enters into a
contractual agreement with the employer, the position is
no longer vacant because it has a "possessor." In contrast,
when an employee ceases working in a workplace with a
legally enforceable seniority system, the employee's former
position does not become vacant if the seniority system entitles another employee to it. Instead, the employee entitled
to the position under the seniority system immediately becomes the new "possessor" of that position. In a workplace
with an unenforceable seniority policy, however, an employee
expecting assignment to a position under the seniority policy
would not have any type of contractual right to the position
and so could not be said to be its "possessor." The position
therefore would become vacant.

Given this understanding of when a position can properly
be considered vacant, if a seniority system, in the absence of
the ADA, would give someone other than the individual
seeking the accommodation a legal entitlement or contractual right to the position to which reassignment is
sought, the seniority system prevents the position from
being vacant. If a position is not vacant, then reassignment
to it is not a reasonable accommodation. The Act specifi535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
410 US AIRWAYS, INC. v. BARNETT

O'Connor, J., concurring
cally says that "reassignment to a vacant position" is a typeof "reasonable accommodation." $ 12111(9)(B) (emphasis

added). Indeed, the legislative history of the Act confirmsthat Congress did not intend reasonable accommodation to
require bumping other employees. H. R. Rep. No. 101-485,pt. 2, p. 63 (1990) ("The Committee also wishes to make clear
that reassignment need only be to a vacant position--`bumping' another employee out of a position to create a vacancyis not required"); S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 32 (1989) (same).

Petitioner's Personnel Policy Guide for Agents, whichcontains its seniority policy, specifically states that it is
"not intended to be a contract (express or implied) or otherwise to create legally enforceable obligations," and that petitioner "reserves the right to change any and all of the stated
policies and procedures in [the] Guide at any time, without
advanc[e] notice." Lodging of Respondent 2 (emphasis in
original). Petitioner conceded at oral argument that its
seniority policy does not give employees any legally enforceable rights. Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. Because the policy did not
give any other employee a right to the position respondent
sought, the position could be said to have been vacant when
it became open for bidding, making the requested accommodation reasonable.

In Part II of its opinion, the Court correctly explains
that "a plaintiff/employee (to defeat a defendant/employer's
motion for summary judgment) need only show that an
`accommodation' seems reasonable on its face, i. e., ordinarily or in the run of cases." Ante, at 401. In other
words, the plaintiff must show that the method of accommodation the employee seeks is reasonable in the run of cases.
See ante, at 402 (quoting Barth v. Gelb, 2 F. 3d 1180, 1187
(CADC 1993)). As the Court also correctly explains, "[o]nce
the plaintiff has made this showing, the defendant/employer
then must show special . . . circumstances that demonstrate
undue hardship" in the context of the particular employer's
operations. Ante, at 402. These interpretations give ap535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

propriate meaning to both the term "reasonable," 42 U. S. C.$ 12112(b)(5)(A), and the term "undue hardship," ibid., preventing the concepts from overlapping by making reason-ableness a general inquiry and undue hardship a specific inquiry. When the Court turns to applying its interpretationof the Act to seniority systems, however, it seems to blend
the two inquiries by suggesting that the plaintiff should havethe opportunity to prove that there are special circumstances
in the context of that particular seniority system that wouldcause an exception to the system to be reasonable despite
the fact that such exceptions are unreasonable in the runof cases.

Although I am troubled by the Court's reasoning, I believethe Court's approach for evaluating seniority systems will
often lead to the same outcome as the test I would haveadopted. Unenforceable seniority systems are likely to involve policies in which employers "retai[n] the right tochange the seniority system,"

ante, at 405, and will often"contai[n] exceptions,"
ibid. They will also often containdisclaimers that "reduc[e] employee expectations that the

system will be followed." Ibid. Thus, under the Court'stest, disabled employees seeking accommodations that would
require exceptions to unenforceable seniority systems maybe able to show circumstances that make the accommodation "reasonable in the[ir] particular case." Ante, at 406.Because I think the Court's test will often lead to the correct
outcome, and because I think it important that a majority ofthe Court agree on a rule when interpreting statutes, I join
the Court's opinion.

Indulging its penchant for eschewing clear rules that mightavoid litigation, see, e. g., Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407, 423
(2002) (Scalia, J., dissenting); TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534U. S. 19, 35-36 (2001) (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment),the Court answers "maybe." It creates a presumption that

an exception to a seniority rule is an "unreasonable" accom-modation, ante, at 403, but allows that presumption to be
rebutted by showing that the exception "will not likely makea difference," ante, at 405.

The principal defect of today's opinion, however, goes wellbeyond the uncertainty it produces regarding the relationship between the ADA and the infinite variety of senioritysystems. The conclusion that any seniority system can ever
be overridden is merely one consequence of a mistaken inter-pretation of the ADA that makes all employment rules and
practices--even those which (like a seniority system) poseno

distinctive obstacle to the disabled--subject to sus-pension when that is (in a court's view) a "reasonable" means

of enabling a disabled employee to keep his job. That is afar cry from what I believe the accommodation provision of
the ADA requires: the suspension (within reason) of thoseemployment rules and practices that the employee's disability prevents him from observing.

I
The Court begins its analysis by describing the ADA asdeclaring that an employer may not " `discriminate against a

more: an employer may not "discriminate against a qualifiedindividual with a disability

added). It further provides that discrimination includes"not making reasonable accommodations

cal or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individ-ual with a disability." $ 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).

Read together, these provisions order employers to modifyor remove (within reason) policies and practices that burden
a disabled person "because of [his] disability." In otherwords, the ADA eliminates workplace barriers only if a disability prevents an employee from overcoming them--those
barriers that would not be barriers but for the employee'sdisability. These include, for example, work stations that

cannot accept the employee's wheelchair, or an assembly-linepractice that requires long periods of standing. But they do
not include rules and practices that bear no more heavily
upon the disabled employee than upon others--even though
an exemption from such a rule or practice might in a sense
"make up for" the employee's disability. It is not a required
accommodation, for example, to pay a disabled employee
more than others at his grade level--even if that increment
is earmarked for massage or physical therapy that would enable the employee to work with as little physical discomfort
as his co-workers. That would be "accommodating" the disabled employee, but it would not be "making . . . accommodatio[n] to the known physical or mental limitations" of the
employee, $ 12112(b)(5)(A), because it would not eliminate
any workplace practice that constitutes an obstacle because
of his disability.

So also with exemption from a seniority system, which
burdens the disabled and nondisabled alike. In particular
cases, seniority rules may have a harsher effect upon the
disabled employee than upon his co-workers. If the disabled
employee is physically capable of performing only one task in
the workplace, seniority rules may be, for him, the difference
between employment and unemployment. But that does
not make the seniority system a disability-related obstacle,
any more than harsher impact upon the more needy disabled
employee renders the salary system a disability-related obstacle. When one departs from this understanding, the

ADA's accommodation provision becomes a standardless
grab bag--leaving it to the courts to decide which workplace
preferences (higher salary, longer vacations, reassignment
to positions to which others are entitled) can be deemed
"reasonable" to "make up for" the particular employee's
disability.

Some courts, including the Ninth Circuit in the present
case, have accepted respondent's contention that the ADA
demands accommodation even with respect to those obstacles that have nothing to do with the disability. Their
principal basis for this position is that the definition of
"reasonable accommodation" includes "reassignment to a vacant position." $ 12111(9)(B). This accommodation would
be meaningless, they contend, if it required only that the
disabled employee be considered for a vacant position. The
ADA already prohibits employers from discriminating
against the disabled with respect to "hiring, advancement,
or discharge . . . and other terms, conditions, and privileges
of employment." $ 12112(a). Surely, the argument goes, a
disabled employee must be given preference over a nondisabled employee when a vacant position appears. See Smith
v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F. 3d 1154, 1164-1165 (CA10
1999) (en banc); Aka v. Washington Hospital Center, 156 F.

Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act,

This argument seems to me quite mistaken. The right to
be given a vacant position so long as there are no obstacles
to that appointment (including another candidate who is
better qualified, if "best qualified" is the workplace rule)
is of considerable value. If an employee is hired to fill a
position but fails miserably, he will typically be fired. Few
employers will search their organization charts for vacancies

to which the low-performing employee might be suited.The ADA, however, prohibits an employer from firing a person whose disability is the cause of his poor performancewithout first seeking to place him in a vacant job where the
disability will not affect performance. Such reassignmentis an accommodation

to the disability because it removes an
obstacle (the inability to perform the functions of the assigned job) arising solely from the disability. Cf. Bruff v.
North Mississippi Health Services, Inc., 244 F. 3d 495, 502
(CA5 2001). See also 3 BNA EEOC Compliance Manual,
supra, at N:2478 ("[A]n employer who does not normally
transfer employees would still have to reassign an employeewith a disability").

The phrase "reassignment to a vacant position" appears ina subsection describing a variety of potential "reasonable
accommodation[s]":

"(A) making existing facilities used by employees
readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disa-bilities; and

"(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work
schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations,
training materials or policies, the provision of qualified
readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." $ 12111(9) (emphasis added).

Subsection (A) clearly addresses features of the workplace
that burden the disabled because of their disabilities. Subsection (B) is broader in scope but equally targeted at
disability-related obstacles. Thus it encompasses "modified
work schedules" (which may accommodate inability to work
for protracted periods), "modification of equipment and devices," and "provision of qualified readers or interpreters."

Scalia, J., dissenting
There is no reason why the phrase "reassignment to a vacant
position" should be thought to have a uniquely different
focus. It envisions elimination of the obstacle of the current
position (which requires activity that the disabled employee
cannot tolerate) when there is an alternate position freely
available. If he is qualified for that position, and no one else
is seeking it, or no one else who seeks it is better qualified, he
must be given the position. But "reassignment to a vacant
position" does not envision the elimination of obstacles to the
employee's service in the new position that have nothing
to do with his disability--for example, another employee's
claim to that position under a seniority system, or another
employee's superior qualifications. Cf. 29 CFR pt. 1630,
App. $ 1630.2(o), p. 357 (2001) (explaining "reasonable accommodation" as "any change in the work environment or in the
way things are customarily done that enables an individual
with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities"
(emphasis added)); Aka v. Washington Hospital Center,
supra, at 1314-1315 (Silberman, J., dissenting) (interpreting
"reassignment to a vacant position" consistently with the
other accommodations listed in $ 12111(9), none of which
"even alludes to the possibility of a preference for the disabled over the nondisabled").

Unsurprisingly, most Courts of Appeals addressing the
issue have held or assumed that the ADA does not mandate
exceptions to a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory policy" such
as a seniority system or a consistent policy of assigning the
most qualified person to a vacant position. See, e. g., EEOC
v. Sara Lee Corp., 237 F. 3d 349, 353-355 (CA4 2001) (seniority system); EEOC v. Humiston-Keeling, Inc., 227 F. 3d 1024,
1028-1029 (CA7 2000) (policy of assigning the most qualified
applicant); Burns v. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., 222 F. 3d

only if they request a transfer to an advertised vacant position); Cravens v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City,

214 F. 3d 1011, 1020 (CA8 2000) (assuming reassignment isnot required if it would violate legitimate, nondiscriminatory

policies); Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F. 3d 1222, 1225(CA11 1997) (policy of not reassigning salaried workers to
production positions covered by a collective-bargaining unit);
Daugherty v. El Paso, 56 F. 3d 695, 700 (CA5 1995) (policy
of giving full-time employees priority over part-time employees in assigning vacant positions).Even the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in

at least some of its regulations, acknowledges that the ADAclears away only obstacles

arising from a person's disability
and nothing more. According to the agency, the term "rea-sonable accommodation" means

"(i) [m]odifications or adjustments to a job applicationprocess

that enable a qualified applicant with a disability
to be considered for the position such qualified applicantdesires; or

"(ii) [m]odifications or adjustments to the work envi-ronment . . .

that enable a qualified individual with a
disability to perform the essential functions of that posi-tion; or

"(iii) [m]odifications or adjustments that enable a cov-ered entity's employee with a disability

to enjoy equal
benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed
by its other similarly situated employees without dis-abilities." 29 CFR $ 1630.2(o) (2001) (emphasis added).

See also 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.9, at 364 ("reasonable
accommodation requirement is best understood as a meansby which barriers to . . . equal employment opportunity . . .

are removed or alleviated").

Sadly, this analysis is lost on the Court, which mistakenly
and inexplicably concludes, ante, at 398, that my position
here is the same as that attributed to US Airways. In rejecting the argument that the ADA creates no "automatic
exemption" for neutral workplace rules such as "break535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
from-work" and furniture budget rules, ante, at 397-398, theCourt rejects an argument I have not made.

II
Although, as I have said, the uncertainty cast upon bonafide seniority systems is the least of the ill consequences

produced by today's decision, a few words on that subjectare nonetheless in order. Since, under the Court's interpretation of the ADA, all workplace rules are eligible to be usedas vehicles of accommodation, the one means of saving seniority systems is a judicial finding that accommodationthrough the suspension of those workplace rules would be
unreasonable. The Court is unwilling, however, to makethat finding categorically, with respect to all seniority systems. Instead, it creates (and "creates" is the appropriateword) a

rebuttable presumption that exceptions to seniorityrules are not "reasonable" under the ADA, but leaves it free

for the disabled employee to show that under the "specialcircumstances" of his case, an exception would be "reasonable." Ante, at 405. The employee would be entitled to anexception, for example, if he showed that "one more departure" from the seniority rules "will not likely make a differ-ence." Ibid.

I have no idea what this means. When is it possible for adeparture from seniority rules to "not likely make a difference"? Even when a bona fide seniority system has multipleexceptions, employees expect that these are the

only ex-ceptions. One more unannounced exception will invariably

undermine the values ("fair, uniform treatment," "job se-curity," "predictable advancement," etc.) that the Court
cites as its reasons for believing seniority systems so im-portant that they merit a presumption of exemption. See
ante, at 404.One is tempted to impart some rationality to the scheme
by speculating that the Court's burden-shifting rule is

535US2 Unit: $U42 [10-01-03 18:21:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
merely intended to give the disabled employee an opportunity to show that the employer's seniority system is in fact
a sham--a system so full of exceptions that it creates no
meaningful employee expectations. The rule applies, however, even if the seniority system is "bona fide and established," Pet. for Cert. i. And the Court says that "to require
the typical employer to show more than the existence of a
seniority system might well undermine the employees' expectations of consistent, uniform treatment . . . ." Ante, at
404. How could deviations from a sham seniority system
"undermine the employees' expectations"?

I must conclude, then, that the Court's rebuttable presumption does not merely give disabled employees the opportunity to unmask sham seniority systems; it gives them
a vague and unspecified power (whenever they can show
"special circumstances") to undercut bona fide systems.
The Court claims that its new test will not require exceptions to seniority systems "in the run of cases," ante, at 403,
but that is belied by the disposition of this case. The Court
remands to give respondent an opportunity to show that an
exception to petitioner's seniority system "will not likely
make a difference" to employee expectations, ante, at 405,
despite the following finding by the District Court:

"[T]he uncontroverted evidence shows that [petitioner's]
seniority system has been in place for `decades' and governs over 14,000 . . . Agents. Moreover, seniority policies such as the one at issue in this case are common to
the airline industry. Given this context, it seems clear
that [petitioner's] employees were justified in relying
upon the policy. As such, any significant alteration of
that policy would result in undue hardship to both the
company and its non-disabled employees." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 96a.

Because the Court's opinion leaves the question whethera seniority system must be disregarded in order to accommodate a disabled employee in a state of uncertainty that canbe resolved only by constant litigation; and because it adopts
an interpretation of the ADA that incorrectly subjects allemployer rules and practices to the requirement of reasonable accommodation; I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.

" [R]eassig nment to a vacant position, " 42 U. S. C.

$ 12111(9) (1994 ed.), is one way an employer may "reason-abl[y] accommodat[e]" disabled employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S. C. $ 12101
et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V). The Court today holds that
a request for reassignment will nonetheless most likely beunreasonable when it would violate the terms of a seniority

system imposed by an employer. Although I concur in theCourt's appreciation of the value and importance of seniority
systems, I do not believe my hand is free to accept the major-ity's result and therefore respectfully dissent.

Nothing in the ADA insulates seniority rules from the"reasonable accommodation" requirement, in marked contrast to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, each of whichhas an explicit protection for seniority. See 42 U. S. C.

Souter, J., dissenting
ADA's provisions on Title VII,1 its failure to replicate TitleVII's exemption for seniority systems leaves the statute ambiguous, albeit with more than a hint that seniority rules donot inevitably carry the day.

In any event, the statute's legislative history resolves theambiguity. The Committee Reports from both the House
of Representatives and the Senate explain that seniorityprotections contained in a collective-bargaining agreement
should not amount to more than "a factor" when it comesto deciding whether some accommodation at odds with the
seniority rules is "reasonable" nevertheless. H. R. Rep.No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 63 (1990) (existence of collectively
bargained protections for seniority "would not be determi-native" on the issue whether an accommodation was reasonable); S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 32 (1989) (a collective-bargaining agreement assigning jobs based on seniority
"may be considered as a factor in determining" whether anaccommodation is reasonable). Here, of course, it does not
matter whether the congressional committees were right orwrong in thinking that views of sound ADA application could
reduce a collectively bargained seniority policy to the levelof "a factor," in the absence of a specific statutory provision
to that effect. In fact, I doubt that any interpretive cluein legislative history could trump settled law specifically
making collective-bargaining agreements enforceable. See,e. g., $ 301(a), Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 29
U. S. C. $ 185(a) (permitting suit in federal court to enforcecollective-bargaining agreements); Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448 (1957) (holding that $ 301(a)expresses a federal policy in favor of the enforceability of
labor contracts); Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U. S.

1 It is evident from the legislative history that several provisions of Title
VII were copied or incorporated by reference into the ADA. See, e. g.,
S. Rep. No. 101-116, pp. 2, 25, 43 (1989); H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2,
pp. 54, 76-77 (1990).

502, 509 (1962) ("Section 301(a) reflects congressional recognition of the vital importance of assuring the enforceability
of [collective-bargaining] agreements"). The point in this
case, however, is simply to recognize that if Congress considered that sort of agreement no more than a factor in the
analysis, surely no greater weight was meant for a seniority scheme like the one before us, unilaterally imposed by
the employer, and, unlike collective-bargaining agreements,
not singled out for protection by any positive federal statute.

This legislative history also specifically rules out the majority's reliance on Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,
432 U. S. 63 (1977), ante, at 403, a case involving a request
for a religious accommodation under Title VII that would
have broken the seniority rules of a collective-bargaining
agreement. We held that such an accommodation would not
be "reasonable," and said that our conclusion was "supported" by Title VII's explicit exemption for seniority systems. 432 U. S., at 79-82. The committees of both Houses
of Congress dealing with the ADA were aware of this case
and expressed a choice against treating it as authority under
the ADA, with its lack of any provision for maintaining
seniority rules. E. g., H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 68
("The Committee wishes to make it clear that the principles
enunciated by the Supreme Court in TWA v. Hardison . . .
are not applicable to this legislation"); S. Rep. No. 101-116,
at 36 (same).2

2 The House Report singles out Hardison's equation of "undue hardship"
and anything more than a "de minimus [sic] cost" as being inapplicable to
the ADA. By contrast, Hardison itself addressed seniority systems not
only in its analysis of undue hardship, but also in its analysis of reasonable
accommodation. 432 U. S., at 81, 84. Nonetheless, Congress's disavowal
of Hardison in light of the "crucial role that reasonable accommodation
plays in ensuring meaningful employment opportunities for people with
disabilities," H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 68, renders that case singularly inappropriate to bolster the Court's holding today.

Because a unilaterally imposed seniority system enjoys no
special protection under the ADA, a consideration of facts
peculiar to this very case is needed to gauge whether Barnett has carried the burden of showing his proposed accommodation to be a "reasonable" one despite the policy in force
at US Airways. The majority describes this as a burden to
show the accommodation is "plausible" or "feasible," ante, at
402, and I believe Barnett has met it.

He held the mailroom job for two years before learning
that employees with greater seniority planned to bid for the
position, given US Airways's decision to declare the job "vacant." Thus, perhaps unlike ADA claimants who request

accommodation through reassignment, Barnett was seeking

not a change but a continuation of the status quo. All he
asked was that US Airways refrain from declaring the position "vacant"; he did not ask to bump any other employee
and no one would have lost a job on his account. There was
no evidence in the District Court of any unmanageable ripple
effects from Barnett's request, or showing that he would
have overstepped an inordinate number of seniority levels
by remaining where he was.

In fact, it is hard to see the seniority scheme here as any
match for Barnett's ADA requests, since US Airways apparently took pains to ensure that its seniority rules raised no
great expectations. In its policy statement, US Airways
said that "[t]he Agent Personnel Policy Guide is not intended
to be a contract" and that "USAir reserves the right to
change any and all of the stated policies and procedures in
this Guide at any time, without advanced notice." Lodging
of Respondent 2 (emphasis in original). While I will skip
any state-by-state analysis of the legal treatment of employee handbooks (a source of many lawyers' fees) it is safe
to say that the contract law of a number of jurisdictions
would treat this disclaimer as fatal to any claim an employee

might make to enforce the seniority policy over an employ-er's contrary decision.

3

With US Airways itself insisting that its seniority systemwas noncontractual and modifiable at will, there is no reason

to think that Barnett's accommodation would have resultedin anything more than minimal disruption to US Airways's
operations, if that. Barnett has shown his requested accom-modation to be "reasonable," and the burden ought to shift
to US Airways if it wishes to claim that, in spite of surfaceappearances, violation of the seniority scheme would have
worked an undue hardship. I would therefore affirm theNinth Circuit.

so riddled with exceptions so as not to engender expectations of consistent

CITY OF LOS ANGELES v. ALAMEDA BOOKS,

INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-799. Argued December 4, 2001--Decided May 13, 2002
Based on its 1977 study concluding that concentrations of adult entertainment establishments are associated with higher crime rates in surrounding communities, petitioner city enacted an ordinance prohibiting such enterprises within 1,000 feet of each other or within 500 feet
of a religious institution, school, or public park. Los Angeles Municipal Code $ 12.70(C) (1978). Because the ordinance's method of calculating distances created a loophole permitting the concentration of multiple adult enterprises in a single structure, the city later amended the
ordinance to prohibit "more than one adult entertainment business in
the same building." $ 12.70(C) (1983). Respondents, two adult establishments that openly operate combined bookstores/video arcades in
violation of $ 12.70(C), as amended, sued under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance, on its face,
violates the First Amendment. Finding that the ordinance was not a
content-neutral regulation of speech, the District Court reasoned that
neither the 1977 study nor a report cited in Hart Book Stores v. Edmisten, a Fourth Circuit case upholding a similar statute, supported
a reasonable belief that multiple-use adult establishments produce the
secondary effects the city asserted as content-neutral justifications
for its prohibition. Subjecting $ 12.70(C) to strict scrutiny, the court
granted respondents summary judgment because it felt the city had
not offered evidence demonstrating that its prohibition was necessary
to serve a compelling government interest. The Ninth Circuit affirmed
on the different ground that, even if the ordinance were content neutral, the city failed to present evidence upon which it could reasonably
rely to demonstrate that its regulation of multiple-use establishments
was designed to serve its substantial interest in reducing crime. The
court therefore held the ordinance invalid under Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
222 F. 3d 719, reversed and remanded.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Thomas, concluded that Los Angeles may reasonably rely

on its 1977 study to demonstrate that its present ban on multipleuse adult establishments serves its interest in reducing crime.
Pp. 433-443.

(a) The 1977 study's central component is a Los Angeles Police Department report indicating that, from 1965 to 1975, crime rates for,
e. g., robbery and prostitution grew much faster in Hollywood, which
had the city's largest concentration of adult establishments, than in
the city as a whole. The city may reasonably rely on the police department's conclusions regarding crime patterns to overcome summary judgment. In finding to the contrary on the ground that the 1977
study focused on the effect on crime rates of a concentration of establishments--not a concentration of operations within a single establishment--the Ninth Circuit misunderstood the study's implications.
While the study reveals that areas with high concentrations of adult
establishments are associated with high crime rates, such areas are also
areas with high concentrations of adult operations, albeit each in separate establishments. It was therefore consistent with the 1977 study's
findings, and thus reasonable, for the city to infer that reducing the
concentration of adult operations in a neighborhood, whether within
separate establishments or in one large establishment, will reduce crime
rates. Neither the Ninth Circuit nor respondents nor the dissent provides any reason to question the city's theory. If this Court were to
accept their view, it would effectively require that the city provide
evidence that not only supports the claim that its ordinance serves an
important government interest, but also does not provide support for
any other approach to serve that interest. Renton specifically refused
to set such a high bar for municipalities that want to address merely
the secondary effects of protected speech. The Court there held that
a municipality may rely on any evidence that is "reasonably believed to
be relevant" for demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial, independent government interest. 475 U. S., at 51-52. This
is not to say that a municipality can get away with shoddy data or reasoning. The municipality's evidence must fairly support its rationale
for its ordinance. If plaintiffs fail to cast direct doubt on this rationale, either by demonstrating that the municipality's evidence does not
support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the municipality's factual findings, the municipality meets the Renton standard.
If plaintiffs succeed in casting doubt on a municipality's rationale in
either manner, the burden shifts back to the municipality to supplement
the record with evidence renewing support for a theory that justifies its
ordinance. See, e. g., Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 298. This case
is at a very early stage in this process. It arrives on a summary judgment motion by respondents defended only by complaints that the 1977
study fails to prove that the city's justification for its ordinance is nec535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

essarily correct. Therefore, it must be concluded that the city, at this
stage of the litigation, has complied with Renton's evidentiary requirement. Pp. 433-442.

(b) The Court need not resolve the parties' dispute over whether
the city can rely on evidence from Hart Book Stores to overcome summary judgment, nor respondents' alternative argument that the ordinance is not a time, place, and manner regulation, but is effectively a
ban on adult video arcades that must be subjected to strict scrutiny.

Justice Kennedy concluded that this Court's precedents may allow
Los Angeles to impose its regulation in the exercise of the zoning authority, and that the city is not, at least, to be foreclosed by summary
judgment. Pp. 444-453.

(a) Under Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, if a city
can decrease the crime and blight associated with adult businesses by
exercising its zoning power, and at the same time leave the quantity
and accessibility of speech substantially undiminished, there is no First
Amendment objection, even if the measure identifies the problem
outside the establishments by reference to the speech inside--that is,
even if the measure is content based. On the other hand, a city may
not regulate the secondary effects of speech by suppressing the speech
itself. For example, it may not impose a content-based fee or tax, see
Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 230, even
if the government purports to justify the fee by reference to secondary effects, see Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S.
123, 134-135. That the ordinance at issue is more a typical land-use
restriction than a law suppressing speech is suggested by the fact that
it is not limited to expressive activities, but extends, e. g., to massage
parlors, which the city has found to cause the same undesirable secondary effects; also, it is just one part of an elaborate web of land-use
regulations intended to promote the social value of the land as a whole
without suppressing some activities or favoring others. Thus, the ordinance is not so suspect that it must be subjected to the strict scrutiny
that content-based laws demand in other instances. Rather, it calls for
intermediate scrutiny, as Renton held. Pp. 445-447.

(b) Renton's description of an ordinance similar to Los Angeles' as
"content neutral," 475 U. S., at 48, was something of a fiction. These
ordinances are content based, and should be so described. Nevertheless, Renton's central holding is sound. Pp. 448-449.

(c) The necessary rationale for applying intermediate scrutiny is
the promise that zoning ordinances like the one at issue may reduce
the costs of secondary effects without substantially reducing speech.
If two adult businesses are under the same roof, an ordinance requir535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing them to separate will have one of two results: One business will
either move elsewhere or close. The city's premise cannot be the latter.
The premise must be that businesses--even those that have always been
under one roof--will for the most part disperse rather than shut down,
that the quantity of speech will be substantially undiminished, and that
total secondary effects will be significantly reduced. As to whether
there is sufficient evidence to support this proposition, the Court has
consistently held that a city must have latitude to experiment, at least
at the outset, and that very little evidence is required. See, e. g., Renton, supra, at 51-52. Here, the proposition to be shown is supported
by common experience and a study showing a correlation between
the concentration of adult establishments and crime. Assuming that
the study supports the city's original dispersal ordinance, most of the
necessary analysis follows. To justify the ordinance at issue, the city
may infer--from its study and from its own experience--that two adult
businesses under the same roof are no better than two next door, and
that knocking down the wall between the two would not ameliorate any
undesirable secondary effects of their proximity to one another. If the
city's first ordinance was justified, therefore, then the second is too.
Pp. 449-453.

(d) Because these considerations seem well enough established in
common experience and the Court's case law, the ordinance survives
summary judgment. P. 453.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
prohibition was designed to serve a substantial governmentinterest. Specifically, the Court of Appeals found that the

city failed to present evidence upon which it could reason-ably rely to demonstrate a link between multiple-use adult
establishments and negative secondary effects. Therefore,the Court of Appeals held the Los Angeles prohibition on
such establishments invalid under Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986), and its precedents interpret-ing that case. 222 F. 3d 719, 723-728 (2000). We reverse

and remand. The city of Los Angeles may reasonably relyon a study it conducted some years before enacting the
present version of $ 12.70(C) to demonstrate that its ban onmultiple-use adult establishments serves its interest in reducing crime. I

In 1977, the city of Los Angeles conducted a compre-hensive study of adult establishments and concluded that
concentrations of adult businesses are associated with higherrates of prostitution, robbery, assaults, and thefts in surrounding communities. See App. 35-162 (Los Angeles Dept.of City Planning, Study of the Effects of the Concentration
of Adult Entertainment Establishments in the City of LosAngeles (City Plan Case No. 26475, City Council File No. 74-

4521-S.3, June 1977)). Accordingly, the city enacted an or-dinance prohibiting the establishment, substantial enlargement, or transfer of ownership of an adult arcade, bookstore,cabaret, motel, theater, or massage parlor or a place for
sexual encounters within 1,000 feet of another such enter-prise or within 500 feet of any religious institution, school,
or public park. See Los Angeles Municipal Code $ 12.70(C)(1978).

There is evidence that the intent of the city council whenenacting this prohibition was not only to disperse distinct
adult establishments housed in separate buildings, but alsoto disperse distinct adult businesses operated under common
ownership and housed in a single structure. See App. 29

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
(Los Angeles Dept. of City Planning, Amendment--ProposedOrdinance to Prohibit the Establishment of More than One

Adult Entertainment Business at a Single Location (CityPlan Case No. 26475, City Council File No. 82-0155, Jan. 13,
1983)). The ordinance the city enacted, however, directedthat "[t]he distance between any two adult entertainment
businesses shall be measured in a straight line . . . from
the closest exterior structural wall of each business." LosAngeles Municipal Code $ 12.70(D) (1978). Subsequent to

enactment, the city realized that this method of calculatingdistances created a loophole permitting the concentration of
multiple adult enterprises in a single structure.

Concerned that allowing an adult-oriented department
store to replace a strip of adult establishments could defeat
the goal of the original ordinance, the city council amended

$ 12.70(C) by adding a prohibition on "the establishment or
maintenance of more than one adult entertainment business
in the same building, structure or portion thereof." Los
Angeles Municipal Code $ 12.70(C) (1983). The amended ordinance defines an "Adult Entertainment Business" as an
adult arcade, bookstore, cabaret, motel, theater, or massage parlor or a place for sexual encounters, and notes that
each of these enterprises "shall constitute a separate adult
entertainment business even if operated in conjunction with
another adult entertainment business at the same establishment." $ 12.70(B)(17). The ordinance uses the term "business" to refer to certain types of goods or services sold in
adult establishments, rather than the establishment itself.
Relevant for purposes of this case are also the ordinance's
definitions of adult bookstores and arcades. An "Adult
Bookstore" is an operation that "has as a substantial portion of its stock-in-trade and offers for sale" printed matter
and videocassettes that emphasize the depiction of specified sexual activities. $ 12.70(B)(2)(a). An adult arcade is
an operation where, "for any form of consideration," five
or fewer patrons together may view films or videocassettes

that emphasize the depiction of specified sexual activities.$ 12.70(B)(1).

Respondents, Alameda Books, Inc., and Highland Books,Inc., are two adult establishments operating in Los Angeles.
Neither is located within 1,000 feet of another adult es-tablishment or 500 feet of any religious institution, public
park, or school. Each establishment occupies less than 3,000
square feet. Both respondents rent and sell sexually ori-ented products, including videocassettes. Additionally, both

provide booths where patrons can view videocassettes fora fee. Although respondents are located in different buildings, each operates its retail sales and rental operations in
the same commercial space in which its video booths are
located. There are no physical distinctions between the different operations within each establishment and each establishment has only one entrance. 222 F. 3d, at 721. Respondents concede they are openly operating in violation
of $ 12.70(C) of the city's code, as amended. Brief for Respondents 7; Brief for Petitioner 9.

After a city building inspector found in 1995 that Alameda
Books, Inc., was operating both as an adult bookstore and
an adult arcade in violation of the city's adult zoning regulations, respondents joined as plaintiffs and sued under
42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief to
prevent enforcement of the ordinance. 222 F. 3d, at 721.
At issue in this case is count I of the complaint, which alleges
a facial violation of the First Amendment. Both the city
and respondents filed cross-motions for summary judgment.

The District Court for the Central District of California
initially denied both motions on the First Amendment issues
in count I, concluding that there was "a genuine issue of
fact whether the operation of a combination video rental
and video viewing business leads to the harmful secondary
effects associated with a concentration of separate businesses in a single urban area." App. 255. After respondents filed a motion for reconsideration, however, the District

Court found that Los Angeles' prohibition on multiple-useadult establishments was not a content-neutral regulation

of speech. App. to Pet. for Cert. 51. It reasoned that nei-ther the city's 1977 study nor a report cited in Hart Book
Stores v. Edmisten, 612 F. 2d 821 (CA4 1979) (uphold-ing a North Carolina statute that also banned multiple-use
adult establishments), supported a reasonable belief thatmultiple-use adult establishments produced the secondary
effects the city asserted as content-neutral justifications forits prohibition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34-47. Therefore,
the District Court proceeded to subject the Los Angelesordinance to strict scrutiny. Because it felt that the city
did not offer evidence to demonstrate that its prohibition isnecessary to serve a compelling government interest, the
District Court granted summary judgment for respondentsand issued a permanent injunction enjoining the enforcement
of the ordinance against respondents. Id., at 51.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, although on different grounds. The Court of Appeals deter-mined that it did not have to reach the District Court's
decision that the Los Angeles ordinance was content basedbecause, even if the ordinance were content neutral, the
city failed to present evidence upon which it could reason-ably rely to demonstrate that its regulation of multiple-use
establishments is "designed to serve" the city's substantialinterest in reducing crime. The challenged ordinance was
therefore invalid under Renton, 475 U. S. 41. 222 F. 3d,at 723-724. We granted certiorari, 532 U. S. 902 (2001), to
clarify the standard for determining whether an ordinanceserves a substantial government interest under Renton,

In Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra, this Courtconsidered the validity of a municipal ordinance that prohibited any adult movie theater from locating within 1,000feet of any residential zone, family dwelling, church, park,

or school. Our analysis of the ordinance proceeded in threesteps. First, we found that the ordinance did not ban adult

theaters altogether, but merely required that they be dis-tanced from certain sensitive locations. The ordinance was
properly analyzed, therefore, as a time, place, and mannerregulation.

Id., at 46. We next considered whether the
ordinance was content neutral or content based. If the
regulation were content based, it would be considered pre-sumptively invalid and subject to strict scrutiny.

Simon &
Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,502 U. S. 105, 115, 118 (1991);

Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.
v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 230-231 (1987). We held, however, that the Renton ordinance was aimed not at the content
of the films shown at adult theaters, but rather at the secondary effects of such theaters on the surrounding community, namely, at crime rates, property values, and the quality
of the city's neighborhoods. Therefore, the ordinance was
deemed content neutral. Renton, supra, at 47-49. Finally,
given this finding, we stated that the ordinance would be
upheld so long as the city of Renton showed that its ordinance was designed to serve a substantial government
interest and that reasonable alternative avenues of communication remained available. 475 U. S., at 50. We concluded that Renton had met this burden, and we upheld its
ordinance. Id., at 51-54.

The Court of Appeals applied the same analysis to evaluate the Los Angeles ordinance challenged in this case.
First, the Court of Appeals found that the Los Angeles
ordinance was not a complete ban on adult entertainment
establishments, but rather a sort of adult zoning regulation,
which Renton considered a time, place, and manner regulation. 222 F. 3d, at 723. The Court of Appeals turned to the
second step of the Renton analysis, but did not draw any
conclusions about whether the Los Angeles ordinance was
content based. It explained that, even if the Los Angeles
ordinance were content neutral, the city had failed to demon535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

435Cite as: 535 U. S. 425 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
strate, as required by the third step of the Renton analysis,
that its prohibition on multiple-use adult establishments was
designed to serve its substantial interest in reducing crime.
The Court of Appeals noted that the primary evidence relied upon by Los Angeles to demonstrate a link between
combination adult businesses and harmful secondary effects
was the 1977 study conducted by the city's planning department. The Court of Appeals found, however, that the city
could not rely on that study because it did not " `suppor[t] a
reasonable belief that [the] combination [of] businesses . . .
produced harmful secondary effects of the type asserted.' "
222 F. 3d, at 724. For similar reasons, the Court of Appeals
also rejected the city's attempt to rely on a report on health
conditions inside adult video arcades described in Hart Book
Stores, supra, a case that upheld a North Carolina statute
similar to the Los Angeles ordinance challenged in this case.

The central component of the 1977 study is a report on
city crime patterns provided by the Los Angeles Police Department. That report indicated that, during the period
from 1965 to 1975, certain crime rates grew much faster in
Hollywood, which had the largest concentration of adult establishments in the city, than in the city of Los Angeles as
a whole. For example, robberies increased 3 times faster
and prostitution 15 times faster in Hollywood than citywide.
App. 124-125.

The 1977 study also contains reports conducted directly
by the staff of the Los Angeles Planning Department that
examine the relationship between adult establishments and
property values. These staff reports, however, are inconclusive. Not surprisingly, the parties focus their dispute
before this Court on the report by the Los Angeles Police
Department. Because we find that reducing crime is a substantial government interest and that the police department
report's conclusions regarding crime patterns may reasonably be relied upon to overcome summary judgment against

436 LOS ANGELES v. ALAMEDA BOOKS, INC.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the city, we also focus on the portion of the 1977 study drawnfrom the police department report.

The Court of Appeals found that the 1977 study did notreasonably support the inference that a concentration of
adult operations within a single adult establishment pro-duced greater levels of criminal activity because the study
focused on the effect that a concentration of establishments--not a concentration of operations within a singleestablishment--had on crime rates. The Court of Appeals pointed out that the study treated combination adultbookstore/arcades as single establishments and did not
study the effect of any separate-standing adult bookstore
or arcade. 222 F. 3d, at 724.

The Court of Appeals misunderstood the implications of
the 1977 study. While the study reveals that areas with
high concentrations of adult establishments are associated
with high crime rates, areas with high concentrations of
adult establishments are also areas with high concentrations
of adult operations, albeit each in separate establishments.
It was therefore consistent with the findings of the 1977
study, and thus reasonable, for Los Angeles to suppose that
a concentration of adult establishments is correlated with
high crime rates because a concentration of operations in
one locale draws, for example, a greater concentration of
adult consumers to the neighborhood, and a high density
of such consumers either attracts or generates criminal activity. The assumption behind this theory is that having
a number of adult operations in one single adult establishment draws the same dense foot traffic as having a
number of distinct adult establishments in close proximity,
much as minimalls and department stores similarly attract
the crowds of consumers. Brief for Petitioner 28. Under
this view, it is rational for the city to infer that reducing
the concentration of adult operations in a neighborhood,
whether within separate establishments or in one large establishment, will reduce crime rates.

535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

437Cite as: 535 U. S. 425 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Neither the Court of Appeals, nor respondents, nor the
dissent provides any reason to question the city's theory.
In particular, they do not offer a competing theory, let alone
data, that explains why the elevated crime rates in neighborhoods with a concentration of adult establishments can
be attributed entirely to the presence of permanent walls
between, and separate entrances to, each individual adult
operation. While the city certainly bears the burden of providing evidence that supports a link between concentrations
of adult operations and asserted secondary effects, it does
not bear the burden of providing evidence that rules out
every theory for the link between concentrations of adult
establishments that is inconsistent with its own.

The error that the Court of Appeals made is that it required the city to prove that its theory about a concentration of adult operations attracting crowds of customers,
much like a minimall or department store does, is a necessary consequence of the 1977 study. For example, the Court
of Appeals refused to allow the city to draw the inference
that "the expansion of an adult bookstore to include an adult
arcade would increase" business activity and "produce the
harmful secondary effects identified in the Study." 222 F.
3d, at 726. It reasoned that such an inference would justify limits on the inventory of an adult bookstore, not a
ban on the combination of an adult bookstore and an adult
arcade. The Court of Appeals simply replaced the city's
theory--that having many different operations in close proximity attracts crowds--with its own--that the size of an
operation attracts crowds. If the Court of Appeals' theory
is correct, then inventory limits make more sense. If the
city's theory is correct, then a prohibition on the combination
of businesses makes more sense. Both theories are consistent with the data in the 1977 study. The Court of Appeals'
analysis, however, implicitly requires the city to prove that
its theory is the only one that can plausibly explain the data

438 LOS ANGELES v. ALAMEDA BOOKS, INC.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
because only in this manner can the city refute the Courtof Appeals' logic.

Respondents make the same logical error as the Courtof Appeals when they suggest that the city's prohibition
on multiuse establishments will raise crime rates in certainneighborhoods because it will force certain adult businesses
to relocate to areas without any other adult businesses. Respondents' claim assumes that the 1977 study proves thatall adult businesses, whether or not they are located near

other adult businesses, generate crime. This is a plausiblereading of the results from the 1977 study, but respondents
do not demonstrate that it is a compelled reading. Nor do
they provide evidence that refutes the city's interpretation
of the study, under which the city's prohibition should on
balance reduce crime. If this Court were nevertheless to
accept respondents' speculation, it would effectively require
that the city provide evidence that not only supports the
claim that its ordinance serves an important government
interest, but also does not provide support for any other
approach to serve that interest.

In Renton, we specifically refused to set such a high bar
for municipalities that want to address merely the secondary effects of protected speech. We held that a municipality may rely on any evidence that is "reasonably believed
to be relevant" for demonstrating a connection between
speech and a substantial, independent government interest.
475 U. S., at 51-52; see also, e. g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre,
Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 584 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring in
judgment) (permitting municipality to use evidence that
adult theaters are correlated with harmful secondary effects
to support its claim that nude dancing is likely to produce
the same effects). This is not to say that a municipality can
get away with shoddy data or reasoning. The municipality's
evidence must fairly support the municipality's rationale
for its ordinance. If plaintiffs fail to cast direct doubt on
this rationale, either by demonstrating that the munici535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

439Cite as: 535 U. S. 425 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
pality's evidence does not support its rationale or by fur-nishing evidence that disputes the municipality's factual

findings, the municipality meets the standard set forth in
Renton. If plaintiffs succeed in casting doubt on a municipality's rationale in either manner, the burden shifts backto the municipality to supplement the record with evidence

renewing support for a theory that justifies its ordinance.
See, e. g., Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 298 (2000) (plu-rality opinion). This case is at a very early stage in this

process. It arrives on a summary judgment motion by re-spondents defended only by complaints that the 1977 study
fails to prove that the city's justification for its ordinance is
necessarily correct. Therefore, we conclude that the city, at
this stage of the litigation, has complied with the evidentiary
requirement in Renton.

Justice Souter faults the city for relying on the 1977
study not because the study fails to support the city's theory
that adult department stores, like adult minimalls, attract
customers and thus crime, but because the city does not
demonstrate that freestanding single-use adult establishments reduce crime. See post, at 460-462 (dissenting opinion). In effect, Justice Souter asks the city to demonstrate, not merely by appeal to common sense, but also with
empirical data, that its ordinance will successfully lower
crime. Our cases have never required that municipalities
make such a showing, certainly not without actual and convincing evidence from plaintiffs to the contrary. See, e. g.,
Barnes, supra, at 583-584 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). Such a requirement would go too far in undermining
our settled position that municipalities must be given a
" `reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions' " to
address the secondary effects of protected speech. Renton,
supra, at 52 (quoting Young v. American Mini Theatres,
Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 71 (1976) (plurality opinion)). A municipality considering an innovative solution may not have data
that could demonstrate the efficacy of its proposal because

440 LOS ANGELES v. ALAMEDA BOOKS, INC.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the solution would, by definition, not have been implementedpreviously. The city's ordinance banning multiple-use adult

establishments is such a solution. Respondents contendthat there are no adult video arcades in Los Angeles County
that operate independently of adult bookstores. See Brieffor Respondents 41. But without such arcades, the city does
not have a treatment group to compare with the control
group of multiple-use adult establishments, and without sucha comparison

Justice Souter would strike down the city's
ordinance. This leaves the city with no means to addressthe secondary effects with which it is concerned.

Our deference to the evidence presented by the city of Los
Angeles is the product of a careful balance between competing interests. On the one hand, we have an "obligation
to exercise independent judgment when First Amendment
rights are implicated." Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 666 (1994) (plurality opinion); see also
Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829,
843-844 (1978). On the other hand, we must acknowledge
that the Los Angeles City Council is in a better position than
the Judiciary to gather and evaluate data on local problems.
See Turner, supra, at 665-666; Erie, supra, at 297-298 (plurality opinion). We are also guided by the fact that Renton
requires that municipal ordinances receive only intermediate
scrutiny if they are content neutral. 475 U. S., at 48-50.
There is less reason to be concerned that municipalities will
use these ordinances to discriminate against unpopular
speech. See Erie, supra, at 298-299.

Justice Souter would have us rethink this balance, and
indeed the entire Renton framework. In Renton, the Court
distinguished the inquiry into whether a municipal ordinance is content neutral from the inquiry into whether it is
"designed to serve a substantial government interest and
do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication." 475 U. S., at 47-54. The former requires courts
to verify that the "predominate concerns" motivating the

Id.,
at 47 (emphasis deleted). The latter inquiry goes one stepfurther and asks whether the municipality can demonstrate

a connection between the speech regulated by the ordinanceand the secondary effects that motivated the adoption of the
ordinance. Only at this stage did Renton contemplate that
courts would examine evidence concerning regulated speechand secondary effects.

Id., at 50-52. Justice Souter
would either merge these two inquiries or move the eviden-tiary analysis into the inquiry on content neutrality, and

raise the evidentiary bar that a municipality must pass. His
logic is that verifying that the ordinance actually reduces the
secondary effects asserted would ensure that zoning regulations are not merely content-based regulations in disguise.
See post, at 457-458.

We think this proposal unwise. First, none of the parties
request the Court to depart from the Renton framework.
Nor is the proposal fairly encompassed in the question
presented, which focuses on the sorts of evidence upon
which the city may rely to demonstrate that its ordinance
is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest.
Pet. for Cert. i. Second, there is no evidence suggesting
that courts have difficulty determining whether municipal
ordinances are motivated primarily by the content of adult
speech or by its secondary effects without looking to evidence connecting such speech to the asserted secondary
effects. In this case, the Court of Appeals has not yet had
an opportunity to address the issue, having assumed for the
sake of argument that the city's ordinance is content neutral.

to reach the question of content neutrality before permitting
the lower court to pass upon it. Finally, Justice Souter

when "common experience" or "common assumptions" areincorrect, see post, at 459, but it is difficult for courts to know

ahead of time whether that condition is met. Municipalitieswill, in general, have greater experience with and understanding of the secondary effects that follow certain pro-tected speech than will the courts. See Erie, 529 U. S., at

The city of Los Angeles argues that its prohibition onmultiuse establishments draws further support from a study

of the poor health conditions in adult video arcades describedin

Hart Book Stores, a case that upheld a North Carolinaordinance similar to that challenged here. See 612 F. 2d,

at 828-829, n. 9. Respondents argue that the city cannotrely on evidence from Hart Book Stores because the city cannot prove it examined that evidence before it enacted thecurrent version of $ 12.70(C). Brief for Respondents 21.
Respondents note, moreover, that unsanitary conditions inadult video arcades would persist regardless of whether
arcades were operated in the same buildings as, say, adultbookstores.

Ibid.We do not, however, need to resolve the parties' dispute

over evidence cited in Hart Book Stores. Unlike the cityof Renton, the city of Los Angeles conducted its own study of
adult businesses. We have concluded that the Los Angelesstudy provides evidence to support the city's theory that a
concentration of adult operations in one locale attracts crime,and can be reasonably relied upon to demonstrate that
Los Angeles Municipal Code $ 12.70(C) (1983) is designedto promote the city's interest in reducing crime. Therefore,
the city need not present foreign studies to overcome thesummary judgment against it.

Before concluding, it should be noted that respondentsargue, as an alternative basis to sustain the Court of Appeals' judgment, that the Los Angeles ordinance is not atypical zoning regulation. Rather, respondents explain, the
prohibition on multiuse adult establishments is effectively aban on adult video arcades because no such business exists
independently of an adult bookstore. Brief for Respondents 12-13. Respondents request that the Court hold thatthe Los Angeles ordinance is not a time, place, and manner

regulation, and that the Court subject the ordinance to strictscrutiny. This also appears to be the theme of

Justice
Kennedy's concurrence. He contends that "[a] city may notassert that it will reduce secondary effects by reducing

speech in the same proportion." Post, at 449 (opinion concurring in judgment). We consider that unobjectionable
proposition as simply a reformulation of the requirement
that an ordinance warrants intermediate scrutiny only if it
is a time, place, and manner regulation and not a ban. The
Court of Appeals held, however, that the city's prohibition
on the combination of adult bookstores and arcades is not
a ban and respondents did not petition for review of that
determination.

Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment
granting summary judgment to respondents and remand the
case for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the plurality opinion because I think it represents
a correct application of our jurisprudence concerning regulation of the "secondary effects" of pornographic speech.
As I have said elsewhere, however, in a case such as this
our First Amendment traditions make "secondary effects"
analysis quite unnecessary. The Constitution does not prevent those communities that wish to do so from regulating, or indeed entirely suppressing, the business of pander535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing sex. See, e. g., Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 310(2000) (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); FW/PBS, Inc. v.
Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 256-261 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part).

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
Speech can produce tangible consequences. It can change
minds. It can prompt actions. These primary effects sig-nify the power and the necessity of free speech. Speech can

also cause secondary effects, however, unrelated to the im-pact of the speech on its audience. A newspaper factory
may cause pollution, and a billboard may obstruct a view.These secondary consequences are not always immune from
regulation by zoning laws even though they are producedby speech.

Municipal governments know that high concentrations of
adult businesses can damage the value and the integrity of a
neighborhood. The damage is measurable; it is all too real.
The law does not require a city to ignore these consequences
if it uses its zoning power in a reasonable way to ameliorate
them without suppressing speech. A city's "interest in attempting to preserve the quality of urban life is one that
must be accorded high respect." Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 71 (1976) (plurality opinion).

The question in this case is whether Los Angeles can seek
to reduce these tangible, adverse consequences by separating adult speech businesses from one another--even two
businesses that have always been under the same roof.
In my view our precedents may allow the city to impose its
regulation in the exercise of the zoning authority. The city
is not, at least, to be foreclosed by summary judgment, so
I concur in the judgment.

This separate statement seems to me necessary, however,
for two reasons. First, Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,
475 U. S. 41 (1986), described a similar ordinance as "content
neutral," and I agree with the dissent that the designation

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
is imprecise. Second, in my view, the plurality's applicationof Renton might constitute a subtle expansion, with which

I do not concur. I

In Renton, the Court determined that while the materialinside adult bookstores and movie theaters is speech, the
consequent sordidness outside is not. The challenge is tocorrect the latter while leaving the former, as far as possible,
untouched. If a city can decrease the crime and blight asso-ciated with certain speech by the traditional exercise of its
zoning power, and at the same time leave the quantity andaccessibility of the speech substantially undiminished, there
is no First Amendment objection. This is so even if themeasure identifies the problem outside by reference to the
speech inside--that is, even if the measure is in that sensecontent based.

On the other hand, a city may not regulate the secondaryeffects of speech by suppressing the speech itself. A city
may not, for example, impose a content-based fee or tax.See

Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S.221, 230 (1987) ("[O]fficial scrutiny of the content of publications as the basis for imposing a tax is entirely incompatiblewith the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the
press"). This is true even if the government purports tojustify the fee by reference to secondary effects. See

For-syth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 134-135

(1992). Though the inference may be inexorable that a citycould reduce secondary effects by reducing speech, this is not
a permissible strategy. The purpose and effect of a zoningordinance must be to reduce secondary effects and not to
reduce speech.A zoning measure can be consistent with the First Amendment if it is likely to cause a significant decrease in second-ary effects and a trivial decrease in the quantity of speech.
It is well documented that multiple adult businesses inclose proximity may change the character of a neighborhood

446 LOS ANGELES v. ALAMEDA BOOKS, INC.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
for the worse. Those same businesses spread across the
city may not have the same deleterious effects. At least
in theory, a dispersal ordinance causes these businesses to
separate rather than to close, so negative externalities are
diminished but speech is not.

The calculus is a familiar one to city planners, for many
enterprises other than adult businesses also cause undesirable externalities. Factories, for example, may cause
pollution, so a city may seek to reduce the cost of that externality by restricting factories to areas far from residential
neighborhoods. With careful urban planning a city in this
way may reduce the costs of pollution for communities, while
at the same time allowing the productive work of the factories to continue. The challenge is to protect the activity
inside while controlling side effects outside.

Such an ordinance might, like a speech restriction, be "content based." It might, for example, single out slaughterhouses for specific zoning treatment, restricting them to a
particularly remote part of town. Without knowing more,
however, one would hardly presume that because the ordinance is specific to that business, the city seeks to discriminate against it or help a favored group. One would
presume, rather, that the ordinance targets not the business
but its particular noxious side effects. But cf. SlaughterHouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873). The business might well
be the city's most valued enterprise; nevertheless, because
of the pollution it causes, it may warrant special zoning treatment. This sort of singling out is not impermissible content
discrimination; it is sensible urban planning. Cf. Village
of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 388 (1926)
("A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong
place,--like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard. If
the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be
allowed to control").

447Cite as: 535 U. S. 425 (2002)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
True, the First Amendment protects speech and not
slaughterhouses. But in both contexts, the inference of impermissible discrimination is not strong. An equally strong
inference is that the ordinance is targeted not at the activity,
but at its side effects. If a zoning ordinance is directed to
the secondary effects of adult speech, the ordinance does
not necessarily constitute impermissible content discrimination. A zoning law need not be blind to the secondary
effects of adult speech, so long as the purpose of the law is
not to suppress it.

The ordinance at issue in this case is not limited to expressive activities. It also extends, for example, to massage
parlors, which the city has found to cause similar secondary effects. See Los Angeles Municipal Code $$ 12.70(B)(8)
(1978), 12.70(B)(17) (1983), 12.70(C) (1986), as amended.
This ordinance, moreover, is just one part of an elaborate
web of land-use regulations in Los Angeles, all of which are
intended to promote the social value of the land as a whole
without suppressing some activities or favoring others.
See $ 12.02 ("The purpose of this article is to consolidate and
coordinate all existing zoning regulations and provisions into
one comprehensive zoning plan . . . in order to encourage the
most appropriate use of land . . . and to promote the health,
safety, and the general welfare . . ."). All this further suggests that the ordinance is more in the nature of a typical
land-use restriction and less in the nature of a law suppressing speech.

For these reasons, the ordinance is not so suspect that we
must employ the usual rigorous analysis that content-based
laws demand in other instances. The ordinance may be a
covert attack on speech, but we should not presume it to
be so. In the language of our First Amendment doctrine
it calls for intermediate and not strict scrutiny, as we held
in Renton.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment

II
In Renton, the Court began by noting that a zoning ordi-nance is a time, place, or manner restriction. The Court

then proceeded to consider the question whether the ordi-nance was "content based." The ordinance "by its terms
[was] designed to prevent crime, protect the city's retailtrade, maintain property values, and generally protec[t] and
preserv[e] the quality of [the city's] neighborhoods, commer-cial districts, and the quality of urban life, not to suppress
the expression of unpopular views." 475 U. S., at 48 (inter-nal quotation marks omitted). On this premise, the Court
designated the restriction "content neutral." Ibid.The Court appeared to recognize, however, that the designation was something of a fiction, which, perhaps, is whyit kept the phrase in quotes. After all, whether a statute is
content neutral or content based is something that can bedetermined on the face of it; if the statute describes speech
by content then it is content based. And the ordinance inRenton "treat[ed] theaters that specialize in adult films
differently from other kinds of theaters." Id., at 47. Thefiction that this sort of ordinance is content neutral--or
"content neutral"--is perhaps more confusing than helpful,as

Justice Souter demonstrates, see post, at 457 (dissent-ing opinion). It is also not a fiction that has commanded our

consistent adherence. See Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist.,534 U. S. 316, 322, and n. 2 (2002) (suggesting that a licensing
scheme targeting only those businesses purveying sexuallyexplicit speech is not content neutral). These ordinances
are content based, and we should call them so.Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed above, the central holding of Renton is sound: A zoning restriction thatis designed to decrease secondary effects and not speech
should be subject to intermediate rather than strict scrutiny.Generally, the government has no power to restrict speech
based on content, but there are exceptions to the rule. See
Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime

535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 126-127 (1991) (Kennedy, J., con-curring in judgment). And zoning regulations do not automatically raise the specter of impermissible content dis-crimination, even if they are content based, because they
have a prima facie legitimate purpose: to limit the negativeexternalities of land use. As a matter of common experience, these sorts of ordinances are more like a zoning re-striction on slaughterhouses and less like a tax on unpopular
newspapers. The zoning context provides a built-in legiti-mate rationale, which rebuts the usual presumption that
content-based restrictions are unconstitutional. For thisreason, we apply intermediate rather than strict scrutiny.

III
The narrow question presented in this case is whether theordinance at issue is invalid "because the city did not study

the negative effects of such combinations of adult businesses,but rather relied on judicially approved statutory precedent
from other jurisdictions." Pet. for Cert. i. This question isactually two questions. First, what proposition does a city
need to advance in order to sustain a secondary-effects ordi-nance? Second, how much evidence is required to support
the proposition? The plurality skips to the second questionand gives the correct answer; but in my view more attention
must be given to the first.At the outset, we must identify the claim a city must make
in order to justify a content-based zoning ordinance. As dis-cussed above, a city must advance some basis to show that
its regulation has the purpose and effect of suppressingsecondary effects, while leaving the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact. The ordinance mayidentify the speech based on content, but only as a shorthand for identifying the secondary effects outside. A citymay not assert that it will reduce secondary effects by reducing speech in the same proportion. On this point, I agreewith

Justice Souter. See post, at 457. The rationale of

535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
450 LOS ANGELES v. ALAMEDA BOOKS, INC.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
the ordinance must be that it will suppress secondary ef-fects--and not by suppressing speech.

The plurality's statement of the proposition to be sup-ported is somewhat different. It suggests that Los Angeles
could reason as follows: (1) "a concentration of operations inone locale draws . . . a greater concentration of adult consumers to the neighborhood, and a high density of such
consumers either attracts or generates criminal activity";(2) "having a number of adult operations in one single

adult establishment draws the same dense foot traffic ashaving a number of distinct adult establishments in close
proximity"; (3) "reducing the concentration of adult operations in a neighborhood, whether within separate establishments or in one large establishment, will reduce crime
rates." Ante, at 436.

These propositions all seem reasonable, and the inferences
required to get from one to the next are sensible. Nevertheless, this syllogism fails to capture an important part
of the inquiry. The plurality's analysis does not address how
speech will fare under the city's ordinance. As discussed,
the necessary rationale for applying intermediate scrutiny is
the promise that zoning ordinances like this one may reduce
the costs of secondary effects without substantially reducing
speech. For this reason, it does not suffice to say that inconvenience will reduce demand and fewer patrons will lead
to fewer secondary effects. This reasoning would as easily
justify a content-based tax: Increased prices will reduce
demand, and fewer customers will mean fewer secondary
effects. But a content-based tax may not be justified in this
manner. See Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland,
481 U. S. 221 (1987); Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123 (1992). It is no trick to reduce secondary
effects by reducing speech or its audience; but a city may not
attack secondary effects indirectly by attacking speech.

The analysis requires a few more steps. If two adult businesses are under the same roof, an ordinance requiring them

535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

451Cite as: 535 U. S. 425 (2002)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
to separate will have one of two results: One business willeither move elsewhere or close. The city's premise cannot

be the latter. It is true that cutting adult speech in halfwould probably reduce secondary effects proportionately.
But again, a promised proportional reduction does not suf-fice. Content-based taxes could achieve that, yet these are
impermissible.

The premise, therefore, must be that businesses--eventhose that have always been under one roof--will for the

most part disperse rather than shut down. True, this prem-ise has its own conundrum. As

Justice Souter writes,
"[t]he city . . . claims no interest in the proliferation of adult
establishments." Post, at 461. The claim, therefore, must
be that this ordinance will cause two businesses to split
rather than one to close, that the quantity of speech will be
substantially undiminished, and that total secondary effects
will be significantly reduced. This must be the rationale of
a dispersal statute.

Only after identifying the proposition to be proved can
we ask the second part of the question presented: is there
sufficient evidence to support the proposition? As to this,
we have consistently held that a city must have latitude to
experiment, at least at the outset, and that very little evidence is required. See, e. g., Renton, 475 U. S., at 51-52
("The First Amendment does not require a city, before enacting such an ordinance, to conduct new studies or produce
evidence independent of that already generated by other
cities, so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is
reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the
city addresses"); Young, 427 U. S., at 71 ("[T]he city must be
allowed a reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems"); Erie v. Pap's A. M.,
529 U. S. 277, 300-301 (2000) (plurality opinion). As a general matter, courts should not be in the business of secondguessing fact-bound empirical assessments of city planners.
See Renton, supra, at 51-52. The Los Angeles City Coun535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cil knows the streets of Los Angeles better than we do.
See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,
665-666 (1994); Erie, supra, at 297-298 (plurality opinion).
It is entitled to rely on that knowledge; and if its inferences
appear reasonable, we should not say there is no basis for
its conclusion.

In this case the proposition to be shown is supported by
a single study and common experience. The city's study
shows a correlation between the concentration of adult establishments and crime. Two or more adult businesses in
close proximity seem to attract a critical mass of unsavory
characters, and the crime rate may increase as a result.
The city, therefore, sought to disperse these businesses.
Los Angeles Municipal Code $ 12.70(C) (1983), as amended.
This original ordinance is not challenged here, and we may
assume that it is constitutional.

If we assume that the study supports the original ordinance, then most of the necessary analysis follows. We may
posit that two adult stores next door to each other attract
100 patrons per day. The two businesses split apart might
attract 49 patrons each. (Two patrons, perhaps, will be
discouraged by the inconvenience of the separation--a relatively small cost to speech.) On the other hand, the reduction in secondary effects might be dramatic, because
secondary effects may require a critical mass. Depending
on the economics of vice, 100 potential customers/victims
might attract a coterie of thieves, prostitutes, and other
ne'er-do-wells; yet 49 might attract none at all. If so, a
dispersal ordinance would cause a great reduction in secondary effects at very small cost to speech. Indeed, the very
absence of secondary effects might increase the audience
for the speech; perhaps for every two people who are discouraged by the inconvenience of two-stop shopping, another
two are encouraged by hospitable surroundings. In that
case, secondary effects might be eliminated at no cost to

Souter, J., dissenting
speech whatsoever, and both the city and the speaker willhave their interests well served.

Only one small step remains to justify the ordinance atissue in this case. The city may next infer--from its study
and from its own experience--that two adult businessesunder the same roof are no better than two next door. The
city could reach the reasonable conclusion that knockingdown the wall between two adult businesses does not ameliorate any undesirable secondary effects of their proximityto one another. If the city's first ordinance was justified,
therefore, then the second is too. Dispersing two adult busi-nesses under one roof is reasonably likely to cause a substantial reduction in secondary effects while reducing speechvery little.

IV
These propositions are well established in common experi-ence and in zoning policies that we have already examined,

and for these reasons this ordinance is not invalid on its face.If these assumptions can be proved unsound at trial, then
the ordinance might not withstand intermediate scrutiny.The ordinance does, however, survive the summary judgment motion that the Court of Appeals ordered granted inthis case.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, and with whom Justice Breyerjoins as to Part II, dissenting.

In 1977, the city of Los Angeles studied sections of thecity with high and low concentrations of adult business establishments catering to the market for the erotic. The cityfound no certain correlation between the location of those
establishments and depressed property values, but it didfind some correlation between areas of higher concentrations of such business and higher crime rates. On thatbasis, Los Angeles followed the examples of other cities in
adopting a zoning ordinance requiring dispersion of adult

establishments. I assume that the ordinance was consti-tutional when adopted, see, e. g., Young v. American Mini

Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976), and assume for pur-poses of this case that the original ordinance remains valid
today.1The city subsequently amended its ordinance to forbid
clusters of such businesses at one address, as in a mall. Thecity has, in turn, taken a third step to apply this amendment
to prohibit even a single proprietor from doing business in atraditional way that combines an adult bookstore, selling
books, magazines, and videos, with an adult arcade, consist-ing of open viewing booths, where potential purchasers of
videos can view them for a fee.From a policy of dispersing adult establishments, the city
has thus moved to a policy of dividing them in two. Thejustification claimed for this application of the new policy
remains, however, the 1977 survey, as supplemented by theauthority of one decided case on regulating adult arcades in
another State. The case authority is not on point, see infra,at 461-462, n. 4, and the 1977 survey provides no support
for the breakup policy. Its evidentiary insufficiency bearsemphasis and is the principal reason that I respectfully dissent from the Court's judgment today.

This ordinance stands or falls on the results of what ourcases speak of as intermediate scrutiny, generally contrasted with the demanding standard applied under the FirstAmendment to a content-based regulation of expression.
The variants of middle-tier tests cover a grab bag of restric-tive statutes, with a corresponding variety of justifications.

1 Although amicus First Amendment Lawyers Association argues that
recent studies refute the findings of adult business correlations with
secondary effects sufficient to justify such an ordinance, Brief for First
Amendment Lawyers Association as Amicus Curiae 21-23, the issue is
one I do not reach.

Souter, J., dissenting
While spoken of as content neutral, these regulations are notuniformly distinct from the content-based regulations calling

for scrutiny that is strict, and zoning of businesses based ontheir sales of expressive adult material receives mid-level
scrutiny, even though it raises a risk of content-based restric-tion. It is worth being clear, then, on how close to a content
basis adult business zoning can get, and why the application
of a middle-tier standard to zoning regulation of adult book-stores calls for particular care.

Because content-based regulation applies to expression byvery reason of what is said, it carries a high risk that expressive limits are imposed for the sake of suppressing a message
that is disagreeable to listeners or readers, or the government. See Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 536 (1980) ("[W]hen regulation is based on the content of speech, governmental action
must be scrutinized more carefully to ensure that communication has not been prohibited merely because public officials
disapprove the speaker's views" (internal quotation marks
omitted)). A restriction based on content survives only on
a showing of necessity to serve a legitimate and compelling
governmental interest, combined with least restrictive narrow tailoring to serve it, see United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000); since merely
protecting listeners from offense at the message is not a legitimate interest of the government, see Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 24-25 (1971), strict scrutiny leaves few
survivors.

The comparatively softer intermediate scrutiny is reserved for regulations justified by something other than content of the message, such as a straightforward restriction
going only to the time, place, or manner of speech or other
expression. It is easy to see why review of such a regulation may be relatively relaxed. No one has to disagree with
any message to find something wrong with a loudspeaker at
three in the morning, see Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77

(1949); the sentiment may not provoke, but being blasted outof a sound sleep does. In such a case, we ask simply

whether the regulation is "narrowly tailored to serve a sig-nificant governmental interest, and . . . leave[s] open ample
alternative channels for communication of the information."Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.

to regulation for nonexpressive purposes, the best known ex-ample being the prohibition on destroying draft cards as an
act of protest, United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968);here a regulation passes muster "if it furthers an important
or substantial governmental interest . . . unrelated to thesuppression of free expression" by a restriction "no greater
than is essential to the furtherance of that interest," id., at377. As mentioned already, yet another middle-tier variety
is zoning restriction as a means of responding to the "sec-ondary effects" of adult businesses, principally crime and
declining property values in the neighborhood. Renton v.Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 49 (1986).

Although this type of land-use restriction has even beencalled a variety of time, place, or manner regulation, id., at

46, equating a secondary-effects zoning regulation with amere regulation of time, place, or manner jumps over an
important difference between them. A restriction on loud-speakers has no obvious relationship to the substance of

2 Limiting such effects qualifies as a substantial governmental interest,
and an ordinance has been said to survive if it is shown to serve such
ends without unreasonably limiting alternatives. Renton, 475 U. S., at 50.
Because Renton called its secondary-effects ordinance a mere time, place,
or manner restriction and thereby glossed over the role of content in
secondary-effects zoning, see infra this page and 457, I believe the soft
focus of its statement of the middle-tier test should be rejected in favor
of the United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968), formulation quoted
above. O'Brien is a closer relative of secondary-effects zoning than mere
time, place, or manner regulations, as the Court has implicitly recognized.

what is broadcast, while a zoning regulation of businesses inadult expression just as obviously does. And while it may

be true that an adult business is burdened only because of itssecondary effects, it is clearly burdened only if its expressive
products have adult content. Thus, the Court has recog-nized that this kind of regulation, though called content neutral, occupies a kind of limbo between full-blown, contentbased restrictions and regulations that apply without anyreference to the substance of what is said.

Id., at 47.
It would in fact make sense to give this kind of zoningregulation a First Amendment label of its own, and if we

called it content correlated, we would not only describe it for
what it is, but keep alert to a risk of content-based regulation
that it poses. The risk lies in the fact that when a law applies selectively only to speech of particular content, the
more precisely the content is identified, the greater is the
opportunity for government censorship. Adult speech refers not merely to sexually explicit content, but to speech
reflecting a favorable view of being explicit about sex and a
favorable view of the practices it depicts; a restriction on
adult content is thus also a restriction turning on a particular
viewpoint, of which the government may disapprove.

This risk of viewpoint discrimination is subject to a relatively simple safeguard, however. If combating secondary
effects of property devaluation and crime is truly the reason
for the regulation, it is possible to show by empirical evidence that the effects exist, that they are caused by the expressive activity subject to the zoning, and that the zoning
can be expected either to ameliorate them or to enhance the
capacity of the government to combat them (say, by concentrating them in one area), without suppressing the expressive activity itself. This capacity of zoning regulation
to address the practical problems without eliminating the
speech is, after all, the only possible excuse for speaking
of secondary-effects zoning as akin to time, place, or manner regulations.

458 LOS ANGELES v. ALAMEDA BOOKS, INC.

Souter, J., dissenting
In examining claims that there are causal relationships
between adult businesses and an increase in secondary effects (distinct from disagreement), and between zoning and
the mitigation of the effects, stress needs to be placed on
the empirical character of the demonstration available. See
Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 510 (1981)
("[J]udgments . . . defying objective evaluation . . . must
be carefully scrutinized to determine if they are only a
public rationalization of an impermissible purpose"); Young,
427 U. S., at 84 (Powell, J., concurring) ("[C]ourts must be
alert . . . to the possibility of using the power to zone as a
pretext for suppressing expression"). The weaker the demonstration of facts distinct from disapproval of the "adult"
viewpoint, the greater the likelihood that nothing more than
condemnation of the viewpoint drives the regulation.3

Equal stress should be placed on the point that requiring
empirical justification of claims about property value or
crime is not demanding anything Herculean. Increased
crime, like prostitution and muggings, and declining property values in areas surrounding adult businesses, are all
readily observable, often to the untrained eye and certainly
to the police officer and urban planner. These harms can be
shown by police reports, crime statistics, and studies of mar3 Regulation of commercial speech, which is like secondary-effects zoning in being subject to an intermediate level of First Amendment scrutiny,
see Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.,
447 U. S. 557, 569 (1980), provides an instructive parallel in the cases enforcing an evidentiary requirement to ensure that an asserted rationale
does not cloak an illegitimate governmental motive. See, e. g., Rubin v.
Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 487 (1995); Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S.
761 (1993). The government's "burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture," but only by "demonstrat[ing] that the harms [the government] recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them
to a material degree." Id., at 770-771. For unless this "critical" requirement is met, Rubin, supra, at 487, "a State could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves
justify a burden on commercial expression," Edenfield, supra, at 771.

ket value, all of which are within a municipality's capacity oravailable from the distilled experiences of comparable communities. See, e. g., Renton, supra, at 51; Young, supra, at55.

And precisely because this sort of evidence is readily avail-able, reviewing courts need to be wary when the government
appeals, not to evidence, but to an uncritical common sense
in an effort to justify such a zoning restriction. It is notthat common sense is always illegitimate in First Amendment demonstration. The need for independent proof varieswith the point that has to be established, and zoning can be
supported by common experience when there is no reason to
question it. We have appealed to common sense in analogous cases, even if we have disagreed about how far it took
us. See Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 300-301 (2000)
(plurality opinion); id., at 313, and n. 2 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But we must be careful
about substituting common assumptions for evidence, when
the evidence is as readily available as public statistics and
municipal property valuations, lest we find out when the evidence is gathered that the assumptions are highly debatable.
The record in this very case makes the point. It has become
a commonplace, based on our own cases, that concentrating
adult establishments drives down the value of neighboring
property used for other purposes. See Renton, 475 U. S., at
51; Young, supra, at 55. In fact, however, the city found
that general assumption unjustified by its 1977 study. App.
39, 45.

The lesson is that the lesser scrutiny applied to contentcorrelated zoning restrictions is no excuse for a government's failure to provide a factual demonstration for claims it
makes about secondary effects; on the contrary, this is what
demands the demonstration. See, e. g., Schad v. Mount
Ephraim, 452 U. S. 61, 72-74 (1981). In this case, however,
the government has not shown that bookstores containing
viewing booths, isolated from other adult establishments, in535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

crease crime or produce other negative secondary effects insurrounding neighborhoods, and we are thus left without

substantial justification for viewing the city's First Amend-ment restriction as content correlated but not simply content
based. By the same token, the city has failed to show anycausal relationship between the breakup policy and elimination or regulation of secondary effects.

II
Our cases on the subject have referred to studies, under-taken with varying degrees of formality, showing the geographical correlations between the presence or concentrationof adult business establishments and enhanced crime rates
or depressed property values. See, e. g., Renton, supra, at50-51; Young, 427 U. S., at 55. Although we have held that
intermediate scrutiny of secondary-effects legislation doesnot demand a fresh evidentiary study of its factual basis if
the published results of investigations elsewhere are "rea-sonably" thought to be applicable in a different municipal
setting, Renton, supra, at 51-52, the city here took responsi-bility to make its own enquiry, App. 35-162. As already
mentioned, the study was inconclusive as to any correlationbetween adult business and lower property values, id., at 45,
and it reported no association between higher crime ratesand any isolated adult establishments. But it did find a geographical correlation of higher concentrations of adult estab-lishments with higher crime rates,

id., at 43, and with thisstudy in hand, Los Angeles enacted its 1978 ordinance requiring dispersion of adult stores and theaters. This origi-nal position of the ordinance is not challenged today, and I
will assume its justification on the theory accepted in Young,that eliminating concentrations of adult establishments will
spread out the documented secondary effects and renderthem more manageable that way.

The application of the 1983 amendment now before us is,however, a different matter. My concern is not with the

assumption behind the amendment itself, that a conglomera-tion of adult businesses under one roof, as in a minimall or

adult department store, will produce undesirable secondaryeffects comparable to what a cluster of separate adult establishments brings about, ante, at 436. That may or may notbe so. The assumption that is clearly unsupported, however, goes to the city's supposed interest in applying theamendment to the book and video stores in question, and in
applying it to break them up. The city, of course, claimsno interest in the proliferation of adult establishments, the
ostensible consequence of splitting the sales and viewing ac-tivities so as to produce two stores where once there was
one. Nor does the city assert any interest in limiting thesale of adult expressive material as such, or reducing the
number of adult video booths in the city, for that would beclear content-based regulation, and the city was careful in
its 1977 report to disclaim any such intent. App. 54.4

4 Finally, the city does not assert an interest in curbing any secondary
effects within the combined bookstore-arcades. In Hart Book Stores, Inc.
v. Edmisten, 612 F. 2d 821 (1979), the Fourth Circuit upheld a similar
ban in North Carolina, relying in part on a county health department
report on the results of an inspection of several of the combined adult
bookstore-video arcades in Wake County, North Carolina. Id., at 828-829,
n. 9. The inspection revealed unsanitary conditions and evidence of salacious activities taking place within the video cubicles. Ibid. The city
introduces this case to defend its breakup policy although it is not clear
from the opinion how separating these video arcades from the adult
bookstores would deter the activities that took place within them. In
any event, while Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986),
allowed a city to rely on the experiences and studies of other cities, it
did not dispense with the requirement that "whatever evidence the city
relies upon [be] reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that
the city addresses," id., at 51-52, and the evidence relied upon by the
Fourth Circuit is certainly not necessarily relevant to the Los Angeles
ordinance. Since November 1977, five years before the enactment of the
ordinance at issue, Los Angeles has regulated adult video booths, prohibiting doors, setting minimum levels of lighting, and requiring that their
interiors be fully visible from the entrance to the premises. Los Angeles
Municipal Code $$ 103.101(i), (j). Thus, it seems less likely that the un535US2 Unit: $U43 [10-01-03 18:26:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
Rather, the city apparently assumes that a bookstore sell-ing videos and providing viewing booths produces secondary

effects of crime, and more crime than would result from hav-ing a single store without booths in one part of town and a
video arcade in another.5 But the city neither says this in
so many words nor proffers any evidence to support even the
simple proposition that an otherwise lawfully located adult
bookstore combined with video booths will produce any
criminal effects. The Los Angeles study treats such combined stores as one, see id., at 81-82, and draws no general
conclusion that individual stores spread apart from other
adult establishments (as under the basic Los Angeles ordinance) are associated with any degree of criminal activity
above the general norm; nor has the city called the Court's
attention to any other empirical study, or even anecdotal
police evidence, that supports the city's assumption. In fact,
if the Los Angeles study sheds any light whatever on the
city's position, it is the light of skepticism, for we may fairly
suspect that the study said nothing about the secondary
effects of freestanding stores because no effects were observed. The reasonable supposition, then, is that splitting
some of them up will have no consequence for secondary
effects whatever.6

sanitary conditions identified in Hart Book Stores would exist in video
arcades in Los Angeles, and the city has suggested no evidence that they
do. For that reason, Hart Book Stores gives no indication of a substantial
governmental interest that the ban on multiuse adult establishments
would further.

5 The plurality indulges the city's assumption but goes no further to

justify it than stating what is obvious from what the city's study says
about concentrations of adult establishments (but not isolated ones): the
presence of several adult businesses in one neighborhood draws "a greater
concentration of adult consumers to the neighborhood, [which] either attracts or generates criminal activity." Ante, at 436.

6 In Renton, the Court approved a zoning ordinance "aimed at preventing the secondary effects caused by the presence of even one such theater

Souter, J., dissenting
The inescapable point is that the city does not even claimthat the 1977 study provides any support for its assumption.

We have previously accepted studies, like the city's ownstudy here, as showing a causal connection between concentrations of adult business and identified secondary effects.7Since that is an acceptable basis for requiring adult businesses to disperse when they are housed in separate prem-ises, there is certainly a relevant argument to be made that
restricting their concentration at one spacious addressshould have some effect on sales and traffic, and effects in the
neighborhood. But even if that argument may justify a banon adult "minimalls,"

ante, at 436, it provides no support forwhat the city proposes to do here. The bookstores involved

here are not concentrations of traditionally separate adultbusinesses that have been studied and shown to have an
association with secondary effects, and they exemplify nonew form of concentration like a mall under one roof. They
are combinations of selling and viewing activities that havecommonly been combined, and the plurality itself recognizes,
ante, at 438, that no study conducted by the city has reportedthat this type of traditional business, any more than any
other adult business, has a correlation with secondary effects
in a given neighborhood." 475 U. S., at 50. The city, however, does not
appeal to that decision to show that combined bookstore-arcades isolated
from other adult establishments, like the theaters in Renton, give rise to
negative secondary effects, perhaps recognizing that such a finding would
only call into doubt the sensibility of the city's decision to proliferate
such businesses. See ante, at 438. Although the question may be open
whether a city can rely on the experiences of other cities when they contradict its own studies, that question is not implicated here, as Los
Angeles relies exclusively on its own study, which is tellingly silent on
the question whether isolated adult establishments have any bearing on
criminal activity.

7 As already noted, n. 1, supra, amicus First Amendment Lawyers

Association argues that more recent studies show no such thing, but
this case involves no such challenge to the previously accepted causal
connection.

in the absence of concentration with other adult establish-ments in the neighborhood. And even if splitting viewing

booths from the bookstores that continue to sell videos wereto turn some customers away (or send them in search of
video arcades in other neighborhoods), it is nothing but spec-ulation to think that marginally lower traffic to one store
would have any measurable effect on the neighborhood, letalone an effect on associated crime that has never been
shown to exist in the first place.8Nor is the plurality's position bolstered, as it seems to
think, ante, at 439, by relying on the statement in Rentonthat courts should allow cities a " `reasonable opportunity to
experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems,' "475 U. S., at 52. The plurality overlooks a key distinction
between the zoning regulations at issue in Renton and

8 Justice Kennedy would indulge the city in this speculation, so long
as it could show that the ordinance will "leav[e] the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact." Ante, at 449 (opinion concurring
in judgment). But the suggestion that the speculated consequences may
justify content-correlated regulation if speech is only slightly burdened
turns intermediate scrutiny on its head. Although the goal of intermediate scrutiny is to filter out laws that unduly burden speech, this is
achieved by examining the asserted governmental interest, not the burden
on speech, which must simply be no greater than necessary to further that
interest. Erie, 529 U. S., at 301; see also n. 2, supra. Nor has Justice
Kennedy even shown that this ordinance leaves speech "substantially
intact." He posits an example in which two adult stores draw 100 customers, and each business operating separately draws 49. Ante, at 452. It
does not follow, however, that a combined bookstore-arcade that draws
100 customers, when split, will yield a bookstore and arcade that together
draw nearly that many customers. Given the now double outlays required to operate the businesses at different locations, see infra, at 466,
the far more likely outcome is that the stand-alone video store will go out
of business. (Of course, the bookstore owner could, consistently with the
ordinance, continue to operate video booths at no charge, but if this were
always commercially feasible then the city would face the separate problem that under no theory could a rule simply requiring that video booths
be operated for free be said to reduce secondary effects.)

Young (and in Los Angeles as of 1978), and this new Los
Angeles breakup requirement. In those two cases, the municipalities' substantial interest for purposes of intermediate
scrutiny was an interest in choosing between two strategies
to deal with crime or property value, each strategy tied to
the businesses' location, which had been shown to have a
causal connection with the secondary effects: the municipality could either concentrate businesses for a concentrated
regulatory strategy, or disperse them in order to spread out
its regulatory efforts. The limitations on location required
no further support than the factual basis tying location to
secondary effects; the zoning approved in those two cases
had no effect on the way the owners of the stores carried
on their adult businesses beyond controlling location, and no
heavier burden than the location limit was approved by this
Court.

The Los Angeles ordinance, however, does impose a heavier burden, and one lacking any demonstrable connection to
the interest in crime control. The city no longer accepts
businesses as their owners choose to conduct them within
their own four walls, but bars a video arcade in a bookstore,
a combination shown by the record to be commercially natural, if not universal. App. 47-51, 229-230, 242. Whereas
Young and Renton gave cities the choice between two strategies when each was causally related to the city's interest, the
plurality today gives Los Angeles a right to "experiment"
with a First Amendment restriction in response to a problem
of increased crime that the city has never even shown to be
associated with combined bookstore-arcades standing alone.
But the government's freedom of experimentation cannot
displace its burden under the intermediate scrutiny standard
to show that the restriction on speech is no greater than
essential to realizing an important objective, in this case
policing crime. Since we cannot make even a best guess
that the city's breakup policy will have any effect on crime

or law enforcement, we are a very far cry from any assuranceagainst covert content-based regulation.

And concern with content-based regulation targeting aviewpoint is right to the point here, as witness a fact that

involves no guesswork. If we take the city's breakup policyat its face, enforcing it will mean that in every case two
establishments will operate instead of the traditional one.Since the city presumably does not wish merely to multiply
adult establishments, it makes sense to ask what offsettinggain the city may obtain from its new breakup policy. The
answer may lie in the fact that two establishments in placeof one will entail two business overheads in place of one: two
monthly rents, two electricity bills, two payrolls. Everymonth business will be more expensive than it used to be,
perhaps even twice as much. That sounds like a good strat-egy for driving out expressive adult businesses. It sounds,
in other words, like a policy of content-based regulation.I respectfully dissent.

9 The plurality's assumption that the city's "motive" in applying
secondary-effects zoning can be entirely compartmentalized from the proffer of evidence required to justify the zoning scheme, ante, at 440-441, is
indulgent to an unrealistic degree, as the record in this case shows. When
the original dispersion ordinance was enacted in 1978, the city's study
showing a correlation between concentrations of adult business and higher
crime rates showed that the dispersal of adult businesses was causally
related to the city's law enforcement interest, and that in turn was a fair
indication that the city's concern was with the secondary effect of higher
crime rates. When, however, the city takes the further step of breaking
up businesses with no showing that a traditionally combined business has
any association with a higher crime rate that could be affected by the
breakup, there is no indication that the breakup policy addresses a secondary effect, but there is reason to doubt that secondary effects are the city's
concern. The plurality seems to ask us to shut our eyes to the city's
failings by emphasizing that this case is merely at the stage of summary
judgment, ante, at 439, but ignores the fact that at this summary judgment
stage the city has made it plain that it relies on no evidence beyond the
1977 study, which provides no support for the city's action.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 00-511. Argued October 10, 2001--Decided May 13, 2002*
In order to foster competition between monopolistic carriers providing

local telephone service and companies seeking to enter local markets,
provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act) entitle the new
entrants to lease elements of the incumbent carriers' local-exchange
networks, 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c), and direct the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to prescribe methods for state utility commissions
to use in setting rates for the sharing of those elements, $ 252(d). Such
"just and reasonable rates" must, inter alia, be "based on the cost
(determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-based
proceeding) of providing the . . . network element." $ 252(d)(1)(A)(i).
Regulations appended to the FCC's First Report and Order under the
Act provide, among other things, for the treatment of "cost" under

$ 252(d)(1)(A)(i) as "forward-looking economic cost," 47 CFR $ 51.505,
something distinct from the kind of historically based cost previously
relied on in valuing a rate base, see, e. g., FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co.,
320 U. S. 591, 596-598, 605; define the "forward-looking economic cost
of an element [as] the sum of (1) the total element long-run incremental cost of the element [TELRIC,] and (2) a reasonable allocation of
forward-looking common costs," $ 51.505(a), "incurred in providing a
group of elements that "cannot be attributed directly to individual elements," $ 51.505(c)(1); and, most importantly, specify that the TELRIC
"should be measured based on the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available and the lowest cost network configuration, given the existing location of the incumbent['s] wire

ments for an entrant, unless the combination is not technically feasible.

$$ 51.315(b)-(f). Challenges to the regulations, mostly by incumbent
carriers and state commissions, were consolidated in the Eighth Circuit,
which initially held, inter alia, that the FCC had no authority to control
state commissions' ratesetting methodology and that the FCC misconstrued $ 251(c)(3)'s plain language in implementing the combination
rules. Reversing in large part in AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd.,
525 U. S. 366, 384-385, this Court, among its rulings, upheld the FCC's
jurisdiction to impose a new ratesetting methodology on the States
and reinstated the principal combination rule, Rule 315(b), which forbids incumbents to separate currently combined network elements before leasing them to entrants who ask for them in a combined form.
On remand, the incumbents' primary challenge went to the FCC's ratesetting methodology. The Eighth Circuit understood $ 252(d)(1) to be
ambiguous as between "forward-looking" and "historical" cost, so that
a forward-looking ratesetting method would presumably be reasonable, but held that $ 252(d)(1) foreclosed the use of the TELRIC methodology because the Act plainly required rates based on the actual,
not hypothetical, cost of providing the network element. The court also
invalidated the additional combination rules, Rules 315(c)-(f), reading

$ 251(c)(3)'s reference to "allow[ing] requesting carriers to combine . . .
elements" as unambiguously requiring requesting carriers, not providing incumbents, to do any and all combining.

Held:

1. The FCC can require state commissions to set the rates charged
by incumbents for leased elements on a forward-looking basis untied
to the incumbents' investment. Because the incumbents have not met
their burden of showing unreasonableness to defeat the deference due
the FCC, see Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-845, the Eighth Circuit's judgment is reversed insofar as it invalidated TELRIC. Pp. 497-528.

(A) This Court rejects the incumbents' argument that "cost" in

$ 252(d)(1)'s requirement that "the . . . rate . . . be . . . based on the cost
. . . of providing the . . . network element" can only mean, in plain
language and in this particular technical context, the past cost to an
incumbent of furnishing the specific network element actually, physically, to be provided, as distinct from its value or the price that would
be paid for it on the open market. At the most basic level of common
usage, "cost" has no such clear implication. A merchant asked about
the "cost" of his goods may reasonably quote their current wholesale
market price, not the cost of the items on his shelves, which he may
have bought at higher or lower prices. When the reference shifts into

the technical realm, the incumbents are still unconvincing. "Cost" as
used in calculating the rate base under the traditional cost-of-service
method did not stand for all past capital expenditures, but at most for
those that were prudent, while prudent investment itself could be denied recovery when unexpected events rendered investment useless.
Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U. S. 299, 312. And even when
investment was wholly includable in the rate base, ratemakers often
rejected the utilities' "embedded costs," their own book-value estimates, which typically were geared to maximize the rate base with
high statements of past expenditures and working capital, combined
with unduly low depreciation rates. See, e. g., Hope Natural Gas Co.,
supra, at 597-598. Equally important, the incumbents' plain-meaning
argument ignores the statutory setting in which the mandate to use
"cost" in valuing network elements occurs. First, the Act uses "cost"
as an intermediate term in the calculation of "just and reasonable rates,"

$ 252(d)(1), and it was the very point of Hope Natural Gas that regulatory bodies required to set rates expressed in these terms have ample
discretion to choose methodology, 320 U. S., at 602. Second, it would
be strange to think Congress tied "cost" to historical cost without a
more specific indication, when the very same sentence that requires
"cost" pricing also prohibits any reference to a "rate-of-return or other
rate-based proceeding," $ 252(d)(1), each of which has been identified
with historical cost ever since Hope Natural Gas was decided. Without
any better indication of meaning than the unadorned term, the word
"cost" in $ 252(d)(1) gives ratesetting commissions broad methodological
leeway, but says little about the method to be employed. Iowa Utilities Bd., supra, at 423. Pp. 497-501.

(B) Also rejected is the incumbents' alternative argument that, because TELRIC calculates the forward-looking cost by reference to a
hypothetical, most efficient element at existing wire centers, not the
actual network element being provided, the FCC's particular methodology is neither consistent with $ 252(d)(1)'s plain language nor within
the zone of reasonable interpretation subject to Chevron deference.
Pp. 501-522.

(1) The term "cost" is simply too protean to support the incumbents' argument that plain language bars a definition of "cost" untethered to historical investment. What the incumbents call the "hypothetical" element is simply the element valued in terms of a piece of
equipment an incumbent may not own. P. 501.

(2) Similarly, the claim that TELRIC exceeds reasonable interpretative leeway is open to the objection that responsibility for
"just and reasonable" rates leaves methodology largely subject to discretion. E. g., Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 790.

The incumbents nevertheless field three arguments, which the Court
rejects. Pp. 501-522.

(a) The incumbents argue, first, that a method of calculating
wholesale lease rates based on the costs of providing hypothetical,
most efficient elements may simulate the competition envisioned by the
Act but does not induce it. There are basically three answers to this
no-stimulation unreasonableness claim. Pp. 503-517.

(i) The basic assumption of the no-stimulation argument--
that in a perfectly efficient market, no one who can lease at a TELRIC
rate will ever build--is contrary to fact. TELRIC does not assume a
perfectly efficient wholesale market or one that is likely to resemble
perfection in any foreseeable time, cf. Iowa Utilities Bd., supra,
at 389-390, but includes several features of inefficiency that undermine the incumbents' argument. First, because the FCC has qualified
any assumption of efficiency by requiring ratesetters to calculate cost
on the basis of the existing location of the incumbent's wire centers,

$ 51.505(b)(1), certain network elements will not be priced at their most
efficient cost and configuration. Second, TELRIC rates in practice
will differ from the products of a perfectly competitive market owing
to lags in price adjustments built into the state-commission ratesetting
process. Finally, because measurement of the TELRIC is based on the
use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available, ibid., the marginal cost of a most efficient element that an entrant
alone has built and uses would not set a new pricing standard until it
became available to competitors as an alternative to the incumbent's
corresponding element. Pp. 504-507.

(ii) It cannot be said that the FCC acted unreasonably in
picking TELRIC to promote the mandated competition. Comparison
of TELRIC with alternatives proposed by the incumbents as more reasonable--embedded-cost methodologies, an efficient component pricing
rule, and "Ramsey pricing," the most commonly proposed variant of
fixed-cost recovery ratesetting--are plausibly answered by the FCC's
stated reasons to reject the alternatives, $ 51.505(d); First Report and
Order |||| 655, 696, 705, 709. Pp. 507-516.

(iii) The claim that TELRIC is unreasonable as a matter
of law because it simulates, but does not produce, facilities-based competition founders on fact. The entrants say that they invested $55 billion
in new facilities from 1996 through 2000, and the incumbents do not
contest the figure. A regulatory scheme that can boast such substantial
competitive capital spending in four years is not easily described as
an unreasonable way to promote competitive investment in facilities.
Pp. 516-517.

Syllabus
(b) Also unavailing is the incumbents' second reason for calling
TELRIC an unreasonable exercise of the FCC's regulatory discretion:
the supposed incapacity of this methodology to provide enough depreciation and allowance for capital costs to induce rational competition on
the theory's own terms. This argument rests upon a fundamentally
false premise, that the TELRIC rules limit the depreciation and capital
costs that ratesetting commissions may recognize. On the contrary,
First Report and Order || 702 gave state commissions considerable discretion on these matters, specifically permitting more favorable allowances for costs of capital and depreciation than were generally allowed
under traditional ratemaking practice. The incumbents' fallback position, that existing rates of depreciation and costs of capital are not even
reasonable starting points, is unpersuasive. This attack tends to argue
in highly general terms, whereas TELRIC rates are calculated on the
basis of individual elements. Those rates leave plenty of room for differences in the appropriate depreciation rates and risk-adjusted capital
costs depending on the nature and technology of the specific element to
be priced. In light of the many TELRIC rates to be calculated by state
commissions across the country, the FCC's prescription of a general
"starting point" is reasonable enough. Pp. 517-522.

(c) Finally, the incumbents' third argument, that TELRIC is
needlessly and unreasonably complicated and impracticable, is unpersuasive. The record suggests that TELRIC rate proceedings are surprisingly smooth-running affairs, with incumbents and competitors typically presenting two conflicting economic models supported by expert
testimony, and state commissioners customarily assigning rates based
on some predictions from one model and others from its counterpart.
At bottom, battles of experts are bound to be part of any ratesetting
scheme, and the FCC was reasonable to prefer TELRIC over alternative fixed-cost schemes that preserve home-field advantages for the
incumbents. P. 522.

(C) The incumbents' attempt to apply the rule of constitutional
avoidance does not present a serious question. They say that "cost"
should be construed by reference to historical investment in order to
avoid the serious constitutional question whether a methodology so
divorced from actual investment will lead to a taking of property in
violation of the Fifth (or Fourteenth) Amendment. However, they
do not argue that any particular, actual TELRIC rate is so unjust as
to be confiscatory, despite the fact that some state commissions have
already put TELRIC rates in place. This want of any rate to be reviewed is significant, given that this Court has never considered a
taking challenge to a ratesetting methodology without being pre535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN
472 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. FCC

Syllabus
sented with specific rate orders alleged to be confiscatory. See, e. g.,
Duquesne, 488 U. S., at 303-304. Indeed, the general rule is that any
question about the constitutionality of ratesetting is raised by rates,
not methods. See, e. g., Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S., at 602. Thus,
the policy of construing a statute to avoid constitutional questions is
presumptively out of place when construing a measure like TELRIC
that prescribes a method. The incumbents argue unpersuasively that
this action is placed outside the general rule by strong signs that takings will occur if the TELRIC interpretation of $ 252(d)(1) is allowed.
First, their comparison of historical investment in local telephone
markets with the corresponding estimate of a TELRIC evaluation is
spurious because their assumed numbers are clearly wrong. Second,
they misplace their reliance on dicta in Duquesne, supra, at 315, to the
effect that there may be a taking challenge if a ratemaking body makes
opportunistic methodology changes just to minimize a utility's return
on capital investment. There is no evidence that the decision to adopt
TELRIC was arbitrary, opportunistic, or undertaken with a confiscatory
purpose. Indeed, the indications in the record are very much to the
contrary. Pp. 523-528.

2. The FCC can require incumbents to combine elements of their
networks at the request of entrants who cannot combine themselves,
when they lease them to the entrants. Thus, the Eighth Circuit erred
in invalidating the additional combination rules, Rules 315(c)-(f ).
Pp. 528-539.

(A) The Court rejects the incumbents' threshold objection that
the Government's and competing carriers' challenge to the rules invalidation is barred by waiver because the Iowa Utilities Bd. petition
to review the Eighth Circuit's earlier invalidation of Rule 315(b) did
not extend to its simultaneous invalidation of Rules 315(c)-(f). The
incumbents argue that the Eighth Circuit exceeded the scope of this
Court's mandate when it revisited the unchallenged portion of its earlier holding, and that this Court should decline to reach the validity
of Rules 315(c)-(f) because doing so would encourage the sort of strategic, piecemeal litigation disapproved in Communist Party of United
States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 367 U. S. 1, 30-31. However, that case does not block consideration of Rules 315(c)-(f) here.
Addressing the issue now would not "make waste" of years of efforts
by the FCC or the Eighth Circuit, id., at 32, n. 8, would not threaten
to leave a constitutional ruling pointless, and would direct the Court's
attention not to an isolated, "long-stale" procedural error by the agency,
ibid., but to the invalidation of FCC rules meant to have general and
continuing applicability. There is no indication that litigation tactics

prompted the failure last time to appeal on these rules, which were
reexamined on remand at the Eighth Circuit's behest, not the Government's nor the competing carriers'. Any issue pressed or passed upon
by a federal court is subject to this Court's broad discretion on certiorari, and there are good reasons to look at Rules 315(c)-(f). The Eighth
Circuit passed on a significant issue that has been placed in a state of
flux by a split among federal cases. Pp. 528-531.

(B) The Eighth Circuit read 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c)(3)'s requirement
that "[a]n incumbent . . . provide . . . network elements in a manner that
allows requesting carriers to combine such elements" as unambiguously excusing incumbents from any obligation to combine provided
elements. But the language is not that plain. If Congress had treated
incumbents and entrants as equals, it probably would be plain enough
that the incumbents' obligations stopped at furnishing an element that
could be combined. The Act, however, proceeds on the understanding
that incumbent monopolists and contending competitors are unequal.
Cf. $ 251(c). And because, within the actual statutory confines, it is not
self-evident that in obligating incumbents to furnish, Congress silently
negated a duty to combine, the Court reads $ 251(c)(3)'s language as
leaving open who should do the work of combination. Under Chevron,
that leaves the additional combination rules intact unless the incumbents can show them to be unreasonable. The Court finds, however,
that those rules reflect a reasonable reading of the statute. They are
meant to remove practical barriers to competitive entry into localexchange markets while avoiding serious interference with incumbent
network operations. The rules say an incumbent shall, for payment,
"perform the functions necessary," Rules 315(c) and (d), to combine
elements in order to put a competing carrier on an equal footing with
the incumbent when the requesting carrier is unable to combine, First
Report and Order || 294, when it would not place the incumbent at a
disadvantage in operating its own network, and when it would not place
other competing carriers at a competitive disadvantage, Rule 315(c)(2).
This duty is consistent with the Act's goals of competition and nondiscrimination, and imposing it is a sensible way to reach the result the
Act requires. Pp. 531-538.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.*
These cases arise under the Telecommunications Act of1996. Each is about the power of the Federal Communications Commission to regulate a relationship between mo-nopolistic companies providing local telephone service and
companies entering local markets to compete with the incum-bents. Under the Act, the new entrants are entitled, among
other things, to lease elements of the local telephone net-works from the incumbent monopolists. The issues are
whether the FCC is authorized (1) to require state utilitycommissions to set the rates charged by the incumbents for
leased elements on a forward-looking basis untied to the in-cumbents' investment, and (2) to require incumbents to combine such elements at the entrants' request when they leasethem to the entrants. We uphold the FCC's assumption and
exercise of authority on both issues.

I
The 1982 consent decree settling the Government's anti-trust suit against the American Telephone and Telegraph

Company (AT&T) divested AT&T of its local-exchange car-riers, leaving AT&T as a long-distance and equipment company, and limiting the divested carriers to the provision oflocal telephone service.

Competition in Local Telephony 7-10 (1994); S. Breyer, Reg-ulation and Its Reform 291-292, 314 (1982). These markets
were addressed by provisions of the Telecommunications Actof 1996 (1996 Act or Act), Pub L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, that
were intended to eliminate the monopolies enjoyed by theinheritors of AT&T's local franchises; this objective was considered both an end in itself and an important step towardthe Act's other goals of boosting competition in broader
markets and revising the mandate to provide universal tele-phone service. See Benjamin et al. 716.

Two sets of related provisions for opening local marketsconcern us here. First, Congress required incumbent localexchange carriers to share their own facilities and serv-ices on terms to be agreed upon with new entrants in their
markets. 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Second,knowing that incumbents and prospective entrants would
sometimes disagree on prices for facilities or services, Con-gress directed the FCC to prescribe methods for state commissions to use in setting rates that would subject bothincumbents and entrants to the risks and incentives that
a competitive market would produce. $ 252(d). The partic-ular method devised by the FCC for setting rates to be
charged for interconnection and lease of network elementsunder the Act, $ 252(d)(1),

utilities in the United States and the structure of local
exchanges made accessible by the Act.

A
Companies providing telephone service have traditionally
been regulated as monopolistic public utilities.2 See J. Bonbright, Principles of Public Utility Rates 3-5 (1st ed. 1961)
(hereinafter Bonbright); I. Barnes, Economics of Public Utility Regulation 37-41 (1942) (hereinafter Barnes). At the
dawn of modern utility regulation, in order to offset monopoly power and ensure affordable, stable public access
to a utility's goods or services, legislatures enacted rate
schedules to fix the prices a utility could charge. See id., at
170-173; C. Phillips, Regulation of Public Utilities 111-112,
and n. 5 (1984) (hereinafter Phillips). See, e. g., Smyth v.
Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 470-476 (1898) (statement of case);
Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134 (1877). As this job became more complicated, legislatures established specialized
administrative agencies, first local or state, then federal, to
set and regulate rates. Barnes 173-175; Phillips 115-117.
See, e. g., Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 433 (1913)
(Interstate Commerce Commission); Shreveport Rate Cases,
234 U. S. 342, 354-355 (1914) ( jurisdictional dispute between
ICC and Texas Railroad Commission). See generally T. McCraw, Prophets of Regulation 11-65 (1984). The familiar
mandate in the enabling Acts was to see that rates be
"just and reasonable" and not discriminatory. Barnes 289.
See, e. g., Transportation Act of 1920, 49 U. S. C. $ 1(5)

Opinion of the Court
All rates were subject to regulation this way: retail ratescharged directly to the public and wholesale rates charged

among businesses involved in providing the goods or servicesoffered by the retail utility. Intrastate retail rates were
regulated by the States or municipalities, with those atwholesale generally the responsibility of the National Government, since the transmission or transportation involvedwas characteristically interstate.

3 See Phillips 143.

Historically, the classic scheme of administrative rate-setting at the federal level called for rates to be set out by

the regulated utility companies in proposed tariff schedules,on the model applied to railroad carriers under the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 379. After interestedparties had had notice of the proposals and a chance to comment, the tariffs would be accepted by the controllingagency so long as they were "reasonable" (or "just and reasonable") and not "unduly discriminatory." Hale, Commis-sions, Rates, and Policies, 53 Harv. L. Rev. 1103, 1104-1105
(1940). See, e. g., Southern Pacific Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 433,445 (1911). The States generally followed this same tariffschedule model. Barnes 297-298. See, e. g., Smyth, supra,at 470-476.

3 The first noteworthy federal rate-regulation statute was the Interstate
Commerce Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 379, which was principally concerned with
railroad rates but generally governed all interstate rates. It was the
model for subsequent federal public-utility statutes like the Federal Power
Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 1063, the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064,
the Natural Gas Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 821, and the Civil Aeronautics Act
of 1938, 52 Stat. 973. The Communications Act of 1934 created the FCC
and was the first statute to address interstate telephone regulation in
an independent and substantive way. Federal regulation in the area
had previously been undertaken incidentally to general interstate carrier
regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Mann-Elkins Act
of 1910, 36 Stat. 539, was the earliest federal statute prescribing rates
for interstate and foreign telephone and telegraph carriers, as part of
revisions to railroad rates set by the ICC. See R. Vietor, Contrived Competition: Regulation and Deregulation in America 171 (1994) (hereinafter
Vietor).

Opinion of the Court
The way rates were regulated as between businesses (bythe National Government) was in some respects, however,

different from regulation of rates as between businessesand the public (at the state or local level). In wholesale
markets, the party charging the rate and the party chargedwere often sophisticated businesses enjoying presumptively
equal bargaining power, who could be expected to negotiatea "just and reasonable" rate as between the two of them.
Accordingly, in the Federal Power Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 1063,and again in the Natural Gas Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 821, Congress departed from the scheme of purely tariff-based regu-lation and acknowledged that contracts between commercial
buyers and sellers could be used in ratesetting, 16 U. S. C.$ 824d(d) (Federal Power Act); 15 U. S. C. $ 717c(c) (Natural
Gas Act). See United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas
Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, 338-339 (1956). When commer-cial parties did avail themselves of rate agreements, the

principal regulatory responsibility was not to relieve a con-tracting party of an unreasonable rate,

FPC v. Sierra PacificPower Co., 350 U. S. 348, 355 (1956) ("its improvident bargain"), but to protect against potential discrimination byfavorable contract rates between allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale customers. See ibid. Cf. NewYork v. United States, 331 U. S. 284, 296 (1947) ("The principal evil at which the Interstate Commerce Act was aimedwas discrimination in its various manifestations"). This
Court once summed up matters at the wholesale level thisway:

"[W]hile it may be that the Commission may not nor-mally impose upon a public utility a rate which would
produce less than a fair return, it does not follow thatthe public utility may not itself agree by contract to a
rate affording less than a fair return or that, if it doesso, it is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain.
In such circumstances the sole concern of the Commis-sion would seem to be whether the rate is so low as to

adversely affect the public interest--as where it mightimpair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service, cast upon other consumers an excessiveburden, or be unduly discriminatory." Sierra Pacific
Power Co., supra, at 355 (citation omitted).
See also United Gas Pipe Line Co., supra, at 345.Regulation of retail rates at the state and local levels

was, on the other hand, focused more on the demand for"just and reasonable" rates to the public than on the perils
of rate discrimination. See Barnes 298-299. Indeed, regu-lated local telephone markets evolved into arenas of statesanctioned discrimination engineered by the public utilitycommissions themselves in the cause of "universal service."
Huber et al. 80-85. See also Vietor 167-185. In order tohold down charges for telephone service in rural markets
with higher marginal costs due to lower population densitiesand lesser volumes of use, urban and business users were
charged subsidizing premiums over the marginal costs ofproviding their own service. See Huber et al. 84.

These cross subsidies between markets were not neces-sarily transfers between truly independent companies, however, thanks largely to the position attained by AT&T andits satellites. This was known as the "Bell system," which
by the mid-20th century had come to possess overwhelmingmonopoly power in all telephone markets nationwide, supplying local-exchange and long-distance services as well asequipment. Vietor 174-175. See also R. Garnet, Telephone
Enterprise: Evolution of Bell System's Horizontal Struc-ture, 1876-1909, pp. 160-163 (1985) (Appendix A). The same
pervasive market presence of Bell providers that made itsimple to provide cross subsidies in aid of universal service,
however, also frustrated conventional efforts to hold retailrates down. See Huber et al. 84-85. Before the Bell system's predominance, regulators might have played compet-ing carriers against one another to get lower rates for the
public, see Cohen 47-50, but the strategy became virtually

Opinion of the Court
impossible once a single company had become the only pro-vider in nearly every town and city across the country. This

regulatory frustration led, in turn, to new thinking aboutjust and reasonable retail rates and ultimately to these cases.

The traditional regulatory notion of the "just and rea-sonable" rate was aimed at navigating the straits between
gouging utility customers and confiscating utility property.
FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, 603 (1944). Seealso Barnes 289-290; Bonbright 38. More than a century

ago, reviewing courts charged with determining whetherutility rates were sufficiently reasonable to avoid unconstitutional confiscation took as their touchstone the revenue thatwould be a "fair return" on certain utility property known
as a "rate base." The fair rate of return was usually set asthe rate generated by similar investment property at the
time of the rate proceeding, and in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.,at 546, the Court held that the rate base must be calculated
as "the fair value of the property being used by [the utility]for the convenience of the public." In pegging the rate base
at "fair value," the Smyth Court consciously rejected theprimary alternative standard, of capital actually invested to
provide the public service or good. Id., at 543-546. TheCourt made this choice in large part to prevent "excessive
valuation or fictitious capitalization" from artificially in-flating the rate base,

id., at 544, lest " `[t]he public . . . besubjected to unreasonable rates in order simply that stockholders may earn dividends,' " id., at 545 (quoting Coving-ton & Lexington Turnpike Road Co. v. Sandford, 164 U. S.
578, 596 (1896)).4But

Smyth proved to be a troublesome mandate, as Jus-tice Brandeis, joined by Justice Holmes, famously observed

4 And the Court had no doubt who should make the sacrifice in that
situation. " `If a corporation cannot maintain such a highway and earn
dividends for stockholders, it is a misfortune for it and them which the
Constitution does not require to be remedied by imposing unjust burdens
upon the public.' " Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S., at 545 (citation omitted).

(1923) (dissenting opinion). The Smyth Court itself had de-scribed, without irony, the mind-numbing complexity of the
required enquiry into fair value, as the alternative to his-torical investment:

"[I]n order to ascertain [fair] value, original cost of con-struction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds andstock, the present as compared with the original cost
of construction, the probable earning capacity of theproperty under particular rates prescribed by statute,
and the sum required to meet operating expenses, areall matters for consideration, and are to be given such
weight as may be just and right in each case. We donot say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property." 169U. S., at 546-547.

To the bewildered, Smyth simply threw up its hands, pre-scribing no one method for limiting use of these numbers
but declaring all such facts to be "relevant." 5 Southwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 262 U. S., at 294-298, and n. 6 (Brandeis,J., dissenting). What is more, the customary checks on

calculations of value in other circumstances were hard tocome by for a utility's property; its costly facilities rarely
changed hands and so were seldom tagged with a price abuyer would actually pay and a seller accept, id., at 292; West

nues were necessarily determined by the rates subject toreview, with the rate of return applied to the very property

subject to valuation. Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488U. S. 299, 309, n. 5 (1989);

Hope Natural Gas Co., supra,
at 601.Small wonder, then, that Justice Brandeis was able to demonstrate how basing rates on Smyth's galactic notion of fair
value could produce revenues grossly excessive or insuffi-cient when gauged against the costs of capital. He gave the

example (simplified) of a $1 million plant built with promisedreturns on the equity of $90,000 a year.

Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co., supra, at 304-306. If the value were to fall
to $600,000 at the time of a rate proceeding, with the rate
of return on similar investments then at 6 percent, Smyth
would say a rate was not confiscatory if it returned at least
$36,000, a shortfall of $54,000 from the costs of capital. But
if the value of the plant were to rise to $1,750,000 at the time
of the rate proceeding, and the rate of return on comparable
investments stood at 8 percent, then constitutionality under
Smyth would require rates generating at least $140,000,
$50,000 above capital costs.

The upshot of Smyth, then, was the specter of utilities
forced into bankruptcy by rates inadequate to pay off the
costs of capital, even when a drop in value resulted from
general economic decline, not imprudent investment; while
in a robust economy, an investment no more prescient could
claim what seemed a rapacious return on equity invested.
Justice Brandeis accordingly advocated replacing "fair value"
with a calculation of rate base on the cost of capital prudently invested in assets used for the provision of the public
good or service, and although he did not live to enjoy success,
his campaign against Smyth came to fruition in FPC v. Hope
Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591 (1944).

In Hope Natural Gas, this Court disavowed the position
that the Natural Gas Act and the Constitution required fair
value as the sole measure of a rate base on which "just and

reasonable" rates were to be calculated. Id., at 601-602.See also FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U. S. 575,

602-606 (1942) (Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ., concurring).In the matter under review, the Federal Power Commission
had valued the rate base by using "actual legitimate cost"reflecting "sound depreciation and depletion practices," and
so had calculated a value roughly 25 percent below the figuregenerated by the natural-gas company's fair-value methods
using "estimated reproduction cost" and "trended originalcost."

Hope Natural Gas, 320 U. S., at 596-598, and nn. 4-5.The Court upheld the Commission. "Rates which enable

the company to operate successfully, to maintain its finan-cial integrity, to attract capital, and to compensate its investors for the risks assumed certainly cannot be condemnedas invalid, even though they might produce only a meager
return on the so-called `fair value' rate base." 6 Id., at 605.Although Hope Natural Gas did not repudiate everything
said in Smyth, since fair value was still "the end product ofthe process of rate-making," 320 U. S., at 601, federal and
state commissions setting rates in the aftermath of Hope
Natural Gas largely abandoned the old fair-value approachand turned to methods of calculating the rate base on the

basis of "cost." A. Kahn, Economics of Regulations: Princi-ples and Institutions 40-41 (1988).

"Cost" was neither self-evident nor immune to confusion,however; witness the invocation of "reproduction cost" as a

6 The fair-value concept survived to some degree in the "used and useful" qualification to the prudent-investment rule, that a utility can only
recover prudently invested capital that is being "used and useful" in
providing the public a good or service. For example, the Pennsylvania
rate statute upheld in Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U. S. 299 (1989),
provided that capital invested with prudence at the time but rendered
useless by unforeseen events would not be recoverable through regulated
rates, just as it would be worthless in terms of market value. Id., at
311-312, n. 7 ("The loss to utilities from prudent ultimately unsuccessful
investments under such a system is greater than under a pure prudent
investment rule, but less than under a fair value approach").

supra, and the Federal Power Commission's rejection
of "trended original cost" (apparently, a straight-line deriva-tion from the cost of capital originally invested) in favor of

"actual legitimate cost," Hope Natural Gas, supra, at 596.Still, over time, general agreement developed on a method
that was primus inter pares, and it is essentially a modern
gloss on that method that the incumbent carriers say theFCC should have used to set the rates at issue here.

The method worked out is not a simple calculation of ratebase as the original cost of "prudently invested" capital
that Justice Brandeis assumed, presumably by reference tothe utility's balance sheet at the time of the rate proceeding. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 262 U. S., at 304-306.Rather, "cost" came to mean "cost of service," that is, the
cost of prudently invested capital used to provide the serv-ice. Bonbright 173; P. Garfield & W. Lovejoy, Public Utility
Economics 56 (1964). This was calculated subject to deductions for accrued depreciation and allowances for working
capital,7 see Phillips 282-283 (table 8-1) ("a typical electric
utility rate base"), naturally leading utilities to minimize
depreciation by using very slow depreciation rates (on the
assumption of long useful lives),8 and to maximize working
capital claimed as a distinct rate-base constituent.

7 Operating cash, inventory, and accounts receivable constitute typical
current assets. Current liabilities consist of accounts payable, such as
taxes, wages, rents, interest payable, and short-term debt. Because, for
example, accounts receivable may not be collected until after liabilities
come due, working capital is capital needed to pay current liabilities in
the interim. Z. Bodie & R. Merton, Finance 427 (prelim. ed. 1998).

8 For example, in 1997, regulated incumbent local-exchange carriers

had an average depreciation cycle of 14.4 years for their assets (an average depreciation cost of $127 per line as against gross plant investment
of $1,836 per line), roughly twice as long as the average cycle of 7.4
years for unregulated competitive carriers like Worldcom. Weingarten &
Stuck, Rethinking Depreciation, 28 Business Communications Review 63

Opinion of the Court
This formula, commonly called the prudent-investmentrule, addressed the natural temptations on the utilities' part

to claim a return on outlays producing nothing of value tothe public. It was meant, on the one hand, to discourage
unnecessary investment and the "fictitious capitalization"feared in Smyth, 169 U. S., at 543-546, and so to protect ratepayers from supporting excessive capacity, or abandoned,destroyed, or phantom assets. Kahn, Tardiff, & Weisman,
Telecommunications Act at three years: an economic evalua-tion of its implementation by the Federal Communications
Commission, 11 Information Economics & Policy 319, 330,n. 27 (1999) (hereinafter Kahn, Telecommunications Act).
At the same time, the prudent-investment rule was intendedto give utilities an incentive to make smart investments
deserving a "fair" return, and thus to mimic natural in-centives in competitive markets

9 (though without an eye to

fostering the actual competition by which such markets aredefined). In theory, then, the prudent-investment qualification gave the ratepayer an important protection by mitigat-ing the tendency of a regulated market's lack of competition
to support monopolistic prices.But the mitigation was too little, the prudent-investment
rule in practice often being no match for the capacity of utili-ties having all the relevant information to manipulate the
rate base and renegotiate the rate of return every time arate was set. The regulatory response in some markets
was adoption of a rate-based method commonly called "pricecaps,"

524 (CADC 1999), as, for example, by the FCC's setting ofmaximum access charges paid to large local-exchange com9 In a competitive market, a company may not simply raise prices as
much as it may need to compensate for poor investments (say, in a plant
that becomes unproductive) because competitors will then undersell the
company's goods. See N. Mankiw, Principles of Economics 308-310 (1998)

panies by interexchange carriers, In re Policy and Rules
Concerning Rates for Dominant Carriers, 5 FCC Rcd. 6786,
6787, || 1 (1990).

The price-cap scheme starts with a rate generated by the
conventional cost-of-service formula, which it takes as a
benchmark to be decreased at an average of some 2-3 percent a year to reflect productivity growth, Kahn, Telecommunications Act 330-332, subject to an upward adjustment if
necessary to reflect inflation or certain unavoidable "exogenous costs" on which the company is authorized to recover a
return. 5 FCC Rcd., at 6787, || 5. Although the price caps
do not eliminate gamesmanship, since there are still battles
to be fought over the productivity offset and allowable exogenous costs, United States Telephone Assn., supra, at 524,
they do give companies an incentive "to improve productivity to the maximum extent possible," by entitling those that
outperform the productivity offset to keep resulting profits,
5 FCC Rcd., at 6787-6788, |||| 7-9. Ultimately, the goal, as
under the basic prudent-investment rule, is to encourage investment in more productive equipment.

Before the passage of the 1996 Act, the price cap was, at
the federal level, the final stage in a century of developing
ratesetting methodology. What had changed throughout
the era beginning with Smyth v. Ames was prevailing opinion on how to calculate the most useful rate base, with the
disagreement between fair-value and cost advocates turning
on whether invested capital was the key to the right balance
between investors and ratepayers, and with the price-cap
scheme simply being a rate-based offset to the utilities' advantage of superior knowledge of the facts employed in costof-service ratemaking. What is remarkable about this evolution of just and reasonable ratesetting, however, is what
did not change. The enduring feature of ratesetting from
Smyth v. Ames to the institution of price caps was the idea
that calculating a rate base and then allowing a fair rate of

Opinion of the Court
return on it was a sensible way to identify a range of rates
that would be just and reasonable to investors and ratepayers. Equally enduring throughout the period was dissatisfaction with the successive rate-based variants. From
the constancy of this dissatisfaction, one possible lesson was
drawn by Congress in the 1996 Act, which was that regulation using the traditional rate-based methodologies gave
monopolies too great an advantage and that the answer lay
in moving away from the assumption common to all the
rate-based methods, that the monopolistic structure within
the discrete markets would endure.

Under the local-competition provisions of the Act, Congress called for ratemaking different from any historical
practice, to achieve the entirely new objective of uprooting
the monopolies that traditional rate-based methods had
perpetuated. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-230, p. 113 (1996).
A leading backer of the Act in the Senate put the new goal
this way:

"This is extraordinary in the sense of telling private
industry that this is what they have to do in order to let
the competitors come in and try to beat your economic
brains out. . . .

"It is kind of almost a jump-start. . . . I will do everything I have to let you into my business, because we
used to be a bottleneck; we used to be a monopoly; we
used to control everything.

"Now, this legislation says you will not control much
of anything. You will have to allow for nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled basis to the network functions and services of the Bell operating companies network that is at least equal in type, quality, and price to
the access [a] Bell operating company affords to itself."

Opinion of the Court
For the first time, Congress passed a ratesetting statutewith the aim not just to balance interests between sellers

and buyers, but to reorganize markets by rendering regu-lated utilities' monopolies vulnerable to interlopers, even
if that meant swallowing the traditional federal reluctanceto intrude into local telephone markets. The approach was
deliberate, through a hybrid jurisdictional scheme with theFCC setting a basic, default methodology for use in setting
rates when carriers fail to agree, but leaving it to stateutility commissions to set the actual rates.

While the Act is like its predecessors in tying the meth-odology to the objectives of "just and reasonable" and nondiscriminatory rates, 47 U. S. C. $ 252(d)(1), it is radicallyunlike all previous statutes in providing that rates be set
"without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-basedproceeding," $ 252(d)(1)(A)(i). The Act thus appears to be
an explicit disavowal of the familiar public-utility model ofrate regulation (whether in its fair-value or cost-of-service
incarnations) presumably still being applied by many Statesfor retail sales, see In re Implementation of Local Competition in Telecommunications Act of 1996, 11 FCC Rcd. 15499,15857, || 704 (1996) (First Report and Order), in favor of
novel ratesetting designed to give aspiring competitorsevery possible incentive to enter local retail telephone markets, short of confiscating the incumbents' property.

The physical incarnation of such a market, a "local ex-change," is a network connecting terminals like telephones,

faxes, and modems to other terminals within a geographicalarea like a city. From terminal network interface devices,
feeder wires, collectively called the "local loop," are run to
local switches that aggregate traffic into common "trunks."The local loop was traditionally, and is still largely, made of

copper wire, though fiber-optic cable is also used, albeit to a

Opinion of the Court
far lesser extent than in long-haul markets.10 Just as theloop runs from terminals to local switches, the trunks run

from the local switches to centralized, or tandem, switches,originally worked by hand but now by computer, which operate much like railway switches, directing traffic into othertrunks. A signal is sent toward its destination terminal on
these common ways so far as necessary, then routed backdown another hierarchy of switches to the intended telephone or other equipment. A local exchange is thus a trans-portation network for communications signals, radiating like
a root system from a "central office" (or several offices forlarger areas) to individual telephones, faxes, and the like.

It is easy to see why a company that owns a local exchange(what the Act calls an "incumbent local exchange carrier,"
47 U. S. C. $ 251(h)) would have an almost insurmountablecompetitive advantage not only in routing calls within the
exchange, but, through its control of this local market, inthe markets for terminal equipment and long-distance calling as well. A newcomer could not compete with the incum-bent carrier to provide local service without coming close to
replicating the incumbent's entire existing network, the mostcostly and difficult part of which would be laying down the
"last mile" of feeder wire, the local loop, to the thousands(or millions) of terminal points in individual houses and
businesses.11 The incumbent company could also control itslocal-loop plant so as to connect only with terminals it manufactured or selected, and could place conditions or fees (called"access charges") on long-distance carriers seeking to con10 Some loop lines employ coaxial cable and fixed wireless technologies,
but these constitute less than 1 percent of the total number of reported
local-exchange lines in the United States. FCC, Local Telephone Competition: Status as of June 30, 2001 (Feb. 27, 2002) (table 5).

11 A mininetwork connecting only some of the users in the local exchange

would be of minimal value to customers, and, correspondingly, any value
to customers would be exponentially increased with the interconnection of
more users to the network. See generally W. Arthur, Increasing Returns
and Path Dependence in the Economy 1-12 (1994).

nect with its network. In an unregulated world, anothertelecommunications carrier would be forced to comply with

these conditions, or it could never reach the customers of alocal exchange.

II
The 1996 Act both prohibits state and local regulationthat impedes the provision of "telecommunications service,"

$ 253(a),12 and obligates incumbent carriers to allow com-petitors to enter their local markets, $ 251(c). Section 251(c)
addresses the practical difficulties of fostering local compe-tition by recognizing three strategies that a potential competitor may pursue. First, a competitor entering the mar-ket (a "requesting" carrier, $ 251(c)(2)) may decide to engage
in pure facilities-based competition, that is, to build its ownnetwork to replace or supplement the network of the incumbent. If an entrant takes this course, the Act obligatesthe incumbent to "interconnect" the competitor's facilities
to its own network to whatever extent is necessary to allowthe competitor's facilities to operate. $$ 251(a) and (c)(2).
At the other end of the spectrum, the statute permits anentrant to skip construction and instead simply to buy and
resell "telecommunications service," which the incumbenthas a duty to sell at wholesale. $$ 251(b)(1) and (c)(4). Between these extremes, an entering competitor may choose tolease certain of an incumbent's "network elements,"

13 which

any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications
service."

13 "Network element" is defined as "a facility or equipment used in the

provision of a telecommunications service. Such term also includes features, functions, and capabilities that are provided by means of such
facility or equipment, including subscriber numbers, databases, signaling systems, and information sufficient for billing and collection or used

of course, might well not agree, in which case an entering
carrier has a statutory option to request mediation by a state

Opinion of the Court
the FCC's understanding that the Act imposed no facilities-ownership requirement,

id., at 392-393. The case then returned to the Eighth Circuit. Id., at 397.With the FCC's general authority to establish a pricing

methodology secure, the incumbent carriers' primary chal-lenge on remand went to the method that the Commission
chose. There was also renewed controversy over the combination rules (Rules 315(c)-(f)) that the Eighth Circuit hadstruck down along with Rule 315(b), but upon which this

Court expressed no opinion when it reversed the invalidationof that latter rule. 219 F. 3d 744, 748 (2000).

As for the method to derive a "nondiscriminatory," "just
and reasonable rate for network elements," the Act requires
the FCC to decide how to value "the cost . . . of providing the . . . network element [which] may include a reasonable profit," although the FCC is (as already seen) forbidden
to allow any "reference to a rate-of-return or other ratebased proceeding," $ 252(d)(1). Within the discretion left to
it after eliminating any dependence on a "rate-of-return or
other rate-based proceeding," the Commission chose a way
of treating "cost" as "forward-looking economic cost," 47
CFR $ 51.505 (1997), something distinct from the kind of historically based cost generally relied upon in valuing a rate
base after Hope Natural Gas. In Rule 505, the FCC defined the "forward-looking economic cost of an element [as]
the sum of (1) the total element long-run incremental cost
of the element [TELRIC]; [and] (2) a reasonable allocation
of forward-looking common costs," $ 51.505(a), common costs
being "costs incurred in providing a group of elements
that "cannot be attributed directly to individual elements,"

$ 51.505(c)(1). Most important of all, the FCC decided that
the TELRIC "should be measured based on the use of the
most efficient telecommunications technology currently
available and the lowest cost network configuration, given
the existing location of the incumbent['s] wire centers."

$ 51.505(b)(1).

Opinion of the Court
"The TELRIC of an element has three components, theoperating expenses, the depreciation cost, and the appropriate risk-adjusted cost of capital." First Report and Order|| 703 (footnote omitted). See also 47 CFR $$ 51.505(b)(2)-
(3) (1997). A concrete example may help. Assume that itwould cost $1 a year to operate a most efficient loop element;
that it would take $10 for interest payments on the capital a
carrier would have to invest to build the lowest cost loopcentered upon an incumbent carrier's existing wire centers

(say $100, at 10 percent per annum); and that $9 would bereasonable for depreciation on that loop (an 11-year useful
life); then the annual TELRIC for the loop element wouldbe $20.

16

The Court of Appeals understood $ 252(d)(1)'s referenceto "the cost . . . of providing the . . . network element"

to be ambiguous as between "forward-looking" and "his-torical" cost, so that a forward-looking ratesetting method
would presumably be a reasonable implementation of thestatute. But the Eighth Circuit thought the ambiguity afforded no leeway beyond that, and read the Act to require
any forward-looking methodology to be "based on the incre-mental costs that an [incumbent] actually incurs or will incur

in providing . . . the unbundled access to its specific networkelements." 219 F. 3d, at 751-753. Hence, the Eighth Circuit held that $ 252(d)(1) foreclosed the use of the TELRICmethodology. In other words, the court read the Act as
plainly requiring rates based on the "actual" not "hypothetical" "cost . . . of providing the . . . network element,"
and reasoned that TELRIC was clearly the latter. Id., at

16 The actual TELRIC rate charged to an entrant leasing the element
would be a fraction of the TELRIC figure, based on a "reasonable projection" of the entrant's use of the element (whether on a flat or per-usage
basis) as divided by aggregate total use of the element by the entrant, the
incumbent, and any other competitor that leases it. 47 CFR $ 51.511
(1997). See also First Report and Order || 682.

750-751. The Eighth Circuit added, however, that if it werewrong and TELRIC were permitted, the claim that in prescribing TELRIC the FCC had effected an unconstitutionaltaking would not be "ripe" until "resulting rates have been
determined and applied." Id., at 753-754.The Court of Appeals also, and for the second time, invalidated Rules 315(c)-(f), 47 CFR $$ 51.315(c)-(f) (1997), theFCC's so-called "additional combination" rules, apparently
for the same reason it had rejected them before, when itstruck down Rule 315(b), the main combination rule. 219
F. 3d, at 758-759. In brief, the rules require an incumbentcarrier, upon request and compensation, to "perform the
functions necessary to combine" network elements for anentrant, unless the combination is not "technically feasible."
Id., at 759. The Eighth Circuit read the language of$ 251(c)(3), with its reference to "allow[ing] requesting carriers to combine . . . elements," as unambiguously requiring arequesting carrier, not a providing incumbent, to do any and
all combining. Ibid.Before us, the incumbent local-exchange carriers claim
error in the Eighth Circuit's holding that a "forward-lookingcost" methodology (as opposed to the use of "historical" cost)
is consistent with $ 252(d)(1), and its conclusion that the useof the TELRIC forward-looking cost methodology presents
no "ripe" takings claim. The FCC and the entrants, on theother side, seek review of the Eighth Circuit's invalidation
of the TELRIC methodology and the additional combinationrules. We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 1124 (2001), and now
affirm on the issues raised by the incumbents, and reverseon those raised by the FCC and the entrants.

A

The incumbent carriers' first attack charges the FCC withignoring the plain meaning of the word "cost" as it occurs

535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
498 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
in the provision of $ 252(d)(1) that "the just and reasonable
rate for network elements . . . shall be . . . based on the cost
(determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other
rate-based proceeding) of providing the . . . network element . . . ." The incumbents do not argue that in theory
the statute precludes any forward-looking methodology, but
they do claim that the cost of providing a competitor with a
network element in the future must be calculated using the
incumbent's past investment in the element and the means
of providing it. They contend that "cost" in the statute refers to "historical" cost, which they define as "what was in
fact paid" for a capital asset, as distinct from "value," or "the
price that would be paid on the open market." Brief for
Petitioners in No. 00-511, p. 19. They say that the technical
meaning of "cost" is "past capital expenditure," ibid., and
they suggest an equation between "historical" and "embedded" costs, id., at 20, which the FCC defines as "the costs
that the incumbent LEC incurred in the past and that are
recorded in the incumbent LEC's books of accounts," 47 CFR

$ 51.505(d)(1) (1997). The argument boils down to the proposition that "the cost of providing the network element" can
only mean, in plain language and in this particular technical
context, the past cost to an incumbent of furnishing the specific network element actually, physically, to be provided.

The incumbents have picked an uphill battle. At the most
basic level of common usage, "cost" has no such clear implication. A merchant who is asked about "the cost of providing the goods" he sells may reasonably quote their current wholesale market price, not the cost of the particular
items he happens to have on his shelves, which may have
been bought at higher or lower prices.

When the reference shifts from common speech into the
technical realm, the incumbents still have to attack uphill.
To begin with, even when we have dealt with historical costs
as a ratesetting basis, the cases have never assumed a sense

Opinion of the Court
of "cost" as generous as the incumbents seem to claim.17"Cost" as used in calculating the rate base under the traditional cost-of-service method did not stand for all past capitalexpenditures, but at most for those that were prudent, while
prudent investment itself could be denied recovery whenunexpected events rendered investment useless, Duquesne
Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U. S., at 312. And even when in-vestment was wholly includable in the rate base, ratemakers
often rejected the utilities' "embedded costs," their ownbook-value estimates, which typically were geared to maximize the rate base with high statements of past expendituresand working capital, combined with unduly low rates of depreciation. See, e. g., Hope Natural Gas, 320 U. S., at 597-598. It would also be a mistake to forget that "cost" was a
term in value-based ratemaking and has figured in contem-porary state and federal ratemaking untethered to historical valuation.18What is equally important is that the incumbents' plainmeaning argument ignores the statutory setting in whichthe mandate to use "cost" in valuing network elements
occurs. First, the Act uses "cost" as an intermediate term

17 Nor is it possible to argue that "cost" would have to mean past incurred cost if the technical context were economics. See D. Carlton &
J. Perloff, Modern Industrial Organization 50-74 (2d ed. 1994) (hereinafter
Carlton & Perloff). "Sunk costs" are unrecoverable past costs; practically
every other sort of economic "cost" is forward looking, or can be either
historical or forward looking. "Opportunity cost," for example, is "the
value of the best forgone alternative use of the resources employed,"
id., at 56, and as such is always forward looking. See Sidak & Spulber,

since Hope Natural Gas was decided.19The fact is that without any better indication of meaning
than the unadorned term, the word "cost" in $ 252(d)(1), asin accounting generally, is "a chameleon,"

statutory context, relying on the part of $ 252(d)(1)(B) which provides that
a just and reasonable rate "may include a reasonable profit." They say
that because separate provision is made in $ 252(d)(1)(A) for factoring
"cost" into the rate, "reasonable profit" may only be understood as income
above recovery of the actual cost of an incumbent's investment. But as
the FCC has noted, "profit" may also mean "normal" profit, which is
"the total revenue required to cover all of the costs of a firm, including
its opportunity costs." First Report and Order || 699, and n. 1705 (citing
D. Pearce, MIT Dictionary of Modern Economics 310 (1994)). That is to
say, a "reasonable profit" may refer to a "normal" return based on "the
cost of obtaining debt and equity financing" prevailing in the industry.
First Report and Order || 700. This latter sense of "cost" (and accordingly
"reasonable profit") is fully incorporated in the FCC's provisions as to
"risk-adjusted cost of capital," namely, that "States may adjust the cost
of capital if a party demonstrates . . . that either a higher or a lower level
of cost of capital is warranted, without . . . conducting a `rate-of-return or
other rate based proceeding.' " Id., || 702.

ticular rate." 525 U. S., at 423 (opinion concurring in partand dissenting in part). We accordingly reach the conclusion adopted by the Court of Appeals, that nothing in$ 252(d)(1) plainly requires reference to historical investment
when pegging rates to forward-looking "cost."

B
The incumbents' alternative argument is that even with-out a stern anchor in calculating "the cost . . . of providing

the . . . network element," the particular forward-lookingmethodology the FCC chose is neither consistent with the
plain language of $ 252(d)(1) nor within the zone of reasonableinterpretation subject to deference under Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.837, 843-845 (1984). This is so, they say, because TELRIC
calculates the forward-looking cost by reference to a hypo-thetical, most efficient element at existing wire centers, not
the actual network element being provided.

1
The short answer to the objection that TELRIC violatesplain language is much the same as the answer to the previous plain-language argument, for what the incumbents callthe "hypothetical" element is simply the element valued in
terms of a piece of equipment an incumbent may not own.This claim, like the one just considered, is that plain language
bars a definition of "cost" untethered to historical invest-ment, and as explained already, the term "cost" is simply too
protean to support the incumbents' argument.

2
Similarly, the claim that TELRIC exceeds reasonable in-terpretative leeway is open to the objection already noted,

that responsibility for "just and reasonable" rates leavesmethodology largely subject to discretion.

See generally Chevron, supra, at 843-845, 866 ("When achallenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom ofthe agency's policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable
choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challengemust fail").

20 The incumbents nevertheless field three ar20 While Justice Breyer does not explicitly challenge the propriety of
Chevron deference, he relies on our decision in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn.
of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S.
29, 56 (1983), to argue that the FCC's choice of TELRIC bears no "rational
connection" to the Act's deregulatory purpose. See post, at 542, 554 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). State Farm involved review of an agency's "changing its course" as to the interpretation of a
statute, 463 U. S., at 42; these cases, by contrast, involve the FCC's first
interpretation of a new statute, and so State Farm is inapposite to the
extent that it may be read as prescribing more searching judicial review
under the circumstances of that case. (Indeed, State Farm may be read
to suggest the obverse conclusion, that the FCC would have had some
more explaining to do if it had not changed its course by favoring TELRIC
over forward-looking methodologies tethered to actual costs, given Congress's clear intent to depart from past ratesetting statutes in passing the
1996 Act.)

But even on Justice Breyer's own terms, FCC rules stressing low
wholesale prices are by no means inconsistent with the deregulatory and
competitive purposes of the Act. As we discuss below, a policy promoting
lower lease prices for expensive facilities unlikely to be duplicated reduces
barriers to entry (particularly for smaller competitors) and puts competitors that can afford these wholesale prices (but not the higher prices the
incumbents would like to charge) in a position to build their own versions
of less expensive facilities that are sensibly duplicable. See n. 27, infra.
See also infra, at 515-516 (discussing FCC's objection to Ramsey pricing).
And while it is true, as Justice Breyer says, that the Act was "deregulatory," in the intended sense of departing from traditional "regulatory"
ways that coddled monopolies, see supra, at 488 (remarks of Sen. Breaux),
that deregulatory character does not necessarily require the FCC to employ passive pricing rules deferring to incumbents' proposed methods and

Opinion of the Court
guments. They contend, first, that a method of calculating
wholesale lease rates based on the costs of providing hypothetical, most efficient elements may simulate the competition envisioned by the Act but does not induce it. Second,
they argue that even if rates based on hypothetical elements could induce competition in theory, TELRIC cannot
do this, because it does not provide the depreciation and
risk-adjusted capital costs that the theory compels. Finally,
the incumbents say that even if these objections can be answered, TELRIC is needlessly, and hence unreasonably, complicated and impracticable.

a

The incumbents' (and Justice Breyer's) basic critique
of TELRIC is that by setting rates for leased network elements on the assumption of perfect competition, TELRIC
perversely creates incentives against competition in fact.
See post, at 548-551. The incumbents say that in purporting to set incumbents' wholesale prices at the level that
would exist in a perfectly competitive market (in order to
make retail prices similarly competitive), TELRIC sets rates
so low that entrants will always lease and never build network elements. See post, at 549-550. And even if an entrant would otherwise consider building a network element
more efficient than the best one then on the market (the one
assumed in setting the TELRIC rate), it would likewise be
deterred by the prospect that its lower cost in building and
operating this new element would be immediately available
to its competitors; under TELRIC, the incumbents assert,
the lease rate for an incumbent's existing element would incost data. On the contrary, the statutory provisions obligating the incumbents to lease their property, $ 251(c)(3), and offer their services for resale
at wholesale rates, $ 251(c)(4), are consistent with the promulgation of a
ratesetting method leaving state commissions to do the work of setting
rates without any reliance on historical-cost data provided by incumbents.

stantly drop to match the marginal cost 21 of the entrant'snew element once built. See ante, at 550; Brief for Respondents BellSouth et al. in Nos. 00-555, etc., pp. 28-29.According to the incumbents, the result will be, not competition, but a sort of parasitic free riding, leaving TELRIC inca-pable of stimulating the facilities-based competition intended
by Congress.We think there are basically three answers to this nostimulation claim of unreasonableness: (1) the TELRICmethodology does not assume that the relevant markets
are perfectly competitive, and the scheme includes severalfeatures of inefficiency that undermine the plausibility of
the incumbents' no-stimulation argument; (2) comparison ofTELRIC with alternatives proposed by the incumbents as
more reasonable are plausibly answered by the FCC's statedreasons to reject the alternatives; and (3) actual investment
in competing facilities since the effective date of the Actsimply belies the no-stimulation argument's conclusion.

(1)
The basic assumption of the incumbents' no-stimulationargument is contrary to fact. As we explained, the argument rests on the assumption that in a perfectly efficientmarket, no one who can lease at a TELRIC rate will ever
build. But TELRIC does not assume a perfectly efficientwholesale market or one that is likely to resemble perfection in any foreseeable time. The incumbents thus makethe same mistake we attributed in a different setting to the
FCC itself. In Iowa Utilities Bd., we rejected the FCC'snecessary-and-impair rule, 47 CFR $ 51.319 (1997), which
required incumbents to lease any network element thatmight reduce, however slightly, an entrant's marginal cost of
providing a telecommunications service, as compared withproviding the service using the entrant's own equivalent

21 "Marginal cost" is "the increase in total cost [of producing goods] that
arises from an extra unit of production." See Mankiw 272; see also id.,
at 283-288, 312-313; Carlton & Perloff 51-52.

Opinion of the Court
element. 525 U. S., at 389-390. "In a world of perfect competition, in which all carriers are providing their service at
marginal cost, the Commission's total equating of increased
cost (or decreased quality) with `necessity' and `impairment'
might be reasonable, but it has not established the existence
of such an ideal world." Id., at 390.

Not only that, but the FCC has of its own accord allowed
for inefficiency in the TELRIC design in additional ways
affecting the likelihood that TELRIC will squelch competition in facilities. First, the Commission has qualified
any assumption of efficiency by requiring ratesetters to calculate cost on the basis of "the existing location of the incumbent['s] wire centers." 47 CFR $ 51.505(b)(1) (1997). This
means that certain network elements, principally local-loop
elements, will not be priced at their most efficient cost and
configuration to the extent, say, that a shorter loop could
serve a local exchange if the incumbent's wire centers were
relocated for a snugger fit with the current geography of
terminal locations.

Second, TELRIC rates in practice will differ from the
products of a perfectly competitive market owing to built-in
lags in price adjustments. In a perfectly competitive market, retail prices drop instantly to the marginal cost of the
most efficient company. See Mankiw 283-288, 312-313. As
the incumbents point out, this would deter market entry because a potential entrant would know that even if it could
provide a retail service at a lower marginal cost, it would
instantly lose that competitive edge once it entered the market and competitors adjusted to match its price. See Brief
for Respondents BellSouth et al. in Nos. 00-555, etc., at 28-
29. Wholesale TELRIC rates, however, are set by state
commissions, usually by arbitrated agreements with 3- or
4-year terms, see Brief for Respondent Qwest Communications International, Inc., in Nos. 00-511, etc., p. 39; Reply

Opinion of the Court
tioner AT&T Corp. 11-12; and no one claims that a competitor could receive immediately on demand a TELRIC rate on
a leased element at the marginal cost of the entrant who
introduces a more efficient element.

But even if a competitor could call for a new TELRIC
rate proceeding immediately upon the introduction of a more
efficient element by a competing entrant, the competitor
would not necessarily know enough to make the call; the
fact of the element's greater efficiency would only become
apparent when reflected in lower retail prices drawing demand away from existing competitors (including the incumbent), forcing them to look to lowering their own marginal
costs. In practice, it would take some time for the innovating entrant to install the new equipment, to engage in marketing offering a lower retail price to attract business, and
to steal away enough customer subscriptions (given the limited opportunity to capture untapped customers for local
telephone service) for competitors to register the drop in
demand.

Finally, it bears reminding that the FCC prescribes measurement of the TELRIC "based on the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available,"
47 CFR $ 51.505(b)(1) (1997). Owing to that condition of
current availability, the marginal cost of a most efficient
element that an entrant alone has built and uses would not
set a new pricing standard until it became available to competitors as an alternative to the incumbent's corresponding
element.22

22 The Michigan state commission's September 1994 order implementing a long-run incremental cost method for leasing local-exchange network elements, which the FCC considered, see First Report and Order
|| 631, and n. 1508, makes this limitation more explicit by specifying that
rates are to be set based on the costs of elements using the most efficient
technology "currently available for purchase." Michigan Pub. Serv.

Opinion of the Court
As a reviewing Court we are, of course, in no position toassess the precise economic significance of these and other

exceptions to the perfectly functioning market that the in-cumbents' criticism assumes. Instead, it is enough to recognize that the incumbents' assumption may well be incorrect.Inefficiencies built into the scheme may provide incentives
and opportunities for competitors to build their own networkelements, perhaps for reasons unrelated to pricing (such as
the possibility of expansion into data-transmission mar-kets by deploying "broadband" technologies, cf.

post, at 552(B
reyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), orthe desirability of independence from an incumbent's management and maintenance of network elements). In anyevent, the significance of the incumbents' mistake of fact may
be indicated best not by argument here, but by the evidenceof actual investment in facilities-based competition since
TELRIC went into effect, to be discussed at Part III-B-2-a-(3),

infra.23 (2)

Perhaps sensing the futility of an unsupported theoreticalattack, the incumbents make the complementary argument
that the FCC's choice of TELRIC, whatever might be saidabout it on its own terms, was unreasonable as a matter of
law because other methods of determining cost would havedone a better job of inducing competition. Having consid23 Justice Breyer characterizes these built-in inefficiencies as well as
provisions for state-commission discretion as to permitted costs of depreciation and capital, see Part III-B-2-a-(2), infra, as "coincidences" that
have favored considerable competitive investment by sheer luck. See
post, at 552. He thus shares the assumption of an efficient market made
by the incumbents in their argument, and like the incumbents, dismisses
departures from the theoretical assumption of a perfectly competitive
market as inconsistencies rather than pragmatic recognitions. The FCC
is, of course, under no obligation to adopt a ratesetting scheme committed
to realizing perfection in economic theory, see First Report and Order
|| 683 (rejecting pricing premised on a fully "hypothetical least-cost most
efficient network").

ered the proffered alternatives and the reasons the FCCgave for rejecting them, 47 CFR $ 51.505(d) (1997); First Report and Order |||| 630-711, we cannot say that the FCCacted unreasonably in picking TELRIC to promote the mandated competition.The incumbents present three principal alternatives for
setting rates for network elements: embedded-cost meth-odologies, the efficient component pricing rule, and Ramsey
pricing.24 The arguments that one or another of these meth-odologies is preferable to TELRIC share a basic claim: it was
unreasonable for the FCC to choose a method of setting ratesthat fails to include, at least in theory, some additional costs
beyond what would be most efficient in the long run,25 be-cause lease rates that incorporate such costs will do a better
job of inducing competition.26 The theory is that once an

24 Justice Breyer proposes a "less formal kind of `play it by ear' system" based on recent European Community practices as yet another alternative, see post, at 558; but the incumbents do not appear to have advocated such an informal ratesetting scheme to the FCC, see First Report
and Order |||| 630-671, nor have they argued for this alternative before
this Court. And to the extent that Justice Breyer's proposal emphasizes state commissions' discretion to vary rates according to local circumstances and the particulars of each case, this is a feature that is already
built into TELRIC. See infra, at 519-520.

25 In the long run, "all of a firm's costs become variable or avoidable."

First Report and Order || 677. See also Kahn, Telecommunications Act
326 ("[A]ll costs are variable and minimized"). In general, the costs of
producing a good include variable and fixed costs. Variable costs depend
on how much of a good is produced, like the cost of copper to make a loop
which rises as the loop is made longer; fixed costs, like rent, must be paid
in any event without regard to how much is produced. See Carlton &
Perloff 51-56. The long run is a timeframe of sufficient duration that a
company has no fixed costs of production.

26 The argument that rates incorporating fixed costs are necessary to

avoid an unconstitutional taking is taken up in Part III-C, infra. Indeed,
the expert literature the incumbents rely on to advocate fixed-cost ratesetting systems, see infra, at 514-515, do so almost exclusively on the
premise of averting unwanted confiscation, and thus offer little support

Opinion of the Court
entrant has its foot in the door, it will have a greater incen-tive to build and operate its own more efficient network element if the lease rates reflect something of the incumbents'actual and inefficient marginal costs. And once the entrant
develops the element at its lower marginal cost and the retailprice drops accordingly, the incumbent will have no choice
but to innovate itself by building the most efficient ele-ment or finding ways to reduce its marginal cost to retain
its market share.The generic feature of the incumbents' proposed alternatives, in other words, is that some degree of long-run ineffi-ciency ought to be preserved through the lease rates, in
order to give an entrant a more efficient alternative to leas-ing. Of course, we have already seen that TELRIC itself
tolerates some degree of inefficient pricing in its existingwire-center configuration requirement and through the ratemaking and development lags just described. This aside,however, there are at least two objections that generally
undercut any desirability that such alternatives may seem tooffer over TELRIC.

The first objection turns on the fact that a lease rate thatcompensates the lessor for some degree of existing inefficiency (at least from the perspective of the long run) is sim-ply a higher rate, and the difference between such a higher
rate and the TELRIC rate could be the difference that keepsa potential competitor from entering the market. See n. 27,
infra. Cf. First Report and Order || 378 ("[I]n some areas,the most efficient means of providing competing service may
be through the use of unbundled loops. In such cases, pre-venting access to unbundled loops would either discourage a
potential competitor from entering the market in that area,thereby denying those consumers the benefits of competition, or cause the competitor to construct unnecessarily dufor the incumbents' argument that recovery of fixed costs is a better way
to spur competition (as opposed to compensating incumbents).

Opinion of the Court
plicative facilities, thereby misallocating societal resources").If the TELRIC rate for bottleneck elements is $100 and for

other elements (say, switches) is $10, an entering competitorthat can provide its own, more efficient switch at what
amounts to a $7 rate can enter the market for $107. If the
lease rate for the bottleneck elements were higher (say, $110)
to reflect some of the inefficiency of bottleneck elements that
actually cost the incumbent $150, then the entrant with only
$107 will be kept out. Is it better to risk keeping more
potential entrants out, or to induce them to compete in less
capital-intensive facilities with lessened incentives to build
their own bottleneck facilities? It was not obviously unreasonable for the FCC to prefer the latter.27

27 Justice Breyer may be right that "firms that share existing facilities
do not compete in respect to the facilities that they share," post, at 550 (at
least in the near future), but this is fully consistent with the FCC's point
that entrants may need to share some facilities that are very expensive to
duplicate (say, loop elements) in order to be able to compete in other, more
sensibly duplicable elements (say, digital switches or signal-multiplexing
technology). In other words, Justice Breyer makes no accommodation
for the practical difficulty the FCC faced, that competition as to "unshared" elements may, in many cases, only be possible if incumbents simultaneously share with entrants some costly-to-duplicate elements jointly
necessary to provide a desired telecommunications service. Such is the
reality faced by the hundreds of smaller entrants (without the resources
of a large competitive carrier such as AT&T or Worldcom) seeking to gain
toeholds in local-exchange markets, see FCC, Local Telephone Competition: Status as of June 30, 2001, p. 4, n. 13. (Feb. 27, 2002) (485 firms
self-identified as competitive local-exchange carriers). Justice Breyer
elsewhere recognizes that the Act "does not require the new entrant and
incumbent to compete in respect to" elements, the "duplication of [which]
would prove unnecessarily expensive," post, at 546. It is in just this way
that the Act allows for an entrant that may have to lease some "unnecessarily expensive" elements in conjunction with building its own elements
to provide a telecommunications service to consumers. In this case, low
prices for the elements to be leased become crucial in inducing the competitor to enter and build. Cf. First Report and Order || 630 (wholesale
prices should send "appropriate signals").

Opinion of the Court
The second general objection turns the incumbents' attackon TELRIC against the incumbents' own alternatives. If

the problem with TELRIC is that an entrant will never buildbecause at the instant it builds, other competitors can lease
the analogous existing (but less efficient) element from anincumbent at a rate assuming the same most efficient marginal cost, then the same problem persists under the incum-bents' methods. For as soon as an entrant builds a more
efficient element, the incumbent will be forced to price tomatch,

28 and that rate will be available to all other competitors. The point, of course, is that things are not this simple.As we have said, under TELRIC, price adjustment is not

instantaneous in rates for a leased element corresponding toan innovating entrant's more efficient element; the same
would presumably be true under the incumbents' alternativemethods, though they do not come out and say it.

Once we get into the details of the specific alternativemethods, other infirmities become evident that undermine
the claim that the FCC could not reasonably have preferredTELRIC. As for an embedded-cost methodology, the problem with a method that relies in any part on historical cost,the cost the incumbents say they actually incur in leasing
network elements, is that it will pass on to lessees the differ-ence between most efficient cost and embedded cost.

29 See

First Report and Order || 705. Any such cost difference isan inefficiency, whether caused by poor management resulting in higher operating costs or poor investment strategies

28 That is to say, if the entrant could offer a telecommunications service
at a lower retail price, competitors including the incumbent would have to
match that price by looking into ways to reduce their marginal costs, and
the incumbents' recalibrated costs would form the basis of new lease rates.

29 In theory, embedded cost could be lower than efficient cost, see Brief

for Respondent Federal Parties 17, n. 8 (though the incumbents, understandably, do not avail themselves of this tack); in which case the goal
of efficient competition would be set back for the different reason of too
much market entry.

that have inflated capital and depreciation. If leased ele-ments were priced according to embedded costs, the incumbents could pass these inefficiencies to competitors inneed of their wholesale elements, and to that extent defeat
the competitive purpose of forcing efficient choices on all car-riers whether incumbents or entrants. The upshot would
be higher retail prices consumers would have to pay. Id.,
|||| 655 and 705.

There are, of course, objections other than inefficiency
to any method of ratemaking that relies on embedded costs
as allegedly reflected in incumbents' book-cost data, with
the possibilities for manipulation this presents. Even if incumbents have built and are operating leased elements at
economically efficient costs, the temptation would remain to
overstate book costs to ratemaking commissions and so perpetuate the intractable problems that led to the price-cap
innovation. See supra, at 486-487.

There is even an argument that the Act itself forbids
embedded-cost methods, and while the FCC rejected this
absolutistic reading of the statute, First Report and Order
|| 704,30 it seems safe to say that the statutory language
places a heavy presumption against any method resembling the traditional embedded-cost-of-service model of ratesetting.31 At the very least, proposing an embedded-cost

30 "We find that the parenthetical, `(determined without reference to a
rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding),' does not further define the
type of costs that may be considered, but rather specifies a type of proceeding that may not be employed to determine the cost of interconnection
and unbundled network elements." First Report and Order || 704 (footnote omitted).

31 The parenthetical provision that "cost" for ratemaking purposes must

be "determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-based
proceeding," 47 U. S. C. $ 252(d)(1)(A)(i), was in the Senate version of the

Opinion of the Court
alternative is a counterintuitive way to show that selectingTELRIC was unreasonable.

Other incumbents say the FCC was unreasonable to pickTELRIC over a method of ratesetting commonly called
the efficient component pricing rule (ECPR). See Brief forRespondent Qwest Communications International, Inc., in
Nos. 00-511, etc., at 40-41. ECPR would base the rate fora leased element on its most efficient long-run incremental
cost (presumably, something like the TELRIC) plus theopportunity cost to the incumbent when the entrant leasing

fect that "rate of return regulation" would be "eliminated" or prescribing
its "abolition." S. 652, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 301(a)(3) (1995) provided:

"Rate of Return Regulation Eliminated--
"(A) In instituting the price flexibility required under paragraph (1) the
Commission and the States shall establish alternative forms of regulation
for Tier 1 telecommunications carriers that do not include regulation of
the rate of return earned by such carrier . . . ."

H. R. 1555, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 248(b) (1995) stated:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to the extent that a carrier
has complied with sections 242 and 244 of this part, the Commission, with
respect to rates for interstate or foreign communications, and State commissions, with respect to rates for intrastate communications, shall not
require rate-of-return regulation."

The Commission inferred from the omission of the express prohibitions
that Congress intended to forbid a "type of proceeding" not a method.
This was a reasonable inference in light of the common practice of setting
wholesale rates by contracts incorporating retail rates set in state rate-ofreturn proceedings, see, e. g., Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, 233 F. 3d 60,
62, and n. 1 (CA1 2000), though not the only one: Congress may, for example, have balked at limiting state regulation at such a level of specificity.
Less plausible is Justice Breyer's interpretation of the statutory language, as "reflect[ing] Congress' desire to obtain not perfect prices but
speedy results," post, at 559; he concludes that the provision "specifies
that States need not use formal methods, relying instead upon bargaining
and yardstick competition," ibid. Section 252(d)(1), however, specifies
how a state commission should set rates when an incumbent and an entrant fail to reach a bargain, $ 252(a)(2); it seems strange, then, to read the
statutory prohibition as affirmatively urging more bargaining and regulatory flexibility, rather than as firing a warning shot to state commissions
to steer clear of entrenched practices perceived to perpetuate incumbent
monopolies.

the element provides a competing telecommunications serv-ice using it. See

Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 426
(Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);J. Sidak & D. Spulber, Deregulatory Takings and the Regulatory Contract 284-285 (1997); First Report and Order || 708.The opportunity cost is pegged to the retail revenue loss suffered by the incumbent when the entrant provides the service in its stead to its former customers. Ibid.The FCC rejected ECPR because its calculation of opportunity cost relied on existing retail prices in monopolisticlocal-exchange markets, which bore no relation to efficient
marginal cost. "We conclude that ECPR is an impropermethod for setting prices of interconnection and unbundled
network elements because the existing retail prices thatwould be used to compute incremental opportunity costs
under ECPR are not cost-based. Moreover, the ECPR doesnot provide any mechanism for moving prices towards competitive levels; it simply takes prices as given." Id., || 709.
In effect, the adjustment for opportunity cost, because it
turns on pre-existing retail prices generated by embedded
costs, would pass on the same inefficiencies and be vulnerable to the same asymmetries of information in ratemaking
as a straightforward embedded-cost scheme.32

The third category of alternative methodologies proposed
focuses on costs over an intermediate term where some fixed
costs are unavoidable, as opposed to TELRIC's long run.
See n. 25, supra (defining the long run). The fundamental
intuition underlying this method of ratesetting is that competition is actually favored by allowing incumbents rate re32 ECPR advocates have since responded that the FCC was wrong to
assume a static tether to uncompetitive retail prices, because ECPR, properly employed, would dynamically readjust the opportunity-cost factor as
retail prices drop. Sidak & Spulber, Telecommons 1097-1098. But this
would not cure the distortions caused by passing any difference between
retail price and most efficient cost back to the incumbents as a lease
premium.

Opinion of the Court
covery of certain fixed costs efficiently incurred in the inter-mediate term.

The most commonly proposed variant of fixed-cost recov-ery ratesetting is "Ramsey pricing." See

Iowa Utilities
Bd., supra, at 426-427 (Breyer, J., concurring in part anddissenting in part). Ramsey pricing was originally theorized as a method of discriminatory taxation of commodities
to generate revenue with minimal discouragement of desiredconsumption. Ramsey, A Contribution to the Theory of

Taxation, 37 Econ. J. 47, 58-59 (1927). The underlying prin-ciple is that goods should be taxed or priced according to
demand: taxes or prices should be higher as to goods for
which demand is relatively inelastic. K. Train, Optimal
Regulation: The Economic Theory of Natural Monopoly 122-
125 (1991). As applied to the local-exchange wholesale market, Ramsey pricing would allow rate recovery of certain
costs incurred by an incumbent above marginal cost, costs
associated with providing an unbundled network element
that are fixed and unavoidable over the intermediate run,
typically the 3- or 4-year term of a rate arbitration agreement. The specific mechanism for recovery through wholesale lease rates would be to spread such costs across the
different elements to be leased according to the demand
for each particular element. First Report and Order || 696.
Cf. B. Mitchell & I. Vogelsang, Telecommunications Pricing:
Theory and Practice 43-61 (1991). Thus, when demand
among entrants for loop elements is high as compared with
demand for switch elements, a higher proportion of fixed
costs would be added as a premium to the loop-element lease
rate than to the switch lease rate.

But this very feature appears to be a drawback when used
as a method of setting rates for the wholesale market in
unbundled network elements. Because the elements for
which demand among entrants will be highest are the costly
bottleneck elements, duplication of which is neither likely
nor desired, high lease rates for these elements would be

Opinion of the Court
the rates most likely to deter market entry, as our earlier
example showed: if the rate for bottleneck elements went
from $100 to $110, the $107 competitor would be kept out.
This is what the FCC has said:

"[W]e conclude that an allocation methodology that relies exclusively on allocating common costs in inverse
proportion to the sensitivity of demand for various network elements and services may not be used. We conclude that such an allocation could unreasonably limit
the extent of entry into local exchange markets by allocating more costs to, and thus raising the prices of, the
most critical bottleneck inputs, the demand for which
tends to be relatively inelastic. Such an allocation of
these costs would undermine the pro-competitive objectives of the 1996 Act." First Report and Order || 696
(footnote omitted).

At the end of the day, theory aside, the claim that TELRIC
is unreasonable as a matter of law because it simulates but
does not produce facilities-based competition founders on
fact. The entrants have presented figures showing that
they have invested in new facilities to the tune of $55 billion
since the passage of the Act (through 2000), see Association
for Local Telecommunications Services, Local Competition
Policy & the New Economy 4 (Feb. 2, 2001); Hearing on H. R.

Act of 1996 Working?, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 1013, 1015 (2000)
($30 billion invested through 1999). The FCC's statistics indicate substantial resort to pure and partial facilities-based
competition among the three entry strategies: as of June 30,
2001, 33 percent of entrants were using their own facilities;
23 percent were reselling services; and 44 percent were leas535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing network elements (26 percent of entrants leasing loopswith switching; 18 percent without switching). See FCC,

Local Telephone Competition: Status as of June 30, 2001, p. 2(Feb. 27, 2002) (tables 3-4). The incumbents do not contradict these figures, but merely speculate that the invest-ment has not been as much as it could have been under other
ratemaking approaches, and they note that investment hasmore recently shifted to nonfacilities entry options. We, of
course, have no idea whether a different forward-lookingpricing scheme would have generated even greater competitive investment than the $55 billion that the entrants claim,but it suffices to say that a regulatory scheme that can boast
such substantial competitive capital spending over a 4-yearperiod is not easily described as an unreasonable way to promote competitive investment in facilities.33

b
The incumbents' second reason for calling TELRIC anunreasonable exercise of the FCC's regulatory discretion is

the supposed incapacity of this methodology to provideenough depreciation and allowance for capital costs to induce
rational competition on the theory's own terms. This chal-lenge must be assessed against the background of utilities'
customary preference for extended depreciation schedules inratemaking (so as to preserve high rate bases), see n. 8,
supra; we have already noted the consequence of the utili-ties' approach, that the "book" value or embedded costs of
capital presented to traditional ratemaking bodies often bore

33 Nor, for that matter, does the evidence support Justice Breyer's
assertion that TELRIC will stifle incumbents' "incentive . . . either to
innovate or to invest" in new elements. Post, at 551. As Justice
Breyer himself notes, incumbents have invested "over $100 billion" during the same period. Post, at 552. The figure affirms the commonsense
conclusion that so long as TELRIC brings about some competition, the
incumbents will continue to have incentives to invest and to improve their
services to hold on to their existing customer base.

little resemblance to the economic value of the capital. SeeFCC Releases Audit Reports on RBOCs' Property Records,

Report No. CC 99-3, 1999 WL 95044 (FCC, Feb. 25, 1999)("[B]ook costs may be overstated by approximately $5 billion"); Huber et al. 116 (We now know that "[b]y the early1980s, the Bell System had accumulated a vast library of accounting books that belonged alongside dime-store novelsand other works of fiction. . . . By 1987, it was widely estimated that the book value of telephone company investmentsexceeded market value by $25 billion dollars"). TELRIC
seeks to avoid this problem by basing its valuation on themarket price for most efficient elements; when rates are figured by reference to a hypothetical element instead of anincumbent's actual element, the incumbent gets no unfair advantage from favorable depreciation rates in the traditionalsense.

This, according to the incumbents, will be fatal to compe-tition. Their argument is that TELRIC will result in constantly changing rates based on ever cheaper, more effi-cient technology; the incumbents will be unable to write off
each new piece of technology rapidly enough to anticipatean even newer gadget portending a new and lower rate.
They will be stuck, they say, with sunk costs in less efficientplant and equipment, with their investment unrecoverable
through depreciation, and their increased risk unrecognizedand uncompensated.

34

34 The incumbents also contend that underdepreciation, i. e., book values
in excess of the economic value of assets, is another reason for increasing
depreciation costs under TELRIC. Brief for Petitioners in No. 00-511,
pp. 4-5. This argument is unpersuasive. As we have described, underdepreciation (to the extent of its continuation today, which the Government disputes, Brief for Respondent Federal Parties 38-39) was undertaken largely by the incumbents themselves, not forced upon them by
regulators, as a means to keep the rate base inflated under the publicutility model of regulation. See supra, at 485-487, 499. For all we know,
the incumbent carriers may yet be seeking low rates of depreciation in
state retail-rate proceedings still conducted under that model, even as

535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

519Cite as: 535 U. S. 467 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
The argument, however, rests upon a fundamentally falsepremise, that the TELRIC rules limit the depreciation and

capital costs that ratesetting commissions may recognize.In fact, TELRIC itself prescribes no fixed percentage rate
as risk-adjusted capital costs and recognizes no particularuseful life as a basis for calculating depreciation costs. On
the contrary, the FCC committed considerable discretion tostate commissions on these matters.

"Based on the current record, we conclude that thecurrently authorized rate of return at the federal or
state level is a reasonable starting point for TELRICcalculations, and incumbent LECs bear the burden of
demonstrating with specificity that the business risksthat they face in providing unbundled network elements
and interconnection services would justify a differentrisk-adjusted cost of capital or depreciation rate. . . .
States may adjust the cost of capital if a party demon-strates to a state commission that either a higher or a
lower level of cost of capital is warranted, without thatcommission conducting a `rate-of-return or other rate
based proceeding.' We note that the risk-adjusted costof capital need not be uniform for all elements. We intend to re-examine the issue of the appropriate risk-adjusted cost of capital on an ongoing basis, particularly
in light of the state commissions' experiences in address-ing this issue in specific situations." First Report and
Order || 702.
The order thus treated then-current capital costs and ratesof depreciation as mere starting points, to be adjusted upward if the incumbents demonstrate the need. That is, for
they seek high depreciation rates here today to factor into the wholesale
prices they may charge for the same elements they use to provide retail
services. In short, the incumbents have already benefited from underdepreciation in the calculation of retail rates, and there is no reason to
allow them further recovery through wholesale rates.

Opinion of the Court
calculating leased element rates, the Commission specificallypermits more favorable allowances for costs of capital and

depreciation than were generally allowed under traditionalratemaking practice.

The incumbents' fallback position, that existing rates ofdepreciation and costs of capital are not even reasonable
starting points, is unpersuasive. As to depreciation rates,
it is well to start by asking how serious a threat there
may be of galloping obsolescence requiring commensurately
rising depreciation rates. The answer does not support
the incumbents. The local-loop plant makes up at least
48 percent of the elements incumbents will have to provide, see id., || 378, n. 818 ("As of . . . 1995 . . . [l]ocal loop
plant comprises approximately $109 billion of total plant in
service, which represents . . . 48 percent of network plant"),
and while the technology of certain other elements like
switches has evolved very rapidly in recent years, loop technology generally has gone no further than copper twistedpair wire and fiber-optic cable in the past couple of decades.
See n. 10, supra (less than 1 percent of local-exchange telephone lines employ technologies other than copper or fiber).
We have been informed of no specter of imminently obsolescent loops requiring a radical revision of currently reasonable depreciation.35 This is significant because the FCC
found as a general matter that federally prescribed rates of
depreciation and counterparts in many States are fairly up
to date with the current state of telecommunications technologies as to different elements. See First Report and
Order || 702.

35 Justice Breyer makes much of the availability of new technologies,
specifically, the use of fixed wireless and electrical conduits, see post, at
549; but the use of wireless technology in local-exchange markets is negligible at present (36,000 lines in the entire Nation, less than 0.02 percent
of total lines, FCC, Local Telephone Competition: Status as of June 30,
2001 (Feb. 27, 2002) (table 5)), and the FCC has not reported any use
whatsoever of electrical conduits to provide local telecommunications
service.

Opinion of the Court
As for risk-adjusted costs of capital, competition in fact
has been slow to materialize in local-exchange retail markets
(as of June 30, 2001, the incumbents retained a 91 percent
share of the local-exchange markets, FCC, Local Telephone
Competition: Status as of June 30, 2001 (Feb. 27, 2002) (table
1)), and whether the FCC's assumption about adequate risk
adjustment was based on hypothetical or actual competition,
it seems fair to say that the rate of 11.25 percent mentioned
by the FCC, First Report and Order || 702, is a "reasonable
starting point" for return on equity calculations based on
the current lack of significant competition in local-exchange
markets.

A basic weakness of the incumbents' attack, indeed, is
its tendency to argue in highly general terms, whereas
TELRIC rates are calculated on the basis of individual elements. TELRIC rates leave plenty of room for differences
in the appropriate depreciation rates and risk-adjusted capital costs depending on the nature and technology of the specific element to be priced (as between switches and loops, for
example). For that matter, even the blanket assumption
that on a TELRIC valuation the estimated purchase price of
a most efficient element will necessarily be lower than the
actual costs of current elements is suspect. The New York
Public Service Commission, for example, used the cost of the
more expensive fiber-optic cable as the basis for its TELRIC
loop fixed rates, notwithstanding the fact that competitors
argued that the cheaper copper-wire loop was more efficient
for voice communications and should have been the underlying valuation for loop rates. See 2 Lodging Material for
Respondents Worldcom, Inc., et al. 655-657 (Opinion No. 97-

2, effective Apr. 1, 1997 (Opinion and Order Setting Rates for

different TELRIC rates to be calculated by state commissions across the country, see Brief for Petitioners Worldcom,

Opinion of the Court
sion's prescription of a general "starting point" is reasonable enough.

c

Finally, as to the incumbents' accusation that TELRIC is
too complicated to be practical, a criticism at least as telling
can be leveled at traditional ratemaking methodologies and
the alternatives proffered. "One important potential advantage of the T[E]LRIC approach, however is its relative
ease of calculation. Rather than estimate costs reflecting
the present [incumbent] network--a difficult task even if [incumbents] provided reliable data--it is possible to generate
T[E]LRIC estimates based on a `green field' approach, which
assumes construction of a network from scratch." App. 182
(Reply Comments of the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration 24 (May 30, 1996)). To the extent that the traditional public-utility model generally relied
on embedded costs, similar sorts of complexity in reckoning
were exacerbated by an asymmetry of information, much to
the utilities' benefit. See supra, at 486-487, 499. And what
we see from the record suggests that TELRIC rate proceedings are surprisingly smooth-running affairs, with incumbents and competitors typically presenting two conflicting
economic models supported by expert testimony, and state
commissioners customarily assigning rates based on some
predictions from one model and others from its counterpart.
See, e. g., 1 Lodging Material for Respondents Worldcom,
Inc., et al. 146-147, 367-368 (Fla. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, In re:
Determination of cost of basic local telecommunications
service, pursuant to Section 364.025, Florida Statutes, issued Jan. 7, 1999); 2 id., at 589-598, 701-704 (N. Y. Pub. Serv.
Comm'n, Opinion No. 97-2, supra). At bottom, battles of
experts are bound to be part of any ratesetting scheme, and
the FCC was reasonable to prefer TELRIC over alternative
fixed-cost schemes that preserve home-field advantages for
the incumbents.

Opinion of the Court

* * *
We cannot say whether the passage of time will show
competition prompted by TELRIC to be an illusion, but
TELRIC appears to be a reasonable policy for now, and that
is all that counts. See Chevron, 467 U. S., at 866. The incumbents have failed to show that TELRIC is unreasonable on its own terms, largely because they fall into the trap
of mischaracterizing the FCC's departures from the assumption of a perfectly competitive market (the wire-center limitation, regulatory and development lags, or the refusal to
prescribe high depreciation and capital costs) as inconsistencies rather than pragmatic features of the TELRIC plan.
Nor have they shown it was unreasonable for the FCC to
pick TELRIC over alternative methods, or presented evidence to rebut the entrants' figures as to the level of competitive investment in local-exchange markets. In short,
the incumbents have failed to carry their burden of showing
unreasonableness to defeat the deference due the Commission. We therefore reverse the Eighth Circuit's judgment
insofar as it invalidated TELRIC as a method for setting
rates under the Act.

C

The incumbents' claim of TELRIC's inherent inadequacy
to deal with depreciation or capital costs has its counterpart
in a further argument. They seek to apply the rule of constitutional avoidance in saying that "cost" ought to be construed by reference to historical investment in order to avoid
a serious constitutional question, whether a methodology
so divorced from investment actually made will lead to a
taking of property in violation of the Fifth (or Fourteenth)
Amendment. The Eighth Circuit did not think any such serious question was in the offing, 219 F. 3d, at 753-754, and
neither do we.

At the outset, it is well to understand that the incumbent carriers do not present the portent of a constitutional

524 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
taking claim in the way that is usual in ratemaking cases.They do not argue that any particular, actual TELRIC rate

is "so unjust as to be confiscatory," that is, as threatening anincumbent's "financial integrity."

Duquesne Light Co., 488
U. S., at 307, 312. Indeed, the incumbent carriers have noteven presented us with an instance of TELRIC rates, which

are to be set or approved by state commissions and reviewed
in the first instance in the federal district courts, 47 U. S. C.$$ 252(e)(4) and (e)(6). And this, despite the fact that some

States apparently have put rates in place already usingTELRIC. See First Report and Order || 631 and accompanying footnotes ("A number of states already employ, or have
plans to utilize, some form of [long-run incremental cost]
methodology in their approach to setting prices for unbundled network elements").

This want of any rate to be reviewed is significant, given
that this Court has never considered a taking challenge on
a ratesetting methodology without being presented with
specific rate orders alleged to be confiscatory. See, e. g., Duquesne Light Co., supra, at 303-304 (denial of $3.5 million
and $15.4 million increases to rate bases of electric utilities);
Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S., at 470-476 (Nebraska carrier-rate
tariff schedule alleged to effect a taking). Granted, the
Court has never strictly held that a utility must have rates
in hand before it can claim that the adoption of a new method
of setting rates will necessarily produce an unconstitutional
taking, but that has been the implication of much the Court
has said. See Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S., at 602 ("The
fact that the method employed to reach [ just and reasonable
rates] may contain infirmities is not . . . important"); Natural
Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U. S., at 586 ("The Constitution does
not bind rate-making bodies to the service of any single formula or combination of formulas"); Los Angeles Gas & Elec.
Corp. v. Railroad Comm'n of Cal., 289 U. S. 287, 305 (1933)

Opinion of the Court
any artificial rule or formula which changed conditions mightupset"). Undeniably, then, the general rule is that any question about the constitutionality of ratesetting is raised byrates, not methods, and this means that the policy of construing a statute to avoid constitutional questions where possibleis presumptively out of place when construing statutes prescribing methods.

The incumbents say this action is one of the rare onesplaced outside the general rule by signs, too strong to ignore,

that takings will occur if the TELRIC interpretation of$ 252(d)(1) is allowed. First, they compare, at the level of
the entire network (as opposed to element-by-element), industry balance-sheet indications of historical investment in
local telephone markets with the corresponding estimate of
a TELRIC evaluation of the cost to build a new and efficient
national system of local exchanges providing universal service. Brief for Petitioners in No. 00-511, at 10-11, and n. 6.
As against an estimated $180 billion for such a new system,
the incumbents juxtapose a value representing "total plant"
on the industry balance sheet for 1999 of roughly $342 billion.
They argue that the huge and unreasonable difference is
proof that TELRIC will necessarily result in confiscatory
rates. Ibid. (citing FCC, 1999 Statistics of Communications
Common Carriers 51 (Aug. 1, 2000) (table 2.9, line no. 32)).

The comparison, however, is spurious because the numbers
assumed by the incumbents are clearly wrong. On the one
side, the $180 billion is supposed to be based on constructing
a barebones universal-service telephone network, and so it
fails to cover elements associated with more advanced telecommunications services that incumbents are required to
provide by lease under 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c)(3). See Application by Bell Atlantic New York for Authorization under
Section 271 of the Communications Act, 15 FCC Rcd. 3953,
|| 245 (1999), aff 'd, 220 F. 3d 607 (CADC 2000). See also In

Opinion of the Court
service model may not be "appropriate [for] determining . . .prices for unbundled network elements"). We do not know

how much higher the efficient replacement figure should be,but we can reasonably assume that $180 billion is too low.

On the other side of the comparison, the "balance sheet"number is patently misstated. As explained above, any
rates under the traditional public-utility model would be cal-culated on a rate base (whether fair value or cost of service)
subject to deductions for accrued depreciation. See Phillips310-315. The net plant investment after depreciation is
not $342 billion but $166 billion, FCC, Statistics of Commu-nications Common Carriers, at 51 (table 2.9, line no. 50), an
amount less than the TELRIC figure the incumbents wouldlike us to assume. And even after we increase the $166 billion by the amount of net current liabilities ($22 billion) onthe balance sheet,

ibid. (line no. 64 minus line no. 13), as arough (and generous) estimate of the working-capital allowance under cost of service, the rate base would then be $188billion, still a far cry from the $342 billion the incumbents
tout, and less than 5 percent above the incumbents' $180 bil-lion universal-service TELRIC figure. What the best numbers may be we are in no position to say: the point is onlythat the numbers being thrown out by the incumbents are
no evidence that TELRIC lease rates would be confiscatory,sight unseen.

The incumbent carriers' second try at nonrate constitu-tional litigation focuses on reliance interests allegedly jeopardized by an intentional switch in ratesetting methodolo-gies. They rely on

Duquesne, where we held as usual thata ratesetting methodology would normally be judged only by

the "overall impact of the rate orders," 36 but went further

36 The Court upheld a Pennsylvania statute barring rate recovery of
capital prudently invested in canceled power plants because the "overall
impact of the rate orders," which allowed returns on common equity of
16 percent and overall returns of 11 to 12 percent, was not "constitutionally objectionable." 488 U. S., at 312; see also id., at 314 (" `It is not

in dicta. We remarked that "a State's decision to arbitrarilyswitch back and forth between methodologies in a way which

required investors to bear the risk of bad investments atsome times while denying them the benefit of good investments at others would raise serious constitutional ques-tions." 488 U. S., at 315.

37 In other words, there may be

a taking challenge distinct from a plain-vanilla objection to
arbitrary or capricious agency action 38 if a ratemaking bodywere to make opportunistic changes in ratesetting methodologies just to minimize return on capital investment in autility enterprise.

In Duquesne itself, there was no need to decide whetherthere might be an exception to the rate-order requirement
for a claim of taking by rates, and there is no reason here todecide whether the policy of constitutional avoidance should
be invoked in order to anticipate a rate-order taking claim.The reason is the same in each case: the incumbent carriers
here are just like the electric utilities in Duquesne in failing
to present any evidence that the decision to adopt TELRIC

Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, 602 (1944)). The utilities in Duquesne, like the incumbents here, made "[n]o argument . . . that . . . reduced
rates jeopardize the financial integrity of the companies, either by leaving
them insufficient operating capital or by impeding their ability to raise
future capital." 488 U. S., at 312. Nor did they show that allowed rates
were "inadequate to compensate current equity holders for the risk associated with their investments under a modified prudent investment
scheme." Ibid.

37 Justice Scalia, joined by Justice White and Justice O'Connor,

concurred, and noted that "all prudently incurred investment may well
have to be counted" to determine "whether the government's action is
confiscatory." Id., at 317.

38 The incumbents make the additional argument that it was arbitrary

or capricious for the FCC to reject historical costs, Brief for Petitioners
in No. 00-511, at 44-49, but this is simply a restatement of the argument
that the FCC was unreasonable in interpreting $ 252(d)(1) to foreclose the
use of historical cost in ratesetting, which we have already addressed, see
Part III-B-2, supra.

was arbitrary, opportunistic, or undertaken with a confisca-tory purpose. What we do know is very much to the contrary. First of all, there was no "switch" of methodologies,since the wholesale market for leasing network elements is
something brand new under the 1996 Act. There was noreplacement of any predecessor methods, much less an opportunistic switch "back and forth." And to the extent thatthe incumbents argue that there was at least an expectation
that some historically anchored cost-of-service method wouldset wholesale lease rates, no such promise was ever made.
First Report and Order || 706 ("[C]ontrary to assertions bysome [incumbents], regulation does not and should not guarantee full recovery of their embedded costs. Such a guaran-tee would exceed the assurances that [the FCC] or the states
have provided in the past"). Cf. Duquesne, supra, at 315.Any investor paying attention had to realize that he could
not rely indefinitely on traditional ratemaking methods butwould simply have to rely on the constitutional bar against
confiscatory rates.39 IV

The effort by the Government and the competing carriersto overturn the Eighth Circuit's invalidation of the additional

any court would be under Duquesne: "Incumbent LECs may seek relief
from the Commission's pricing methodology, if they provide specific information to show that the pricing methodology, as applied to them, will
result in confiscatory rates." First Report and Order || 739. The FCC,
in other words, is willing to consider a challenge to TELRIC in advance
of a rate order, but any challenger needs to go beyond general criticism
of a method's tendency, and to show with "specific information" that a
confiscatory rate is bound to result. Additionally, as the FCC has acknowledged, the smallest, rural incumbent local-exchange carriers most
likely to suffer immediately from the imposition of unduly low rates
are expressly exempt from the TELRIC pricing rules under 47 U. S. C.

$ 252(f)(1), see First Report and Order || 706, and other rural incumbents
may obtain exemptions from the rules by applying to their state commissions under $ 252(f)(2).

combination rules, 47 CFR $$ 51.315(c)-(f) (1997), draws the
incumbents' threshold objection that the challenge is barred
by waiver, since the 1999 petition to review the 1997 invalidation of Rule 315(b) did not extend to the Eighth Circuit's
simultaneous invalidation of the four companion rules, Rules
315(c)-(f ), 120 F. 3d, at 813, 819, n. 39.40 The incumbents
must, of course, acknowledge that the Court of Appeals sua
sponte invited briefing on the status of Rules 315(c)-(f) 41 on
remand after this Court's reinstatement of Rule 315(b), Iowa
Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 395, and specifically struck them
down again, albeit on its 1997 rationale, 219 F. 3d, at 758-759.
But the incumbent carriers argue that the Eighth Circuit
exceeded the scope of this Court's mandate when it revisited
the unchallenged portion of its earlier holding, so that this
Court should decline to reach the validity of Rules 315(c)-(f)
today. To do so, they say, would encourage the sort of strategic, piecemeal litigation disapproved in Communist Party

We do not think Communist Party blocks our consider-ation of Rules 315(c)-(f). The issue there was raised by the
petitioner's failure on an earlier trip to this Court to pursuea procedural objection to agency action. Litigation of the
procedural point would not only have obviated the Court'sneed to review the constitutionality of an Act of Congress
when the case got here, but could have saved five years oflitigation during which time "the Board and the Court of
Appeals [had] each twice more reconsidered [the] steadilygrowing record . . . ."

Id., at 31-32, n. 8. After all thattime, petitioner sought review of the procedural point.

Nothing like that can be said about these cases. Address-ing the issue now would not "make waste" of years of efforts
by the FCC or the Court of Appeals, id., at 32, n. 8, wouldnot threaten to leave a constitutional ruling pointless, and
would direct the Court's attention not to an isolated, "long-stale" procedural error by the agency, ibid., but to the invalidation of FCC rules meant to have general and continu-ing applicability. There is no indication of litigation tactics
behind the failure last time to appeal on these rules, whichwere reexamined on remand at the behest of the court, not
the Government or the competing carriers.Any issue "pressed or passed upon below" by a federal
court, United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 41 (1992) (in-ternal quotation marks omitted), is subject to this Court's
broad discretion over the questions it chooses to take on cer-tiorari, and there are good reasons to look at Rules 315(c)-(f).
The Court of Appeals passed on a significant issue, and oneplaced in a state of flux, see

B
The Eighth Circuit found the four additional combinationrules at odds with the plain language of the final sentence of

47 U. S. C. $ 251(c)(3), which we quote more fully:

"[E]ach incumbent local exchange carrier has . . .. . . . .

"[t]he duty to provide, to any requesting telecommuni-cations carrier for the provision of a telecommunications
service, nondiscriminatory access to network elementson an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point
on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable,and nondiscriminatory . . . . An incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide such unbundled networkelements in a manner that allows requesting carriers
to combine such elements in order to provide such tele-communications service."

"Bundling" and "combination" are related but distinct con-cepts. Bundling is about lease pricing. To provide a network element "on an unbundled basis" is to lease the ele-ment, however described, to a requesting carrier at a stated
price specific to that element. Iowa Utilities Bd., supra,at 394. The FCC's regulations identify in advance a certain
number of elements for separate pricing, 47 CFR $ 51.319(1997), but the regulations do not limit the elements subject
to specific rates. A separately priced element need not bethe simplest possible configuration of equipment or function,
and a predesignated unbundled element might actually com-prise items that could be considered separate elements themselves. For example, "if the states require incumbent LECsto provision subloop elements [which together constitute a
local loop], incumbent LECs must still provision a local loop

535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
532 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
as a single, combined element when so requested, becausewe identify local loops as a single element in this proceeding." First Report and Order || 295. The "combination"provided for in Rules 315(b)-(f), on the other hand, refers
to a mechanical connection of physical elements within anincumbent's network, or the connection of a competitive carrier's element with the incumbent's network "in a manner
that would allow a requesting carrier to offer the telecommu-nications service."

Id., || 294, n. 620.
The additional combination rules are best understood asmeant to ensure that the statutory duty to provide unbundled elements gets a practical result. A separate rate for
an unbundled element is not much good if an incumbent refuses to lease the element except in combination with others
that competing carriers have no need of; or if the incumbents refuse to allow the leased elements to be combined
with a competitor's own equipment. And this is just what
was happening before the FCC devised its combination
rules. Incumbents, according to the FCC's findings, were
refusing to give competitors' technicians access to their

physical plants to make necessary connections. In re Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 15 FCC Rcd. 3696, 3910,
|| 482 (1999) (Third Report and Order), petitions for review
pending sub nom. United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC,
Nos. 00-1015, etc. (CADC).

The challenged additional combination rules, issued under

$ 251(c)(3), include two that are substantive and two that are
procedural, the latter having no independent significance
here. Rule 315(c) requires an incumbent to "perform the
functions necessary to combine unbundled network elements in any manner, even if those elements are not ordinarily combined" in the incumbent's own network, so long
as the combination is "[t]echnically feasible" and "[w]ould
not impair the ability of other carriers to obtain access to
unbundled network elements or to interconnect" with the

Opinion of the Court
incumbent's network. The companion Rule 315(d) likewiserequires the incumbent to do the combining between the

network elements it leases and a requesting carrier's ownelements, so long as technically feasible.

42

The rules are challenged alternatively as inconsistent withstatutory plain language and as unreasonable interpretations. The plain language in question is the sentence that"[a]n incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide such unbundled network elements in a manner that allows request-ing carriers to combine such elements in order to provide
such telecommunications service." 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c)(3).The Eighth Circuit read this as unambiguously excusing incumbents from any obligation to combine provided elements,219 F. 3d, at 759. The ruling has a familiar ring, for this is
the same reason that the Court of Appeals invalidated theserules in 1997 along with Rule 315(b), as being inconsistent
with a plain limit on incumbents' obligation under $ 251(c)(3)to provide elements "on an unbundled basis." 120 F. 3d,
at 813.But the language is not that plain. Of course, it is true
that the statute would not be violated literally by an incum-bent that provided elements so that a requesting carrier
could combine them, and thereafter sat on its hands whileany combining was done. But whether it is plain that the
incumbents have a right to sit is a question of context asmuch as grammar. If Congress had treated incumbents and
entrants as equals, it probably would be plain enough thatthe incumbents' obligations stopped at furnishing an element
that could be combined. The Act, however, proceeds on theunderstanding that incumbent monopolists and contending
competitors are unequal, cf. $ 251(c) ("Additional obligationsof incumbent local exchange carriers"), and within the actual
statutory confines it is not self-evident that in obligating

42 Under Rules 315(e)-(f), an incumbent that denies a requested combination has the burden to prove technical infeasibility or to show how the
combination would impede others' access.

Opinion of the Court
incumbents to furnish, Congress negated a duty to combinethat is not inconsistent with the obligation to furnish, but

not expressly mentioned. Thus, it takes a stretch to getfrom permissive statutory silence to a statutory right on the
part of the incumbents to refuse to combine for a requestingcarrier, say, that is unable to make the combination, First
Report and Order || 294, or may even be unaware that it
needs to combine certain elements to provide a telecom-munications service.

Id., || 293. And these are the only instances in which the additional combination rules obligatethe incumbents according to the FCC's clarification in the

First Report and Order.

The conclusion that the language is open is certainly in
harmony with, if not required by, our holding in Iowa Utilities Bd., dealing with Rule 315(b). In reinstating that rule,
we rejected the argument that furnishing elements "on an
unbundled basis," $ 251(c)(3), must mean "physically separated," 525 U. S., at 394, and expressly noted that "$ 251(c)(3)
is ambiguous on whether leased network elements may or
must be separated," id., at 395. We relied on that ambiguity
in holding that an incumbent has no statutory right to separate elements when a competitor asks to lease them in the
combined form employed by the incumbent in its own network. Ibid. That holding would make a very odd partner
with a ruling that an ambiguous $ 251(c)(3) plainly empowers
incumbent carriers to refuse to combine elements even when
requesting carriers cannot. We accordingly read the language of $ 251(c)(3) as leaving open who should do the work
of combination, and under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), that
leaves the FCC's rules intact unless the incumbents can
show them to be unreasonable.

For the decision whether Rules 315(c)-(f) survive Chevron
step two, Iowa Utilities Bd. is, to be sure, less immediate help, since in that case we found Rule 315(b) reasonable
because it prevented incumbents from dismantling exist535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ing combinations to sabotage competitors, 525 U. S., at 395,
whereas here we deal not with splitting up but with joining
together. We think, nonetheless, that the additional combination rules reflect a reasonable reading of the statute,
meant to remove practical barriers to competitive entry into
local-exchange markets while avoiding serious interference
with incumbent network operations.

At the outset, it is well to repeat that the duties imposed
under the rules are subject to restrictions limiting the burdens placed on the incumbents. An obligation on the part
of an incumbent to combine elements for an entrant under
Rules 315(c) and (d) only arises when the entrant is unable
to do the job itself. First Report and Order || 294 ("If the
carrier is unable to combine the elements, the incumbent
must do so"). When an incumbent does have an obligation,
the rules specify a duty to "perform the functions necessary
to combine," not necessarily to complete the actual combination. 47 CFR $$ 51.315(c)-(d) (1997). And the entrant
must pay "a reasonable cost-based fee" for whatever the
incumbent does. Brief for Petitioner Federal Parties in
Nos. 00-587, etc., p. 34. See also id., at 10, 34, n. 14.

The force of the objections is limited further by the FCC's
implementation in the rules of the statutory conditions that
the incumbents' duty arises only if the requested combination does not discriminate against other carriers by impeding
their access, and only if the requested combination is "technically feasible," $ 251(c)(3). As to the latter restriction, the
Commission "decline[d] to adopt the view proffered by some
parties that incumbents must combine network elements in
any technically feasible manner requested." First Report
and Order || 296. The concern was that such a rule "could
potentially affect the reliability and security of the incumbent's network, and the ability of other carriers to obtain
interconnection, or request and use unbundled elements."

Opinion of the Court
Thus, the incumbents are wrong to claim that the re-striction to "technical feasibility" places only minimal limits

on the duty to combine, since the First Report and Ordermakes it clear that what is "technically feasible" does not
mean merely what is "economically reasonable," id., || 199, orwhat is simply practical or possible in an engineering sense,
see id., |||| 196-198. The limitation is meant to preserve"network reliability and security,"

id., || 296, n. 622, and acombination is not technically feasible if it impedes an incumbent carrier's ability "to retain responsibility for themanagement, control, and performance of its own network,"
id., || 203.This demanding sense of "technical feasibility," as a condition protecting the incumbent's ability to control the per-formance of its own network, is in accord with what we said
in Iowa Utilities Bd. There, for example, we reinstated theCommission's "pick and choose" rule

43 in part because the

duty to provide network elements on matching terms to all
comers did not arise when it was "not technically feasible,"$ 51.809(b)(2). 525 U. S., at 396. If "technically feasible"

meant what is merely possible, it would have been no limita-tion at all.

The two substantive rules each have additional featuresthat are consistent with the purposes of $ 251(c)(3). Rule
315(c), to the extent that it raises a duty to combine whatis "ordinarily combined," neatly complements the facially
similar Rule 315(b), upheld in Iowa Utilities Bd., id., at 395,forbidding incumbents to separate currently combined network elements when the entrant requests them in a com-bined form. If the latter were the only rule, an incumbent

43 "An incumbent LEC shall make available without unreasonable delay
to any requesting telecommunications carrier any individual interconnection, service, or network element arrangement contained in any
agreement to which it is a party that is approved by a state commission
pursuant to section 252 of the Act, upon the same rates, terms, and conditions as those provided in the agreement." 47 CFR $ 51.809(a) (1997).

Opinion of the Court
might well be within its rights to insist, for example, on pro-viding a loop and a switch in a combined form when a naive

entrant asked just for them, while refusing later to combinethem with a network interface device, which is also ordinarily combined with the loop and the switch, and whichis necessary to set up a telecommunications link. But
under Rule 315(c), when the entrant later requires the
element it missed the first time, the incumbent's obligationis to "perform the functions necessary," 47 CFR $ 51.315(c)

(1997), for a combination of what the entrant cannot com-bine alone, First Report and Order || 294, and would not
have needed to combine if it had known enough to request
the elements together in a combined form in the first place.
Cf. id., || 297 ("[I]ncumbent[s] must work with new entrants
to identify the elements the new entrants will need to
offer a particular service in the manner the new entrants
intend").

Of course, it is not this aspect of Rule 315(c), requiring
the combination of what is ordinarily combined, that draws
the incumbents' (or Justice Breyer's, see post, at 563)
principal objection; they focus their attack, rather, on the
additional requirement of Rule 315(c), that incumbents combine unbundled network elements "even if those elements
are not ordinarily combined in the incumbent['s] network."
47 CFR $ 51.315(c) (1997). To build upon our previous example, this would seemingly require an incumbent to combine the loop, switch, and interface (ordinarily combined in
its network) with a second loop and network interface (provided by the incumbent as a separate unbundled element),
so that the competitive carrier could charge for a second-line
connection, as for a fax or modem. See Brief for Petitioners
Worldcom, Inc., et al. in No. 00-555, at 48 (providing the
example).

But this provision of Rule 315(c) is justified by the statutory requirement of "nondiscriminatory access." $ 251(c)(3).
As we have said, the FCC has interpreted the rule as obli535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
538 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
gating the incumbent to combine "[i]f the carrier is unableto combine the elements." First Report and Order || 294.

There is no dispute that the incumbent could make the com-bination more efficiently than the entrant; nor is it contested
that the incumbent would provide the combination itselfif a customer wanted it or the combination otherwise served
a business purpose. See Third Report and Order || 481.
It hardly seems unreasonable, then, to require the incumbentto make the combination, for which it will be entitled to a

reasonable fee; otherwise, an entrant would not enjoy true"nondiscriminatory access" notwithstanding the bare provision on an unbundled basis of the network elements it
needs to provide a service.

As to Rule 315(d), it is hard to see how this rule is any
less reasonable than $ 251(c)(2), which imposes a statutory
duty to interconnect. The rule simply requires the incumbent to perform functions necessary to combine the
unbundled elements it provides with elements owned by
the requesting carrier "in any technically feasible manner."
Essentially, it appears to be nothing more than an elementto-element version of the incumbents' statutory duty "to provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting . . .
carrier, interconnection with the local exchange carrier's
network," in $ 251(c)(2).

In sum, what we have are rules that say an incumbent
shall, for payment, "perform the functions necessary," 47
CFR $$ 51.315(c) and (d) (1997), to combine network elements
to put a competing carrier on an equal footing with the incumbent when the requesting carrier is unable to combine,
First Report and Order || 294, when it would not place the
incumbent at a disadvantage in operating its own network, and when it would not place other competing carriers
at a competitive disadvantage, 47 CFR $ 51.315(c)(2) (1997).
This duty is consistent with the Act's goals of competition
and nondiscrimination, and imposing it is a sensible way to
reach the result the statute requires.

* * *
The 1996 Act sought to bring competition to local-exchange markets, in part by requiring incumbent localexchange carriers to lease elements of their networks atrates that would attract new entrants when it would be more
efficient to lease than to build or resell. Whether the FCCpicked the best way to set these rates is the stuff of debate
for economists and regulators versed in the technology oftelecommunications and microeconomic pricing theory. The
job of judges is to ask whether the Commission made choicesreasonably within the pale of statutory possibility in deciding what and how items must be leased and the way to setrates for leasing them. The FCC's pricing and additional
combination rules survive that scrutiny.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part
and affirmed in part, and the cases are remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

I agree with the majority that the Telecommunications Actof 1996 (Act or Telecommunications Act), 47 U. S. C. $ 251

no taking of the incumbent firms' property in violation ofthe Fifth Amendment has occurred. I disagree, however,

(1996). As part of that effort, the Act requires incumbentlocal telecommunications firms to make certain "elements"
of their local systems available to new competitors seekingto enter those local markets. 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c)(3) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V). If the incumbents and competitors cannot agree
on the price that an incumbent can charge a new entrant,local regulators will determine the price. $ 252. The regulated price will depend upon the element's "cost." $ 252(d)(1)(A). In

AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366
(1999), this Court held that the Act authorizes the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) to set
rules for determining those prices.

These cases require the Court to review the Commission's
rules. Those rules create a "start-from-scratch" version of
what the Commission calls a "Total Element Long-Run Incremental Cost" system (TELRIC). See Kahn, Tardiff, &
Weisman, The Telecommunications Act at three years: an
economic evaluation of its implementation by the Federal
Communications Commission, 11 Info. Econ. & Policy 319,
326 (1999) (hereinafter Kahn) (referring to the FCC's system
as "TELRIC-Blank Slate"). In essence, the Commission requires local regulators to determine the cost of supplying a
particular incumbent network "element" to a new entrant,
not by looking at what it has cost that incumbent to supply the element in the past, nor by looking at what it will
cost that incumbent to supply that element in the future.
Rather, the regulator must look to what it would cost a
hypothetical perfectly efficient firm to supply that element
in the future, assuming that the hypothetical firm were to
build essentially from scratch a new, perfectly efficient communications network. The only concession to the incumbent's actual network is the presumption that presently
existing wire centers--which hold the switching equipment
for a local area--will remain in their current locations.

in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 11 FCC Rcd. 15499,

will be placed at the incumbent LEC's current wire centerlocations, but that the reconstructed local network will employ the most efficient technology for reasonably foreseeable
capacity requirements").An example will help explain the system as I understand it. Imagine an incumbent local telephone company'smajor switching center, say, in downtown Chicago, from
which cables and wires run through conduits or along poles
to subsidiary switching equipment, other electronic equipment, and eventually to end-user equipment, such as telephone handsets, computer modems, or fax machines located
in office buildings or private residences. A new competitor,
whom the law entitles to use an "element" of the incumbent
firm's system, asks for use of such an "element," say, a single
five-block portion of this system, thereby obtaining access
to 20 downtown office buildings. Under the Commission's
TELRIC, the incumbent's "cost" (upon which "rates" must
be based) equals not the real resources that the Chicago
incumbent must spend to provide the five-block "element"
demanded, but the resources that a hypothetical perfectly
efficient new supplier would spend were that supplier rebuilding the entire downtown Chicago system, other than
the local wire center, from scratch. This latter figure, of
course, might be very different from any incumbent's actual
costs.

things, whether the Commission has " `abuse[d]' " its statutorily delegated " `discretion' " to create implementing rules.

since the subject matter is a highly technical one, namely,ratemaking, where the agency possesses expert knowledge.
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844 (1984).Nonetheless, that leeway is not unlimited. It is bounded,

for example, by the scope of the statute that grants authorityand by the need for the agency to show a "rational connection" between the regulations and the statute's purposes.State Farm, 463 U. S., at 56. We must determine whether,
despite the leeway given experts on technical subject matter,agency regulations exceed these legal limits. See id., at 43;
Overton Park, supra, at 416; Administrative Procedure Act,5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A) (requiring agency action to be set aside
if "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwisenot in accordance with law"). And, reluctantly, I have come
to the conclusion that they do. After considering the in-cumbents' objections and the Commission's responses, I cannot find that "rational connection" between statutory pur-pose and implementing regulation that the law demands.
State Farm, supra, at 56. II

Because the critical legal problem concerns the relationof the Commission's regulations to the statute's purpose,
I must ask at the outset, what is that purpose? The rele-vant statutory provision says only that the agency shall set
"rate[s]" (for "elements") "based on . . . cost." 47 U. S. C.$ 252(d)(1). At first blush the word "cost" calls to mind
traditional cost-based ratesetting. See Natural Gas Act, 15U. S. C. $ 717c; Natural Gas Act of 1938, $$ 4a, 5, 52 Stat.

Protection and Competition Act of 1992: Rate Regulation,9 FCC Rcd. 4527, 4555, || 55 (1994) (Commission rules referring to "[o]riginal cost" as traditional basis "for public utility valuation").An agency engaged in traditional ratemaking will seek to

protect consumers by mandating low prices as the end result.In doing so, the agency will sometimes try to mimic the
prices that it believes (hypothetically) the regulated firm
(often a legal monopoly) would have set had it been an unregulated firm in a competitively structured industry. See
ante, at 486; Bonbright 89 ("[M]any economists have declared
that . . . the prices that would result without regulation but
under pure or perfect competition would be the `ideal'
prices"); 1 A. Kahn, Economics of Regulation: Principles and
Institutions 63 (1988) (hereinafter Economics of Regulation)
("The traditional legal criteria of proper public utility rates
have always borne a strong resemblance to the criteria of
the competitive market in long-run equilibrium"). And the
Commission's regulations are at least arguably consistent
with an agency effort to find prices that replicate the end
results of theoretically perfect competition. See Order
|||| 679, 738.

But that regulatory objective--low, competiti onmimicking prices--is not the objective of the relevant statutory provision here. The Telecommunications Act is not a
ratemaking statute seeking better regulation. It is a deregulatory statute seeking competition. It assumes that,
given modern technology, local telecommunications markets
may now prove large enough for several firms to compete in
the provision of some services--but not necessarily all services--without serious economic waste. It finds the competitive process an indirect but more effective way to bring

544 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Breyer, J.
about the common objectives of competition and regulationalike, namely, low prices, better products, and more efficient

production methods. But it authorizes the Commission topromulgate rules that will help achieve that procedural
goal--the substitution of competition for regulation in localmarkets--where that transformation is economically feasible. See ante, at 539 (accepting this rationale). The Act
does not authorize the Commission to promulgate rules thatwould hinder the transition from a regulated to a competitive marketplace--whether or not those rules directlymandate lower "element" prices along the way.

Five considerations, taken together, convince me that
the description of the statutory goal I have just given is an
accurate one. First, the Act itself says that its objective
is to substitute competition for regulation. Preamble, 110
Stat. 56 (stating that the goal of the Act is to "promote competition and reduce regulation" in both local and longdistance telecommunications markets); see also H. R. Conf.
Rep. No. 104-458, at 1; ante, at 489.

Second, the Act's history suggests the Congress would
have thought that goal a reasonable one. The 20th century's
history of telecommunications markets is primarily one of
regulation. For decades experts justified regulation on the
ground that telecommunications providers were "natural
monopolists," i. e., telecommunications markets would not
support more than one firm of efficient size. See ante, at
475-476. But beginning in the 1970's, technological developments led to a change of expert opinion by undermining
the "natural monopoly" rationale. Long-distance telecommunications markets seemed newly capable of supporting
several competing firms without significant economic waste.
See R. Vietor, Contrived Competition: Regulation and Deregulation in America 185-190 (1994). And opinion began
to change similarly in respect to local markets. In the case
of local markets, however, the change was marked by hesitation and lingering uncertainty. See P. Huber, M. Kellogg, &

The Geodesic Network II: 1993 Report on Competition inthe Telephone Industry 2.1-2.5 (1992). That is because local
telecommunications service had long demanded expensivefixed investment, for example, digging up streets to lay cables or stringing wires on overhead poles. See ante, at 489-
491. And whether, or the extent to which, a new competitorcould replicate, or avoid, that kind of investment without significantly wasting resources remained unclear. See Huber34, 206. Thus, at the time Congress wrote the new Act,
technological development seemed to permit nonwasteful
competition in respect to some aspects of local service;
but in respect to other aspects an incumbent local telecommunications provider might continue to possess "natural
monopoly" advantages. Id., at 206-207. And these circumstances made it reasonable for Congress to try to secure local
competition insofar as that competition would prove economically feasible, i. e., where competition would not prove
seriously wasteful. See Order || 1. See also 47 U. S. C.

$$ 271(c)(1)(A), 271(c)(1)(B) (recognizing that some local markets will not support more than one firm).

Third, the Act's structure and language indicate a congressional effort to secure that very end. The Act dismantles artificial legal barriers to new entry in local markets, thereby permitting new firms to enter if they wish.

$ 253(a); see ante, at 491, and n. 12. But the Act recognizes
that simple permission may not prove sufficient--perhaps
because the incumbent will retain a "natural monopoly" form
of control over certain necessary elements of service. It
consequently goes on to promote new entry in three ways.
See ante, at 491-492. First, it requires incumbents to "interconnect" with new entrants (at a price determined by the
regulations before us), thereby allowing a new entrant's
small set of subscribers to connect with the incumbent firm's
likely larger customer base. $ 251(c)(2). Second, it requires

546 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Breyer, J.
incumbents to sell retail services to new entrants at whole-sale rates, thereby allowing newly entering firms automatically to compete in retailing if they so desire. $ 251(c)(4).Third, it requires incumbents to provide new entrants "access to network elements," say, telephone lines connectinghomes or offices with switching centers, "on an unbundled
basis." $ 251(c)(3). This third requirement permits a new
entrant to compete selectively without replicating (or substi-tuting) all of the elements the incumbent uses to offer the

service in question.Suppose, for example, the incumbent's control of certain
existing cables, lines, or switching equipment would put
the new entrant at an economic disadvantage because duplication of those "elements" would prove unnecessarily expensive. The new Act does not require the new entrant
and incumbent to compete in respect to those elements,
say, through wasteful duplication. Rather, the Act permits
the new entrant to offer, and to compete with respect to, a
related service by obtaining "access" to (and therefore using)
those "elements" of the incumbent's network, while finding on its own other elements necessary to the service.
It is as if a railroad regulator, anxious to promote railroad
competition between City A and City B but aware that it
would prove wasteful to duplicate a certain railroad bridge
across the Mississippi River, ordered the bridge's owner
to share the bridge with new competitors. The sharing
would avoid wasteful duplication of the hard-to-duplicate resource--namely, the bridge. But at the same time it would
facilitate competition in the remaining aspects of the A-to-B
railroad service. That, I assume, is why the Act says that
the "elements" that must be shared are those for which access is "necessary" and in respect to which "failure to provide access" would "impair" the ability of the new entrant
"to provide the services that it seeks to offer." $ 251(d)(2).
See Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 392 (Commission must
give "substance to the `necessary' and `impair' require535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ments"); cf. id., at 416-417 (Breyer, J., concurring in partand dissenting in part) (stating that the "necessary" and "impair" provision's object is to require access to, and therebyforce sharing of, those elements of an incumbent's system
that would prove, to a significant degree, economicallywasteful to duplicate).

To put the matter more concretely, imagine that a communications firm--a potential new entrant--wishes to sell voice,data, text, pictures, entertainment, or other communications

services, perhaps in competition with the incumbent. Thatfirm must decide how its service will reach a customer inside
a house or office. Should the firm (1) run its own new cable
into the house? (2) run wires through an already-existing
electricity conduit? (3) communicate without wires, say, by
wireless or one-way or two-way satellite? (4) or use the
incumbent's pair of twisted copper telephone service wires
already in place? If the potential new entrant claims that
all but the last of these possibilities are impractical or

far too expensive--that using existing telephone wires is far
cheaper (in terms of real resources expended) than the alternatives--then the new entrant is claiming that the incumbent's wires are a kind of "bridge" to which it must have
access. And it may ask the regulator to make its new entry
feasible by requiring the incumbent to permit it to use that
"element" at a reasonable price.

Fourth, the Commission has described the Act's goals as
including promotion of nonwasteful competition. The preamble to the Commission's price regulations describes
their statutorily based aim as "giv[ing] appropriate signals
to producers and consumers and ensur[ing] efficient entry
and utilization of the telecommunications infrastructure."
Order || 630 (emphasis added). The Commission also says
that "the prices that potential entrants pay for these elements should reflect forward-looking economic costs in order
to encourage efficient levels of investment and entry." Id.,
|| 672 (emphasis added). And it adds that "Congress spe535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cifically determined that input prices should be based oncosts because this would foster competition in the retail

market." Id., || 710; see also id., || 1.Fifth, the Solicitor General confirmed this view at oral
argument when he said that the rates in question shouldbe set in order to "encourage new entrants to come into
the market," Tr. of Oral Arg. 60, to "allow them to enter themarket at competitive rates,"

ibid., and to "encourage themto develop new technologies," id., at 61.

The statute, then, seeks new local market competition in-sofar as local markets can support that competition without
serious waste. And we must read the relevant ratesettingprovision--including the critical word "cost"--with that goal
in mind. III

The Commission's critics--Verizon, other incumbents, andexperts whose published articles Verizon has lodged with
the Court--concede that the statute grants the Commissionbroad authority to define "cost[s]." They also concede that
every ratesetting system has flaws. Cf., e. g., Missouriex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Serv.

cost" systems because of the administrative difficulty of de-termining costs); Economics of Regulation 109-111 (criticizing "historical cost" systems because of their failure toprovide proper incentives).

Nonetheless, the critics argue, the Commission cannot law-fully choose a system that thwarts a basic statutory purpose
without offering any significant compensating advantage.They take the relevant purpose as furthering local competition where feasible. See Part II, supra. They add thatrates will further that purpose (1) if they discourage new
firms from using the incumbent's facilities or "elements"when it is significantly less expensive, economically speaking, for the entrant to build or to buy elsewhere, and (2) if

they encourage new firms to use the incumbent's facilitieswhen it is significantly less expensive, economically speaking, for the entrant to do so. They point out that pricesthat approximately reflect an

actual incumbent's actual
additional costs of supplying the services (or "element")demanded will come close to doing both these things. See

Kahn 330 (prices set at "incremental cost," the cost of supplying an added "increment," will give challengers the"proper target at which to shoot" only if that cost reflects

"the cost that society will actually incur if they pur-chase more" or the resources that it would save if they

FCC has misunderstood the M-ECPR system). But prices
like the Commission's, based on the costs that a hypothetical
"most efficient" firm would incur if hypothetically building
largely from scratch, Order || 685, would do neither. Indeed,
they would do exactly the opposite, creating incentives that
hinder rather than further the statute's basic objective.

First, the critics ask, why, given such a system, would a
new entrant ever build or buy a new element? After all,
the Commission's ratesetting system sets the incumbent's
compulsory leasing rate at a level that would rarely exceed
the price of building or buying elsewhere. That is because
the Commission's ratesetting system chooses as its basis
the hypothetical cost of the most efficient method of providing the relevant service--i. e., the cost of entering a house
through the use of electrical conduits or of using wireless
(if cheaper in general), and it then applies those costs (based
on, say, hypothetical wireless) as if they were the cost of
the system in place (the twisted pair of wires). Why then
would the new entrant use an electrical conduit, or a wireless
system, to enter a house when, by definition, the Commis535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Breyer, J.
sion will require the incumbent to lease its pair of twistedwires at an equivalent price or lower--whether or not the

incumbent will have to spend more, in fact, to provide thetwisted wires? The rules further discourage independent
building or buying by assessing a special penalty upon thenew entrant that does so, for that entrant will have to
worry that soon another newer new entrant will insist upon
sharing the incumbent's equivalent of that very element at astill lower regulation-determined price based on subsequent

technological developments.The Commission's system will tend to create instances in
which (1) the incumbent's actual future cost of maintaining an element (say, a set of wires) will exceed (2) the new
entrant's cost of building or buying elsewhere (say, through
wireless or wires in electrical conduits) which, in turn, will
equal (or even exceed) (3) the hypothetical future "best practice" cost (namely, what the experts decide will, in general,
be cheapest). In such a case (or in related cases, where
technological improvements, actual or predicted, tend to
offset various cost differences), the new entrant will uneconomically share the incumbent's facilities by leasing
rather than building or buying elsewhere. And that result,
in the assumed circumstances, is wasteful. It undermines
the efficiency goal that the majority itself claims the Act
seeks to achieve. Cf. ante, at 509-510, 539.

Nor is the "sharing" of facilities (e. g., the wire pairs)
that this result embodies consistent with the competition
that the Act was written to promote. That is because firms
that share existing facilities do not compete in respect to
the facilities that they share, any more than several grain
producers who auction their grain at a single jointly owned
market compete in respect to auction services. Cf. Iowa
Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 429 (Breyer, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) ("It is in the unshared, not in
the shared, portions of the enterprise that meaningful competition would likely emerge"). Yet rules that combine a

strong monetary incentive to share with a broad definition of"network element," see 47 CFR $$ 51.319(f )-(g) (1997); Order

very different from the competitive market that the statuteseeks to create. See

Iowa Utilities Bd., supra, at 386-387
(affirming the Commission's broad definition of "network element"). At the least, those rules are inconsistent with theCommission's own view that they will sometimes "serve as

a transitional arrangement until fledgling competitors coulddevelop a customer base and complete the construction of
their own networks." In re Implementation of the Local
Competition Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, 15 FCC Rcd. 3696, 3700, || 6 (1999) (Third Report and
Order). Why, given the pricing rules, would those "fledgling competitors" ever try to fly on their own?

Second, what incentive would the Commission's rules
leave the incumbents either to innovate or to invest in a new
"element?" The rules seem to say that the incumbent will
share with competitors the cost-reducing benefits of a successful innovation, while leaving the incumbent to bear the
costs of most unsuccessful investments on its own. But see
infra, at 552. Why would investment not then stagnate?
See, e. g., Jorde, Sidak, & Teece, Innovation, Investment, and
Unbundling, 17 Yale J. Reg. 1, 8 (2000) ("It makes no
economic sense for the [incumbent] to invest in technologies
that lower its own marginal costs, so long as competitors
can achieve the identical cost savings by regulatory fiat");

Nov. 9, 1998 (Chief Executive Officer of AT&T, which here
supports the Commission's regulations), cited in Huber 206,
n. 611 (" `No company will invest billions of dollars . . . if
competitors who have not invested a penny of capital, nor
taken an ounce of risk, can come along and get a free ride on
the investments and risks of others' ").

I recognize that no regulator is likely to enforce the Commission's rules so strictly that investment literally slows
to a trickle. Indeed, the majority cites figures showing
that in the past several years new firms have invested $30
to $60 billion in local communications markets. See ante, at
516. We do not know how much of this investment represents facilities, say, broadband, for which an incumbent's
historical network offers no substitute. Nor do we know
whether this number is small or large compared with what
might have been. Cf. FCC, Statistics of Communications
Common Carriers 51 (table 2.7); FCC, Statistics of Communications Common Carriers 42 (table 2.7); FCC, Statistics of
Communications Common Carriers 29 (table 2.7); FCC, Statistics of Communications Common Carriers 1 (table 2.7) (incumbents' similar investment over the same period amounts
to over $100 billion); cf. FCC, 2000/2001 Statistics of Communications Common Carriers 51 (table 2.9) (total depreciated
investment plus working capital equals $220 billion); ante, at
516, 521 (new entrants' market share provided by entrants'
own facilities alone is 33%). Regardless, given the incentives, this independent investment would seem to have been
made despite the "start from scratch" rules, not because of
them. At best, such statistics do no more than show that at
least some of the coincidences I describe below have, happily
for the Commission and the public alike, come to pass. See
infra, at 554, 556, 560-561.

The critics mention several other problems as well. They
say, for example, that the Commission's regulations will exacerbate the problem of "stranded costs"--i. e., the need for a
once-regulated incumbent to recover its reasonable, but now

technologically outdated, historical investment. See PartIII-C,

ante. They add that the regulations will make nearly
redundant the statute's provisions for "element" rates setthrough negotiation. See 47 U. S. C. $ 252(a)(1). After all,

given the Commission's regulations, how much is there tonegotiate about? The regulations entitle the new entrant
to a price equal to, or lower than, the price to which any
rational incumbent could agree. See Brief for United Statesin

Mathias v. Worldcom Technologies, Inc., O. T. 2001,
No. 00-878, p. 18, n. 5 ("[A]s a practical matter" carriers havelittle incentive to negotiate).

Nor, in the critics' view, do the regulations possess anyoffsetting advantages. They lack that ease of administration that led Justices Holmes and Brandeis to favor use(for ratesetting purposes) of an incumbent's historic costs
despite their economic inaccuracy. See Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 262 U. S., at 292-296 (dissenting opinion); see
also ante, at 481-483. The hypothetical nature of the Com-mission's system means that experts must estimate how

imaginary firms would rebuild their systems from scratch--
whether, for example, they (hypothetically) would receivepermission to dig up streets, to maintain unsightly telephone

poles, or to share their pole costs with other users, say,
cable operators--and they must then estimate what would
turn out to be most "efficient" in such (hypothetical) future
circumstances. The speculative nature of this enterprise,
the critics say, will lead to a battle of experts, each asking
a commission to favor what can amount to little more than a
guess. See Kahn 333, 334, n. 36, 335 (describing three models introduced in regulatory proceedings, one of which reduced all actual expenses by 27% because railroad regulation
had brought similar efficiency gains, another of which assumed that all utilities, including electricity producers,
would rebuild entire systems from scratch at the same time,
and the third of which assumed New Hampshire's telecommunications system was administratively most efficient
but then reduced its actual administrative expenses by 25%).

Opinion of Breyer, J.
These administrative difficulties seem far greater than anydifficulty likely involved in an effort to determine an actual

incumbent's actual (past or likely future) costs. See Affi-davits of W. Baumol, J. Ordover, & R. Willig, Comments of
AT&T Corp., CC Docket 96-98: In the Matter of Implemen-tation of Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, || 25 (May 16, 1996), App. 67 (TELRIC'sestimates "do not simply accept the architecture, sizing,
technology, or operating decisions" of the incumbents "asbases for calculating" costs). Assumptions are inevitable.
And the resulting uncertainties mean a somewhat randomsort of rate that can either exacerbate the incentive problems previously mentioned or alleviate those problems bya kind of regulatory coincidence. See

ante, at 522 (describ-ing how state commissioners "customarily assig[n] rates

based on some predictions from one model and others fromits counterpart").

IV
The criticisms described in Part III are serious, poten-tially severing any rational relation between the Commission's regulations and the statutory provision's basicpurposes.

State Farm, 463 U. S., at 56. Hence, the Com-mission's responses are important. Do those responses reduce the force of the criticisms, blunt their edges, or sug-gest offsetting virtues? I have found six major responses.
But none of them is convincing.First, the FCC points out that rates will include not only
a charge reflecting hypothetical "most-efficient-firm" costsbut also a depreciation charge--a charge that can reconcile
a firm's initial historic investment, say, in equipment, andthe equipment's current value, which diminishes over time.
See Order || 686 ("[P]roperly designed depreciation sched-ules should account for expected declines in the value of
capital goods"). If, for example, an incumbent's reason-able investment, measured actually and historically, came
to $50 million, but FCC experts predict a "most-efficient535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

555Cite as: 535 U. S. 467 (2002)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
firm-building-from-scratch" future replication cost of $30 million, a depreciation charge could permit the incumbent to
recoup the otherwise missing $20 million. And, in theory,
a state commission might structure a potentially complex
depreciation charge so as both to permit recovery of historic
investment and also to offset many of the improper investment incentives described in Part II, supra.

This response, however, does not reflect what the Commission's regulations actually say. Those regulations say
nothing about permitting recovery of reasonable historic
investment nor about varying the charge to offset perverse
investment incentives. Rather, they strongly indicate the
opposite. They clearly require state commissions to use
current depreciation rates right alongside the Commission's
new and different "most-efficient-firm-building-from-scratch"
charges. See Order || 702. They do create an exception
from "current" rates. But to take advantage of that exception "incumbent LECs" have to bear the "burden of
demonstrating with specificity that the business risks that
they face in providing unbundled network elements and
interconnection services would justify a different . . . depreciation rate." Ibid. Unless the exception is to swallow
the rule, the term "business risks" must refer to some special situation--not to the ordinary circumstance in which a
new entrant simply asks to share an "element" at rates
determined under Commission "most-efficient-firm" rules.
In any event, that is how 24 state commissions have read the
language. See 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review--Review
of Depreciation Requirements for Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, 15 FCC Rcd. 242, || 69 (1999). And the
FCC nowhere explicitly says to the contrary. Hence the
FCC depreciation rules as written do not respond to the
critics' claims in the ordinary case, nor do they otherwise
transform its "most-efficient-firm-building-from-scratch" system into a system that reflects historic costs.

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Second, the FCC points out that a state commission canadjust permissible profit rates. In theory, such an adjustment could offset many of the improper investment incen-tives described in Part II,

supra. But, like the depreciation regulations, the profit regulations say nothing aboutthe matter. Indeed, like the depreciation regulations, they

suggest the opposite. The relevant FCC regulations say
that "the currently authorized rate of return at the federal
or state level is a reasonable starting point." Order || 702
(emphasis added). They, too, add an exception, available to"incumbent LEC's" that successfully "bear the burden of

demonstrating with specificity that the business risks that
they face in providing unbundled network elements and
interconnection services would justify a different riskadjusted cost of capital." Ibid. But this exception, like the
depreciation exception, cannot respond to the critics' claims
in the ordinary case for similar reasons.

The FCC adds that it did not have "time" to offer more
than "tentative guidance," Reply Brief for Federal Parties
11-12, that profits now may be too high, Order || 702, and
that the incumbents may find other ways to lower their capital costs, id., || 687. These additions, however, concede the
critics' basic point--that the "profit" rules as written do not
provide an answer to Part III's claims. Rather, considered
as a response to those claims, they must rest upon no more
than hope for a regulatory coincidence. Most significantly,
they hope that current market conditions mean that current
profit rates somehow magically offset the adverse effects
of the Commission's other regulations, see Part III, supra.

(arguing for FCC defenders that Hausman overstates theneed for change, but stating that "if any adjustments . . . are

required . . . such adjustments would be modest"). And themajority relies on its belief that that hope has been realized.
Ante, at 521 (stating that in light of the fact that "competi-tion in fact has been slow to materialize," "it seems fair to
say" that the current rate is a " `reasonable starting point' ").
Of course, one must sympathize with the FCC's time prob-lem. But the statute did not require the FCC so quickly to

create so complex a system. Rather, the statute seems toforesee rates set, not by FCC regulations primarily or in
detail, but by negotiations among the parties, 47 U. S. C.

$ 252(a)(1), if not by state commissions. See Iowa Utilities
Bd., 525 U. S., at 412-420 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part).

Third, the Commission supports the reasonableness and
practicality of its system with the claim that "a number of
states" have used it successfully, as have several European
nations. Order || 681. As to domestic experience, I can
find no evidence that, prior to the promulgation of the
rules at issue here, any State had successfully implemented
the FCC's version of TELRIC. It is hardly surprising that
since then several States have tried to apply it. Nor is it
surprising that their implementation has produced criticisms
similar to those made here. See, e. g., MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. GTE Northwest, Inc., 41 F. Supp. 2d 1157,
1168-1169, and n. 7 (Ore. 1999) (discussing problems with the
FCC's TELRIC).

And the "foreign nation" part of the Commission's claim
rests only upon a 1997 European Community paper referring
to a "best current practice" approach as a future goal. See
Commission of European Communities, Recommendation
on Interconnection in a liberalised telecommunications market, C(97) 3148, $$ 3.3, 3.5 (Oct. 15, 1997), http://europa.eu.int/
ISPO/infosoc/telecompolicy/en/r3148-en.htm (Apr. 17, 2002).
Indeed, Britain's FCC counterpart has said that, in the

Opinion of Breyer, J.
absence of a showing of inefficiency, the incumbent's actual current expenditures on capacity additions should be
used "as the starting point." See Office of Telecommuni-cations (Oftel), Access to Bandwidth: Indicative prices and

pricing principles || 9 (May 2000), http://www.oftel.gov.uk/publications/ broadband/llu/llu0500.htm (Apr. 17, 2002).

In fact, as I understand the European system, it may
turn out in practice to work roughly as follows: The relevantEuropean regulatory agency, seeking competition, encourages new firms to enter local markets in order to providenew voice, data, text, picture, entertainment, or other communications service. Like the Commission, the agency normally has the authority to insist that an incumbent firm
"unbundle," e. g., that it permit a new entrant to use its pair
of twisted wires running from switching center to the inside
of a house. It also has the authority to set prices. But in
exercising that authority, it has neither required, nor is it
likely to rely upon, any one ratesetting method. Rather, it
may encourage negotiation among the parties in order to
reach agreed-upon prices low enough to prevent the incumbent from blocking entry but high enough to encourage
the new firm to consider other entry methods, such as use
of electricity conduits, or new cables, where economically
feasible. If no agreement can be reached, the regulator, in
determining the price, can use formulas, modified to take
proper account of depreciation and historical cost, or it can
look to prices set in other European nations as a yardstick
to help produce competition.

This less formal kind of "play it by ear" system, in my
view, is what the statute before us intended. The Act provides for price negotiation among the parties, it brings in
state regulators where necessary to break deadlocks, and it
permits the States to use a variety of different ratesetting
approaches, looking to experience in other States as appropriate, in order to determine proper prices. The mysterious
statutory parenthetical phrase "(determined without ref535US2 Unit: $U44 [09-27-03 14:51:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Breyer, J.
erence to a rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding),"$ 252(d)(1), makes sense from this point of view. It reflects

Congress' desire to obtain not perfect prices but speedy re-sults. It specifies that States need not use formal methods,
relying instead upon bargaining and yardstick competition.See

Iowa Utilities, supra, at 424-425 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. Order || 631 (describing how the New York Commission "se[t] prices ona case-by-case basis"). I recognize, however, that the FCC

has rejected this approach in favor of extraordinarily com-plex national ratesetting standards, which we review only to
determine whether they will further, or serve as obstacles
to, the competitive marketplace that the statute seeks.

Fourth, the FCC adds that its system seeks to base rates
on the costs a hypothetical "most efficient firm" hypothetically would incur were it "building from scratch." And such
a system, in its view, will "simulate" or "best replicat[e], to
the extent possible, the conditions of a competitive market."
Order || 679; see also id., || 738. This response, however,
does not do more than describe that very feature of the system upon which the critics focus their attack.

As I have previously said, supra, at 543, such an objective
is perhaps consistent with an ordinary ratesetting statute
that seeks only low prices. But the problem before us--that
of a lack of "rational connection" between the regulations
and the statute--grows out of the fact that the Telecommunications Act is not a typical regulatory statute asking regulators simply to seek low prices, perhaps by trying to replicate
those of a hypothetical competitive market. Rather, this
statute is a deregulatory statute, and it asks regulators to
create prices that will induce appropriate new entry. See
Part II, supra. That being so, we may assume, purely for
argument's sake, that the FCC rules could successfully "replicate" the prices toward which perfectly efficient, perfectly
competitive markets would tend. But see Kahn 326-327
(stating that such prices are never achieved in any actual

Opinion of Breyer, J.
market); A. Kahn, Whom the Gods Would Destroy, or HowNot to Deregulate 4 (2001) (stating that a firm in an actual

market would determine efficient investment in light of itsactual system, not a hypothetical system built from scratch).
Still, those rules, if successful, would produce the strong in-centives to demand sharing, and the strong disincentives to
build independently, that Part II describes--for they would
create a "sharing" or "interconnection" price equal to orlower than any price associated with the creation of independent facilities. They would thereby tend toward a sys-tem in which regulatory price setting would

supplant, not
promote, competition. And however congenial institutional
regulators might find such a system, it differs dramatically
from the system that the statute seeks to bring about. See
Part II, supra. Cf. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 387-392
(setting aside Commission rules granting new entrants
power to obtain access to virtually any existing element).
At least that is the claim that underlies much of the criticism
set forth in Part III, supra. And the Commission's response
that its system simulates the conditions of a competitive
market does not respond to that basic criticism.

Fifth, the Commission says that its regulations are simply
suggestive, leaving States free to depart. Reply Brief for
Federal Parties 11-12. The short but conclusive answer to
this response is that the Commission considered a "suggestive" approach and rejected it. See Order || 66 (refusing to
characterize rules as setting forth, not "requirements," but
" `preferred outcomes,' " because the latter approach "would
fail to establish explicit national standards for arbitration,
and would fail to provide sufficient guidance to the parties'
options in negotiations").

Sixth, the majority (but not the Commission) points out
that local commissions are likely to leave any given set of
rates in effect for some period of time. And this "regulatory
lag" will solve the problem. See ante, at 505-506. I do not
understand how it could solve the main problem--that of

leading new entrants to lease a more costly incumbent "ele-ment" where building or buying independently could prove

less costly. See supra, at 548-550. Nor, given any new en-trant's legal right to obtain a regulator's decision, am I certain that lags will prove significant. But, in any event,lags will differ, depending upon regulator, time, and circumstance, thereby introducing a near random elementthat might, or might not, ameliorate the system's otherwise
adverse effects.In sum, neither the Commission's nor the majority's responses are convincing. V

Judges have long recognized the difficulty of reviewingthe substance of highly technical agency decisionmaking.
Compare Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F. 2d 1, 66 (CADC 1976)(en banc) (Bazelon, C. J., concurring) ("[T]he best way for
courts to guard against unreasonable . . . administrative de-cisions is not . . . themselves to scrutinize the technical
merits . . . [but to] establish a decision-making processthat assures a reasoned decision" (internal quotation marks
omitted)), with id., at 69 (Leventhal, J., concurring) (statingthat judges must assure, on substantive review, "conformance to statutory standards and requirements of rationality,"acquiring "whatever technical background is necessary").
This Court has emphasized the limitations the law imposesupon judges' authority to insist upon special agency procedures. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NaturalResources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 543-548
(1978). But it has also made clear that judges nonethelessmust review for rationality the substance of agency decisions, including technical decisions. State Farm, 463 U. S.,at 56. That review requires agencies to undertake the difficult task of translating technical matters into languagethat judges can understand and preparing technical responses to challenges of the sort found here. But, despitethe difficulty, review by generalist judges is important, both

because technical agency decisions are often of great impor-tance to the general public and because the law forbids agencies, in the name of technical expertise, to wrest themselvesfree of public control.

Agencies are, of course, expert in technical areas. Thatis why Judge Leventhal wrote that "the judges," when reviewing the rationality of substantive decisions, "must act
with restraint." Ethyl Corp., 541 F. 2d, at 69. And I agree.But, he added, judges may not "abstain from any substantive review." Id., at 68. And again I agree. In thesecases, the critics' claims are strong. They suggest that the
FCC's pricing rule, together with its original "forced leasing" twin, see Iowa Utilities Bd., supra, at 388-392 (finding
original leasing rule unlawful), would bring about, not the
competitive marketplace that the statute demands, but a
highly regulated marketplace characterized by widespread
sharing of facilities with innovation and technological change
reflecting mandarin decisionmaking through regulation
rather than decentralized decisionmaking based on the interaction of freely competitive market forces. And the Commission's replies are unsatisfactory. The majority nonetheless finds the Commission's pricing rules reasonable. As a
regulatory theory, that conclusion might be supportable.
But under this deregulatory statute, it is not. Under these
circumstances, it would amount to abstention from, indeed
abdication of, "rational basis" review, were I to agree that
the record here demonstrates the "rational connection" between regulations and statutory purpose upon which the law
insists. State Farm, supra, at 56; Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A); see also State Farm, supra, at 43
("[W]e may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency itself has not given"). As Judge Leventhal properly put it, "Restraint, yes, abdication, no." Ethyl
Corp., supra, at 69. The Court, of course, with 65 pages of
careful analysis, does not abdicate its reviewing responsibility; but for the reasons stated here I cannot agree with

Opinion of Breyer, J.
its substantive conclusion. Consequently, I would affirmthe Eighth Circuit's determination that the regulations are

unlawful. VI

I disagree with the majority about one further legal issue.The statute imposes upon an incumbent the

"duty to provide . . . for the provision of a telecommu-nications service, nondiscriminatory access to network
elements on an unbundled basis . . . in a manner thatallows requesting carriers to combine such elements
in order to provide such telecommunications service."47 U. S. C. $ 251(c)(3) (emphasis added).

The FCC, pointing to this provision, has said that (upon re-quest) incumbents must themselves combine, among other
things, elements that are ordinarily not combined. Rules315(c)-(f ), 47 CFR $$ 51.315(c)-(f ) (1997). How, the incumbents ask, can a statute that speaks of the requesting car-riers combining elements grant the FCC authority to insist
that they, the incumbents, combine the elements?In Iowa Utilities Bd., the Court found authority for a
somewhat similar rule--a rule that forbids incumbents touncombine elements ordinarily found in combination. But,
as the majority recognizes, ante, at 534-535, that differentrule rests upon a rationale absent here. If an incumbent
takes apart elements that it ordinarily keeps together, itis normally discriminating against the requesting carriers.
And the statutory provision forbids discrimination. Buthere the incumbent simply keeps apart elements that it ordinarily keeps apart in the absence of a new entrant's demand.How does that discriminate? And if it does not discriminate, where does this statutory provision give the FCC au-thority to forbid it?

I cannot find the statutory authority. And I consequentlywould affirm the lower court on the point.
For these reasons, I dissent.

ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. AMERICAN

CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 00-1293. Argued November 28, 2001--Decided May 13, 2002
In Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, this Court

found that the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA)--Congress'
first attempt to protect children from exposure to pornographic material
on the Internet--ran afoul of the First Amendment in its regulation of
indecent transmissions and the display of patently offensive material.
That conclusion was based, in part, on the crucial consideration that the
CDA's breadth was wholly unprecedented. After the Court's decision
in Reno, Congress attempted to address this concern in the Child Online
Protection Act (COPA). Unlike the CDA, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web, covers only communications
made for commercial purposes, and restricts only "material that is
harmful to minors," 47 U. S. C. $ 231(a)(1). In defining "material that is
harmful to minors," COPA draws on the three-part obscenity test set
forth in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, see $ 231(e)(6), and thus requires jurors to apply "contemporary community standards" in assessing material, see $ 231(e)(6)(A). Respondents--who post or have members that post sexually oriented material on the Web--filed a facial
challenge before COPA went into effect, claiming, inter alia, that the
statute violated adults' First Amendment rights because it effectively
banned constitutionally protected speech, was not the least restrictive
means of accomplishing a compelling governmental purpose, and was
substantially overbroad. The District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of COPA because it concluded that
the statute was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny. The Third Circuit
affirmed but based its decision on a ground not relied upon by the District Court: that COPA's use of "contemporary community standards,"

$ 231(e)(6)(A), to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered
the statute substantially overbroad.

Held: COPA's reliance on "community standards" to identify what material "is harmful to minors" does not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad for First Amendment purposes. The Court, however,
expresses no view as to whether COPA suffers from substantial overbreadth for reasons other than its use of community standards, whether
the statute is unconstitutionally vague, or whether the statute survives

strict scrutiny. Prudence dictates allowing the Third Circuit to first
examine these difficult issues. Because petitioner did not ask to have
the preliminary injunction vacated, and because this Court could not do
so without addressing matters the Third Circuit has yet to consider,
the Government remains enjoined from enforcing COPA absent further
action by the lower courts. Pp. 585-586.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to

Parts I, II, and IV, an opinion with respect to Parts III-A,III-C, and III-D, in which

The Chief Justice and Justice
Scalia join, and an opinion with respect to Part III-B, inwhich

The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Scalia join.

This case presents the narrow question whether the ChildOnline Protection Act's (COPA or Act) use of "community

standards" to identify "material that is harmful to minors"violates the First Amendment. We hold that this aspect of
COPA does not render the statute facially unconstitutional.

"The Internet . . . offer[s] a forum for a true diversity ofpolitical discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity." 47U. S. C. $ 230(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V). While "surfing" the
World Wide Web, the primary method of remote informationretrieval on the Internet today,

1 see App. in No. 99-1324

(CA3), p. 180 (hereinafter App.), individuals can access mate-rial about topics ranging from aardvarks to Zoroastrianism.

One can use the Web to read thousands of newspapers pub-lished around the globe, purchase tickets for a matinee at the
neighborhood movie theater, or follow the progress of anyMajor League Baseball team on a pitch-by-pitch basis.

The Web also contains a wide array of sexually explicitmaterial, including hardcore pornography. See, e. g., Amerand Gilbert H. Weil; for the Association of American Publishers, Inc., et al.

Opinion of the Court
ican Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 31 F. Supp. 2d 473, 484(ED Pa. 1999). In 1998, for instance, there were approximately 28,000 adult sites promoting pornography on theWeb. See H. R. Rep. No. 105-775, p. 7 (1998). Because
"[n]avigating the Web is relatively straightforward," Reno v.American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 852 (1997),
and access to the Internet is widely available in homes,schools, and libraries across the country,

2 see App. 177-178,

children may discover this pornographic material either bydeliberately accessing pornographic Web sites or by stumbling upon them. See 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 476 ("A child with
minimal knowledge of a computer, the ability to operate abrowser, and the skill to type a few simple words may be

able to access sexual images and content over the WorldWide Web").

Congress first attempted to protect children from expo-sure to pornographic material on the Internet by enacting
the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), 110 Stat.
133. The CDA prohibited the knowing transmission overthe Internet of obscene or indecent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age. See 47 U. S. C. $ 223(a). It alsoforbade any individual from knowingly sending over or displaying on the Internet certain "patently offensive" materialin a manner available to persons under 18 years of age. See

$ 223(d). The prohibition specifically extended to "any com-ment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depict[ed] or describ[ed], in termspatently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs."$ 223(d)(1).

2 When this litigation commenced in 1998, "[a]pproximately 70.2 million
people of all ages use[d] the Internet in the United States." App. 171.
It is now estimated that 115.2 million Americans use the Internet at least
once a month and 176.5 million Americans have Internet access either at
home or at work. See More Americans Online, New York Times, Nov. 19,
2001, p. C7.

568 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of the Court
The CDA provided two affirmative defenses to those pros-ecuted under the statute. The first protected individuals

who took "good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriateactions" to restrict minors from accessing obscene, indecent,
and patently offensive material over the Internet. See$ 223(e)(5)(A). The second shielded those who restricted minors from accessing such material "by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adultpersonal identification number." $ 223(e)(5)(B).

Notwithstanding these affirmative defenses, in Reno v.
American Civil Liberties Union, we held that the CDA's
regulation of indecent transmissions, see $ 223(a), and thedisplay of patently offensive material, see $ 223(d), ran afoul

of the First Amendment. We concluded that "the CDAlack[ed] the precision that the First Amendment requires
when a statute regulates the content of speech" because,"[i]n order to deny minors access to potentially harmful
speech, the CDA effectively suppress[ed] a large amount ofspeech that adults ha[d] a constitutional right to receive and
to address to one another." 521 U. S., at 874.

Our holding was based on three crucial considerations.First, "existing technology did not include any effective

method for a sender to prevent minors from obtaining access
to its communications on the Internet without also denying
access to adults." Id., at 876. Second, "[t]he breadth of the
CDA's coverage [was] wholly unprecedented." Id., at 877.
"Its open-ended prohibitions embrace[d]," not only commercial speech or commercial entities, but also "all nonprofit
entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in the presence of minors." Ibid. In addition, because the CDA did not define
the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive," the statute
"cover[ed] large amounts of nonpornographic material with
serious educational or other value." Ibid. As a result, regulated subject matter under the CDA extended to "discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card

Opinion of the Court
catalog of the Carnegie Library." Id., at 878. Third, wefound that neither affirmative defense set forth in the CDA

"constitute[d] the sort of `narrow tailoring' that [would] savean otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision."
Id., at 882. Consequently, only the CDA's ban on the know-ing transmission of obscene messages survived scrutiny because obscene speech enjoys no First Amendment protec-tion. See

id., at 883.After our decision in Reno v. American Civil Liberties

Union, Congress explored other avenues for restricting mi-nors' access to pornographic material on the Internet. In
particular, Congress passed and the President signed intolaw the Child Online Protection Act, 112 Stat. 2681-736 (codified in 47 U. S. C. $ 231 (1994 ed., Supp. V)). COPA prohibitsany person from "knowingly and with knowledge of the character of the material, in interstate or foreign commerce bymeans of the World Wide Web, mak[ing] any communication
for commercial purposes that is available to any minor andthat includes any material that is harmful to minors." 47
U. S. C. $ 231(a)(1).Apparently responding to our objections to the breadth of
the CDA's coverage, Congress limited the scope of COPA'scoverage in at least three ways. First, while the CDA applied to communications over the Internet as a whole, includ-ing, for example, e-mail messages, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web. Second, unlike theCDA, COPA covers only communications made "for commercial purposes." 3 Ibid. And third, while the CDA pro3 The statute provides that "[a] person shall be considered to make a
communication for commercial purposes only if such person is engaged in
the business of making such communications." 47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(2)(A)
(1994 ed., Supp. V). COPA then defines the term "engaged in the business" to mean a person:

"who makes a communication, or offers to make a communication, by
means of the World Wide Web, that includes any material that is harmful
to minors, devotes time, attention, or labor to such activities, as a regular
course of such person's trade or business, with the objective of earning a
profit as a result of such activities (although it is not necessary that the

Opinion of the Court
hibited "indecent" and "patently offensive" communications,COPA restricts only the narrower category of "material that

is harmful to minors." Ibid.Drawing on the three-part test for obscenity set forth in
Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), COPA defines"material that is harmful to minors" as

"any communication, picture, image, graphic image file,article, recording, writing, or other matter of any kind
that is obscene or that--"(A) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, taking the material as awhole and with respect to minors, is designed to appeal
to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient interest;"(B) depicts, describes, or represents, in a manner
patently offensive with respect to minors, an actual orsimulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibi-tion of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast; and

"(C) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic,political, or scientific value for minors." 47 U. S. C.

$ 231(e)(6).
Like the CDA, COPA also provides affirmative defensesto those subject to prosecution under the statute. An individual may qualify for a defense if he, "in good faith, hasrestricted access by minors to material that is harmful to
minors--(A) by requiring the use of a credit card, debit ac-count, adult access code, or adult personal identification number; (B) by accepting a digital certificate that verifies age; or(C) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible under
available technology." $ 231(c)(1). Persons violating COPAare subject to both civil and criminal sanctions. A civil penalty of up to $50,000 may be imposed for each violation of
person make a profit or that the making or offering to make such communications be the person's sole or principal business or source of income)."

$ 231(e)(2)(B).

the statute. Criminal penalties consist of up to six months
in prison and/or a maximum fine of $50,000. An additional
fine of $50,000 may be imposed for any intentional violation
of the statute. $ 231(a).

One month before COPA was scheduled to go into effect,
respondents filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality
of the statute in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Respondents are a diverse group of organizations,4 most of which maintain their
own Web sites. While the vast majority of content on their
Web sites is available for free, respondents all derive income
from their sites. Some, for example, sell advertising that is
displayed on their Web sites, while others either sell goods
directly over their sites or charge artists for the privilege of
posting material. 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 487. All respondents
either post or have members that post sexually oriented material on the Web. Id., at 480. Respondents' Web sites contain "resources on obstetrics, gynecology, and sexual health;
visual art and poetry; resources designed for gays and lesbians; information about books and stock photographic images
offered for sale; and online magazines." Id., at 484.

In their complaint, respondents alleged that, although they
believed that the material on their Web sites was valuable
for adults, they feared that they would be prosecuted under
COPA because some of that material "could be construed as
`harmful to minors' in some communities." App. 63. Respondents' facial challenge claimed, inter alia, that COPA

ments because it (1) "create[d] an effective ban on constitu-tionally protected speech by and to adults"; (2) "[was] not

the least restrictive means of accomplishing any compellinggovernmental purpose"; and (3) "[was] substantially overbroad." 5 Id., at 100-101.The District Court granted respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction, barring the Government from enforcingthe Act until the merits of respondents' claims could be adjudicated. 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 499. Focusing on respondents'claim that COPA abridged the free speech rights of adults,
the District Court concluded that respondents had estab-lished a likelihood of success on the merits.

Id., at 498.The District Court reasoned that because COPA constitutes

content-based regulation of sexual expression protected bythe First Amendment, the statute, under this Court's precedents, was "presumptively invalid" and "subject to strictscrutiny." Id., at 493. The District Court then held that
respondents were likely to establish at trial that COPA couldnot withstand such scrutiny because, among other reasons,
it was not apparent that COPA was the least restrictivemeans of preventing minors from accessing "harmful to minors" material. Id., at 497.The Attorney General of the United States appealed the
District Court's ruling. American Civil Liberties Union v.
Reno, 217 F. 3d 162 (CA3 2000). The United States Courtof Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. Rather than reviewing the District Court's "holding that COPA was notlikely to succeed in surviving strict scrutiny analysis," the
Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on a ground thatwas not relied upon below and that was "virtually ignored
by the parties and the amicus in their respective briefs."
Id., at 173-174. The Court of Appeals concluded that

5 In three other claims, which are not relevant to resolving the dispute
at hand, respondents alleged that COPA infringed the free speech rights
of older minors, violated the right to "communicate and access information
anonymously," and was "unconstitutionally vague." App. 101-102.

573Cite as: 535 U. S. 564 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
COPA's use of "contemporary community standards" to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute
substantially overbroad. Because "Web publishers are
without any means to limit access to their sites based on the
geographic location of particular Internet users," the Court
of Appeals reasoned that COPA would require "any material
that might be deemed harmful by the most puritan of communities in any state" to be placed behind an age or credit
card verification system. Id., at 175. Hypothesizing that
this step would require Web publishers to shield "vast
amounts of material," ibid., the Court of Appeals was "persuaded that this aspect of COPA, without reference to its
other provisions, must lead inexorably to a holding of a likelihood of unconstitutionality of the entire COPA statute," id.,
at 174.

We granted the Attorney General's petition for certiorari,
532 U. S. 1037 (2001), to review the Court of Appeals' determination that COPA likely violates the First Amendment because it relies, in part, on community standards to identify
material that is harmful to minors, and now vacate the Court
of Appeals' judgment.

II

The First Amendment states that "Congress shall make
no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." This provision
embodies "[o]ur profound national commitment to the free
exchange of ideas." Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v.
Connaughton, 491 U. S. 657, 686 (1989). "[A]s a general
matter, `the First Amendment means that government has
no power to restrict expression because of its message, its
ideas, its subject matter, or its content.' " Bolger v. Youngs
Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 65 (1983) (quoting Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972)). However, this principle, like other First Amendment principles,
is not absolute. Cf. Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485
U. S. 46, 56 (1988).

535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
574 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of the Court
Obscene speech, for example, has long been held to fall
outside the purview of the First Amendment. See, e. g.,
Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484-485 (1957). But
this Court struggled in the past to define obscenity in a manner that did not impose an impermissible burden on protected speech. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390
U. S. 676, 704 (1968) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (referring to the "intractable obscenity problem"); see also Miller v. California, 413 U. S., at 20-23 (reviewing "the somewhat tortured history of th[is] Court's
obscenity decisions"). The difficulty resulted from the belief
that "in the area of freedom of speech and press the courts
must always remain sensitive to any infringement on genuinely serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific expression." Id., at 22-23.

Ending over a decade of turmoil, this Court in Miller set
forth the governing three-part test for assessing whether
material is obscene and thus unprotected by the First
Amendment: "(a) [W]hether `the average person, applying
contemporary community standards' would find that the
work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;
(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole,
lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."
Id., at 24 (citations omitted; emphasis added).

Miller adopted the use of "community standards" from
Roth, which repudiated an earlier approach for assessing objectionable material. Beginning in the 19th century, English courts and some American courts allowed material to
be evaluated from the perspective of particularly sensitive
persons. See, e. g., Queen v. Hicklin [1868] L. R. 3 Q. B.
360; see also Roth, 354 U. S., at 488-489, and n. 25 (listing
relevant cases). But in Roth, this Court held that this sensitive person standard was "unconstitutionally restrictive of

575Cite as: 535 U. S. 564 (2002)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
the freedoms of speech and press" and approved a standardrequiring that material be judged from the perspective of

"the average person, applying contemporary communitystandards."

Id., at 489. The Court preserved the use of
community standards in formulating the Miller test, explain-ing that they furnish a valuable First Amendment safeguard:

"[T]he primary concern . . . is to be certain that . . . [material]
will be judged by its impact on an average person, ratherthan a particularly susceptible or sensitive person--or indeed a totally insensitive one." Miller, supra, at 33 (inter-nal quotation marks omitted); see also

Hamling v. United
States, 418 U. S. 87, 107 (1974) (emphasizing that the princi-pal purpose of the community standards criterion "is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of eachjuror's personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly
sensitive or insensitive person or group").

III
The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that this
Court's prior community standards jurisprudence "has noapplicability to the Internet and the Web" because "Web

publishers are currently without the ability to control thegeographic scope of the recipients of their communications."
217 F. 3d, at 180. We therefore must decide whether thistechnological limitation renders COPA's reliance on community standards constitutionally infirm.6

6 While petitioner contends that a speaker on the Web possesses the
ability to communicate only with individuals located in targeted geographic communities, Brief for Petitioner 29, n. 3, he stipulated below that
"[o]nce a provider posts its content on the Internet and chooses to make
it available to all, it generally cannot prevent that content from entering
any geographic community." App. 187. The District Court adopted this
stipulation as a finding of fact, see American Civil Liberties Union v.
Reno, 31 F. Supp. 2d 473, 484 (ED Pa. 1999), and petitioner points to no
evidence in the record suggesting that this finding is clearly erroneous.

576 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Opinion of Thomas, J.

A
In addressing this question, the parties first dispute thenature of the community standards that jurors will be instructed to apply when assessing, in prosecutions underCOPA, whether works appeal to the prurient interest of minors and are patently offensive with respect to minors.7 Re-spondents contend that jurors will evaluate material using
"local community standards," Brief for Respondents 40,while petitioner maintains that jurors will not consider the
community standards of any particular geographic area, butrather will be "instructed to consider the standards of the
adult community as a whole, without geographic specifica-tion." Brief for Petitioner 38.

In the context of this case, which involves a facial chal-lenge to a statute that has never been enforced, we do not
think it prudent to engage in speculation as to whether cer-tain hypothetical jury instructions would or would not be
consistent with COPA, and deciding this case does not re-quire us to do so. It is sufficient to note that community
standards need not be defined by reference to a precise geo-graphic area. See Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U. S. 153, 157
(1974) ("A State may choose to define an obscenity offensein terms of `contemporary community standards' as defined
in Miller without further specification . . . or it may chooseto define the standards in more precise geographic terms,
as was done by California in Miller"). Absent geographic

7 Although the phrase "contemporary community standards" appears
only in the "prurient interest" prong of the Miller test, see Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973), this Court has indicated that the "patently
offensive" prong of the test is also a question of fact to be decided by
a jury applying contemporary community standards. See, e. g., Pope v.
Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 500 (1987). The parties here therefore agree that
even though "contemporary community standards" are similarly mentioned only in the "prurient interest" prong of COPA's harmful-to-minors
definition, see 47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6)(A), jurors will apply "contemporary

specification, a juror applying community standards will in-evitably draw upon personal "knowledge of the community

or vicinage from which he comes." Hamling, supra, at 105.Petitioner concedes the latter point, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 3-4, and admits that, even if jurors were instructedunder COPA to apply the standards of the adult population
as a whole, the variance in community standards across thecountry could still cause juries in different locations to reach
inconsistent conclusions as to whether a particular work is"harmful to minors." Brief for Petitioner 39.

Because juries would apply different standards across thecountry, and Web publishers currently lack the ability to

limit access to their sites on a geographic basis, the Court ofAppeals feared that COPA's "community standards" component would effectively force all speakers on the Web to abideby the "most puritan" community's standards. 217 F. 3d, at
175. And such a requirement, the Court of Appeals con-cluded, "imposes an overreaching burden and restriction on
constitutionally protected speech." Id., at 177.In evaluating the constitutionality of the CDA, this Court
expressed a similar concern over that statute's use of com-munity standards to identify patently offensive material on
the Internet. We noted that "the `community standards'criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication available to a nationwide audience will be judged bythe standards of the community most likely to be offended
by the message." Reno, 521 U. S., at 877-878. The Courtof Appeals below relied heavily on this observation, stating
that it was "not persuaded that the Supreme Court's concernwith respect to the `community standards' criterion has been
sufficiently remedied by Congress in COPA." 217 F. 3d,at 174.

The CDA's use of community standards to identify pat-ently offensive material, however, was particularly problem535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
atic in light of that statute's unprecedented breadth and
vagueness. The statute covered communications depicting
or describing "sexual or excretory activities or organs" that
were "patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards"--a standard somewhat similar to the second prong of Miller's three-prong test. But the CDA did
not include any limiting terms resembling Miller's additional
two prongs. See Reno, 521 U. S., at 873. It neither contained any requirement that restricted material appeal to
the prurient interest nor excluded from the scope of its
coverage works with serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientific value. Ibid. The tremendous breadth of the CDA
magnified the impact caused by differences in community
standards across the country, restricting Web publishers
from openly displaying a significant amount of material that
would have constituted protected speech in some communities across the country but run afoul of community standards
in others.

COPA, by contrast, does not appear to suffer from the
same flaw because it applies to significantly less material
than did the CDA and defines the harmful-to-minors material
restricted by the statute in a manner parallel to the Miller
definition of obscenity. See supra, at 569-570, 574-575. To
fall within the scope of COPA, works must not only "depic[t],
describ[e], or represen[t], in a manner patently offensive with
respect to minors," particular sexual acts or parts of the
anatomy,8 they must also be designed to appeal to the prurient interest of minors and, "taken as a whole, lac[k] serious

8 While the CDA allowed juries to find material to be patently offensive
so long as it depicted or described "sexual or excretory activities or organs," COPA specifically delineates the sexual activities and anatomical
features, the depictions of which may be found to be patently offensive:
"an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated
normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals or
post-pubescent female breast." 47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6)(B).

literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors." 47U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6).

These additional two restrictions substantially limit theamount of material covered by the statute. Material appeals to the prurient interest, for instance, only if it is insome sense erotic. Cf. Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S.
205, 213, and n. 10 (1975).9 Of even more significance, how-ever, is COPA's exclusion of material with serious value for
minors. See 47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6)(C). In Reno, we empha-sized that the serious value "requirement is particularly important because, unlike the `patently offensive' and `prurientinterest' criteria, it is not judged by contemporary community standards." 521 U. S., at 873 (citing Pope v. Illinois,481 U. S. 497, 500 (1987)). This is because "the value of [a]
work [does not] vary from community to community basedon the degree of local acceptance it has won."

Ibid.Rather, the relevant question is "whether a reasonable person would find . . . value in the material, taken as a whole."
Id., at 501. Thus, the serious value requirement "allows ap-pellate courts to impose some limitations and regularity on

the definition by setting, as a matter of law, a national floorfor socially redeeming value." Reno, supra, at 873 (emphasis added), a safeguard nowhere present in the CDA.10

9 Justice Stevens argues that the "prurient interest" prong does not
"substantially narrow the category of images covered" by COPA because
"[a]rguably every depiction of nudity--partial or full--is in some sense
erotic with respect to minors," post, at 607-608 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original). We do not agree. For example, we have great difficulty understanding how pictures of a war victim's wounded nude body
could reasonably be described under the vast majority of circumstances as
erotic, especially when evaluated from the perspective of minors. See
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 422 (1991) (defining erotic as
"of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire").

10 Justice Stevens contends that COPA's serious value prong only

marginally limits the sweep of the statute because it does not protect all
material with serious value but just those works with serious value for
minors. See post, at 608. His dissenting opinion, however, does not
refer to any evidence supporting this counterintuitive assertion, and there

C
When the scope of an obscenity statute's coverage is suffi-ciently narrowed by a "serious value" prong and a "prurient

interest" prong, we have held that requiring a speaker dis-seminating material to a national audience to observe varying community standards does not violate the First Amend-ment. In

Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87 (1974), thisCourt considered the constitutionality of applying community standards to the determination of whether material isobscene under 18 U. S. C. $ 1461, the federal statute prohibiting the mailing of obscene material. Although this statutedoes not define obscenity, the petitioners in

Hamling weretried and convicted under the definition of obscenity set forth

in Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman ofPleasure" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U. S. 413 (1966),
which included both a "prurient interest" requirement and arequirement that prohibited material be " `utterly without
redeeming social value.' " Hamling, supra, at 99 (quotingMemoirs, supra, at 418).

Like respondents here, the dissenting opinion in Hamlingargued that it was unconstitutional for a federal statute to
rely on community standards to regulate speech. JusticeBrennan maintained that "[n]ational distributors choosing to
send their products in interstate travels [would] be forced tocope with the community standards of every hamlet into
which their goods [might] wander." 418 U. S., at 144. As aresult, he claimed that the inevitable result of this situation
would be "debilitating self-censorship that abridges the FirstAmendment rights of the people."

Ibid.This Court, however, rejected Justice Brennan's argument

that the federal mail statute unconstitutionally compelled
is certainly none in the record suggesting that COPA restricts about the
same amount of material as did the CDA. Moreover, Justice Stevens
does not dispute that COPA's "serious value" prong serves the important
purpose of allowing appellate courts to set "as a matter of law, a national
floor for socially redeeming value." Reno, 521 U. S., at 873.

speakers choosing to distribute materials on a national basisto tailor their messages to the least tolerant community:

"The fact that distributors of allegedly obscene materialsmay be subjected to varying community standards in the
various federal judicial districts into which they transmit thematerials does not render a federal statute unconstitutional."
Id., at 106.Fifteen years later,

Hamling's holding was reaffirmed inSable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115

(1989). Sable addressed the constitutionality of 47 U. S. C.$ 223(b) (1982 ed., Supp. V), a statutory provision prohibiting
the use of telephones to make obscene or indecent communi-cations for commercial purposes. The petitioner in that
case, a "dial-a-porn" operator, challenged, in part, that por-tion of the statute banning obscene phone messages. Like
respondents here, the "dial-a-porn" operator argued that re-liance on community standards to identify obscene material
impermissibly compelled "message senders . . . to tailor alltheir messages to the least tolerant community." 492 U. S.,
at 124.11 Relying on Hamling, however, this Court onceagain rebuffed this attack on the use of community standards
in a federal statute of national scope: "There is no constitu-tional barrier under

Miller to prohibiting communicationsthat are obscene in some communities under local standards

even though they are not obscene in others. If Sable's audi-ence is comprised of different communities with different
local standards, Sable ultimately bears the burden of com-plying with the prohibition on obscene messages." 492

Hamling andSable "are easily distinguished from the present case" because in both of those cases "the defendants had the ability

Court has held that the Miller test defines regulated speech for purposes
of federal obscenity statutes such as 47 U. S. C. $ 223(b) (1994 ed.). See,

to control the distribution of controversial material with respect to the geographic communities into which they released it" whereas "Web publishers have no such comparable
control." 217 F. 3d, at 175-176. In neither Hamling nor
Sable, however, was the speaker's ability to target the release of material into particular geographic areas integral
to the legal analysis. In Hamling, the ability to limit the
distribution of material to targeted communities was not
mentioned, let alone relied upon,12 and in Sable, a dial-a-porn
operator's ability to screen incoming calls from particular
areas was referenced only as a supplemental point, see 492
U. S., at 125.13 In the latter case, this Court made no effort
to evaluate how burdensome it would have been for dial-aporn operators to tailor their messages to callers from thousands of different communities across the Nation, instead
concluding that the burden of complying with the statute
rested with those companies. See id., at 126.

12 This fact was perhaps omitted because under the federal statute at
issue in Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87 (1974), a defendant could
be prosecuted in any district through which obscene mail passed while it
was on route to its destination, see id., at 143-144 (Brennan, J., dissenting),
and a postal customer obviously lacked the ability to control the path his
letter traveled as it made its way to its intended recipient.

13 Justice Stevens' contention that this Court "upheld the application

of community standards to a nationwide medium" in Sable due to the fact
that "[it] was at least possible" for dial-a-porn operators to tailor their
messages to particular communities is inaccurate. See post, at 605 (dissenting opinion). This Court's conclusion clearly did not hinge either on
the fact that dial-a-porn operators could prevent callers in particular communities from accessing their messages or on an assessment of how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn operators to take that step.
Rather, these companies were required to abide by the standards of various communities for the sole reason that they transmitted their material
into those communities. See Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 ("If Sable's audience
is comprised of different communities with different local standards, Sable
ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages").

Opinion of Thomas, J.
While Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens question
the applicability of this Court's community standards jurisprudence to the Internet, we do not believe that the medium's "unique characteristics" justify adopting a different approach than that set forth in Hamling and Sable. See post,
at 594-595 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). If a
publisher chooses to send its material into a particular
community, this Court's jurisprudence teaches that it is the
publisher's responsibility to abide by that community's
standards. The publisher's burden does not change simply
because it decides to distribute its material to every community in the Nation. See Sable, supra, at 125-126. Nor does
it change because the publisher may wish to speak only to
those in a "community where avant garde culture is the
norm," post, at 595 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment),
but nonetheless utilizes a medium that transmits its speech
from coast to coast. If a publisher wishes for its material to
be judged only by the standards of particular communities,
then it need only take the simple step of utilizing a medium
that enables it to target the release of its material into
those communities.14

Respondents offer no other grounds upon which to distinguish this case from Hamling and Sable. While those cases
involved obscenity rather than material that is harmful to
minors, we have no reason to believe that the practical effect
of varying community standards under COPA, given the
statute's definition of "material that is harmful to minors,"
is significantly greater than the practical effect of varying

14 In addition, COPA does not, as Justice Kennedy suggests, " `foreclose an entire medium of expression.' " Post, at 596 (quoting City of
Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 55 (1994)). While Justice Kennedy and
Justice Stevens repeatedly imply that COPA banishes from the Web
material deemed harmful to minors by reference to community standards,
see, e. g., post, at 596 (opinion concurring in judgment); post, at 608-609,
612 (dissenting opinion), the statute does no such thing. It only requires
that such material be placed behind adult identification screens.

community standards under federal obscenity statutes. Itis noteworthy, for example, that respondents fail to point out

even a single exhibit in the record as to which coverageunder COPA would depend upon which community in the
country evaluated the material. As a result, if we were tohold COPA unconstitutional because of its use of community
standards, federal obscenity statutes would likely also be un-constitutional as applied to the Web,

15 a result in substantial

tension with our prior suggestion that the application of theCDA to obscene speech was constitutional. See

Reno, 521U. S., at 877, n. 44, 882-883.

D
Respondents argue that COPA is "unconstitutionally over-broad" because it will require Web publishers to shield some

material behind age verification screens that could bedisplayed openly in many communities across the Nation if
Web speakers were able to limit access to their sites on ageographic basis. Brief for Respondents 33-34. "[T]o prevail in a facial challenge," however, "it is not enough for aplaintiff to show `some' overbreadth."

Reno, supra, at 896
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissentingin part). Rather, "the overbreadth of a statute must not

only be real, but substantial as well." Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615 (1973). At this stage of the litiga-tion, respondents have failed to satisfy this burden, at least

solely as a result of COPA's reliance on community stand-ards.

than "speculation." See, e. g., post, at 598 (Kennedy, J., concurring in

judgment). The only objective evidence cited in the dissenting opinion for
the proposition that COPA "will restrict a substantial amount of protected
speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities" are various anecdotes compiled in an amici brief. See post, at 611,

Opinion of the Court
tent restricted by COPA in a manner analogous to Miller'sdefinition of obscenity, we conclude, consistent with our holdings in Hamling and Sable, that any variance caused by thestatute's reliance on community standards is not substantial
enough to violate the First Amendment.

IV
The scope of our decision today is quite limited. We hold
only that COPA's reliance on community standards to iden-tify "material that is harmful to minors" does not

by itself
render the statute substantially overbroad for purposes ofthe First Amendment. We do not express any view as to

whether COPA suffers from substantial overbreadth for
other reasons, whether the statute is unconstitutionallyvague, or whether the District Court correctly concluded

that the statute likely will not survive strict scrutiny analyCuriae 4-10). Justice Stevens, however, is not even willing to represent that these anecdotes relate to material restricted under COPA, see
post, at 611, and we understand his reluctance for the vast majority of the
works cited in that brief, if not all of them, are likely unaffected by the
statute. See Brief for Volunteer Lawyer for the Arts et al. as Amici
Curiae 4-10 (describing, among other incidents, controversies in various
communities regarding Maya Angelou's I Know Why The Caged Bird
Sings, Judy Blume's Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, J. D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, 1993 Academy
Award Best Picture nominee The Piano, the American Broadcasting Corporation television network's NYPD Blue, and songs of the "popular folkrock duo" the Indigo Girls). These anecdotes are therefore of questionable relevance to the matter at hand and certainly do not constitute a
sufficient basis for invalidating a federal statute.

Moreover, we do not agree with Justice Kennedy's suggestion that it
is necessary for the Court of Appeals to revisit this question upon remand.
See post, at 597-599. The lack of evidence in the record relevant to the
question presented does not indicate that "we should vacate for further
consideration." Post, at 599. Rather, it indicates that respondents, by
offering little more than "speculation," have failed to meet their burden of
demonstrating in this facial challenge that COPA's reliance on community
standards renders the statute substantially overbroad.

sis once adjudication of the case is completed below. Whilerespondents urge us to resolve these questions at this time,

prudence dictates allowing the Court of Appeals to first ex-amine these difficult issues.

Petitioner does not ask us to vacate the preliminary in-junction entered by the District Court, and in any event, we
could not do so without addressing matters yet to be considered by the Court of Appeals. As a result, the Governmentremains enjoined from enforcing COPA absent further action

by the Court of Appeals or the District Court.For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I agree with the plurality that even if obscenity on theInternet is defined in terms of local community standards,

respondents have not shown that the Child Online Protection
Act (COPA) is overbroad solely on the basis of the variationin the standards of different communities. See

ante, at 577-
579. Like Justice Breyer, however, see post, at 589 (opin-ion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), I write

separately to express my views on the constitutionality anddesirability of adopting a national standard for obscenity for
regulation of the Internet.

The plurality's opinion argues that, even under local community standards, the variation between the most and least
restrictive communities is not so great with respect to the
narrow category of speech covered by COPA as to, alone,
render the statute substantially overbroad. See ante, at
577-579. I agree, given respondents' failure to provide examples of materials that lack literary, artistic, political, and
scientific value for minors, which would nonetheless result in
variation among communities judging the other elements of
the test. Respondents' examples of material for which com535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
munity standards would vary include such things as the
appropriateness of sex education and the desirability of
adoption by same-sex couples. Brief for Respondents 43.
Material addressing the latter topic, however, seems highly
unlikely to be seen to appeal to the prurient interest in any
community, and educational material like the former must,
on any objective inquiry, see ante, at 579, have scientific
value for minors.

But respondents' failure to prove substantial overbreadth
on a facial challenge in this case still leaves open the possibility that the use of local community standards will cause problems for regulation of obscenity on the Internet, for adults
as well as children, in future cases. In an as-applied challenge, for instance, individual litigants may still dispute that
the standards of a community more restrictive than theirs
should apply to them. And in future facial challenges to
regulation of obscenity on the Internet, litigants may make
a more convincing case for substantial overbreadth. Where
adult speech is concerned, for instance, there may in fact
be a greater degree of disagreement about what is patently
offensive or appeals to the prurient interest.

Nor do I think such future cases can be resolved by application of the approach we took in Hamling v. United States,
418 U. S. 87 (1974), and Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.
v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989). I agree with Justice Kennedy that, given Internet speakers' inability to control the
geographic location of their audience, expecting them to bear
the burden of controlling the recipients of their speech, as
we did in Hamling and Sable, may be entirely too much to
ask, and would potentially suppress an inordinate amount
of expression. See post, at 594-596 (opinion concurring in
judgment); contra, ante, at 580-584. For these reasons,
adoption of a national standard is necessary in my view for
any reasonable regulation of Internet obscenity.

Our precedents do not forbid adoption of a national standard. Local community-based standards originated with

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973). In that case, weapproved jury instructions that based the relevant "community standards" on those of the State of California ratherthan on the Nation as a whole. In doing so, we held that
"[n]othing in the First Amendment requires" that a jury con-sider national standards when determining if something is
obscene as a matter of fact. Id., at 31. The First Amendment, we held, did not require that "the people of Maine orMississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable

in Las Vegas, or New York City." Id., at 32. But we saidnothing about the constitutionality of jury instructions that
would contemplate a national standard--i. e., requiring that
the people who live in all of these places hold themselves
to what the nationwide community of adults would find was
patently offensive and appealed to the prurient interest.

Later, in Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U. S. 153, 157 (1974), we
confirmed that "Miller approved the use of [instructions
based on local standards]; it did not mandate their use."
The instructions we approved in that case charged the jury
with applying "community standards" without designating
any particular "community." In holding that a State may
define the obscenity standard by stating the Miller standard
without further specification, 418 U. S., at 157, Jenkins left
open the possibility that jurors would apply any number of
standards, including a national standard, in evaluating material's obscenity.

To be sure, the Court in Miller also stated that a national
standard might be "unascertainable," 413 U. S., at 31, and
"[un]realistic," id., at 32. But where speech on the Internet
is concerned, I do not share that skepticism. It is true that
our Nation is diverse, but many local communities encompass
a similar diversity. For instance, in Miller itself, the jury
was instructed to consider the standards of the entire State
of California, a large (today, it has a population of greater
than 33 million people, see U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau
of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 23 (120th

ed. 2000) (Table 20)) and diverse State that includes bothBerkeley and Bakersfield. If the

Miller Court believed generalizations about the standards of the people of Californiawere possible, and that jurors would be capable of assessing

them, it is difficult to believe that similar generalizations arenot also possible for the Nation as a whole. Moreover, the
existence of the Internet, and its facilitation of national dialogue, has itself made jurors more aware of the views ofadults in other parts of the United States. Although jurors

asked to evaluate the obscenity of speech based on a nationalstandard will inevitably base their assessments to some extent on their experience of their local communities, I agreewith

Justice Breyer that the lesser degree of variation
that would result is inherent in the jury system and does
not necessarily pose a First Amendment problem. See post,
at 591. In my view, a national standard is not only constitutionally permissible, but also reasonable.

While I would prefer that the Court resolve the issue before it by explicitly adopting a national standard for defining
obscenity on the Internet, given respondents' failure to demonstrate substantial overbreadth due solely to the variation
between local communities, I join Parts I, II, III-B, and IV
of Justice Thomas' opinion and the judgment.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I write separately because I believe that Congress intended the statutory word "community" to refer to the Nation's adult community taken as a whole, not to geographically separate local areas. The statutory language does not
explicitly describe the specific "community" to which it refers. It says only that the "average person, applying contemporary community standards," must find that the "material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed
to appeal to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient
interest . . . ." 47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V).

Opinion of Breyer, J.
In the statute's legislative history, however, Congressmade clear that it did not intend this ambiguous statutory

phrase to refer to separate standards that might differsignificantly among different communities. The relevant
House of Representatives Report says:

"The Committee recognizes that the applicability of
community standards in the context of the Web is con-troversial,

but understands it as an `adult' standard,
rather than a `geographic' standard, and one that is
reasonably constant among adults in America with
respect to what is suitable for minors." H. R. Rep.No. 105-775, p. 28 (1998) (emphasis added).

This statement, reflecting what apparently was a uniformview within Congress, makes clear that the standard, and
the relevant community, is national and adult.At the same time, this view of the statute avoids the need
to examine the serious First Amendment problem thatwould otherwise exist. See

Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U. S. 224, 237-238 (1998); Ashwander v. TVA, 297

question may be avoided' "). To read the statute as adopting the community standards of every locality in the United
States would provide the most puritan of communities with
a heckler's Internet veto affecting the rest of the Nation.
The technical difficulties associated with efforts to confine
Internet material to particular geographic areas make the
problem particularly serious. See American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 217 F. 3d 162, 175-176 (CA3 2000). And
these special difficulties also potentially weaken the authority of prior cases in which they were not present. Cf. Sable

Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989);Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87 (1974). A nationally

uniform adult-based standard--which Congress, in its Com-mittee Report, said that it intended--significantly alleviates any special need for First Amendment protection. Ofcourse some regional variation may remain, but any such
variations are inherent in a system that draws jurors from alocal geographic area and they are not, from the perspective
of the First Amendment, problematic. See id., at 105-106.For these reasons I do not join Part III of

Justice
Thomas' opinion, although I agree with much of the reason-ing set forth in Parts III-B and III-D, insofar as it explains

the conclusion to which I just referred, namely, that variationreflecting application of the same national standard by different local juries does not violate the First Amendment.

If a law restricts substantially more speech than is justi-fied, it may be subject to a facial challenge. Broadrick v.

Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615 (1973). There is a very reallikelihood that the Child Online Protection Act (COPA or
Act) is overbroad and cannot survive such a challenge. In-deed, content-based regulations like this one are presumptively invalid abridgments of the freedom of speech. See
R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992). Yet COPAis a major federal statute, enacted in the wake of our previous determination that its predecessor violated the FirstAmendment. See Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,
521 U. S. 844 (1997). Congress and the President wereaware of our decision, and we should assume that in seeking
to comply with it they have given careful consideration tothe constitutionality of the new enactment. For these reasons, even if this facial challenge appears to have consider535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
able merit, the Judiciary must proceed with caution and iden-tify overbreadth with care before invalidating the Act.

In this case, the District Court issued a preliminary in-junction against enforcement of COPA, finding it too broad
across several dimensions. The Court of Appeals affirmed,but on a different ground. COPA defines "material that is
harmful to minors" by reference to "contemporary community standards," 47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V);and on the theory that these vary from place to place, the

Court of Appeals held that the definition dooms the statute"without reference to its other provisions."

American
Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 217 F. 3d 162, 174 (CA3 2000).
The Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to construe the
rest of the Act or address the District Court's reasoning.

This single, broad proposition, stated and applied at such
a high level of generality, cannot suffice to sustain the Court
of Appeals' ruling. To observe only that community standards vary across the country is to ignore the antecedent
question: community standards as to what? Whether the
national variation in community standards produces overbreadth requiring invalidation of COPA, see Broadrick,
supra, depends on the breadth of COPA's coverage and on
what community standards are being invoked. Only by
identifying the universe of speech burdened by COPA is it
possible to discern whether national variation in community
standards renders the speech restriction overbroad. In
short, the ground on which the Court of Appeals relied cannot be separated from those that it overlooked.

The statute, for instance, applies only to "communication
for commercial purposes." 47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(2)(A). The
Court of Appeals, however, did not consider the amount
of commercial communication, the number of commercial
speakers, or the character of commercial speech covered by
the Act. Likewise, the statute's definition of "harmful
to minors" requires material to be judged "as a whole."

$ 231(e)(6)(C). The notion of judging work as a whole is

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
familiar in other media, but more difficult to define on theWorld Wide Web. It is unclear whether what is to be

judged as a whole is a single image on a Web page, a wholeWeb page, an entire multipage Web site, or an interlocking
set of Web sites. Some examination of the group of coveredspeakers and the categories of covered speech is necessary in
order to comprehend the extent of the alleged overbreadth.The Court of Appeals found that COPA in effect subjects
every Internet speaker to the standards of the most puritani-cal community in the United States. This concern is a real
one, but it alone cannot suffice to invalidate COPA withoutcareful examination of the speech and the speakers within
the ambit of the Act. For this reason, I join the judgmentof the Court vacating the opinion of the Court of Appeals
and remanding for consideration of the statute as a whole.Unlike

Justice Thomas, however, I would not assume thatthe Act is narrow enough to render the national variation in

community standards unproblematic. Indeed, if the DistrictCourt correctly construed the statute across its other dimensions, then the variation in community standards might welljustify enjoining enforcement of the Act. I would leave that
question to the Court of Appeals in the first instance.

II
COPA provides a three-part conjunctive definition of "ma-terial that is harmful to minors." The first part of the definition is that "the average person, applying contemporarycommunity standards, would find, taking the material as a
whole and with respect to minors, [that it] is designed toappeal to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient interest."
47 U. S. C. $ 231(e)(6)(A). (The parties agree that the secondpart of the definition, $ 231(e)(6)(B), likewise invokes contemporary community standards, though only implicitly. Seeante, at 576, n. 7.) The nub of the problem is, as the Court
has said, that "the `community standards' criterion as appliedto the Internet means that any communication available to

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
a nationwide audience will be judged by the standards ofthe community most likely to be offended by the message."

Reno, 521 U. S., at 877-878. If material might be consideredharmful to minors in any community in the United States,
then the material is covered by COPA, at least when viewedin that place. This observation was the linchpin of the
Court of Appeals' analysis, and we must now consider
whether it alone suffices to support the holding below.The quoted sentence from

Reno was not casual dicta;
rather, it was one rationale for the holding of the case.In

Reno, the Court found "[t]he breadth of [COPA's
predecessor] . . . wholly unprecedented," id., at 877, in part
because of variation in community standards. The Court
also relied on that variation to assess the strength of the
Government's interest, which it found "not equally strong
throughout the coverage of this broad statute." Id., at 878.
The Court illustrated the point with an example: A parent
who e-mailed birth control information to his 17-year-old
child at college might violate the Act, "even though neither
he, his child, nor anyone in their home community found the
material `indecent' or `patently offensive,' if the college
town's community thought otherwise." Ibid. Variation
in community standards rendered the statute broader than
the scope of the Government's own expressed compelling
interest.

It is true, as Justice Thomas points out, ante, at 580-583,
that requiring a speaker addressing a national audience to
meet varying community standards does not always violate
the First Amendment. See Hamling v. United States, 418
U. S. 87, 106 (1974) (obscene mailings); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 125-126 (1989) (obscene phone messages). These cases, however, are of limited utility in analyzing the one before us, because each mode
of expression has its own unique characteristics, and each
"must be assessed for First Amendment purposes by standards suited to it." Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Con535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

595Cite as: 535 U. S. 564 (2002)

rad, 420 U. S. 546, 557 (1975). Indeed, when Congress pur-ports to abridge the freedom of a new medium, we must be

particularly attentive to its distinct attributes, for "differ-ences in the characteristics of new media justify differences
in the First Amendment standards applied to them." Red
Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 386 (1969).
The economics and the technology of each medium affect
both the burden of a speech restriction and the Government'sinterest in maintaining it.

In this case the District Court found as a fact that "[o]ncea provider posts its content on the Internet and chooses to
make it available to all, it generally cannot prevent that content from entering any geographic community." American
Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 31 F. Supp. 2d 473, 484 (ED
Pa. 1999). By contrast, in upholding a ban on obscene phone
messages, we emphasized that the speaker could "hire operators to determine the source of the calls or engag[e] with the
telephone company to arrange for the screening and blocking
of out-of-area calls or fin[d] another means for providing messages compatible with community standards." Sable, supra,
at 125. And if we did not make the same point in Hamling,
that is likely because it is so obvious that mailing lends itself
to geographic restriction. (The Court has had no occasion
to consider whether venue would be proper in "every hamlet
into which [obscene mailings] may wander," Hamling, supra,
at 144 (dissenting opinion), for the petitioners in Hamling
did not challenge the statute as overbroad on its face.) A
publisher who uses the mails can choose the location of his
audience.

The economics and technology of Internet communication
differ in important ways from those of telephones and mail.
Paradoxically, as the District Court found, it is easy and
cheap to reach a worldwide audience on the Internet, see 31
F. Supp. 2d, at 482, but expensive if not impossible to reach
a geographic subset, id., at 484. A Web publisher in a community where avant garde culture is the norm may have no

535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
desire to reach a national market; he may wish only to speakto his neighbors; nevertheless, if an eavesdropper in a more

traditional, rural community chooses to listen in, there isnothing the publisher can do. As a practical matter, COPA
makes the eavesdropper the arbiter of propriety on the Web.And it is no answer to say that the speaker should "take the
simple step of utilizing a [different] medium." Ante, at 583
(principal opinion of Thomas, J.). "Our prior decisions havevoiced particular concern with laws that foreclose an entire

medium of expression . . . . [T]he danger they pose to thefreedom of speech is readily apparent--by eliminating a common means of speaking, such measures can suppress too
much speech." City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 55
(1994).

Justice Breyer would alleviate the problem of local variation in community standards by construing the statute to
comprehend the "Nation's adult community taken as a
whole," rather than the local community from which the jury
is drawn. Ante, at 589 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also ante, at 586-589 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). There
is one statement in a House Committee Report to this effect,
"reflecting," Justice Breyer writes, "what apparently was
a uniform view within Congress." Ante, at 590. The statement, perhaps, reflects the view of a majority of one House
committee, but there is no reason to believe that it reflects
the view of a majority of the House of Representatives, let
alone the "uniform view within Congress." Ibid.

In any event, we need not decide whether the statute invokes local or national community standards to conclude that
vacatur and remand are in order. If the statute does incorporate some concept of national community standards, the
actual standard applied is bound to vary by community nevertheless, as the Attorney General concedes. See ante, at
577 (principal opinion of Thomas, J.); Brief for Petitioner
39.

597Cite as: 535 U. S. 564 (2002)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
For this reason the Court of Appeals was correct to focuson COPA's incorporation of varying community standards;

and it may have been correct as well to conclude that inpractical effect COPA imposes the most puritanical community standard on the entire country. We have observed thatit is "neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the
First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine orMississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable
in Las Vegas, or New York City." Miller v. California, 413U. S. 15, 32 (1973). On the other hand, it is neither realistic
nor beyond constitutional doubt for Congress, in effect, toimpose the community standards of Maine or Mississippi on
Las Vegas and New York. "People in different States varyin their tastes and attitudes, and this diversity is not to be
strangled by the absolutism of imposed uniformity." Id.,at 33. In striking down COPA's predecessor, the

RenoCourt identified this precise problem, and if the Hamling

and Sable Courts did not find the problem fatal, that isbecause those cases involved quite different media. The
national variation in community standards constitutes a par-ticular burden on Internet speech.

III
The question that remains is whether this observation "by
itself " suffices to enjoin the Act. See ante, at 585. I agreewith the Court that it does not. Ibid. We cannot know

whether variation in community standards renders the Actsubstantially overbroad without first assessing the extent of
the speech covered and the variations in community stand-ards with respect to that speech.

First, the breadth of the Act itself will dictate the degreeof overbreadth caused by varying community standards.
Indeed, Justice Thomas sees this point and uses it in anattempt to distinguish the Communications Decency Act of
1996, which was at issue in Reno. See ante, at 577-578("The CDA's use of community standards to identify patently

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
offensive material, however, was particularly problematic inlight of that statute's unprecedented breadth and vagueness"); ante, at 578 ("The tremendous breadth of the CDAmagnified the impact caused by differences in community
standards across the country"). To explain the ways inwhich COPA is narrower than the CDA,

Justice Thomas
finds that he must construe sections of COPA elided by the
Court of Appeals. Though I agree with the necessity fordoing so,

Justice Thomas' interpretation--undertaken
without substantial arguments or briefing--is not altogetherpersuasive, and I would leave this task to the Court of Appeals in the first instance. As this case comes to us, once it
is accepted that we cannot strike down the Act based merely
on the phrase "contemporary community standards," we
should go no further than to vacate and remand for a more
comprehensive analysis of the Act.

Second, community standards may have different degrees
of variation depending on the question posed to the community. Defining the scope of the Act, therefore, is not relevant
merely to the absolute number of Web pages covered, as Justice Stevens suggests, post, at 609-610 (dissenting opinion); it is also relevant to the proportion of overbreadth,
"judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,"
Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 615. Because this issue was "virtually ignored by the parties and the amicus" in the Court of
Appeals, 217 F. 3d, at 173, we have no information on the
question. Instead, speculation meets speculation. On the
one hand, the Court of Appeals found "no evidence to suggest that adults everywhere in America would share the
same standards for determining what is harmful to minors."
Id., at 178. On the other hand, Justice Thomas finds "no
reason to believe that the practical effect of varying community standards under COPA . . . is significantly greater than
the practical effect of varying community standards under
federal obscenity statutes." Ante, at 583-584. When a key
issue has "no evidence" on one side and "no reason to be535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

599Cite as: 535 U. S. 564 (2002)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
lieve" the other, it is a good indication that we should vacatefor further consideration.

The District Court attempted a comprehensive analysis ofCOPA and its various dimensions of potential overbreadth.
The Court of Appeals, however, believed that its own analy-sis of "contemporary community standards" obviated all
other concerns. It dismissed the District Court's analysis
in a footnote:

"[W]e do not find it necessary to address the DistrictCourt's analysis of the definition of `commercial purposes'; whether the breadth of the forms of content cov-ered by COPA could have been more narrowly tailored;
whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden on Web publishers or whether those affirmative de-fenses should have been included as elements of the

crime itself; whether COPA's inclusion of criminal aswell as civil penalties was excessive; whether COPA is
designed to include communications made in chat rooms,discussion groups and links to other Web sites; whether
the government is entitled to so restrict communicationswhen children will continue to be able to access foreign
Web sites and other sources of material that is harmfulto them; what taken `as a whole' should mean in the
context of the Web and the Internet; or whether the
statute's failure to distinguish between material that isharmful to a six year old versus a sixteen year old is

problematic." 217 F. 3d, at 174, n. 19.
As I have explained, however, any problem caused by varia-tion in community standards cannot be evaluated in a vacuum. In order to discern whether the variation creates substantial overbreadth, it is necessary to know what speech
COPA regulates and what community standards it invokes.

It is crucial, for example, to know how limiting is the Act's
limitation to "communication for commercial purposes." 47
U. S. C. $ 231(e)(2)(A). In Reno, we remarked that COPA's

535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
600 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
predecessor was so broad in part because it had no suchlimitation. 521 U. S., at 877. COPA, by contrast, covers a

speaker only if:

"the person who makes a communication or offers to
make a communication, by means of the World WideWeb, that includes any material that is harmful to

minors, devotes time, attention, or labor to such activi-ties, as a regular course of such person's trade or business, with the objective of earning a profit as a resultof such activities (although it is not necessary that the
person make a profit or that the making or offeringto make such communications be the person's sole or
principal business or source of income)." 47 U. S. C.

$ 231(e)(2)(B).

So COPA is narrower across this dimension than its prede-cessor; but how much narrower is a matter of debate. In

the District Court, the Attorney General contended that theAct applied only to professional panderers, but the court rejected that contention, finding "nothing in the text of theCOPA . . . that limits its applicability to so-called commercial
pornographers only." 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 480. Indeed, the
plain text of the Act does not limit its scope to pornographythat is offered for sale; it seems to apply even to speech provided for free, so long as the speaker merely hopes to profitas an indirect result. The statute might be susceptible of
some limiting construction here, but again the Court of Ap-peals did not address itself to this question. The answer
affects the breadth of the Act and hence the significance ofany variation in community standards.

Likewise, it is essential to answer the vexing question of
what it means to evaluate Internet material "as a whole," 47
U. S. C. $$ 231(e)(6)(A), (C), when everything on the Web is
connected to everything else. As a general matter, "[t]he
artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of
a single explicit scene. . . . [T]he First Amendment requires

535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
that redeeming value be judged by considering the work asa whole. Where the scene is part of the narrative, the work

itself does not for this reason become obscene, even thoughthe scene in isolation might be offensive."

Ashcroft v. Free
Speech Coalition, ante, at 248. COPA appears to respectthis principle by requiring that the material be judged "as a

whole," both as to its prurient appeal, $ 231(e)(6)(A), and as
to its social value, $ 231(e)(6)(C). It is unclear, however,what constitutes the denominator--that is, the material to

be taken as a whole--in the context of the World Wide Web.See 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 483 ("Although information on the Web
is contained in individual computers, the fact that each of
these computers is connected to the Internet through World
Wide Web protocols allows all of the information to become
part of a single body of knowledge"); id., at 484 ("From a
user's perspective, [the World Wide Web] may appear to be
a single, integrated system"). Several of the respondents
operate extensive Web sites, some of which include only a
small amount of material that might run afoul of the Act.
The Attorney General contended that these respondents had
nothing to fear from COPA, but the District Court disagreed,
noting that the Act prohibits communication that "includes"
any material harmful to minors. $ 231(a)(1). In the District Court's view, "it logically follows that [COPA] would
apply to any Web site that contains only some harmful to
minors material." Id., at 480. The denominator question is
of crucial significance to the coverage of the Act.

Another issue is worthy of mention, because it too may
inform whether the variation in community standards renders the Act substantially overbroad. The parties and the
Court of Appeals did not address the question of venue,
though it would seem to be bound up with the issue of varying community standards. COPA does not address venue in
explicit terms, so prosecution may be proper "in any district
in which [an] offense was begun, continued, or completed."
18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a). The Act's prohibition includes an inter535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
602 ASHCROFT v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

Stevens, J., dissenting
state commerce element, 47 U. S. C. $ 231(a)(1), and "[a]nyoffense involving . . . interstate . . . commerce . . . may be

inquired of and prosecuted in any district from, through, orinto which such commerce . . . moves." 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a).
In the context of COPA, it seems likely that venue would beproper where the material originates or where it is viewed.
Whether it may be said that a Web site moves "through"other venues in between is less certain. And since, as discussed above, juries will inevitably apply their own commu-nity standards, the choice of venue may be determinative of
the choice of standard. The more venues the Governmenthas to choose from, the more speech will be chilled by variation across communities. IV

In summary, the breadth of the Act depends on the issuesdiscussed above, and the significance of varying community
standards depends, in turn, on the breadth of the Act. TheCourt of Appeals was correct to focus on the national variation in community standards, which can constitute a substan-tial burden on Internet communication; and its ultimate conclusion may prove correct. There may be grave doubts thatCOPA is consistent with the First Amendment; but we
should not make that determination with so many questionsunanswered. The Court of Appeals should undertake a
comprehensive analysis in the first instance.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the In-ternet, as in older media. Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults. Some are offensiveto certain viewers but welcomed by others. For decades,
our cases have recognized that the standards for judgingtheir acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community. Those cases developed the require-ment that communications should be protected if they do not
violate contemporary community standards. In its original

535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
form, the community standard provided a shield for commu-nications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society. Thus, the Court "has emphasized on morethan one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a
judgment be made on the basis of `contemporary communitystandards' is to assure that the material is judged neither on
the basis of each juror's personal opinion, nor by its effect
on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group."
Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 107 (1974). In the
context of the Internet, however, community standards be-come a sword, rather than a shield. If a prurient appeal is

offensive in a puritan village, it may be a crime to post it on
the World Wide Web.

The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) restricts access
by adults as well as children to materials that are "harmful to minors." 47 U. S. C. $ 231(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V).
COPA is a substantial improvement over its predecessor, the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), which we held
unconstitutional five years ago in Reno v. American Civil
Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844 (1997) (ACLU I). Congress
has thoughtfully addressed several of the First Amendment
problems that we identified in that case. Nevertheless,
COPA preserves the use of contemporary community standards to define which materials are harmful to minors. As
we explained in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 877-878, "the `community standards' criterion as applied to the Internet means
that any communication available to a nationwide audience
will be judged by the standards of the community most likely
to be offended by the message."

We have recognized that the State has a compelling interest in protecting minors from harmful speech, Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989), and
on one occasion we upheld a restriction on indecent speech
that was made available to the general public, because it
could be accessed by minors, FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U. S. 726 (1978). Our decision in that case was influ535US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-03 17:27:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

enced by the distinctive characteristics of the broadcast me-dium, as well as the expertise of the agency, and the narrow

scope of its order. Id., at 748-750; see also ACLU I, 521U. S., at 867. On the other hand, we have repeatedly rejected the position that the free speech rights of adults canbe limited to what is acceptable for children. See id., at 875
(quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60,74-75 (1983) ("[R]egardless of the strength of the government's interest" in protecting children, "[t]he level of dis-course reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that
which would be suitable for a sandbox" (internal quotationmarks omitted)));

Sable, 492 U. S., at 128; Butler v. Michi-gan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957).

Petitioner relies on our decision in Ginsberg v. New York,390 U. S. 629 (1968), for the proposition that Congress can
prohibit the display of materials that are harmful to minors.But the statute upheld in Ginsberg prohibited selling indecent materials directly to children, id., at 633 (describingN. Y. Penal Law $ 484-h, making it unlawful " `knowingly to
sell . . . to a minor . . .' "), whereas the speech implicated hereis simply posted on a medium that is accessible to both adults
and children, 47 U. S. C. $ 231(a)(1) (prohibiting anyone from"knowingly . . . mak[ing] any communication for commercial
purposes that is available to any minor . . ."). Like the re-striction on indecent "dial-a-porn" numbers invalidated in
Sable, the prohibition against mailing advertisements forcontraceptives invalidated in

Bolger, and the ban againstselling adult books found impermissible in Butler, COPA

seeks to limit protected speech that is not targeted at chil-dren, simply because it can be obtained by them while

U. S., at 383.COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to
the general public, it also covers a medium in which speechcannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely
to be considered harmful to minors. The Internet presentsa unique forum for communication because information, once
posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.The speaker cannot control access based on the location of
the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which itsspeech is transmitted. By approving the use of community
standards in this context, Justice Thomas endorses a con-struction of COPA that has "the intolerable consequence of
denying some sections of the country access to material,there deemed acceptable, which in others might be considered offensive to prevailing community standards of de-cency."

Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, 370 U. S. 478,488 (1962).

If the material were forwarded through the mails, as in
Hamling, or over the telephone, as in Sable, the sender couldavoid destinations with the most restrictive standards. Indeed, in Sable, we upheld the application of communitystandards to a nationwide medium because the speaker was
"free to tailor its messages . . . to the communities it choosesto serve," by either "hir[ing] operators to determine the
source of the calls . . . [or] arrang[ing] for the screening andblocking of out-of-area calls." 492 U. S., at 125 (emphasis
added). Our conclusion that it was permissible for thespeaker to bear the ultimate burden of compliance, id., at
126, assumed that such compliance was at least possible with-out requiring the speaker to choose another medium or to
limit its speech to what all would find acceptable. Given the
ACLU I, 521 U. S. 844, 854 (1997), " `the receipt of information on the
Internet requires a series of affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial' "--or scanning a magazine rack.

undisputed fact that a provider who posts material on the
Internet cannot prevent it from entering any geographic
community, see ante, at 575, n. 6 (opinion of Thomas, J.), a
law that criminalizes a particular communication in just a
handful of destinations effectively prohibits transmission of
that message to all of the 176.5 million Americans that have
access to the Internet, see ante, at 567, n. 2 (majority opinion). In light of this fundamental difference in technologies,
the rules applicable to the mass mailing of an obscene montage or to obscene dial-a-porn should not be used to judge
the legality of messages on the World Wide Web.2

In his attempt to fit this case within the framework of
Hamling and Sable, Justice Thomas overlooks the more
obvious comparison--namely, the CDA invalidated in ACLU
I. When we confronted a similar attempt by Congress to
limit speech on the Internet based on community standards,
we explained that because Web publishers cannot control
who accesses their Web sites, using community standards
to regulate speech on the Internet creates an overbreadth
problem. "[T]he `community standards' criterion as applied
to the Internet means that any communication available to a
nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the
community most likely to be offended by the message." 521
U. S., at 877-878. Although our holding in ACLU I did not
turn on that factor alone, we did not adopt the position relied
on by Justice Thomas--that applying community standards
to the Internet is constitutional based on Hamling and

2 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at
583, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid
having its speech judged by the least tolerant community. Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were
to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay. Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to "take the simple step of
utilizing a medium that enables," ibid., them to avoid this material before
requiring the speaker to find another forum.

Justice Thomas points to several other provisions inCOPA to argue that any overbreadth will be rendered insubstantial by the rest of the statute. Ante, at 578-579.These provisions afford little reassurance, however, as they
only marginally limit the sweep of the statute. It is truethat, in addition to COPA's "appeals to the prurient interest
of minors" prong, the material must be "patently offensivewith respect to minors" and it must lack "serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value for minors." 47 U. S. C.$ 231(e)(6). Nonetheless, the "patently offensive" prong is
judged according to contemporary community standards aswell,

ante, at 576, n. 7 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whateverdisparity exists between various communities' assessment of

the content that appeals to the prurient interest of minorswill surely be matched by their differing opinions as to

3 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading
the phrase "contemporary national standards" into the statute, ante, at
589 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). While the
legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is
contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider "community" standards. This phrase is a term of art that has taken
on a particular meaning in light of our precedent. Although we have
never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally
impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is "an exercise in
futility," Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 30 (1973), and that "[a] juror is
entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person
in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination," Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 104 (1974).
Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and
we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.
Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute
to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose. And even
if the plurality were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge,
as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult,
standard will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country,

whether descriptions of sexual acts or depictions of nudityare patently offensive with respect to minors. Nor does the

requirement that the material be "in some sense erotic," seeante, at 579 (citing Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,
213, and n. 10 (1975)), substantially narrow the category ofimages covered. Arguably every depiction of nudity--partial or full--is in some sense erotic with respect to minors.4Petitioner's argument that the "serious value" prong minimizes the statute's overbreadth is also unpersuasive. Al-though we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective,reasonable person standard,

Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497,500 (1987), this criterion is inadequate to cure COPA's overbreadth because COPA adds an important qualifying phraseto the standard Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), formulation of the serious value prong. The question for thejury is not whether a reasonable person would conclude that
the materials have serious value; instead, the jury must de-termine whether the materials have serious value

for mi-nors. Congress reasonably concluded that a substantial

number of works, which have serious value for adults, do nothave serious value for minors. Cf. ACLU I, 521 U. S., at
896 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dis-senting in part) ("While discussions about prison rape or
nude art . . . may have some redeeming educational valuefor adults, they do not necessarily have any such value for
minors"). Thus, even though the serious value prong limitsthe total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains
true that there is a significant amount of protected speechwithin the category of materials that have no serious value
for minors. That speech is effectively prohibited whenever

4 Of course, Justice Thomas' example of the image "of a war victim's
wounded nude body," ante, at 579, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted "a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent
female breast" and lacked serious political value for minors, 47 U. S. C.

the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.5
While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any
worry that the serious value determination will be made by
the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that,
within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value
for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be
made by the most restrictive community.

Justice Kennedy makes a similar misstep, ante, at 592
(opinion concurring in judgment), when he ties the overbreadth inquiry to questions about the scope of the other
provisions of the statute. According to his view, we cannot
determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad
based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by
the other restrictions in the statute. But this represents a
fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine. As
Justice White explained in Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S.

5 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for
commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the
CDA, ante, at 569. While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase "commercial purposes" is somewhat misleading. The definition of commercial purposes, 47 U. S. C.

$ 231(e)(2)(B), covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements
or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the
advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are
harmful to minors. As the District Court noted: "There is nothing in
the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called
commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability
on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial
purposes `that includes any material that is harmful to minors,' " App. to
Pet. for Cert. 52a. In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious
limitation. A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites
contain commercial content. Lawrence & Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107-109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek--but on the
Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3. Interestingly,
this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

601, 615 (1973), "the overbreadth of a statute must not
only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to

the statute's plainly legitimate sweep." (Emphasis added.)
Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the "commercial purposes" or "as a whole" provisions on remand, the
question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a
substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community
standards.6 These other provisions may reduce the absolute
number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the
narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial
amount of protected speech that many communities would
not find harmful to minors. Because Web speakers cannot
limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions
are construed.

Justice Thomas acknowledges, and petitioner concedes,
that juries across the country will apply different standards
and reach different conclusions about whether particular
works are harmful to minors. See ante, at 577; Brief for
Petitioner 3-4, 39. We recognized as much in ACLU I when
we noted that "discussions about prison rape or safe sexual
practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card catalog of the Carnegie Library" might offend some community's standards and not others, 521 U. S.,
at 878. In fact, our own division on that question provides
further evidence of the range of attitudes about such material. See, e. g., id., at 896 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judg6 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the
District Court, ante, at 599. But most of those concerns went to whether
COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth. Even under Justice
Kennedy's formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth
analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or
whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

among communities in their attitudes toward works involv-ing homosexuality, masturbation, and nudity.

Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excludedfrom COPA's coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlyingthemes depicted. This diversity of views surely extends to
whether materials with the same themes, that do not haveserious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests
and are patently offensive. There is no reason to think the
differences between communities' standards will disappearonce the image or description is no longer within the context

of a work that has serious value for minors.8 Because com-munities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals wascorrect to conclude that, regardless of how COPA's other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the
Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protectedspeech that would not be considered harmful to minors in

many communities.Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of
course, on the content of the message. The kind of hard-core pornography involved in

Hamling, which I assume
would be obscene under any community's standard, does notbelong on the Internet. Perhaps "teasers" that serve no

function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore mate-rials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site's "metatags" in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visitingpornographic sites, deserve the same fate. But COPA ex7 Brief for Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4-10

tends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements,online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms,

stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustra-tions encompassing a vast number of messages that are
unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no"serious value" for minors. It is quite wrong to allow the
standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant com-munities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages
in this burgeoning market.In the context of most other media, using community
standards to differentiate between permissible and imper-missible speech has two virtues. As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protectspeakers from the least tolerant members of society. By aggregating values at the community level, the Miller testeliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscenespeech. But community standards also serve as a shield to
protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sortbased on their preferences. Those who abhor and those who
tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-mindedpeople and settle in communities that share their views on
what is acceptable for themselves and their children. Thissorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace;
the audience cannot self-segregate. As a result, in thecontext of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword,
because the community that wishes to live without certainmaterial rids not only itself, but the entire Internet, of

the offending speech.In sum, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and therefore respectfully dissent.

LAPIDES v. BOARD OF REGENTS OF UNIVERSITYSYSTEM OF GEORGIA

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 01-298. Argued February 25, 2002--Decided May 13, 2002
Petitioner, a professor in the Georgia state university system, filed a statecourt suit against respondents--the system's board of regents (hereinafter Georgia or State) and university officials in their personal capacities and as state agents--alleging that the officials had violated state
tort law and 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 when they placed sexual harassment allegations in his personnel files. The defendants removed the case to Federal District Court and then sought dismissal. Conceding that a state
statute had waived Georgia's sovereign immunity from state-law suits
in state court, the State claimed Eleventh Amendment immunity
from suit in the federal court. The District Court held that Georgia
had waived such immunity when it removed the case to federal court.
In reversing, the Eleventh Circuit found that, because state law was
unclear as to whether the state attorney general had the legal authority
to waive Georgia's Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State retained
the legal right to assert immunity, even after removal.

Held: A State waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity when it removes

a case from state court to federal court. Pp. 617-624.

(a) Because this case does not present a valid federal claim against
Georgia, see Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 66, the
answer to the question presented is limited to the context of state-law
claims where the State has waived immunity from state-court proceedings. Although absent a federal claim, the Federal District Court
might remand the state claims against the State to state court, those
claims remain pending in the federal court, which has the discretion
to decide the remand question in the first instance. Thus, the question
presented is not moot. Pp. 617-618.

(b) This Court has established the general principle that a State's
voluntary appearance in federal court amounts to a waiver of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447; Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 574; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line
R. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 284, and has often cited with approval the cases
embodying that principle, see, e. g., College Savings Bank v. Florida
Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 681, n. 3. Here,
Georgia was brought involuntarily into the case as a defendant in state

court, but it then voluntarily removed the case to federal court, thus
voluntarily invoking that court's jurisdiction. Unless this Court is to
abandon the general principle requiring waiver or there is something
special about removal in this case, the general principle should apply.
Pp. 618-620.

(c) Contrary to respondents' arguments, there is no reason to abandon
the general principle. The principle enunciated in Gunter, Gardner,
and Clark did not turn on the nature of the relief and is sound as applied
to money damages cases such as this. And more recent cases requiring
a clear indication of a State's intent to waive its immunity, e. g., College
Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at 675-681, distinguished the kind of constructive waivers repudiated there from waivers effected by litigation conduct, id., at 681, n. 3. Nor have respondents pointed to a special feature
of removal or of this case that would justify taking the case out from
the general rule. That Georgia claims a benign motive for removal--
not to obtain litigating advantages for itself but to provide the officials
sued in their personal capacities with the interlocutory appeal provisions available in federal court--cannot make a critical difference.
Motives are difficult to evaluate, while jurisdictional rules should be
clear. Because adopting respondents' position would permit States to
achieve unfair tactical advantages, if not in this case, then in others,
see Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U. S. 381, 393-394,
the rationale for applying the general principle is as strong here as elsewhere. Respondents also argue that Georgia is entitled to immunity
because state law does not authorize its attorney general to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity and because, in Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, a State regained immunity by
showing such lack of authority--even after the State had litigated the
case against it. Here, however, Georgia voluntarily invoked the federal court's jurisdiction, while the State in Ford had involuntarily been
made a federal-court defendant. This Court has consistently found
waiver when a state attorney general, authorized to bring a case in
federal court, has voluntarily invoked that court's jurisdiction. More
importantly, in large part the rule governing voluntary invocations of
federal jurisdiction has rested upon the inconsistency and unfairness
that a contrary rule would create. A rule that finds waiver through a
state attorney general's invocation of federal-court jurisdiction avoids
inconsistency and unfairness, but a rule that, as in Ford, denies waiver
despite the attorney general's state-authorized litigating decision does
the opposite. For these reasons, Clark, Gunter, and Gardner represent the sounder line of authority, and Ford, which is inconsistent
with the basic rationale of those cases, is overruled insofar as it would

The Eleventh Amendment grants a State immunity fromsuit in federal court by citizens of other States, U. S. Const.,

Amdt. 11, and by its own citizens as well, Hans v. Louisiana,134 U. S. 1 (1890). The question before us is whether the
State's act of removing a lawsuit from state court to federalcourt waives this immunity. We hold that it does.

I
Paul Lapides, a professor employed by the Georgia stateuniversity system, brought this lawsuit in a Georgia state

court. He sued respondents, the Board of Regents of theUniversity System of Georgia (hereinafter Georgia or State)
and university officials acting in both their personal capac-ities and as agents of the State. Lapides' lawsuit alleged
that university officials placed allegations of sexual harass-ment in his personnel files. And Lapides claimed that their
doing so violated both Georgia law, see Georgia Tort ClaimsAct, Ga. Code Ann. $ 50-21-23 (1994), and federal law, see
Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983(1994 ed., Supp. V).

All defendants joined in removing the case to Federal Dis-trict Court, 28 U. S. C. $ 1441, where they sought dismissal.
Those individuals whom Lapides had sued in their personalcapacities argued that the doctrine of "qualified immunity"
barred Lapides' federal-law claims against them. And theDistrict Court agreed. The State, while conceding that a
state statute had waived sovereign immunity from state-lawsuits in state court, argued that, by virtue of the Eleventh
Amendment, it remained immune from suit in federal court.

Opinion of the Court
See U. S. Const., Amdt. 11 (limiting scope of "Judicial powerof the

United States" (emphasis added)). But the District
Court did not agree. Rather, in its view, by removing thecase from state to federal court, the State had waived

its Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Atascadero State
Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238 (1985) (State may
waive Eleventh Amendment immunity).

The State appealed the District Court's Eleventh Amend-ment ruling. See

Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 144-145 (1993)(allowing interlocutory appeal). And the Court of Appeals

for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. 251 F. 3d 1372 (2001).
In its view, state law was, at the least, unclear as to whether
the State's attorney general possessed the legal authority
to waive the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity. And,
that being so, the State retained the legal right to assert
its immunity, even after removal. See Ford Motor Co. v.
Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459 (1945).

Lapides sought certiorari. We agreed to decide whether
"a state waive[s] its Eleventh Amendment immunity by its
affirmative litigation conduct when it removes a case to federal court . . . ." Pet. for Cert. (i).

It has become clear that we must limit our answer to the
context of state-law claims, in respect to which the State has
explicitly waived immunity from state-court proceedings.
That is because Lapides' only federal claim against the State
arises under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, that claim seeks only monetary damages, and we have held that a State is not a "person" against whom a $ 1983 claim for money damages might
be asserted. Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491
U. S. 58, 66 (1989). Compare Tr. of Oral Arg. 57-58 (asserting that complaint also sought declaratory judgment on
the federal claim), with complaint, App. 9-19 (failing, implicitly or explicitly, to seek any such relief). Hence this
case does not present a valid federal claim against the State.
Nor need we address the scope of waiver by removal in a

situation where the State's underlying sovereign immunityfrom suit has not been waived or abrogated in state court.

It has also become clear that, in the absence of any viablefederal claim, the Federal District Court might well remand
Lapides' state-law tort claims against the State to statecourt. 28 U. S. C. $ 1367(c)(3). Nonetheless, Lapides' statelaw tort claims against the State remain pending inFederal District Court, $ 1367(a), and the law commits the
remand question, ordinarily a matter of discretion, to theFederal District Court for decision in the first instance.

The Eleventh Amendment provides that the "Judicialpower of the United States shall not be construed to extend

to any suit . . . commenced or prosecuted against one ofthe . . . States" by citizens of another State, U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 11, and (as interpreted) by its own citizens. Hans v.
Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890). A State remains free towaive its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in a federal court. See, e. g., Atascadero, supra, at 238. And thequestion before us now is whether a State waives that im535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
munity when it removes a case from state court to federalcourt.

It would seem anomalous or inconsistent for a State both(1) to invoke federal jurisdiction, thereby contending that
the "Judicial power of the United States" extends to thecase at hand, and (2) to claim Eleventh Amendment immunity, thereby denying that the "Judicial power of the
United States" extends to the case at hand. And a Constitu-tion that permitted States to follow their litigation interests

by freely asserting both claims in the same case could gener-ate seriously unfair results. Thus, it is not surprising that
more than a century ago this Court indicated that a State's
voluntary appearance in federal court amounted to a waiver
of its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Clark v. Barnard,
108 U. S. 436, 447 (1883) (State's "voluntary appearance" in
federal court as an intervenor avoids Eleventh Amendment
inquiry). The Court subsequently held, in the context of a
bankruptcy claim, that a State "waives any immunity . . .
respecting the adjudication of " a "claim" that it voluntarily
files in federal court. Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565,
574 (1947). And the Court has made clear in general that
"where a State voluntarily becomes a party to a cause and
submits its rights for judicial determination, it will be bound
thereby and cannot escape the result of its own voluntary act
by invoking the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment."
Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 284
(1906) (emphasis added). The Court has long accepted this
statement of the law as valid, often citing with approval the
cases embodying that principle. See, e. g., College Savings
Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,
527 U. S. 666, 681, n. 3 (1999) (citing Gardner); Employees
of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department

620 LAPIDES v. BOARD OF REGENTS OF UNIV. SYSTEM

OF GA.

Opinion of the Court

In this case, the State was brought involuntarily into thecase as a defendant in the original state-court proceedings.

But the State then voluntarily agreed to remove the case tofederal court. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1446(a);

Chicago, R. I. & P.
R. Co. v. Martin, 178 U. S. 245, 248 (1900) (removal requiresthe consent of all defendants). In doing so, it voluntarily

invoked the federal court's jurisdiction. And unless we are
to abandon the general principle just stated, or unless thereis something special about removal or about this case, the

general legal principle requiring waiver ought to apply.We see no reason to abandon the general principle. Georgia points out that the cases that stand for the principle, Gunter, Gardner, and Clark, did not involve suits for
money damages against the State--the heart of the Eleventh
Amendment's concern. But the principle enunciated in
those cases did not turn upon the nature of the relief sought.
And that principle remains sound as applied to suits for
money damages.

Georgia adds that this Court decided Gunter, Gardner,
and Clark before it decided more recent cases, which have
required a "clear" indication of the State's intent to waive
its immunity. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S., at 675-681.
But College Savings Bank distinguished the kind of constructive waivers repudiated there from waivers effected by
litigation conduct. Id., at 681, n. 3. And this makes sense
because an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment that
finds waiver in the litigation context rests upon the Amendment's presumed recognition of the judicial need to avoid
inconsistency, anomaly, and unfairness, and not upon a
State's actual preference or desire, which might, after all,
favor selective use of "immunity" to achieve litigation advantages. See Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections v. Schacht,
524 U. S. 381, 393 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). The relevant "clarity" here must focus on the litigation act the State
takes that creates the waiver. And that act--removal--is
clear.

Opinion of the Court
Nor has Georgia pointed to any special feature, either ofremoval or of this case, that would justify taking the case

out from under the general rule. Georgia argues that itsmotive for removal was benign. It agreed to remove, not
in order to obtain litigating advantages for itself, but to pro-vide its codefendants, the officials sued in their personal
capacities, with the generous interlocutory appeal provisions
available in federal, but not in state, court. Compare Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524-530 (1985) (authorizing
interlocutory appeal of adverse qualified immunity determi-nation), with

Turner v. Giles, 264 Ga. 812, 813, 450 S. E. 2d
421, 424 (1994) (limiting interlocutory appeals to those certified by trial court). And it intended, from the beginning, to
return to state court, when and if its codefendants had
achieved their own legal victory.

A benign motive, however, cannot make the critical difference for which Georgia hopes. Motives are difficult to
evaluate, while jurisdictional rules should be clear. See
Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 426 (1916)
(Holmes, J., concurring). To adopt the State's Eleventh
Amendment position would permit States to achieve unfair
tactical advantages, if not in this case, in others. See
Schacht, supra, at 393-394, 398 (Kennedy, J., concurring);
cf. ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State
and Federal Courts 366-367 (1968) (discussing the unfairness
of allowing one who has invoked federal jurisdiction subsequently to challenge that jurisdiction). And that being so,
the rationale for applying the general "voluntary invocation"
principle is as strong here, in the context of removal, as
elsewhere.

More importantly, Georgia argues that state law, while authorizing its attorney general "[t]o represent the state in all
civil actions tried in any court," Ga. Code Ann. $ 45-15-3(6)
(1990); see Ga. Const., Art. 5, $ 3, || 4, does not authorize the
attorney general to waive the State's Eleventh Amendment
immunity, id., Art. 1, $ 2, |||| 9(e), (f), reprinted in 2 Ga. Code

OF GA.

Opinion of the Court

Ann. (Supp. 1996). Georgia adds that in Ford, this Courtunanimously interpreted roughly similar state laws similarly,

that the Court held that "no properly authorized executiveor administrative officer of the state has waived the state's
immunity," 328 U. S., at 469, and that it sustained an Elev-enth Amendment defense raised for the first time after a
State had litigated a claim brought against it in federal court.
That is to say, in Ford a State regained immunity by showingthe attorney general's lack of statutory authority to waive--

even after the State litigated a case brought against it infederal court. Why, then, asks Georgia, can it not regain
immunity in the same way, even after it removed its case to
federal court?

The short answer to this question is that this case involves
a State that voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court, while Ford involved a State that a private plaintiff had involuntarily made a defendant in federal court.
This Court consistently has found a waiver when a State's
attorney general, authorized (as here) to bring a case in
federal court, has voluntarily invoked that court's jurisdiction. See Gardner, 329 U. S., at 574-575; Gunter, 200 U. S.,
at 285-289, 292; cf. Clark, 108 U. S., at 447-448 (not inquiring into attorney general's authority). And the Eleventh Amendment waiver rules are different when a State's
federal-court participation is involuntary. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890); cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 11 (discussing suits "commenced or prosecuted against" a State).

But there is a more important answer. In large part the
rule governing voluntary invocations of federal jurisdiction
has rested upon the problems of inconsistency and unfairness
that a contrary rule of law would create. Gunter, supra, at
284. And that determination reflects a belief that neither
those who wrote the Eleventh Amendment nor the States
themselves (insofar as they authorize litigation in federal
courts) would intend to create that unfairness. As in analogous contexts, in which such matters are questions of federal

535US2 Unit: $U46 [09-26-03 17:36:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
law, cf., e. g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425,429, n. 5 (1997), whether a particular set of state laws, rules,

or activities amounts to a waiver of the State's EleventhAmendment immunity is a question of federal law. A rule
of federal law that finds waiver through a state attorneygeneral's invocation of federal-court jurisdiction avoids inconsistency and unfairness. A rule of federal law that, as
in Ford, denies waiver despite the state attorney general'sstate-authorized litigating decision, does the opposite. For

these reasons one Member of this Court has called for Ford'sreexamination.

Schacht, 524 U. S., at 394, 397 (Kennedy,
J., concurring). And for these same reasons, we conclude
that Clark, Gunter, and Gardner represent the sounder line
of authority. Finding Ford inconsistent with the basic rationale of that line of cases, we consequently overrule Ford
insofar as it would otherwise apply.

The State makes several other arguments, none of which
we find convincing. It points to cases in which this Court
has permitted the United States to enter into a case voluntarily without giving up immunity or to assert immunity
despite a previous effort to waive. See United States v.
United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506 (1940);
United States v. Shaw, 309 U. S. 495 (1940); see also Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe
of Okla., 498 U. S. 505 (1991). Those cases, however, do not
involve the Eleventh Amendment--a specific text with a
history that focuses upon the State's sovereignty vis-a` -vis
the Federal Government. And each case involves special
circumstances not at issue here, for example, an effort by a
sovereign (i. e., the United States) to seek the protection of
its own courts (i. e., the federal courts), or an effort to protect
an Indian tribe.

Finally, Georgia says that our conclusion will prove confusing, for States will have to guess what conduct might
be deemed a waiver in order to avoid accidental waivers.
But we believe the rule is a clear one, easily applied by both

Opinion of the Court

federal courts and the States themselves. It says that re-moval is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court's

jurisdiction sufficient to waive the State's otherwise validobjection to litigation of a matter (here of state law) in a
federal forum. As Justice Kennedy has pointed out, once"the States know or have reason to expect that removal will
constitute a waiver, then it is easy enough to presume thatan attorney authorized to represent the State can bind it to
the jurisdiction of the federal court (for Eleventh Amend-ment purposes) by the consent to removal." See

Schacht,supra, at 397 (concurring opinion).

We conclude that the State's action joining the removingof this case to federal court waived its Eleventh Amendment
immunity--though, as we have said, the District Court maywell find that this case, now raising only state-law issues,
should nonetheless be remanded to the state courts for de-termination. 28 U. S. C. $ 1367(c)(3).

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis reversed.

It is so ordered.

625OCTOBER TERM, 2001
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. COTTON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 01-687. Argued April 15, 2002--Decided May 20, 2002
A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging respondents with

conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute a "detectable amount" of cocaine and cocaine base. Respondents were convicted and received a sentence based on the District Court's finding
of drug quantity--at least 50 grams of cocaine base--that implicated
the enhanced penalties of 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b). They did not object in
the District Court to the fact that the sentences were based on a quantity not alleged in the indictment. While their appeal was pending,
this Court decided, in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, that
"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the
penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must
be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." In
federal prosecutions, such facts must also be charged in the indictment. Id., at 476. Respondents then argued in the Fourth Circuit that
their sentences were invalid under Apprendi, because the drug quantity issue was neither alleged in the indictment nor submitted to the
petit jury. That court vacated the sentences on the ground that it had
no jurisdiction to impose a sentence for an offense not charged in the
indictment.

Held:

1. A defective indictment does not deprive a court of jurisdiction.
Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1, the progenitor of the Fourth Circuit's view
that the indictment errors are "jurisdictional," is a product of an era
in which this Court's authority to review criminal convictions was
greatly circumscribed. It could examine constitutional errors in a criminal trial only on a writ of habeas corpus, and only then if it deemed the
error "jurisdictional." The Court's desire to correct obvious constitutional violations led to a "somewhat expansive notion of `jurisdiction,' "
Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485, 494, which is not what the term
means today, i. e., "the courts' statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case," Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.
83, 89. Because subject-matter jurisdiction involves a court's power to
hear a case, it can never be forfeited or waived. Thus, defects require
correction regardless of whether the error was raised in district court.
But a grand jury right can be waived. Post-Bain cases confirm that

535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
626 UNITED STATES v. COTTON

Syllabus
indictment defects do not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a
case. See, e. g., Lamar v. United States, 240 U. S. 60. Thus, this Court
some time ago departed from Bain's view that indictment defects are
"jurisdictional." Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212; Russell v.
United States, 369 U. S. 749, distinguished. Insofar as it held that a
defective indictment deprives a court of jurisdiction, Bain is overruled. Pp. 629-631.

2. The omission from a federal indictment of a fact that enhances the
statutory maximum sentence does not justify a court of appeals' vacating the enhanced sentence, even though the defendant did not object
in the trial court. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b)'s
plain-error test, where there is an "(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that
affects substantial rights," an appellate court may correct an error
not raised at trial, "but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings." Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 466-467 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The Government concedes that the indictment's failure to
allege a fact that increased the sentences was plain error. But, even
assuming the error affected respondents' substantial rights, it did not
seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The evidence that the conspiracy involved at least
50 grams of cocaine base was "overwhelming" and "essentially uncontroverted." It is true that the Fifth Amendment grand jury right serves
a vital function in providing for a body of citizens that acts as a check
on prosecutorial power, but that is no less true of the Sixth Amendment
right to a petit jury, which must find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
The petit jury's important role did not, however, prevent the Johnson
Court from applying the longstanding rule "that a constitutional right
may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make
timely assertion of the right." Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414,
444. The real threat to the "fairness, integrity, or public reputation
of judicial proceedings" would be if respondents, despite the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence that they were involved in a
vast drug conspiracy, were to receive a sentence prescribed for those
committing less substantial drug offenses because of an error that was
never objected to at trial. Pp. 631-634.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
In Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), we heldthat "[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact
that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribedstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved
beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 490. In federal prose-cutions, such facts must also be charged in the indictment.
Id., at 476 (quoting Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243,n. 6 (1999)). In this case, we address whether the omission
from a federal indictment of a fact that enhances the statu-tory maximum sentence justifies a court of appeals' vacating
the enhanced sentence, even though the defendant did notobject in the trial court.

Respondent Stanley Hall, Jr., led a "vast drug organiza-tion" in Baltimore. 261 F. 3d 397, 401 (CA4 2001). The six
other respondents helped run the operation. In October1997, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging
respondents with conspiring to distribute and to possesswith intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine and
50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U. S. C.$$ 846 and 841(a)(1). A superseding indictment returned in

Opinion of the Court
distribute and to possess with intent to distribute a "detectable amount" of cocaine and cocaine base. The superseding
indictment did not allege any of the threshold levels of drug
quantity that lead to enhanced penalties under $ 841(b).

In accord with the superseding indictment, the District
Court instructed the jury that "as long as you find that a
defendant conspired to distribute or posses[s] with intent
to distribute these controlled substances, the amounts involved are not important." App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a (emphasis deleted). The jury found respondents guilty.

Congress established "a term of imprisonment of not more
than 20 years" for drug offenses involving a detectable quantity of cocaine or cocaine base. $ 841(b)(1)(C). But the District Court did not sentence respondents under this provision. Consistent with the practice in federal courts at
the time, at sentencing the District Court made a finding
of drug quantity that implicated the enhanced penalties of

$ 841(b)(1)(A), which prescribes "a term of imprisonment
which may not be . . . more than life" for drug offenses
involving at least 50 grams of cocaine base. The District
Court found, based on the trial testimony, respondent
Hall responsible for at least 500 grams of cocaine base,
and the other respondents responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. The court sentenced respondents
Hall and Powell to 30 years' imprisonment and the other respondents to life imprisonment. Respondents did not object
in the District Court to the fact that these sentences were
based on an amount of drug quantity not alleged in the
indictment.

While respondents' appeal was pending in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, we decided
Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra. Respondents then argued
in the Court of Appeals that their sentences were invalid
under Apprendi, because the issue of drug quantity was
neither alleged in the indictment nor submitted to the petit

Opinion of the Court
jury. The Court of Appeals noted that respondents "failed
to raise this argument before the district court" and thus
reviewed the argument for plain error. 261 F. 3d, at 403
(citing Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b)). A divided court nonetheless vacated respondents' sentences on the ground that
"because an indictment setting forth all the essential elements of an offense is both mandatory and jurisdictional, . . .
a court is without jurisdiction to . . . impose a sentence for
an offense not charged in the indictment." 261 F. 3d, at 404-
405 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such an error, the
Court of Appeals concluded, "seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings."
Id., at 406. We granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 1074 (2002), and
now reverse.

We first address the Court of Appeals' conclusion that
the omission from the indictment was a "jurisdictional"
defect and thus required vacating respondents' sentences.
Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1 (1887), is the progenitor of this
view. In Bain, the indictment charged that Bain, the cashier and director of a bank, made false statements "with intent to deceive the Comptroller of the Currency and the
agent appointed to examine the affairs" of the bank. Id.,
at 4. Before trial, the court struck the words "the Comptroller of the Currency and," on the ground that they were
superfluous. The jury found Bain guilty. Id., at 4-5. Bain
challenged the amendment to the indictment in a petition
for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court concluded that the
amendment was improper and that therefore "the jurisdiction of the offence [was] gone, and the court [had] no right
to proceed any further in the progress of the case for want
of an indictment." Id., at 13.

Bain, however, is a product of an era in which this Court's
authority to review criminal convictions was greatly circumscribed. At the time it was decided, a defendant could not
obtain direct review of his criminal conviction in the Su535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

America 244-246 (1939). The Court's authority to issue awrit of habeas corpus was limited to cases in which the
convicting "court had no jurisdiction to render the judg-ment which it gave." Bain, supra, at 3; see also Preiser v.
Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 485 (1973). In 1887, therefore, thisCourt could examine constitutional errors in a criminal trial
only on a writ of habeas corpus, and only then if it deemedthe error "jurisdictional." The Court's desire to correct
obvious constitutional violations led to a "somewhat expan-sive notion of `jurisdiction,' "

Custis v. United States, 511U. S. 485, 494 (1994), which was "more a fiction than anything

else," Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 79 (1977).Bain's elastic concept of jurisdiction is not what the term
"jurisdiction" means today, i. e., "the courts' statutory orconstitutional power to adjudicate the case." Steel Co. v.
Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998).This latter concept of subject-matter jurisdiction, because
it involves a court's power to hear a case, can never be for-feited or waived. Consequently, defects in subject-matter
jurisdiction require correction regardless of whether theerror was raised in district court. See,

e. g., Louisville &Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149 (1908). In contrast, the grand jury right can be waived. See Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 7(b); Smith v. United States, 360 U. S. 1, 6 (1959).

Post-Bain cases confirm that defects in an indictmentdo not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case. In
Lamar v. United States, 240 U. S. 60 (1916), the Court re-jected the claim that "the court had no jurisdiction because
the indictment does not charge a crime against the UnitedStates."

Id., at 64. Justice Holmes explained that a dis1 In 1889, Congress authorized direct review of capital cases in the

(1951), held that a ruling "that the indictment is defective
does not affect the jurisdiction of the trial court to determine
the case presented by the indictment."

Thus, this Court some time ago departed from Bain's view
that indictment defects are "jurisdictional." Bain has been
cited in later cases such as Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S.
212 (1960), and Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749 (1962),
for the proposition that "an indictment may not be amended
except by resubmission to the grand jury, unless the change
is merely a matter of form," id., at 770 (citing Bain, supra).
But in each of these cases proper objection had been made
in the District Court to the sufficiency of the indictment.
We need not retreat from this settled proposition of law decided in Bain to say that the analysis of that issue in terms
of "jurisdiction" was mistaken in the light of later cases
such as Lamar and Williams. Insofar as it held that a defective indictment deprives a court of jurisdiction, Bain is
overruled.

Freed from the view that indictment omissions deprive a
court of jurisdiction, we proceed to apply the plain-error test
of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) to respondents'
forfeited claim. See United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725,
731 (1993). "Under that test, before an appellate court can
correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) `error,'
(2) that is `plain,' and (3) that `affect[s] substantial rights.' "
Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 466-467 (1997) (quoting Olano, supra, at 732). "If all three conditions are met,
an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice
a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error "seriously affect[s]

Opinion of the Court
ceedings." 520 U. S., at 467 (internal quotation marks omit-ted) (quoting

Olano, supra, at 732).
The Government concedes that the indictment's failureto allege a fact, drug quantity, that increased the statutory maximum sentence rendered respondents' enhancedsentences erroneous under the reasoning of

Apprendi and
Jones. The Government also concedes that such error was
plain. See Johnson, supra, at 468 ("[W]here the law atthe time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the

law at the time of appeal[,] it is enough that an error be`plain' at the time of appellate consideration").

The third inquiry is whether the plain error "affect[ed]substantial rights." This usually means that the error
"must have affected the outcome of the district court pro-ceedings."

Olano, supra, at 734. Respondents argue that
an indictment error falls within the "limited class" of "struc-tural errors,"

Johnson, supra, at 468-469, that "can be corrected regardless of their effect on the outcome," Olano,
supra, at 735. Respondents cite Silber v. United States, 370
U. S. 717 (1962) (per curiam), and Stirone v. United States,
supra, in support of this position.2 The Government counters by noting that Johnson's list of structural errors did not
include Stirone or Silber, see 520 U. S., at 468-469, and that
the defendants in both of these cases preserved their claims
at trial.

As in Johnson (see id., at 469), we need not resolve
whether respondents satisfy this element of the plain-error
inquiry, because even assuming respondents' substantial
rights were affected, the error did not seriously affect the

2 Respondents also argue that even if the indictment defect is not structural error, it did affect their substantial rights because they were sentenced to more than the 20-year maximum that $ 841(b) authorizes without
regard to drug quantity. The Government responds that the defendants
had notice that their sentences could exceed 20 years, and that the grand
jury would have found that the conspiracy involved at least 50 grams of
cocaine base had the Government sought such an allegation.

Opinion of the Court
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed-ings. The error in Johnson was the District Court's failure

to submit an element of the false statement offense, material-ity, to the petit jury. The evidence of materiality, however,
was "overwhelming" and "essentially uncontroverted." Id.,at 470. We thus held that there was "no basis for concluding that the error `seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrityor public reputation of judicial proceedings.' "

Ibid.The same analysis applies in this case to the omission of

drug quantity from the indictment. The evidence that theconspiracy involved at least 50 grams of cocaine base was
"overwhelming" and "essentially uncontroverted." 3 Muchof the evidence implicating respondents in the drug conspiracy revealed the conspiracy's involvement with far morethan 50 grams of cocaine base. Baltimore police officers
made numerous state arrests and seizures between February1996 and April 1997 that resulted in the seizure of 795 ziplock bags and clear bags containing approximately 380 grams
of cocaine base. 20 Record 179-244. A federal search ofrespondent Jovan Powell's residence resulted in the seizure of 51.3 grams of cocaine base. 32 id., at 18-30. A co-operating co-conspirator testified at trial that he witnessed
respondent Hall cook one-quarter of a kilogram of cocainepowder into cocaine base. 22

id., at 208. Another cooperating co-conspirator testified at trial that she was present in ahotel room where the drug operation bagged one kilogram

of cocaine base into ziplock bags. 27 id., at 107-108. Surelythe grand jury, having found that the conspiracy existed,
would have also found that the conspiracy involved at least50 grams of cocaine base.

3 Respondents challenged the presentence reports' assignment of a base
offense level of 38, which is applicable to 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine
base. But they never argued that the conspiracy involved less than
50 grams of cocaine base, which is the relevant quantity for purposes of
Apprendi, as that is the threshold quantity for the penalty of life imprisonment in 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(A).

634 UNITED STATES v. COTTON

Opinion of the Court
Respondents emphasize that the Fifth Amendment grandjury right serves a vital function in providing for a body

of citizens that acts as a check on prosecutorial power.No doubt that is true. See, e. g., 3 Story, Commentaries on
the Constitution $ 1779 (1883), reprinted in 5 The Founders'Constitution 295 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987). But
that is surely no less true of the Sixth Amendment right toa petit jury, which, unlike the grand jury, must find guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt. The important role of the petitjury did not, however, prevent us in

Johnson from applyingthe longstanding rule "that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to maketimely assertion of the right . . . ." Yakus v. United States,
321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944).In providing for graduated penalties in 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b),
Congress intended that defendants, like respondents, in-volved in large-scale drug operations receive more severe
punishment than those committing drug offenses involv-ing lesser quantities. Indeed, the fairness and integrity of
the criminal justice system depends on meting out to thoseinflicting the greatest harm on society the most severe punishments. The real threat then to the "fairness, integrity,and public reputation of judicial proceedings" would be if
respondents, despite the overwhelming and uncontrovertedevidence that they were involved in a vast drug conspiracy,
were to receive a sentence prescribed for those committingless substantial drug offenses because of an error that was
never objected to at trial. Cf. Johnson, supra, at 470 (quot-ing R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970)).

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

VERIZON MARYLAND INC. v. PUBLIC SERVICECOMMISSION OF MARYLAND

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 00-1531. Argued December 5, 2001--Decided May 20, 2002*
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act) requires that incumbent localexchange carriers (LECs) "provide . . . interconnection with" their existing networks when a new entrant seeks access to a market, 47 U. S. C.

$ 251(c)(2); that the carriers then establish "reciprocal compensation
arrangements" for transporting and terminating the calls of each
others' customers, $ 251(b)(5); and that their interconnection agreements
be submitted to a state utility commission for approval, $ 252(e)(1).
Petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., the incumbent LEC in Maryland, negotiated an interconnection agreement with a competitor later acquired
by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc. After the Maryland Public Service
Commission (Commission) approved the agreement, Verizon informed
WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for
calls made by Verizon's customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) because ISP traffic was not "local traffic"
subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement. WorldCom filed a
complaint with the Commission, which ordered Verizon to make the
payments for past and future ISP-bound calls. Verizon then filed an
action in Federal District Court, citing $ 252(e)(6) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1331
as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, and
other competing LECs. Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that
the order was unlawful and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement,
alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and a Federal Communications Commission ruling. The District Court dismissed the action.
The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Commission had not
waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit; that the doctrine
of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, does not permit suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacities; and that neither

$ 252(e)(6) nor $ 1331 provides a basis for jurisdiction over Verizon's
claims against the private defendants.

*Together with No. 00-1711, United States v. Public Service Commission of Maryland et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

Syllabus
Held:

1. Section 1331 provides a basis for jurisdiction over Verizon's claim
that the Commission's order requiring reciprocal compensation for ISPbound calls is pre-empted by federal law. Federal courts have jurisdiction under $ 1331 where the petitioner's right to recover will be
sustained if federal law is given one construction and will be defeated
if it is given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely to obtain jurisdiction, or is wholly insubstantial
and frivolous. Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.
83, 89. Here, resolution of Verizon's claim turns on whether the Act,
or an FCC ruling, precludes the Commission from ordering payment
of reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that the claim
is immaterial or insubstantial and frivolous. Even if $ 252(e)(6) (which
provides that a party aggrieved by a state commission's determination
under $ 252 may bring a federal action to determine whether an interconnection agreement meets the requirements of $$ 251 and 252) does
not confer jurisdiction, it does not divest the district courts of their
authority under $ 1331. Cf. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S.
136, 141. Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism
for the commission actions that it covers, and it does not distinctively
limit the substantive relief available. Finally, none of the Act's other
provisions evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commission
determination. Pp. 641-644.

2. The doctrine of Ex parte Young permits Verizon's suit to go forward against the state commissioners in their official capacities. The
Court thus need not decide whether the Commission waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory regime
established by the Act. In determining whether the Ex parte Young
doctrine avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only
conduct a "straightforward inquiry" into whether the complaint alleges
an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective. Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.
261, 296, 298-299. Here, Verizon's prayer for injunctive relief--that
state officials be restrained from enforcing an order in contravention of
controlling federal law--clearly satisfies our "straightforward inquiry."
As for Verizon's prayer for declaratory relief, even though Verizon seeks
a declaration of the past, as well as the future, ineffectiveness of the
Commission's action, so that the private parties' past financial liability
may be affected, no past liability of the State, or of any of its commissioners, is at issue, see Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 668. The
Fourth Circuit's suggestion that the doctrine of Ex parte Young is inapplicable because the Commission's order was probably not inconsistent with federal law is unavailing: The inquiry into whether suit lies

under Ex parte Young does not include an analysis of the merits of the
claim, see Coeur d'Alene, supra, at 281. Nor is there any merit to the
Commission's argument that $ 252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one held in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.
Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 75, to implicitly exclude Ex parte Young actions.

638 VERIZON MD. INC. v. PUBLIC SERV. COMM'N OF MD.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
These cases present the question whether federal districtcourts have jurisdiction over a telecommunication carrier's

claim that the order of a state utility commission requir-ing reciprocal compensation for telephone calls to Internet
Service Providers violates federal law.

I
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act or Act),Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, created a new telecommunications regime designed to foster competition in local tele-phone markets. Toward that end, the Act imposed various
obligations on incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs),including a duty to share their networks with competitors.
See 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c) (1994 ed., Supp. V). When a new en-trant seeks access to a market, the incumbent LEC must
"provide . . . interconnection with" the incumbent's existingnetwork, $ 251(c)(2), and the carriers must then establish
"reciprocal compensation arrangements" for transportingand terminating the calls placed by each others' customers,

$ 251(b)(5). As we have previously described, see AT&TCorp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 371-373 (1999),
an incumbent LEC "may negotiate and enter into a bind-ing agreement" with the new entrant "to fulfill the duties" imposed by $$ 251(b) and (c), but "without regard tothe standards set forth" in those provisions. $$ 252(a)(1),

Chambliss.

Opinion of the Court
251(c)(1). That agreement must be submitted to the statecommission for approval, $ 252(e)(1), which may reject it if it

discriminates against a carrier not a party or is not consist-ent with "the public interest, convenience, and necessity,"

$ 252(e)(2)(A).As required by the Act, the incumbent LEC in Maryland,
petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., formerly known as BellAtlantic Maryland, Inc., negotiated an interconnection agreement with competitors, including MFS Intelenet of Mary-land, later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.
The Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) ap-proved the agreement. Six months later, Verizon informed
WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compen-sation for telephone calls made by Verizon's customers to the
local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs),claiming that ISP traffic was not "local traffic"

1 subject to

the reciprocal compensation agreement because ISPs con-nect customers to distant Web sites. WorldCom disputed

Verizon's claim and filed a complaint with the Commission.The Commission found in favor of WorldCom, ordering
Verizon "to timely forward all future interconnection pay-ments owed [WorldCom] for telephone calls placed to an
ISP" and to pay WorldCom any reciprocal compensationthat it had withheld pending resolution of the dispute. Verizon appealed to a Maryland state court, which affirmed theorder.

1 Section 1.61 of the interconnection agreement provides: " `Reciprocal
Compensation' is As Described in the Act, and refers to the payment
arrangements that recover costs incurred for the transport and termination of Local Traffic originating on one Party's network and terminating
on the other Party's network." In turn, $ 1.44 defines " `Local Traffic' "
as "traffic that is originated by a Customer of one Party on that Party's
network and terminates to a Customer of the other Party on that other
Party's network, within a given local calling area, or expanded area service (`EAS') area, as defined in [Bell Atlantic's] effective Customer tariffs.
Local Traffic does not include traffic originated or terminated by a commercial mobile radio service carrier."

640 VERIZON MD. INC. v. PUBLIC SERV. COMM'N OF MD.

Opinion of the Court
Subsequently, the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) issued a ruling--later vacated by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, see Bell Atlantic
Tel. Cos. v. FCC, 206 F. 3d 1 (2000)--which categorized ISPbound calls as nonlocal for purposes of reciprocal compen-sation but concluded that, absent a federal compensation

mechanism for those calls, state commissions could construe
interconnection agreements as requiring reciprocal compen-sation. Verizon filed a new complaint with the Commission,

arguing that the FCC ruling established that Verizon wasno longer required to provide reciprocal compensation for
ISP traffic. In a 3-to-2 decision, the Commission rejected
this contention, concluding that, as a matter of state contract
law, WorldCom and Verizon had agreed to treat ISP-bound
calls as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.

Verizon filed an action in the United States District Court
for the District of Maryland, citing 47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) and
28 U. S. C. $ 1331 as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as
defendants the Commission, its individual members in their
official capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.
In its complaint, Verizon sought declaratory and injunctive
relief from the Commission's order, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation
to WorldCom for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and the
FCC ruling.

The District Court dismissed the action, and a divided
panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 240 F. 3d 279 (2001). The Fourth Circuit held that
the Commission had not waived its immunity from suit by
voluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme set up
under the 1996 Act, and that the doctrine of Ex parte Young,
209 U. S. 123 (1908), does not permit suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacities. It then held
that neither 47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) nor 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 provides a basis for jurisdiction over Verizon's claims against
the private defendants. Both Verizon and the United

States, an intervenor below, petitioned this Court for re-view of the four questions resolved by the Fourth Circuit.

Because we had previously granted certiorari in Mathias v.WorldCom Technologies, Inc., 532 U. S. 903 (2001), which
raised all but the question whether $ 1331 provides a basisfor jurisdiction, we granted certiorari only on the $ 1331
question and set the case for oral argument in tandem with
Mathias. 533 U. S. 928 (2001). After oral argument, forreasons explained in our decision in Mathias released today,

WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States contend that47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 independently

grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction to deter-mine whether the Commission's order requiring that Verizon pay WorldCom reciprocal compensation for ISP-boundcalls violates the 1996 Act. Section 252 sets forth procedures relating to formation and commission approval ofinterconnection agreements, and commission approval and
continuing review of interconnection terms and conditions(called "[s]tatements of generally available terms," $ 252(f))
filed by LECs. Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part:"In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by suchdetermination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal
district court to determine whether the agreement or state-ment meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and
this section." The determination at issue here is neither theapproval or disapproval of a negotiated agreement nor the
approval or disapproval of a statement of generally availableterms. WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States argue,
however, that a state commission's authority under $ 252 im-plicitly encompasses the authority to interpret and enforce
an interconnection agreement that the commission has ap535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
proved,2 and that an interpretation or enforcement decision
is therefore a "determination under [$ 252]" subject to federal review. Whether the text of $ 252(e)(6) can be so construed is a question we need not decide. For we agree with
the parties' alternative contention, that even if $ 252(e)(6)
does not confer jurisdiction, it at least does not divest the
district courts of their authority under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 to
review the Commission's order for compliance with federal
law.

Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered payment
of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls. Verizon
sought a declaratory judgment that the Commission's order
was unlawful, and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement. We have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under $ 1331 to entertain such a suit. Verizon seeks
relief from the Commission's order "on the ground that
such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by
virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must
prevail," and its claim "thus presents a federal question
which the federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1331 to resolve." Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S.
85, 96, n. 14 (1983).

The Commission contends that since the Act does not
create a private cause of action to challenge the Commission's order, there is no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.
We need express no opinion on the premise of this argument.
"It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a

fact federal or state law that confers this authority, but no party contends that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to interpret and enforce
the agreement.

Opinion of the Court
valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not im-plicate subject-matter jurisdiction,

i. e., the courts' statutory
or constitutional power to adjudicate the case." Steel Co. v.
Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998).
As we have said, "the district court has jurisdiction if `theright of the petitioners to recover under their complaint

will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United
States are given one construction and will be defeated ifthey are given another,' unless the claim `clearly appears

to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of ob-taining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous. ' " Ib id. (citations omitted).
Here, resolution of Verizon's claim turns on whether the Act,
or an FCC ruling issued thereunder, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, and
there is no suggestion that Verizon's claim is " `immaterial' "
or " `wholly insubstantial and frivolous.' " Ibid.

Verizon's claim thus falls within 28 U. S. C. $ 1331's
general grant of jurisdiction, and contrary to the Fourth
Circuit's conclusion, nothing in 47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) purports to strip this jurisdiction. Section 252(e)(6) provides
for federal review of an agreement when a state commission
"makes a determination under [$ 252]." If this does not include (as WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States claim it
does) the interpretation or enforcement of an interconnection
agreement, then $ 252(e)(6) merely makes some other actions
by state commissions reviewable in federal court. This is
not enough to eliminate jurisdiction under $ 1331. Although
the situation is not precisely parallel (in that here the elimination of federal district-court review would not amount
to the elimination of all review), we think what we said in
Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 141 (1967), is
nonetheless apt: "The mere fact that some acts are made
reviewable should not suffice to support an implication of
exclusion as to others." (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.) And here there is nothing more than that

mere fact. Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers
(the mechanism is the same as $ 1331: district-court review),
and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available. Cf. United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 448-449
(1988). Indeed, it does not even mention subject-matter
jurisdiction, but reads like the conferral of a private right of
action ("[A]ny party aggrieved by such determination may
bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court,"

$ 252(e)(6)). Cf. Steel Co., supra, at 90-91 (even a statutory
provision that uses the word "jurisdiction" may not relate to
"subject-matter jurisdiction"); see also Davis v. Passman,
442 U. S. 228, 239, n. 18 (1979).

And finally, none of the other provisions of the Act evince
any intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination. If anything, they reinforce the conclusion that

$ 252(e)(6)'s silence on the subject leaves the jurisdictional
grant of $ 1331 untouched. For where otherwise applicable
jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly. Section 252(e)(4) provides: "No State court shall
have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission
in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section."
In sum, nothing in the Act displays any intent to withdraw
federal jurisdiction under $ 1331; we will not presume that
the statute means what it neither says nor fairly implies.3

3 The Commission also suggests that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine precludes a federal district court from exercising jurisdiction over Verizon's
claim. See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S.
462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923). The
Rooker-Feldman doctrine merely recognizes that 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 is a
grant of original jurisdiction, and does not authorize district courts to
exercise appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, which Congress has reserved to this Court, see $ 1257(a). The doctrine has no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinations
made by a state administrative agency.

Opinion of the Court

III
The Commission nonetheless contends that the EleventhAmendment bars Verizon's claim against it and its individual

commissioners. WorldCom, Verizon, and the United Statescounter that the Commission is subject to suit because it
voluntarily participated in the regulatory regime establishedby the Act. Whether the Commission waived its immunity
is another question we need not decide, because--as thesame parties also argue--even absent waiver, Verizon may
proceed against the individual commissioners in their officialcapacities, pursuant to the doctrine of

Ex parte Young, 209U. S. 123 (1908).

In determining whether the doctrine of Ex parte Youngavoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need
only conduct a "straightforward inquiry into whether [the]complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and
seeks relief properly characterized as prospective." Idahov.

Souter, J., joined by Stevens, Ginsburg, and

requiring payment of reciprocal compensation was pre-empted by the 1996 Act and an FCC ruling. The prayer
for injunctive relief--that state officials be restrained from
enforcing an order in contravention of controlling federallaw--clearly satisfies our "straightforward inquiry." We

have approved injunction suits against state regulatory com-missioners in like contexts. See,

e. g., Prentis v. Atlantic
Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210, 230 (1908) ("[W]hen the rate isfixed a bill against the commission to restrain the members

Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466 (1898); Reagan v. Farmers'
Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362 (1894). Indeed, Ex parte
Young itself was a suit against state officials (including state
utility commissioners, though only the state attorney gen-eral appealed) to enjoin enforcement of a railroad commission's order requiring a reduction in rates. 209 U. S., at 129.
As for Verizon's prayer for declaratory relief: That, to besure, seeks a declaration of the

past, as well as the future,
ineffectiveness of the Commission's action, so that the pastfinancial liability of private parties may be affected. But

no past liability of the State, or of any of its commissioners,
is at issue. It does not impose upon the State "a monetary
loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part
of the defendant state officials." Edelman v. Jordan, 415
U. S. 651, 668 (1974). Insofar as the exposure of the State
is concerned, the prayer for declaratory relief adds nothing
to the prayer for injunction.

The Fourth Circuit suggested that Verizon's claim could
not be brought under Ex parte Young, because the Commission's order was probably not inconsistent with federal
law after all. 240 F. 3d, at 295-297. The court noted that
the FCC ruling relied upon by Verizon does not seem to
require compensation for ISP traffic; that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has vacated the
ruling; and that the Commission interpreted the interconnection agreement under state contract-law principles. It may
(or may not) be true that the FCC's since-vacated ruling does
not support Verizon's claim; it may (or may not) also be true
that state contract law, and not federal law as Verizon contends, applies to disputes regarding the interpretation of
Verizon's agreement. But the inquiry into whether suit lies
under Ex parte Young does not include an analysis of the
merits of the claim. See Coeur d'Alene, supra, at 281 ("An
allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law . . . is ordinarily sufficient" (emphasis added)).

Opinion of the Court
Nor does the 1996 Act display any intent to foreclose juris-diction under

Ex parte Young--as we concluded the Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act did in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.
Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). There an Indian Tribe sued
the State of Florida for violating a duty to negotiate imposedunder that Act, 25 U. S. C. $ 2710(d)(3). Congress had specified the means to enforce that duty in $ 2710(d)(7), a provision "intended . . . not only to define, but also to limit signifi-cantly, the duty imposed by $ 2710(d)(3)." 517 U. S., at 74.

The "intricate procedures set forth in that provision" pre-scribed that a court could issue an order directing the State
to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to
mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the
Interior be notified. Id., at 74-75. We concluded that
"this quite modest set of sanctions" displayed an intent not
to provide the "more complete and more immediate relief "
that would otherwise be available under Ex parte Young.
517 U. S., at 75. Permitting suit under Ex parte Young
was thus inconsistent with the "detailed remedial scheme,"
517 U. S., at 74--and the limited one--that Congress had
prescribed to enforce the State's statutory duty to negotiate.
The Commission's argument that $ 252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one in Seminole Tribe, implicitly excluding Ex parte Young actions, is
without merit. That section provides only that when state
commissions make certain "determinations," an aggrieved
party may bring suit in federal court to establish compliance with the requirements of $$ 251 and 252. Even with
regard to the "determinations" that it covers, it places no
restriction on the relief a court can award. And it does not
even say whom the suit is to be brought against--the state
commission, the individual commissioners, or the carriers
benefiting from the state commission's order. The mere
fact that Congress has authorized federal courts to review
whether the Commission's action complies with $$ 251 and
252 does not without more "impose upon the State a liabil535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

We conclude that 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 provides a basis forjurisdiction over Verizon's claim that the Commission's order

requiring reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls ispre-empted by federal law. We also conclude that the doctrine of Ex parte Young permits Verizon's suit to go forwardagainst the state commissioners in their official capacities.
We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re-mand these cases for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration ordecision of these cases.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
For the reasons well stated by the Court, I agree VerizonMaryland Inc. may proceed against the state commissioners in their official capacity under the doctrine of Ex parteYoung, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). When the plaintiff seeks to
enjoin a state utility commissioner from enforcing an orderalleged to violate federal law, the Eleventh Amendment
poses no bar. See Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho,521 U. S. 261, 271 (1997) (principal opinion of

Kennedy, J.,joined by
Rehnquist, C. J.).This is unlike the case in

Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe ofIdaho, supra, where the plaintiffs tried to use Ex parte

Young to divest a State of sovereignty over territory withinits boundaries. In such a case, a " `straightforward inquiry,' "
which the Court endorses here, ante, at 645, proves morecomplex. In Coeur d'Alene seven Members of this Court
described Ex parte Young as requiring nothing more thanan allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law and a

request for prospective relief; they divided four to three,
however, over whether that deceptively simple test had
been met.

In my view, our Ex parte Young jurisprudence requires
careful consideration of the sovereign interests of the State
as well as the obligations of state officials to respect the
supremacy of federal law. See Coeur d'Alene, supra, at
267-280 (principal opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.). I believe this approach, whether stated in
express terms or not, is the path followed in Coeur d'Alene
as well as in the many cases preceding it. I also believe
it necessary. Were it otherwise, the Eleventh Amendment,
and not Ex parte Young, would become the legal fiction.

The complaint in this litigation, however, parallels the
very suit permitted by Ex parte Young itself. With this
brief explanation, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion, Part III of which rests on a
ground all of us can agree upon: 1 on the assumption of an
Eleventh Amendment 2 bar, relief is available under the
doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). Although
that assumption apparently has been made from the start of
the litigation, I think it is open to some doubt and so write
separately to question whether these cases even implicate
the Eleventh Amendment.

1 In so doing, I set aside for the moment my continuing conviction
that the interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment that a majority of
this Court has embraced is fundamentally mistaken. See Alden v. Maine,
527 U. S. 706, 760 (1999) (dissenting opinion); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.
Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 100 (1996) (dissenting opinion).

Souter, J., concurring
While the State of Maryland is the named defendant, itis only a nominal one. Verizon Maryland Inc., the private

party "suing" it, does not seek money damages, or the sortof declaratory or injunctive relief that could be had against
a private litigant.3 Nor does Verizon seek an order enjoin-ing the State from enforcing purely state-law rate orders of
dubious constitutionality, the relief requested in Ex parte
Young itself, id., at 129-131. Instead, Verizon claims thatthe Maryland Public Service Commission has wrongly decided a question of federal law 4 under a decisional powerconferred by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act), a
power that no person may wield. Verizon accordingly seeksnot a simple order of relief running against the state commission, but a different adjudication of a federal question

3 Cf. e. g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356,
360 (2001) (money damages from the State as employer under Title I of
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of
Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 66 (2000) (money damages from the State as employer under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967); Alden
v. Maine, supra, at 712 (money damages from the State as employer
under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 in state court); Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S.
627, 633 (1999) (money damages and injunctive and declaratory relief

Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 671 (1999) (same
for trademark violations); Seminole Tribe, supra, at 47 (suit to compel
State to negotiate in good faith); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890)
(money damages for failure to honor state securities). In Seminole Tribe,
a majority of this Court observed "that the relief sought by a plaintiff
suing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit is barred by
the Eleventh Amendment," 517 U. S., at 58, but this was said in the
context of a suit for injunctive relief (to enforce a duty to negotiate) as
opposed to money damages. My point is that conventional relief of both
sorts (and declaratory relief) is different in kind from the judicial review
of agency action sought in these cases.

4 Whether the interpretation of a reciprocal-compensation provision

in a privately negotiated interconnection agreement presents a federal
issue is a different question which neither the Court nor I address at the
present.

by means of appellate review in Federal District Court,5whose jurisdiction to entertain the claim of error the Court

today has affirmed. If the District Court should see thingsVerizon's way and reverse the state commission qua federal
regulator, what dishonor would be done to the dignity of theState, which has accepted congressionally conferred power
to decide matters of federal law in the first instance?One answer might be that even naming the state commission as a defendant in a suit for declaratory and injunc-tive relief in federal court is an unconstitutional indignity.
But I do not see how this could be right. At least wherethe suit does not seek to bar a state authority from applying and enforcing state law, a request for declaratory or in-junctive relief is simply a formality for obtaining a process
of review. Cf. 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 206(2d ed. 1983) ("[T]he suit for injunction and declaratory judgment in a district court under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 . . . is nowalways available to reach reviewable [federal] administrative
action in absence of a specific statute making some otherremedy exclusive"). And as for the nominal position of a
State as defendant, "[i]t must be regarded as a settled doc-trine of this court . . . `that the question whether a suit
is within the prohibition of the 11th Amendment is notalways determined by reference to the nominal parties on
the record.' " In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 487 (1887) (altera-tion in original) (quoting Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U. S.
270, 287 (1885)). If the applicability of the Eleventh Amend-ment pivots on the formalism that a State is found on the
wrong side of the "v." in the case name of a regulatory ap-peal, constitutional immunity becomes nothing more than an
accident of captioning practice in utility cases reviewed bycourts. For that matter, the formal and nominal position
of a governmental body in these circumstances is not even

the universal practice. While the regulatory commission isgenerally a nominal defendant when a party appeals in the

federal system,6 this is not the uniform practice amongthe States, several of which caption utility cases on judicial
review in terms of the appealing utility.7The only credible response, which Maryland to its credit
advances, is that the State has a strong interest in any casewhere its adjudication of a federal question is challenged.

See Supplemental Brief for Respondents MCI WorldCom,Inc., et al. 21-24. An adverse ruling in one appeal can no

doubt affect the state commission's ruling in future cases.But this is true any time a state court decides a federal question and a successful appeal is made to this Court, and noone thinks that the Eleventh Amendment applies in that instance. See Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 412 (1821) (awrit of error from a state-court decision is not a "suit" under

8 The Fourth Circuit obliquely questioned the strength of the State's

interest, noting that "under Maryland law, it is not necessary for the State
commission, much less the individual commissioners, to be a party to an
appeal for State-court review of its determinations." Bell Atlantic Md.,
Inc. v. MCI Worldcom, Inc., 240 F. 3d 279, 295 (2001). But while the
Maryland statute which the Fourth Circuit cited, Md. Pub. Util. Cos. Code
Ann. $ 3-204(d) (1998), does provide that "[t]he Commission may," not
must, "be a party to an appeal," the Maryland courts have specified that
the Public Service Commission is one of certain agencies " `the functions
of which are so identified with the execution of some definite public policy
as the representative of the State, that their participation in litigation
affecting their decisions is regarded by the Legislature as essential to the
adequate protection of the State's interests.' " Calvert County Planning

9 Whether an issue comes from a stateagency or a state-court decision, the federal court is review-ing the State's determination of a question of federal law,

and it is neither prudent nor natural to see such review asimpugning the dignity of the State or implicating the States'
sovereign immunity in the federal system.

9 A possible ground for distinction is that the Supreme Court reviews
state-court decisions while a federal district court initially reviews statecommission decisions under the Act. The argument would be that the
Constitution requires any controversy in which a State's dignitary interests are implicated to be decided by this Court, and no other federal court,
as a sign of respect for the State's sovereignty. See Farquhar v. Georgia

ALABAMA v. SHELTON
certiorari to the supreme court of alabama
No. 00-1214. Argued February 19, 2002--Decided May 20, 2002
Defendant-respondent Shelton represented himself in an Alabama Circuit

Court criminal trial. The court repeatedly warned Shelton about the
problems self-representation entailed, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state expense. He was convicted of misdemeanor
assault and sentenced to a 30-day jail term, which the trial court immediately suspended, placing Shelton on two years' unsupervised probation. The Alabama Supreme Court reversed Shelton's suspended jail
sentence, reasoning that this Court's decisions in Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, and Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367, require provision of
counsel in any petty offense, misdemeanor, or felony prosecution, Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37, "that actually leads to imprisonment even for a
brief period," id., at 33. The State Supreme Court concluded, inter
alia, that because a defendant may not be imprisoned absent provision
of counsel, Shelton's suspended sentence could never be activated and
was therefore invalid.

Held: A suspended sentence that may "end up in the actual deprivation

of a person's liberty" may not be imposed unless the defendant was
accorded "the guiding hand of counsel" in the prosecution for the crime
charged. Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 40. Pp. 660-674.

(a) The controlling rule is that "absent a knowing and intelligent
waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense . . . unless he was
represented by counsel at his trial." Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37.
Pp. 661-662.

(b) Applying this "actual imprisonment" rule, the Court rejects the
argument of its invited amicus curiae that failure to appoint counsel to
an indigent defendant does not bar the imposition of a suspended or
probationary sentence upon conviction of a misdemeanor, even though
the defendant might be incarcerated in the event probation is revoked.
Pp. 662-672.

(1) The Sixth Amendment does not permit activation of a suspended sentence upon an indigent defendant's violation of the terms of
his probation where the State did not provide him counsel during the
prosecution of the offense for which he is imprisoned. A suspended
sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction. Once
the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the
probation violation, but for the underlying offense. The uncounseled

Syllabus
conviction at that point "result[s] in imprisonment," Nichols v. United
States, 511 U. S. 738, 746; it "end[s] up in the actual deprivation of a
person's liberty," Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 40. This is precisely what
the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in Argersinger and Scott, does not
allow. P. 662.

(2) The Court rejects the first of two grounds on which amicus
resists this reasoning, i. e., amicus' attempt to align this case with Nichols and with Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778. Those decisions do
not stand for the broad proposition that sequential proceedings must be
analyzed separately for Sixth Amendment purposes, with the right to
state-appointed counsel triggered only in proceedings that result in

immediate actual imprisonment. The dispositive factor in Gagnon and
Nichols was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or only
after some delay. Rather, the critical point was that the defendant had
a recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony for
which he was imprisoned. See Nichols, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9. Here,
revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel,
not for a felony conviction for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.
See id., at 747; Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 789. Far from supporting amicus'
position, Gagnon and Nichols simply highlight that the Sixth Amendment inquiry trains on the stage of the proceedings corresponding to
Shelton's Circuit Court trial, where his guilt was adjudicated, eligibility
for imprisonment established, and prison sentence determined. Nichols is further distinguishable because the Court there applied a less
exacting standard allowing a trial court, once guilt has been established,
to increase the defendant's sentence based simply on evidence of the
underlying conduct that gave rise to his previous conviction, 511 U. S.,
at 748, even if he had never been charged with that conduct, Williams
v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, and even if he had been acquitted of a misdemeanor with the aid of appointed counsel, United States v. Watts, 519
U. S. 148, 157. That relaxed standard has no application here, where
the question is whether the defendant may be jailed absent a conviction credited as reliable because the defendant had access to counsel.
Pp. 662-665.

(3) Also unpersuasive is amicus' contention that practical considerations weigh against extension of the Sixth Amendment appointedcounsel right to a defendant in Shelton's situation. Based on figures
suggesting that conditional sentences are commonly imposed but rarely
activated, amicus argues that the appropriate rule would permit imposition of a suspended sentence on an uncounseled defendant and require
appointment of counsel, if at all, only at the probation revocation stage,
when incarceration is imminent. That regime would unduly reduce the

656 ALABAMA v. SHELTON

Syllabus
Sixth Amendment's domain. In Alabama, the probation revocation
hearing is an informal proceeding, at which the defendant has no right
to counsel, and the court no obligation to observe customary rules of
evidence. More significant, the defendant may not challenge the validity or reliability of the underlying conviction. A hearing so timed and
structured cannot compensate for the absence of trial counsel and
thereby bring Shelton's sentence within constitutional bounds. Nor
does this Court agree with amicus that its holding will substantially
limit the States' ability to impose probation. Most jurisdictions already
provide a state-law right to appointed counsel more generous than that
afforded by the Federal Constitution, while simultaneously preserving
the option of probationary punishment. See 511 U. S., at 748-749, n. 12.
Even if amicus is correct that some States cannot afford the costs of the
Court's rule, those jurisdictions have recourse to the option of pretrial
probation, whereby the prosecutor and defendant agree to the defendant's participation in a pretrial rehabilitation program, which includes
conditions typical of post-trial probation, and the adjudication of guilt
and imposition of sentence for the underlying offense occur only if

the defendant breaches those conditions. This system reserves the
appointed-counsel requirement for the few cases in which incarceration
proves necessary, see Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 784, while respecting the
constitutional imperative that no person be imprisoned unless he was
represented by counsel, Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37. Pp. 665-672.

(c) The Court does not rule on Alabama's argument that, although
the Sixth Amendment bars activation of a suspended sentence for an
uncounseled conviction, the Constitution does not prohibit, as a method
of effectuating probationary punishment, the imposition of a suspended
sentence that can never be enforced. There is not so much as a hint in
the Alabama Supreme Court's decision that Shelton's probation term is
separable from the prison term to which it was tethered. Absent any
prior presentation of the novel position the State now takes, this Court
resists passing on it in the first instance. It is for the State Supreme
Court to consider before this Court does whether the suspended sentence alone is invalid, leaving Shelton's probation term freestanding and
independently effective. See Hortonville Joint School Dist. No. 1 v.
Hortonville Ed. Assn., 426 U. S. 482, 488. Pp. 672-674.

This case concerns the Sixth Amendment right of an indi-gent defendant charged with a misdemeanor punishable by

imprisonment, fine, or both, to the assistance of court-appointed counsel. Two prior decisions control the Court's
judgment. First, in Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25(1972), this Court held that defense counsel must be appointed in any criminal prosecution, "whether classified aspetty, misdemeanor, or felony,"

id., at 37, "that actually leadsto imprisonment even for a brief period," id., at 33. Later,

in Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367, 373-374 (1979), the Courtdrew the line at "actual imprisonment," holding that counsel need not be appointed when the defendant is finedfor the charged crime, but is not sentenced to a term of
imprisonment.

658 ALABAMA v. SHELTON

Opinion of the Court
Defendant-respondent LeReed Shelton, convicted of
third-degree assault, was sentenced to a jail term of 30
days, which the trial court immediately suspended, placing
Shelton on probation for two years. The question presented is whether the Sixth Amendment right to appointed
counsel, as delineated in Argersinger and Scott, applies to a
defendant in Shelton's situation. We hold that a suspended
sentence that may "end up in the actual deprivation of a
person's liberty" may not be imposed unless the defendant
was accorded "the guiding hand of counsel" in the prosecution for the crime charged. Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 40
(internal quotation marks omitted).

I
After representing himself at a bench trial in the District
Court of Etowah County, Alabama, Shelton was convicted
of third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor carrying a
maximum punishment of one year imprisonment and a $2,000
fine, Ala. Code $$ 13A-6-22, 13A-5-7(a)(1), 13A-5-12(a)(1)
(1994). He invoked his right to a new trial before a jury in
Circuit Court, Ala. Code $ 12-12-71 (1995), where he again
appeared without a lawyer and was again convicted. The
court repeatedly warned Shelton about the problems selfrepresentation entailed, see App. 9, but at no time offered
him assistance of counsel at state expense.

The Circuit Court sentenced Shelton to serve 30 days in
the county prison. As authorized by Alabama law, however,
Ala. Code $ 15-22-50 (1995), the court suspended that sentence and placed Shelton on two years' unsupervised probation, conditioned on his payment of court costs, a $500
fine, reparations of $25, and restitution in the amount of

$516.69.

Shelton appealed his conviction and sentence on Sixth
Amendment grounds, and the Alabama Court of Criminal

Opinion of the Court
Appeals affirmed.1 That court initially held that an indigentdefendant who receives a suspended prison sentence has a

constitutional right to state-appointed counsel and remandedfor a determination whether Shelton had "made a knowing,
intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right." App. 7.When the case returned from remand, however, the appeals
court reversed course: A suspended sentence, the court concluded, does not trigger the Sixth Amendment right to ap-pointed counsel unless there is "evidence in the record that

the [defendant] has actually been deprived of liberty." Id.,at 13. Because Shelton remained on probation, the court
held that he had not been denied any Sixth Amendment rightat trial.

Id., at 14.
The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the Court ofCriminal Appeals in relevant part. Referri ng to th is

Court's decisions in Argersinger and Scott, the AlabamaSupreme Court reasoned that a defendant may not be
"sentenced to a term of imprisonment" absent provisionof counsel. App. 37. In the Alabama high court's view, a
suspended sentence constitutes a "term of imprisonment"
within the meaning of Argersinger and Scott even thoughincarceration is not immediate or inevitable. And because

the State is constitutionally barred from activating the con-ditional sentence, the Alabama court concluded, " `the threat
itself is hollow and should be considered a nullity.' " App.37 (quoting

United States v. Reilley, 948 F. 2d 648, 654
(CA10 1991)). Accordingly, the court affirmed Shelton's conviction and the monetary portion of his punishment, but invalidated "that aspect of his sentence imposing 30 days of

1 Shelton also appealed on a number of state-law grounds. The Court
of Criminal Appeals rejected all but one of those challenges, concluding
that most had been procedurally defaulted in the trial court. See App.
14-25. On one such challenge, the court remanded for further proceedings, id., at 23, but affirmed after the trial court ruled against Shelton on
remand, id., at 29.

suspended jail time." App. 40. By reversing Shelton's sus-pended sentence, the State informs us, the court also vacated

the two-year term of probation. See Brief for Petitioner 6.2Courts have divided on the Sixth Amendment question
presented in this case. Some have agreed with the decisionbelow that appointment of counsel is a constitutional prerequisite to imposition of a conditional or suspended prison sen-tence. See,

e. g., Reilley, 948 F. 2d, at 654; United States v.Foster, 904 F. 2d 20, 21 (CA9 1990); United States v. White,

529 F. 2d 1390, 1394 (CA8 1976). Others have rejected thatproposition. See, e. g., Cottle v. Wainwright, 477 F. 2d 269,
274 (CA5), vacated on other grounds, 414 U. S. 895 (1973);Griswold v. Commonwealth, 252 Va. 113, 116-117, 472 S. E.
2d 789, 791 (1996); State v. Hansen, 273 Mont. 321, 325, 903P. 2d 194, 197 (1995). We granted certiorari to resolve the
conflict. 532 U. S. 1018 (2001).

II
Three positions are before us in this case. In line withthe decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama, Shelton argues that an indigent defendant may not receive a suspendedsentence unless he is offered or waives the assistance of
state-appointed counsel. Brief for Respondent 5-27.3 Ala2 Justice Maddox dissented, stating that Shelton was not constitutionally
entitled to counsel because he "received only a suspended sentence and
was not incarcerated." App. 41. Justice Maddox also construed the trial
record as establishing Shelton's waiver of any right to appointed counsel
he might have enjoyed. Ibid.

3 Shelton also urges this Court to overrule Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407

U. S. 25 (1972), and Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), to the extent
those cases do not guarantee a right to counsel "in all cases where imprisonment is an authorized penalty." Brief for Respondent 27-31. We do
not entertain this contention, for Shelton first raised it in his brief on
the merits. "We would normally expect notice of an intent to make so
far-reaching an argument in the respondent's opposition to a petition for
certiorari, cf. this Court's Rule 15.2, thereby assuring adequate preparation time for those likely affected and wishing to participate." South
Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999).

Opinion of the Court
bama now concedes that the Sixth Amendment bars activa-tion of a suspended sentence for an uncounseled conviction,

but maintains that the Constitution does not prohibit imposi-tion of such a sentence as a method of effectuating probationary punishment. Reply Brief 4-13. To assure full airing ofthe question presented, we invited an amicus curiae (amicus) to argue in support of a third position, one Alabamahas abandoned: Failure to appoint counsel to an indigent defendant "does not bar the imposition of a suspended or proba-tionary sentence upon conviction of a misdemeanor, even
though the defendant might be incarcerated in the event pro-bation is revoked." 534 U. S. 987 (2001).

4

A
In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344-345 (1963), weheld that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of the right to

state-appointed counsel, firmly established in federal-courtproceedings in

Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938), appliesto state criminal prosecutions through the Fourteenth

Amendment. We clarified the scope of that right in Argersinger, holding that an indigent defendant must be offeredcounsel in any misdemeanor case "that actually leads to imprisonment." 407 U. S., at 33. Seven Terms later, Scottconfirmed Argersinger's "delimit[ation]," 440 U. S., at 373.
Although the governing statute in Scott authorized a jailsentence of up to one year, see id., at 368, we held that the
defendant had no right to state-appointed counsel becausethe sole sentence actually imposed on him was a $50 fine, id.,
at 373. "Even were the matter res nova," we stated, "thecentral premise of

Argersinger--that actual imprisonment isa penalty different in kind from fines or the mere threat of

imprisonment--is eminently sound and warrants adoption ofactual imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional
right to appointment of counsel" in nonfelony cases. Ibid.

662 ALABAMA v. SHELTON

Opinion of the Court
Subsequent decisions have reiterated the Argersinger-Scott "actual imprisonment" standard. See, e. g., Glover v.

United States, 531 U. S. 198, 203 (2001) ("any amount of ac-tual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance"); M. L. B.
v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102, 113 (1996); Nichols v. United States,511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994) (constitutional line is "between criminal proceedings that resulted in imprisonment, and thosethat did not");

id., at 750 (Souter, J., concurring in judg-ment) ("The Court in Scott, relying on Argersinger[,] drew

a bright line between imprisonment and lesser criminal pen-alties."); Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of Durham
Cty., 452 U. S. 18, 26 (1981). It is thus the controlling rulethat "absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person
may be imprisoned for any offense . . . unless he was repre-sented by counsel at his trial." Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37.

B
Applying the "actual imprisonment" rule to the case be-fore us, we take up first the question we asked amicus to

address: Where the State provides no counsel to an indigentdefendant, does the Sixth Amendment permit activation of a
suspended sentence upon the defendant's violation of theterms of probation? We conclude that it does not. A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense ofconviction. Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation violation, but forthe underlying offense. The uncounseled conviction at that
point "result[s] in imprisonment," Nichols, 511 U. S., at 746;it "end[s] up in the actual deprivation of a person's liberty,"
Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 40. This is precisely what theSixth Amendment, as interpreted in

Argersinger and Scott,does not allow.

Amicus resists this reasoning primarily on two grounds.First, he attempts to align this case with our decisions in
Nichols and Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778 (1973). SeeBrief for

Amicus Curiae by Invitation of the Court 11-18

Opinion of the Court
(hereinafter Fried Brief). We conclude that Shelton's caseis not properly bracketed with those dispositions.

Nichols presented the question whether the Sixth Amend-ment barred consideration of a defendant's prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in determining his sentencefor a subsequent felony offense. 511 U. S., at 740. Nichols
pleaded guilty to federal felony drug charges. Several
years earlier, unrepresented by counsel, he was fined but notincarcerated for the state misdemeanor of driving under the

influence (DUI). Including the DUI conviction in the fed-eral Sentencing Guidelines calculation allowed the trial court
to impose a sentence for the felony drug conviction "25
months longer than if the misdemeanor conviction had not
been considered." Id., at 741. We upheld this result, concluding that "an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid
under Scott because no prison term was imposed, is also
valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction." Id., at 749. In Gagnon, the question was whether
the defendant, who was placed on probation pursuant to a
suspended sentence for armed robbery, had a due process
right to representation by appointed counsel at a probation
revocation hearing. 411 U. S., at 783. We held that counsel
was not invariably required in parole or probation revocation
proceedings; we directed, instead, a "case-by-case approach"
turning on the character of the issues involved. Id., at
788-791.

Considered together, amicus contends, Nichols and Gagnon establish this principle: Sequential proceedings must be
analyzed separately for Sixth Amendment purposes, Fried
Brief 11-18, and only those proceedings "result[ing] in immediate actual imprisonment" trigger the right to stateappointed counsel, id., at 13 (emphasis added). Thus, the
defendant in Nichols had no right to appointed counsel in
the DUI proceeding because he was not immediately imprisoned at the conclusion of that proceeding. The uncounseled
DUI, valid when imposed, did not later become invalid be535US3 Unit: $U49 [09-22-03 20:59:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
664 ALABAMA v. SHELTON

Opinion of the Court
cause it was used to enhance the length of imprisonment that
followed a separate and subsequent felony proceeding. Just
so here, amicus contends: Shelton had no right to appointed
counsel in the Circuit Court because he was not incarcerated
immediately after trial; his conviction and suspended sentence were thus valid and could serve as proper predicates
for actual imprisonment at a later hearing to revoke his probation. See Fried Brief 14, 23-24.

Gagnon and Nichols do not stand for the broad proposition
amicus would extract from them. The dispositive factor in
those cases was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or only after some delay. Rather, the critical point
was that the defendant had a recognized right to counsel
when adjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he
was imprisoned. See Nichols, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9 (absent
waiver, right to appointed counsel in felony cases is absolute). Unlike this case, in which revocation of probation
would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of
which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel,
the sentences imposed in Nichols and Gagnon were for felony convictions--a federal drug conviction in Nichols, and a
state armed robbery conviction in Gagnon--for which the
right to counsel is unquestioned. See Nichols, 511 U. S., at
747 (relevant sentencing provisions punished only "the last
offense committed by the defendant," and did not constitute
or "change the penalty imposed for the earlier" uncounseled
misdemeanor); Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 789 (distinguishing "the
right of an accused to counsel in a criminal prosecution" from
"the more limited due process right of one who is a probationer or parolee only because he has been convicted of a
crime").

Thus, neither Nichols nor Gagnon altered or diminished
Argersinger's command that "no person may be imprisoned
for any offense . . . unless he was represented by counsel at
his trial," 407 U. S., at 37 (emphasis added). Far from

665Cite as: 535 U. S. 654 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
supporting amicus' position, Gagnon and Nichols simply
highlight that the Sixth Amendment inquiry trains on the
stage of the proceedings corresponding to Shelton's Circuit
Court trial, where his guilt was adjudicated, eligibity for imprisonment established, and prison sentence determined.

Nichols is further distinguishable for the related reason
that the Court there applied a "less exacting" standard "consistent with the traditional understanding of the sentencing
process." 511 U. S., at 747. Once guilt has been established, we noted in Nichols, sentencing courts may take into
account not only "a defendant's prior convictions, but . . . also
[his] past criminal behavior, even if no conviction resulted
from that behavior." Ibid. Thus, in accord with due process, Nichols "could have been sentenced more severely based
simply on evidence of the underlying conduct that gave rise"
to his previous conviction, id., at 748 (emphasis added), even
if he had never been charged with that conduct, Williams v.
New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949), and even if he had been acquitted of the misdemeanor with the aid of appointed counsel, United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 157 (1997) (per
curiam). That relaxed standard has no application in this
case, where the question is whether the defendant may be
jailed absent a conviction credited as reliable because the
defendant had access to "the guiding hand of counsel," Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Amicus also contends that "practical considerations
clearly weigh against" the extension of the Sixth Amendment appointed-counsel right to a defendant in Shelton's situation. Fried Brief 23. He cites figures suggesting that

although conditional sentences are commonly imposed, they
are rarely activated. Id., at 20-22; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21
(speculating that "hundreds of thousands" of uncounseled defendants receive suspended sentences, but only "thousands"
of that large number are incarcerated upon violating the
terms of their probation). Based on these estimations, ami535US3 Unit: $U49 [09-22-03 20:59:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
666 ALABAMA v. SHELTON

Opinion of the Court
cus argues that a rule requiring appointed counsel in everycase involving a suspended sentence would unduly hamper

the States' attempts to impose effective probationary punish-ment. A more "workable solution," he contends, would permit imposition of a suspended sentence on an uncounseleddefendant and require appointment of counsel, if at all, only
at the probation revocation stage, when incarceration is imminent. Fried Brief 18, 23-24.

Amicus observes that probation is "now a critical tool of
law enforcement in low level cases." Id., at 22. Even so, itdoes not follow that preservation of that tool warrants the

reduction of the Sixth Amendment's domain that would result from the regime amicus hypothesizes. Amicus does
not describe the contours of the hearing that, he suggests,
might precede revocation of a term of probation imposed on
an uncounseled defendant. See id., at 24 (raising, but not
endeavoring to answer, several potential questions about the
nature of the revocation hearing amicus contemplates). In
Alabama, however, the character of the probation revocation
hearing currently afforded is not in doubt. The proceeding
is an "informal" one, Buckelew v. State, 48 Ala. App. 418, 421,
265 So. 2d 202, 205 (Crim. App. 1972), at which the defendant
has no right to counsel, and the court no obligation to observe customary rules of evidence, Martin v. State, 46 Ala.
App. 310, 311, 241 So. 2d 339, 340 (Crim. App. 1970).

More significant, the sole issue at the hearing--apart from
determinations about the necessity of confinement, see Ala.
Code $ 15-22-54(d)(4) (1975)--is whether the defendant
breached the terms of probation. See Martin, 46 Ala. App.,
at 312, 241 So. 2d, at 341 ("All that is required in a hearing
of this character is that the evidence be such as to reasonably
satisfy the judge in the exercise of his sound discretion that
the defendant has violated a valid condition upon which the
sentence was suspended." (internal quotation marks omitted)). The validity or reliability of the underlying conviction is beyond attack. See Buckelew, 48 Ala. App., at 421,

535US3 Unit: $U49 [09-22-03 20:59:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

667Cite as: 535 U. S. 654 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
265 So. 2d, at 205 ("a probation hearing cannot entertain acollateral attack on a judgment of another circuit").

We think it plain that a hearing so timed and structuredcannot compensate for the absence of trial counsel, for it does
not even address the key Sixth Amendment inquiry: whetherthe adjudication of guilt corresponding to the prison sentence
is sufficiently reliable to permit incarceration. Deprived of
counsel when tried, convicted, and sentenced, and unable tochallenge the original judgment at a subsequent probation

revocation hearing, a defendant in Shelton's circumstancesfaces incarceration on a conviction that has never been subjected to "the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing,"
United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656 (1984). The Sixth
Amendment does not countenance this result.

In a variation on amicus' position, the dissent would limit
review in this case to the question whether the imposition
of Shelton's suspended sentence required appointment of
counsel, answering that question "plainly no" because such a
step "does not deprive a defendant of his personal liberty."
Post, at 676. Only if the sentence is later activated, the dissent contends, need the Court "ask whether the procedural
safeguards attending the imposition of [Shelton's] sentence
comply with the Constitution." Ibid.

Severing the analysis in this manner makes little sense.
One cannot assess the constitutionality of imposing a suspended sentence while simultaneously walling off the procedures that will precede its activation. The dissent imagines
a set of safeguards Alabama might provide at the probation
revocation stage sufficient to cure its failure to appoint counsel prior to sentencing, including, perhaps, "complete retrial
of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel,"
post, at 677. But there is no cause for speculation about
Alabama's procedures; they are established by Alabama statute and decisional law, see supra, at 666 and this page, and
they bear no resemblance to those the dissent invents in its
effort to sanction the prospect of Shelton's imprisonment on

Opinion of the Court
an uncounseled conviction.5 Assessing the issue before usin light of actual circumstances, we do not comprehend how

the procedures Alabama in fact provides at the probationrevocation hearing could bring Shelton's sentence within
constitutional bounds.6Nor do we agree with amicus or the dissent that our holding will "substantially limit the states' ability" to imposeprobation, Fried Brief 22, or encumber them with a "large,
new burden," post, at 680. Most jurisdictions already pro-vide a state-law right to appointed counsel more generous than that afforded by the Federal Constitution. See

5 In any event, the dissent is simply incorrect that our decision today
effectively "deprive[s] the State of th[e] option" of placing an uncounseled
defendant on probation, with incarceration conditioned on a guilty verdict
following a trial de novo. Post, at 677. That option is the functional
equivalent of pretrial probation, as to which we entertain no constitutional
doubt. See infra, at 670-672, and n. 12.

Regarding the dissent's suggestion that other "means of retesting (with
assistance of counsel) the validity of the original conviction" might suffice,
post, at 678, n. 3, we doubt that providing counsel after the critical guilt
adjudication stage "[would] be of much help to a defendant," for "the die
is usually cast when judgment is entered on an uncounseled trial record." Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 41 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result).
"[A] large number of misdemeanor convictions take place in police or justice courts which are not courts of record. Without a drastic change in
the procedures of these courts, there would be no way" for the defendant
to demonstrate error in the original proceeding or reconstruct evidence
lost in the intervening period. Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738,
748 (1994). But we need not here decide whether or what procedural
safeguards "short of complete retrial" at the probation revocation stage
could satisfy the Sixth Amendment, post, at 678; the minimal procedures
Alabama does provide are plainly insufficient.

6 Charging that we have "miraculously divined how the Alabama justices

would resolve a constitutional question," post, at 676, the dissent forgets
that this case is here on writ of certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court.
That court ruled in the decision under review that Shelton's sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. The Alabama Supreme Court has thus already spoken on the issue we now address, and in doing so expressed not
the slightest hint that revocation-stage procedures--real or imaginary--
would affect the constitutional calculus.

Opinion of the Court
in the large majority of the States.10 And given the cur-rent commitment of most jurisdictions to affording courtappointed counsel to indigent misdemeanants while simulta-neously preserving the option of probationary punishment,
we do not share amicus' concern that other States may lackthe capacity and resources to do the same.

Moreover, even if amicus is correct that "some courts andjurisdictions at least [can]not bear" the costs of the rule we
confirm today, Fried Brief 23, those States need not abandonprobation or equivalent measures as viable forms of punish10 That ten States in this majority do not provide counsel to every defendant who receives a suspended sentence hardly supports the dissent's
dire predictions about the practical consequences of today's decision, see
post, at 679-681, and n. 4. The circumstances in which those States currently allow prosecution of misdemeanors without appointed counsel are
quite narrow. In Pennsylvania, for example, all defendants charged with
misdemeanors enjoy a right to counsel regardless of the sentence imposed,
Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(B) (2002); only those charged with "summary
offenses" (violations not technically considered crimes and punishable
by no more than 90 days' imprisonment, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 106(c)(2)
(1998)) may receive a suspended sentence uncounseled. Pa. Rule Crim.
Proc. 122(A) (2002); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 510 Pa. 106, 111, n. 7, 507
A. 2d 57, 59, n. 7 (1986). (Typical "summary offenses" in Pennsylvania
include the failure to return a library book within 30 days, 18 Pa. Cons.
Stat. $ 6708 (1998), and fishing on a Sunday, 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 2104
(1998).) Gaps in the misdemeanor defendant's right to appointed counsel
in other States that extend protection beyond the Sixth Amendment are
similarly slight. See, e. g., S. D. Codified Laws $$ 23A-40-6.1, 22-6-2(2)
(1998) (defendant charged with misdemeanor enjoys absolute right to appointed counsel unless offense punishable by no more than 30 days' imprisonment); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 26.04(b)(3) (Vernon Supp. 2002)
(counsel must be appointed to all misdemeanor defendants except those
tried before a judge who knows sentence will not include imprisonment).

More typical of the situation that results in a suspended sentence, we
think, is a case like Shelton's--a prosecution before a jury for third-degree
assault, arising out of a fistfight that followed a minor traffic accident, see
App. 15, n. 2. Far from "quite irrelevant," post, at 679, that 34 States
already provide an attorney in this situation strongly suggests that the
added requirement of providing counsel routinely in suspended sentence
cases will not prove unduly onerous.

Opinion of the Court
ment. Although they may not attach probation to an im-posed and suspended prison sentence, States unable or

unwilling routinely to provide appointed counsel to misde-meanants in Shelton's situation are not without recourse to
another option capable of yielding a similar result.That option is pretrial probation, employed in some form
by at least 23 States. See App. to Reply Brief for National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae1a-2a (collecting state statutes). Under such an arrangement, the prosecutor and defendant agree to the defendant'sparticipation in a pretrial rehabilitation program,

11 which includes conditions typical of post-trial probation. The adjudi-cation of guilt and imposition of sentence for the underlying

offense then occur only if and when the defendant breachesthose conditions.

Ibid.; see, e. g., Conn. Gen. Stat. $ 54-56e
(2001); Pa. Rules Crim. Proc. 310-320, 316 (2002) ("The con-ditions of the [pretrial rehabilitation] program may be such

as may be imposed with respect to probation after conviction
of a crime."); N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law $ 170.55(3) (McKinney
Supp. 2001) (pretrial "adjournment in contemplation of dismissal" may require defendant "to observe certain specified
conditions of conduct").12

Like the regime urged by amicus, this system reserves
the appointed-counsel requirement for the "small percent11 Because this device is conditioned on the defendant's consent, it does
not raise the question whether imposition of probation alone so restrains
a defendant's liberty as to require provision of appointed counsel. See
Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus
Curiae 8; cf. Brief for Respondent 13-16.

12 There is thus only one significant difference between pretrial probation and the "sensible option" urged by the dissent, i. e., "complete retrial
of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel" upon a defendant's violation of probation terms, post, at 677. Pretrial probation is substantially less expensive: It permits incarceration after a single trial,
whereas the dissent's regime requires two--one (without counsel) to place
the defendant on probation, and a second (with counsel) to trigger
imprisonment.

Brief 21, thus allowing a State to "supervise a course of rehabilitation" without providing a lawyer every time it wishes
to pursue such a course, Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 784. Unlike

the constitutional imperative that "no person may be imprisoned for any offense . . . unless he was represented by counsel at his trial," Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37.

Alabama concedes that activation of a suspended sentence
results in the imprisonment of an uncounseled defendant "for
a term that relates to the original offense" and therefore
"crosses the line of `actual imprisonment' " established in
Argersinger and Scott. Reply Brief to Amicus Curiae Professor Charles Fried 8. Shelton cannot be imprisoned, Alabama thus acknowledges, "unless the State has afforded him
the right to assistance of appointed counsel in his defense,"
Scott, 440 U. S., at 374; see Reply Brief 9. Alabama maintains, however, that there is no constitutional barrier to imposition of a suspended sentence that can never be enforced;
the State therefore urges reversal of the Alabama Supreme
Court's judgment insofar as it vacated the term of probation
Shelton was ordered to serve.

In effect, Alabama invites us to regard two years' probation for Shelton as a separate and independent sentence,
which "the State would have the same power to enforce [as]
a judgment of a mere fine." Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. Scott, Alabama emphasizes, squarely held that a fine-only sentence
does not trigger a right to court-appointed counsel, Tr. of
Oral Arg. 6; similarly, Alabama maintains, probation uncoupled from a prison sentence should trigger no immediate
right to appointed counsel. Seen as a freestanding sentence,
Alabama further asserts, probation could be enforced, as a
criminal fine or restitution order could, in a contempt pro535US3 Unit: $U49 [09-22-03 20:59:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ceeding. See Reply Brief 11-12; Reply Brief to Amicus
Curiae Professor Charles Fried 10-13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.

Alabama describes the contempt proceeding it envisions
as one in which Shelton would receive "the full panoply of
due process," including the assistance of counsel. Reply
Brief 12. Any sanction imposed would be for "postconviction wrongdoing," not for the offense of conviction.
Reply Brief to Amicus Curiae Professor Charles Fried 11.
"The maximum penalty faced would be a $100 fine and five
days' imprisonment," Reply Brief 12 (citing Ala. Code $ 12-
11-30(5) (1995)), not the 30 days ordered and suspended by
the Alabama Circuit Court, see supra, at 658.

There is not so much as a hint, however, in the decision of
the Supreme Court of Alabama, that Shelton's probation
term is separable from the prison term to which it was tethered. Absent any prior presentation of the position the
State now takes,13 we resist passing on it in the first instance.
Our resistance to acting as a court of first view instead of one
of review is heightened by the Alabama Attorney General's
acknowledgment at oral argument that he did not know of
any State that imposes, postconviction, on a par with a fine,
a term of probation unattached to a suspended sentence.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. The novelty of the State's current position is further marked by the unqualified statement in
Alabama's opening brief that, "[b]y reversing Shelton's
suspended sentence, the [Supreme Court of Alabama] correspondingly vacated the two-year probationary term." Brief
for Petitioner 6.

13 Not until its reply brief did the State convey that, as it comprehends
Argersinger and Scott, "there is no possibility that Shelton's suspended
sentence will be activated if he violates the terms of his probation."
Reply Brief 9. Before the Supreme Court of Alabama, the State's position coincided with the position now argued by amicus. See State's Brief
and Argument on Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Alabama Court of

674 ALABAMA v. SHELTON

Scalia, J., dissenting
In short, Alabama has developed its position late in thislitigation and before the wrong forum. It is for the Alabama

Supreme Court to consider before this Court does whetherthe suspended sentence alone is invalid, leaving Shelton's
probation term freestanding and independently effective.See Hortonville Joint School Dist. No. 1 v. Hortonville Ed.
Assn., 426 U. S. 482, 488 (1976) ("We are, of course, bound toaccept the interpretation of [the State's] law by the highest
court of the State."). We confine our review to the rulingthe Alabama Supreme Court made in the case as presented
to it: "[A] defendant who receives a suspended or probatedsentence

to imprisonment has a constitutional right to coun-sel." App. 40 (emphasis added); see Brief for Petitioner 6.

We find no infirmity in that holding.

* * *
Satisfied that Shelton is entitled to appointed counsel atthe critical stage when his guilt or innocence of the charged

crime is decided and his vulnerability to imprisonment is de-termined, we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Alabama.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

In Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, 37 (1972), we heldthat "absent a knowing and intelligent waiver,

no personmay be imprisoned for any offense . . . unless he was represented by counsel at his trial." (Emphasis added.) Al-though, we said, the "run of misdemeanors will not be affected" by this rule, "in those that end up in the actualdeprivation of a person's liberty, the accused will receive
the benefit" of appointed counsel. Id., at 40 (emphasisadded). We affirmed this rule in Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S.
367 (1979), drawing a bright line between imprisonment and

Scalia, J., dissenting
the mere threat of imprisonment: "[T]he central premise of
Argersinger--that actual imprisonment is a penalty different
in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment--is
eminently sound and warrants adoption of actual imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional right to appointment of counsel." Id., at 373 (emphasis added). We have
repeatedly emphasized actual imprisonment as the touchstone of entitlement to appointed counsel. See, e. g., Glover
v. United States, 531 U. S. 198, 203 (2001) ("any amount of
actual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance" (emphasis added)); M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102, 113 (1996)
("right [to appointed counsel] does not extend to nonfelony
trials if no term of imprisonment is actually imposed" (emphasis added)); Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of
Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18, 26 (1981) (the Court "has refused
to extend the right to appointed counsel to include prosecutions which, though criminal, do not result in the defendant's
loss of personal liberty" (emphasis added)).

Today's decision ignores this long and consistent jurisprudence, extending the misdemeanor right to counsel to cases
bearing the mere threat of imprisonment. Respondent's
30-day suspended sentence, and the accompanying 2-year
term of probation, are invalidated for lack of appointed counsel even though respondent has not suffered, and may never
suffer, a deprivation of liberty. The Court holds that the
suspended sentence violates respondent's Sixth Amendment
right to counsel because it "may `end up in the actual deprivation of [respondent's] liberty,' " ante, at 658 (emphasis
added), if he someday violates the terms of probation, if a
court determines that the violation merits revocation of probation, Ala. Code $ 15-22-54(d)(1) (1995), and if the court
determines that no other punishment will "adequately protect the community from further criminal activity" or "avoid
depreciating the seriousness of the violation," $ 15-22-
54(d)(4). And to all of these contingencies there must yet

Scalia, J., dissenting
be added, before the Court's decision makes sense, an element of rank speculation. Should all these contingencies
occur, the Court speculates, the Alabama Supreme Court
would mechanically apply its decisional law applicable to routine probation revocation (which establishes procedures that
the Court finds inadequate) rather than adopt special procedures for situations that raise constitutional questions in
light of Argersinger and Scott. Ante, at 666-668. The
Court has miraculously divined how the Alabama justices
would resolve a constitutional question.1

But that question is not the one before us, and the Court
has no business offering an advisory opinion on its answer.
We are asked to decide whether "imposition of a suspended
or conditional sentence in a misdemeanor case invoke[s] a
defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel." Pet. for
Cert. i. Since imposition of a suspended sentence does not
deprive a defendant of his personal liberty, the answer to
that question is plainly no. In the future, if and when the
State of Alabama seeks to imprison respondent on the previously suspended sentence, we can ask whether the procedural safeguards attending the imposition of that sentence
comply with the Constitution. But that question is not before us now. Given our longstanding refusal to issue advisory opinions, Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), particularly with respect to constitutional questions (as to which we
seek to avoid even non-advisory opinions, Ashwander v.
TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)),
I am amazed by the Court's conclusion that it "makes little

1 The Court says that the Alabama Supreme Court has already resolved
this question, since, in finding that respondent's sentence violated the
Sixth Amendment, it "expressed not the slightest hint that revocationstage procedures . . . would affect the constitutional calculus." Ante, at
668, n. 6. Indeed it did not, and that was precisely its error. It did not
answer (because it did not consider) the question whether procedures
attending the probation revocation proceeding could cure the absence of
counsel at trial.

sense" to limit today's decision to the question presented (theconstitutionality of imposing a suspended sentence on

uncounseled misdemeanants) and to avoid a question notpresented (the constitutionality of the "procedures that will
precede its activation"). Ante, at 667.Although the Court at one point purports to limit its decision to suspended sentences imposed on uncounseled misde-meanants in States, like Alabama, that offer only "minimal
procedures" during probation revocation hearings, see ante,at 668, n. 5, the text of today's opinion repudiates that limitation. In answering the question we asked amicus to ad-dress--whether "the Sixth Amendment permit[s] activation
of a suspended sentence upon the defendant's violation of theterms of probation"--the Court states without qualification
that "it does not." Ante, at 662. Thus, when the Court
says it "doubt[s]" that any procedures attending the reimpo-sition of the suspended sentence "could satisfy the Sixth

Amendment," ante, at 668, n. 5, it must be using doubt as aeuphemism for certitude.

The Court has no basis, moreover, for its "doubt." Surely
the procedures attending reimposition of a suspended sen-tence would be adequate if they required, upon the defendant's request, complete retrial of the misdemeanor violationwith assistance of counsel. By what right does the Court
deprive the State of that option? 2 It may well be a sensible

2 The Court asserts that pretrial probation, which its opinion permits, is
the "functional equivalent" of post-trial probation with later retrial if the
suspended sentence is to be activated. Even if that were so, I see no
basis for forcing the State to employ one "functional equivalent" rather
than the other. But in fact there is nothing but the Court's implausible
speculation to support the proposition that pretrial probation will "yiel[d]
a similar result," ante, at 671. That would certainly be a curious coincidence, inasmuch as pretrial probation has the quite different purpose of
conserving prosecutorial and judicial resources by forgoing trial. See,
e. g., 3a U. S. Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual $ 9-22.000
(1988); H. Abadinsky, Probation and Parole: Theory and Practice 348-349
(3d ed. 1987) (pretrial probation programs "use the fact that an arrest has

option, since most defendants will be induced to comply with
the terms of their probation by the mere threat of a retrial
that could send them to jail, and since the expense of those
rare, counseled retrials may be much less than the expense
of providing counsel initially in all misdemeanor cases that
bear a possible sentence of imprisonment. And it may well
be that, in some cases, even procedures short of complete
retrial will suffice.3

occurred as a means of identifying defendants in need of treatment or, at
least, not in need of criminal prosecution"). Moreover, pretrial probation
is generally available only for minor offenses, App. to Reply Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 1a, and
is available in States (e. g., Alabama) that also employ post-trial probation,
id., at 3a. If the thesis that it is the "functional equivalent" of post-trial
probation were true, we would expect to see pretrial probation used for
both major and minor crimes and to see it used in place of, not in addition
to, post-trial probation.

3 The Court quotes Chief Justice Burger's concurrence in Argersinger v.

Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25 (1972), to support its "doubt that providing counsel
after the critical guilt adjudication stage `[would] be of much help to a
defendant,' for `the die is usually cast when judgment is entered on an
uncounseled trial record.' Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 41." Ante, at 668,
n. 5. But that passage was addressing the limited benefits of "[a]ppeal
from a conviction after an uncounseled trial," Argersinger, supra, at 41
(emphasis added), and was doubtless correct in light of the uniformly restricted scope of appellate review. But it makes no sense to transfer the
Chief Justice's concerns to unknown and unknowable forms of probation
revocation proceedings, which may provide various means of retesting
(with assistance of counsel) the validity of the original conviction. The
Court notes that a "large number of misdemeanor convictions take place
in police or justice courts which are not courts of record," making it quite
difficult for a defendant "to demonstrate error in the original proceeding."
Ante, at 668, n. 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). But it is entirely
irrelevant whether a "large number of misdemeanor convictions" take
place in police or justice courts. What matters is whether a record is
available in misdemeanor convictions that result in a suspended prison
sentence (a presumably small fraction of all misdemeanor convictions).
We have no reliable information on that point other than the experience
of the present case--which shows that Alabama does provide a record
which counsel can comb for substantive and procedural inadequacy. Re535US3 Unit: $U49 [09-22-03 20:59:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
Our prior opinions placed considerable weight on the prac-tical consequences of expanding the right to appointed counsel beyond cases of actual imprisonment. See, e. g., Scott,440 U. S., at 373 (any extension of Argersinger would "impose unpredictable, but necessarily substantial, costs on 50quite diverse States"); see also Argersinger, 407 U. S., at
56-62 (Powell, J., concurring in result) (same). Today, theCourt gives this consideration the back of its hand. Its observation that "[a]ll but 16 States" already appoint counselfor defendants like respondent,

ante, at 669, is interestingbut quite irrelevant, since today's holding is not confined

to defendants like respondent. Appointed counsel musthenceforth be offered before any defendant can be awarded
a suspended sentence, no matter how short. Only 24 Stateshave announced a rule of this scope.

4 Thus, the Court's decispondent was tried before a judge in State District Court, a court of
record; he subsequently exercised his right, under Ala. Code $ 12-12-71
(1995), to trial de novo before a jury in State Circuit Court, a higher court
of record. See Ex parte Maye, 799 So. 2d 944, 947 (Ala. 2001).

counsel in a misdemeanor bench trial resulting in a suspended sentence.

with respect to the similarly phrased Pennsylvania statutes cited supra--
is probably no. N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 2A:158A-5.2 (1985); Rodriguez v.
Rosenblatt, 58 N. J. 281, 295, 277 A. 2d 216, 223 (1971); N. C. Gen. Stat.

$ 7A-451(a)(1) (1999); State v. McCoy, 304 N. C. 363, 370, 283 S. E. 2d 788,
791-792 (1981).

The District of Columbia must also be numbered among the jurisdictions
whose law is altered by today's decision. District of Columbia Code Ann.

$ 11-2602 (West 2001) guarantees counsel in "all cases where a person
faces a loss of liberty and the Constitution or any other law requires the
appointment of counsel." (Emphasis added.) Today's decision, discarding the rule of Argersinger, brings suspended sentences within this
prescription.

The Court asserts that the burden of today's decision on these jurisdictions is small because the "circumstances in which [they] currently
allow prosecution of misdemeanors without appointed counsel are quite
narrow." Ante, at 670, n. 10 (emphasis added). But the narrowness of

the range of circumstances covered says nothing about the number of
suspended-sentence cases covered. Misdemeanors punishable by less
than six months' imprisonment may be a narrow category, but it may well
include the vast majority of cases in which (precisely because of the minor
nature of the offense) a suspended sentence is imposed. There is simply
nothing to support the Court's belief that few offenders are prosecuted for
crimes in which counsel is not already provided. The Court minimizes
the burden on Pennsylvania by observing that the "summary offenses"
for which it permits uncounseled suspended sentences include such rarely
prosecuted crimes as failing to return a library book within 30 days and
fishing on Sunday. Ibid. But they also include first-offense minor retail
theft, driving with a suspended license, and harassment (which includes
minor assault). See Thomas, supra, at 109, 507 A. 2d, at 58; 75 Pa. Cons.
Stat. $ 1543(b)(1) (Supp. 2002); 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 2709(a), (c)(1) (2000).

BELL, WARDEN v. CONE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 01-400. Argued March 25, 2002--Decided May 28, 2002
Respondent was tried in a Tennessee court for the murder of an elderly

couple, whose killings culminated a 2-day crime rampage in which respondent also committed robbery and shot a police officer and another
citizen. At his trial, the prosecution adduced overwhelming evidence
that respondent perpetrated the crimes and killed the couple in a brutal
and callous fashion. His defense that he was not guilty by reason of
insanity due to substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorders related to his Vietnam military service was supported by expert testimony
about his drug use and by his mother's testimony that he returned from
Vietnam a changed person. The jury found him guilty on all charges.
The next day, during opening statements at the sentencing hearing for
the murders, the prosecution said that it would prove four aggravating
factors warranting the death penalty, and the defense called the jury's
attention to the mitigating evidence already before it. Defense counsel
cross-examined prosecution witnesses, but called no witnesses. After
the junior prosecutor gave a low-key closing, defense counsel waived
final argument, which prevented the lead prosecutor, by all accounts an
extremely effective advocate, from arguing in rebuttal. The jury found
four aggravating factors and no mitigating circumstances, which, under
Tennessee law, required a death sentence. The State Supreme Court
affirmed. After a hearing in which respondent's trial counsel testified,
the State Criminal Court denied his petition for postconviction relief,
rejecting his contention that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance
during the sentencing phase by failing to present mitigating evidence
and waiving final argument. In affirming, the State Court of Criminal
Appeals found counsel's performance within the permissible range of
competency under the attorney-performance standard of Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U. S. 668. Subsequently, the Federal District Court
denied respondent's federal habeas petition, ruling that he did not meet
28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1)'s requirement that a state decision be "contrary
to," or involve "an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law." The Sixth Circuit reversed with respect to the sentence,
finding that respondent suffered a Sixth Amendment violation for which
prejudice should be presumed under United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.
648, because his counsel, by not asking for mercy after the prosecutor's

686 BELL v. CONE

Syllabus
final argument, did not subject the State's death penalty call to meaningful adversarial testing; and that the state court's adjudication of respondent's claim was therefore an unreasonable application of the clearly
established law announced in Strickland.

Held: Respondent's claim was governed by Strickland, and the state

court's decision neither was "contrary to," nor involved "an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law" under $ 2254(d)(1).
Pp. 693-702.

(a) Section 2254(d)(1)'s "contrary to" and "unreasonable application"
clauses have independent meaning. A federal habeas court may grant
relief under the former clause if the state court applies a rule different
from the governing law set forth in this Court's cases, or if it decides a
case differently than this Court has done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405-406. The federal court may grant relief under the latter clause if the state court
correctly identifies the governing legal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonably applies it in the particular case. Id., at 407-410.
Such application must be objectively unreasonable, which is different
from incorrect. To satisfy Strickland's two-part test for evaluating
claims that counsel performed so incompetently that a defendant's sentence or conviction should be reversed, the defendant must prove that
counsel's representation fell below an objective reasonableness standard
and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional error, the proceeding's result would have been different.
In Cronic, this Court identified three situations in which it is possible
to presume prejudice to the defense. Respondent argues that his claim
fits within the exception for cases where "counsel entirely fails to
subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing," 466
U. S., at 659 (emphasis added), because his counsel failed to mount a case
for life imprisonment after the prosecution introduced evidence in the
sentencing hearing and gave a closing statement. Under Cronic,
the attorney's failure to test the prosecutor's case must be complete.
Here, respondent argues not that his counsel failed to oppose the prosecution throughout the sentencing proceeding, but that he failed to do so
at specific points. The challenged aspects of counsel's performance--
failing to adduce mitigating evidence and waiving closing argument--
are plainly of the same ilk as other specific attorney errors subject to
Strickland's performance and prejudice components. See, e. g., Darden
v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168, 184. Because the state court correctly
identified Strickland's principles as those governing the analysis of
respondent's claim, there is no merit in his contention that the state

Syllabus
court's adjudication was contrary to this Court's clearly established
law. Pp. 693-698.

(b) Nor was the state court's decision "an unreasonable application"
of Strickland. Strickland requires a defendant to overcome the "presumption that . . . the challenged action `might be considered sound trial
strategy.' " 466 U. S., at 689. Section 2254(d)(1) requires respondent
to do more, i. e., show that the state court applied Strickland to his case
in an objectively unreasonable manner. This he cannot do. Counsel
was faced with the onerous task of defending a client who had committed a brutal and senseless crime and who, despite a relatively normal
upbringing, had become a drug addict and robber. Counsel reasonably
could have concluded that the substance of the medical experts' testimony during the guilt phase was still fresh to the jury during the
sentencing phase, and that respondent's mother had not made a good
witness at the guilt stage and should not be subjected to further crossexamination. Respondent's sister refused to testify, and counsel had
sound tactical reasons for not calling respondent himself. Counsel also
feared that the prosecution might elicit information about respondent's
criminal history from other witnesses that he could have called, and that
testimony about respondent's normal youth might cut the other way

in the jury's eyes. Counsel's final-argument options were to make a
closing argument and reprise for the jury the primary mitigating
evidence, plead for his client's life, and impress upon the jury other,
less significant facts, knowing that it would give the persuasive lead
prosecutor the chance to depict his client as a heartless killer just before the jurors began deliberation; or to prevent the lead prosecutor
from arguing by waiving his own summation and relying on the jurors'
familiarity with the case and his opening plea for life made just a
few hours before. Neither option so clearly outweighs the other that
it was objectively unreasonable for the state court to deem his choice
a tactical decision about which competent lawyers might disagree.

28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).

I

In 1982, respondent was convicted of, and sentenced
to death for, the murder of an elderly couple in Memphis,
Tennessee. The killings culminated a 2-day crime rampage
that began when respondent robbed a Memphis jewelry
store of approximately $112,000 in merchandise on a Saturday in August 1980. Shortly after the 12:45 p.m. robbery, a
police officer in an unmarked vehicle spotted respondent
driving at a normal speed and began to follow him. After
a few blocks, respondent accelerated, prompting a high-speed
chase through midtown Memphis and into a residential neighborhood where respondent abandoned his vehicle.
Attempting to flee, respondent shot an officer who tried to
apprehend him, shot a citizen who confronted him, and, at
gunpoint, demanded that another hand over his car keys.
As a police helicopter hovered overhead, respondent tried to
shoot the fleeing car owner, but was frustrated because his
gun was out of ammunition.

Throughout the afternoon and into the next morning, respondent managed to elude detection as police combed the
surrounding area. In the meantime, officers inventorying
his car found an array of illegal and prescription drugs, the
stolen merchandise, and more than $2,400 in cash. Respondent reappeared early Sunday morning when he drew a gun
on an elderly resident who refused to let him in to use her
telephone. Later that afternoon, respondent broke into the
home of Shipley and Cleopatra Todd, aged 93 and 79 years
old, and killed them by repeatedly beating them about the
head with a blunt instrument. He moved their bodies so
that they would not be visible from the front and rear doors
and ransacked the first floor of their home. After shaving
his beard, respondent traveled to Florida. He was arrested

Opinion of the Court
there for robbing a drugstore in Pompano Beach. He ad-mitted killing the Todds and shooting the police officer.

A Tennessee grand jury charged respondent with twocounts of first-degree murder in the perpetration of a burglary in connection with the Todds' deaths, three counts ofassault with intent to murder in connection with the shootings and attempted shooting of the car owner, and one count
of robbery with a deadly weapon for the jewelry store theft.At a jury trial in the Criminal Court of Shelby County, the

prosecution adduced overwhelming physical and testimonialevidence showing that respondent perpetrated the crimes
and that he killed the Todds in a brutal and callous fashion.

The defense conceded that respondent committed most of
the acts in question, but sought to prove that he was not
guilty by reason of insanity. A clinical psychologist testified
that respondent suffered from substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorders related to his military service in Vietnam. A neuropharmacologist recounted at length respondent's history of illicit drug use, which began after he joined
the Army and escalated to the point where he was daily consuming "rather horrific" quantities. Tr. 1722-1763. That
drug use, according to the expert, caused chronic amphetamine psychosis, hallucinations, and ongoing paranoia, which
affected respondent's mental capacity and ability to obey the
law. Defense counsel also called respondent's mother, who
spoke of her son coming back from Vietnam in 1969 a
changed person, his honorable discharge from service, his
graduation with honors from college, and the deaths of his
father and fiance' e while he was in prison from 1972-1979
for robbery. Although respondent did not take the stand,
defense counsel was able to elicit through other testimony
that he had expressed remorse for the killings. Rejecting
his insanity defense, the jury found him guilty on all charges.

Punishment for the first-degree murder counts was fixed
in a separate sentencing hearing that took place the next day
and lasted about three hours. Under then-applicable Ten535US3 Unit: $U51 [09-22-03 21:02:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

691Cite as: 535 U. S. 685 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
nessee law, a death sentence was required if the jury foundunanimously that the State proved beyond a reasonable

doubt the existence of at least one statutory aggravatingcircumstance that was not outweighed by any mitigating
circumstance. Tenn. Code Ann. $ 39-2-203 (1982). In mak-ing these determinations, the jury could (and was instructed
that it could) consider evidence from both the guilt and punishment phases. Ibid.; Tr. 2219.During its opening statement, the State said it would

prove four aggravating factors: that (1) respondent hadpreviously been convicted of one or more felonies involving

the use or threat of violence to a person; (2) he knowingly
created a great risk of death to two or more persons other

than the victim during the act of murder; (3) the murder was
especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; and (4) the murder

was committed for the purpose of avoiding lawful arrest.
In his opening statement, defense counsel called the jury's
attention to the mitigating evidence already before them.
He suggested that respondent was under the influence of extreme mental disturbance or duress, that he was an addict
whose drug and other problems stemmed from the stress of
his military service, and that he felt remorse. Counsel
urged the jury that there was a good reason for preserving
his client's life if one looked at "the whole man." App. 26.
He asked for mercy, calling it a blessing that would raise
them above the State to the level of God.

The prosecution then called a records custodian and fingerprint examiner to establish that respondent had three
armed robbery convictions and two officers who said they
tried unsuccessfully to arrest respondent for armed robbery
after the jewelry store heist. Through cross-examination of
the records custodian, respondent's attorney brought out
that his client had been awarded the Bronze Star in Vietnam.
After defense counsel successfully objected to the State's
proffer of photos of the Todds' decomposing bodies, both
sides rested. The junior prosecuting attorney on the case

Opinion of the Court
gave what the state courts described as a "low-key" closing.1Defense counsel waived final argument, preventing the lead

prosecutor, who by all accounts was an extremely effectiveadvocate, from arguing in rebuttal. The jury found in both
murder cases four aggravating factors and no mitigatingcircumstances substantial enough to outweigh them. The
Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed respondent's convictions
and sentence on appeal, State v. Cone, 665 S. W. 2d 87, andwe denied certiorari, 467 U. S. 1210 (1984).

Respondent then petitioned for state postconviction relief,contending that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance
during the sentencing phase by failing to present mitigatingevidence and by waiving final argument. After a hearing in
which respondent's trial counsel testified, a division of theTennessee Criminal Court rejected this contention. The
Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. Cone v.
State, 747 S. W. 2d 353 (1987). The appellate court reviewed
counsel's explanations for his decisions concerning the calling
of witnesses and the waiving of final argument. Id., at 356-
357. Describing counsel's representation as "very conscientious," the court concluded that his performance was within
the permissible range of competency, citing Baxter v. Rose,
523 S. W. 2d 930 (Tenn. 1975), a decision the Tennessee Supreme Court deems to have announced the same attorney
performance standard as Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668 (1984). See, e. g., State v. Burns, 6 S. W. 3d 453,
461 (1999). The court also expressed its view that respondent received the death penalty based on the law and facts,
not on the shortcomings of counsel. 747 S. W. 2d, at 357-
358. The Tennessee Supreme Court denied respondent
permission to appeal, and we denied further review, Cone v.
Tennessee, 488 U. S. 871 (1988).

In 1997, after his second application for state postconviction relief was dismissed, respondent sought a federal writ

Opinion of the Court
of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 as amended by theAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. His

petition alleged numerous grounds for relief including in-effective assistance at the sentencing phase. The District
Court ruled that respondent did not meet $ 2254(d)'s require-ments and denied the petition.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the refusal to issue a writwith respect to respondent's conviction, but reversed with
respect to his sentence. 243 F. 3d 961, 979 (CA6 2001). Itheld that respondent suffered a Sixth Amendment violation
for which prejudice should be presumed under United Statesv.

Cronic, 466 U. S. 648 (1984), because his counsel, by notasking for mercy after the prosecutor's final argument, did

not subject the State's call for the death penalty to meaning-ful adversarial testing. 243 F. 3d, at 979. The state court's
adjudication of respondent's Sixth Amendment claim, in theCourt of Appeals' analysis, was therefore an unreasonable
application of the clearly established law announced in
Strickland. 243 F. 3d, at 979. We granted certiorari, 534U. S. 1064 (2001), and now reverse the Court of Appeals.

II
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of1996 modified a federal habeas court's role in reviewing state

prisoner applications in order to prevent federal habeas"retrials" and to ensure that state-court convictions are
given effect to the extent possible under law. See Williamsv. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 403-404 (2000). To these ends,

$ 2254(d)(1) provides:

of the United States." 2

As we stated in Williams, $ 2254(d)(1)'s "contrary to" and
"unreasonable application" clauses have independent meaning. 529 U. S., at 404-405. A federal habeas court may
issue the writ under the "contrary to" clause if the state
court applies a rule different from the governing law set
forth in our cases, or if it decides a case differently than we
have done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Id.,
at 405-406. The court may grant relief under the "unreasonable application" clause if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from our decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case. Id.,
at 407-408. The focus of the latter inquiry is on whether
the state court's application of clearly established federal law
is objectively unreasonable, and we stressed in Williams
that an unreasonable application is different from an incorrect one. Id., at 409-410. See also id., at 411 (a federal
habeas court may not issue a writ under the unreasonable
application clause "simply because that court concludes in
its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or
incorrectly").

Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals exceeded its
statutory authority to grant relief under $ 2254(d)(1) because
the decision of the Tennessee courts was neither contrary to
nor an unreasonable application of the clearly established law
of Strickland. Respondent counters that he is entitled to
relief under $ 2254(d)(1)'s "contrary to" clause because the
state court applied the wrong legal rule. In his view,
Cronic, not Strickland, governs the analysis of his claim that

Opinion of the Court
his counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the sentencinghearing. We address this issue first.

In Strickland, which was decided the same day as Cronic,we announced a two-part test for evaluating claims that a
defendant's counsel performed so incompetently in his or herrepresentation of a defendant that the defendant's sentence
or conviction should be reversed. We reasoned that there
would be a sufficient indication that counsel's assistance wasdefective enough to undermine confidence in a proceeding's

result if the defendant proved two things: first, that counsel's"representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness," 466 U. S., at 688; and second, that "there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,"
id., at 694. Without proof of both deficient performance and
prejudice to the defense, we concluded, it could not be said
that the sentence or conviction "resulted from a breakdown
in the adversary process that rendered the result of the proceeding unreliable," id., at 687, and the sentence or conviction should stand.

In Cronic, we considered whether the Court of Appeals
was correct in reversing a defendant's conviction under the
Sixth Amendment without inquiring into counsel's actual
performance or requiring the defendant to show the effect it
had on the trial. 466 U. S., at 650, 658. We determined that
the court had erred and remanded to allow the claim to be
considered under Strickland's test. 466 U. S., at 666-667,
and n. 41. In the course of deciding this question, we identified three situations implicating the right to counsel that
involved circumstances "so likely to prejudice the accused
that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is
unjustified." Id., at 658-659.

First and "[m]ost obvious" was the "complete denial of
counsel." Id., at 659. A trial would be presumptively unfair, we said, where the accused is denied the presence of
counsel at "a critical stage," id., at 659, 662, a phrase we used

in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52, 54 (1961), and White
v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, 60 (1963) (per curiam), to denote
a step of a criminal proceeding, such as arraignment, that
held significant consequences for the accused.3 Second, we
posited that a similar presumption was warranted if "counsel
entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful
adversarial testing." Cronic, supra, at 659. Finally, we
said that in cases like Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932),
where counsel is called upon to render assistance under
circumstances where competent counsel very likely could
not, the defendant need not show that the proceedings were
affected. Cronic, supra, at 659-662.

Respondent argues that his claim fits within the second
exception identified in Cronic because his counsel failed to
"mount some case for life" after the prosecution introduced
evidence in the sentencing hearing and gave a closing statement. Brief for Respondent 26. We disagree. When we

and White v. Maryland where we found a Sixth Amendment error without
requiring a showing of prejudice. Each involved criminal defendants who
had actually or constructively been denied counsel by government action.

spoke in Cronic of the possibility of presuming prejudicebased on an attorney's failure to test the prosecutor's case,

we indicated that the attorney's failure must be complete.We said "if counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's
case to meaningful adversarial testing." Cronic, supra, at659 (emphasis added). Here, respondent's argument is not
that his counsel failed to oppose the prosecution throughoutthe sentencing proceeding as a whole, but that his counsel
failed to do so at specific points. For purposes of distin-guishing between the rule of

Strickland and that of Cronic,this difference is not of degree but of kind.

4

The aspects of counsel's performance challenged by re-spondent--the failure to adduce mitigating evidence and the

waiver of closing argument--are plainly of the same ilk asother specific attorney errors we have held subject to Strick4 In concluding that Cronic applies to respondent's ineffective-assistance
claim, the dissent relies in part on inferences it draws from evidence that
his attorney sought treatment for a mental illness four years after respondent's trial. See post, at 715-716 (opinion of Stevens, J.). While
the dissent admits that counsel's mental health problems "may have onset
after [respondent's] trial," it speculates that counsel's mental health problems began earlier based on its "complete reading of the trial transcript
and an assessment of [counsel's] actions at trial." Post, at 716. But, as
the dissent concedes, respondent did not present any evidence regarding
his counsel's mental health in the state-court proceedings. Before us, respondent does not argue that we could consider his attorney's medical
records obtained in the federal habeas proceedings in assessing his Sixth
Amendment claim, nor does he suggest that his counsel suffered from mental health problems at the time of his trial. Furthermore, any implication
that trial counsel was impaired during his representation is contradicted
by the testimony of the two experts called during the state postconviction
hearing. Both had extensive experience in prosecuting and defending
criminal cases and were familiar with trial counsel's abilities. Wayne Emmons said that counsel was "not only fully capable, but one of the most
conscientious lawyers [he] knew." State Postconviction Tr. 73. And Stephen Shankman said he considered respondent's counsel "to be one of the
finest practitioners in [the] community in the area of criminal defense
work," id., at 182, and "an extremely experienced lawyer" whom he would
be "hardpressed to second guess," id., at 190.

land's performance and prejudice components. In Dardenv. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168, 184 (1986), for example, we

evaluated under Strickland a claim that counsel was ineffec-tive for failing to put on any mitigating evidence at a capital
sentencing hearing. In Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 788(1987), we did the same when presented with a challenge to
counsel's decision at a capital sentencing hearing not to offerany mitigating evidence at all.

We hold, therefore, that the state court correctly identifiedthe principles announced in

Strickland as those governingthe analysis of respondent's claim. Consequently, we find

no merit in respondent's contention that the state court'sadjudication was contrary to our clearly established law.
Cf. Williams, 529 U. S., at 405 ("The word `contrary' is com-monly understood to mean `diametrically different,' `opposite
in character or nature,' or `mutually opposed' " (quoting Web-ster's Third New International Dictionary 495 (1976))).

III
The remaining issue, then, is whether respondent can ob-tain relief on the ground that the state court's adjudication

of his claim involved an "unreasonable application" of Strick-land. In Strickland we said that "[ j]udicial scrutiny of a
counsel's performance must be highly deferential" and that"every effort [must] be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of coun-sel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from
counsel's perspective at the time." 466 U. S., at 689. Thus,even when a court is presented with an ineffective-assistance
claim not subject to $ 2254(d)(1) deference, a defendant mustovercome the "presumption that, under the circumstances,
the challenged action `might be considered sound trial strat-egy.' "

Ibid. (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U. S. 91,101 (1955)).

For respondent to succeed, however, he must do more thanshow that he would have satisfied

Strickland's test if his

Opinion of the Court
claim were being analyzed in the first instance, becauseunder $ 2254(d)(1), it is not enough to convince a federal habeas court that, in its independent judgment, the state-courtdecision applied

Strickland incorrectly. See Williams,
supra, at 411. Rather, he must show that the TennesseeCourt of Appeals applied

Strickland to the facts of his case
in an objectively unreasonable manner. This, we conclude,
he cannot do.Respondent's counsel was faced with the formidable task

of defending a client who had committed a horribly brutaland senseless crime against two elderly persons in their
home. He had just the day before shot a police officer and
an unarmed civilian, attempted to shoot another person, and
committed a robbery. The State had near conclusive proof
of guilt on the murder charges as well as extensive evidence
demonstrating the cruelty of the killings. Making the situation more onerous were the facts that respondent, despite his high intelligence and relatively normal upbringing,
had turned into a drug addict and had a history of robbery
convictions.

Because the defense's theory at the guilt phase was not
guilty by reason of insanity, counsel was able to put before the jury extensive testimony about what he believed
to be the most compelling mitigating evidence in the case--
evidence regarding the change his client underwent after
serving in Vietnam; his drug dependency, which apparently
drove him to commit the robbery in the first place; and
its effects. Before the state courts, respondent faulted his
counsel for not recalling his medical experts during the
sentencing hearing. But we think counsel reasonably could
have concluded that the substance of their testimony was
still fresh to the jury. Each had taken the stand not long
before, and counsel focused on their testimony in his guilt
phase closing argument, which took place the day before the
sentencing hearing was held. Respondent's suggestion that
the jury could not fully consider the mental health proof as

Opinion of the Court
potentially mitigating because it was adduced during theguilt phase finds no support in the record. Defense counsel

advised the jury that the testimony of the experts estab-lished the existence of mitigating circumstances, and the
trial court specifically instructed the jury that evidence of amental disease or defect insufficient to establish a criminal
defense could be considered in mitigation. Tr. 2221.Respondent also assigned error in his counsel's decision
not to recall his mother. While counsel recognized that re-spondent's mother could have provided further information
about respondent's childhood and spoken of her love for him,he concluded that she had not made a good witness at the
guilt stage, and he did not wish to subject her to furthercross-examination. Respondent advances no argument that
would call his attorney's assessment into question.In his trial preparations, counsel investigated the possibility of calling other witnesses. He thought respondent's sis-ter, who was closest to him, might make a good witness, but
she did not want to testify. And even if she had agreed,putting her on the stand would have allowed the prosecutor
to question her about the fact that respondent called herfrom the Todds' house just after the killings. After consulting with his client, counsel opted not to call respondent him-self as a witness. And we think counsel had sound tactical
reasons for deciding against it. Respondent said he wasvery angry with the prosecutor and thought he might lash
out if pressed on cross-examination, which could have onlyalienated him in the eyes of the jury. There was also the
possibility of calling other witnesses from his childhood ordays in the Army. But counsel feared that the prosecution
might elicit information about respondent's criminal history.5

5 Respondent cites Cozzolino v. State, 584 S. W. 2d 765 (Tenn. 1979), to
argue that calling additional witnesses would not have opened the door to
evidence about his prior bad acts. We need not express any view as to
Tennessee law on this issue except to point out that Cozzolino does not
state such a broad, categorical rule. Cozzolino held that a trial court

Opinion of the Court
He further feared that testimony about respondent's normalyouth might, in the jury's eyes, cut the other way.

Respondent also focuses on counsel's decision to waivefinal argument. He points out that counsel could have explained the significance of his Bronze Star decoration andargues that his counsel's failure to advocate for life in closing
necessarily left the jury with the impression that he de-served to die. The Court of Appeals "reject[ed] out of hand"
the idea that waiving summation could ever be consideredsound trial strategy. 243 F. 3d, at 979. In this case, we
think at the very least that the state court's contrary assessment was not "unreasonable." After respondent's counselgave his opening statement discussing the mitigating evidence before them and urging that they choose life for hisclient, the prosecution did not put on any particularly dramatic or impressive testimony. The State's witnesses testi-fied rather briefly about the undisputed facts that respondent
had prior convictions and was evading arrest.When the junior prosecutor delivered a very matter-offact closing that did not dwell on any of the brutal aspects of
the crime, counsel was faced with a choice. He could make aclosing argument and reprise for the jury, perhaps in greater

detail than his opening, the primary mitigating evidence con-cerning his client's drug dependency and posttraumatic
stress from Vietnam. And he could plead again for life forhis client and impress upon the jurors the importance of
what he believed were less significant facts, such as theBronze Star decoration or his client's expression of remorse.
But he knew that if he took this opportunity, he would givethe lead prosecutor, who all agreed was very persuasive, the

erred in admitting evidence that the defendant committed crimes after
the murder because that evidence was not relevant to any aggravating
factors or mitigating factors raised by the defense. Id., at 767-768. In
this case, at a minimum, any evidence about respondent's prior robbery
convictions would have been relevant because the State relied on those
convictions to prove an aggravating circumstance.

chance to depict his client as a heartless killer just beforethe jurors began deliberation. Alternatively, counsel could

prevent the lead prosecutor from arguing by waiving hisown summation and relying on the jurors' familiarity with
the case and his opening plea for life made just a few hoursbefore. Neither option, it seems to us, so clearly outweighs
the other that it was objectively unreasonable for the Tennessee Court of Appeals to deem counsel's choice to waiveargument a tactical decision about which competent lawyers

might disagree.We cautioned in

Strickland that a court must indulge a
"strong presumption" that counsel's conduct falls within thewide range of reasonable professional assistance because it

is all too easy to conclude that a particular act or omission
of counsel was unreasonable in the harsh light of hindsight.
466 U. S., at 689. Given the choices available to respondent's
counsel and the reasons we have identified, we cannot say
that the state court's application of Strickland's attorneyperformance standard was objectively unreasonable. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
In my judgment, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded
that during the penalty phase of respondent's capital murder
trial, his counsel "entirely fail[ed] to subject the prosecution's
case to meaningful adversarial testing." United States v.
Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 659 (1984). Counsel's shortcomings
included a failure to interview witnesses who could have
provided mitigating evidence; a failure to introduce available mitigating evidence; and the failure to make any closing argument or plea for his client's life at the conclusion of

the penalty phase. Furthermore, respondent's counsel was,
subsequent to trial, diagnosed with a mental illness that ren535US3 Unit: $U51 [09-22-03 21:02:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dered him unqualified to practice law, and that apparently
led to his suicide. See App. 88-89. These circumstances
"justify a presumption that respondent's conviction was insufficiently reliable to satisfy the Constitution." Cronic, 466
U. S., at 662.

I

Certain facts about respondent, Gary Cone, are not in dispute. Cone was a "gentle child," of exceptional intelligence,
with an outstanding academic record in high school. App.
62-63. His father was an officer in the United States Army
and a firm disciplinarian. He apparently enjoyed a loving
relationship with his older brother and with both of his sisters. At age 8 or 9, however, Cone witnessed the drowning
of his older brother. In 1966, at age 18, Cone enlisted in the
Army and was sent to Germany. He was eventually transferred to Vietnam, where he served as a supply clerk until
1969. His service in Vietnam involved, among other things,
transporting corpses and performing long hours of guard
duty. He was awarded the Bronze Star, and he received an
honorable discharge.

After returning to the States, Cone graduated from college and, although accepted into law school for August/
September 1980, never enrolled. According to Cone, he
began to use drugs--mainly amphetamines--while in Vietnam, in order to perform extended guard duties, and he continued to do so after his discharge from the Army. In an
apparent effort to fund this growing drug habit, he committed robberies, and, in 1972, after college, he was convicted
of armed robbery and incarcerated in Oklahoma until 1979.
While he was in prison, his father died and his fiance' e, whom
he met while in college, was raped and murdered. After his
release from prison, he kept in touch with his mother (who
lived in Arkansas) and his sister (who lived in Chicago), but
did not stay in one place. The lack of evidence of gainful
employment post-1979, coupled with evidence of travels to

704 BELL v. CONE

Stevens, J., dissenting
Florida and Hawaii, suggests that Cone supported himself
and his drug habit by criminal activity.

The Court has fairly described the facts of respondent's
crime. Ante, at 689-690. However, in order to understand
both why Cronic applies in the present case, and how counsel
completely failed respondent at the penalty phase, I describe
the events at trial in more detail. In his opening statement
at the guilt phase of the trial, respondent's counsel, John
Dice, admitted to the jury that Cone had committed the
crimes for which he was charged, but explained that he was
not guilty by reason of insanity--a condition brought on by
excessive drug use that resulted from "Vietnam Veterans
Syndrome." See, e. g., Tr. 956-957.1 Dice explained to the
jury that Cone's time in Vietnam had transformed him, leading to his insanity, and Dice promised several witnesses in
aid of this insanity defense, including Cone's sister Susan,
Cone's mother, and his two aunts, all of whom would "testify
about the Gary Cone that they knew," id., at 953, that is, the

1 Dice claims credit for developing this defense, but these claims are
unsubstantiated and appear exaggerated from Dice's testimony. See
State Postconviction Tr. 92. Nonetheless, such a defense was in its early
stages at the time of respondent's 1982 trial, and has become more widely
asserted. See generally Levin, Defense of the Vietnam Veteran with
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, 46 Am. Jur. Trials 441 (1993 and Supp.
2001). Furthermore, as of 1980, the American Psychiatric Association
began formally to recognize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which
can derive from disturbing war experiences. See American Psychiatric
Assn., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 463-468 (rev.
4th ed. 2000).

The PTSD from which respondent allegedly suffered would sensibly
have been used by Dice as mitigation in the penalty phase. See Levin,
46 Am. Jur. Trials $ 37. However, its viability as the guilt phase defense
in this case was unlikely at best, because insanity in this context applies
when "[t]he veteran who believes he is again in combat . . . attacks one
whom he believes to be an enemy soldier." Davidson, Note, PostTraumatic Stress Disorder: A Controversial Defense for Veterans of a
Controversial War, 29 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 415, 424 (1988). Cone was
not in combat and his crime did not fit this description.

pre-Vietnam Cone. Dice also advised the jury that he wouldprove that the victim's sister had written a letter of forgiveness to Cone's mother--"one of the most loving letters I'veever read in my life," in Dice's words.

Id., at 965-966.2
Despite these promises, after the State's affirmative casein the guilt phase, Dice presented only three witnesses in

support of the insanity defense: Cone's mother testified about
his behavior after his return from Vietnam, but the courtlargely precluded her from discussing Cone's pre-Vietnam

life; a clinical psychologist testified about posttraumaticstress resulting from Cone's Vietnam service; and a neuropharmacologist testified about Cone's drug use and its ef-fects. Through these witnesses, Dice attempted to paint a
picture of a normal person who fell victim to "amphetaminepsychosis" and became a "junkie of such unbelievable proportions that it would have been impossible for him to form anyintent."

Id., at 957. Cone was not a witness at the guilt
phase, though he did take the stand outside the presence of
the jury to waive his right to testify.

In its rebuttal case, the State adduced the testimony of
Aileen Blankman, whom Cone visited in Florida approximately one day after the murders. She testified that respondent neither used drugs while visiting her, nor appeared
to have recently used drugs, thereby calling into question
his claim of drug addiction. According to Dice's co-counsel,
Blankman's testimony "utterly destroyed our defense. We
were totally unprepared for that." State Postconviction
Tr. 42. Dice knew of Blankman's contact with Cone after
the murders, and was "absolutely" aware that Blankman was

2 This letter's mitigating effect would have been significant. It read, in
part: "Even tho I am still in shock over the tragic death of my dear brother
and his wife, I want you to know that you and your family have my prayers
and deepest sympathy. I am also praying for Gary. We know he must
have been out of his mind to have done the things he did. May God
forgive him." Record, Exh. 29. See Tr. 1280-1281 (referencing letter,
marked as Exhibit 29, which was never submitted to the jury).

Stevens, J., dissenting
a possible prosecution witness, but Dice failed to interview
her before the trial. Id., at 138.3 In guilt phase rebuttal,
the State also introduced its own medical experts to challenge the defense experts' testimony concerning Cone's
alleged insanity. Although the State's experts questioned
Cone's claim of Vietnam Veterans Syndrome, their testimony
focused on Cone's failure to satisfy the insanity standard.
See Tr. 1957, 1983. It took less than two hours for the jury
to return a guilty verdict on all counts.

Dice's stated attitude toward the penalty phase must
frame our consideration of the constitutional standard applicable to this case. Once his "Vietnam Veterans Syndrome"
defense was rejected in the guilt phase, it appears that Dice
approached the penalty phase with a sense of hopelessness
because his "basic tactic was to try to convince the jury that
Gary Cone was insane at the time of the commission of these
acts, and the jury rejected that." State Postconviction
Tr. 109. Dice perceived that the guilt phase evidence concerning Cone's mental health "made absolutely no difference
to the jury," id., at 159, and that the jurors "weren't buying any of it," id., at 156, even though that evidence had
been introduced to the jury through the lens of the insanity
defense, not as mitigation for the death penalty.4 Dice's co3 With respect to this failure, Dice explained: "So, we could have interviewed her, but we didn't. I don't know, maybe she was devastating and
maybe she wasn't, but let's say that we had interviewed her, you know,
what would it have changed? If she'd come up here and she'd testified,
she would have testified the same way I assume." State Postconviction
Tr. 140.

4 It is true that the jury was instructed to consider mitigation from the

guilt phase, and also true that Dice's brief penalty phase opening referenced the mental health evidence from the guilt phase, ante, at 691, but
the jury's whole view of that testimony was influenced by its relation to
the debunked insanity defense. Although the State's experts may have
been successful in undermining Cone's claim to insanity, they did not
necessarily undermine the potential mitigating effect of Cone's mental
health evidence.

counsel echoed the sentiment that death was a foregone con-clusion: "I don't recall too much on any discussion, really,

about the penalty stage, mainly because my own feelingabout the case law as it was then, and I guess as it still is, is
that when a jury is [Witherspooned] in,5 it's a fixed jury.They're going to find a death penalty. . . . It was almost a
hopeless feeling that the way the problem was going to besolved was through the Court of Appeals, not through any
jury verdict." Id., at 39. Indeed, Dice expressed this hope-lessness even before the trial began; he testified that he told
Cone's mother "the first day I met her, that if [the prosecu-tor] does not elect to offer life in this case, your boy is going
to the chair and there's not going to be a darn thing . . . I'mgoing to be able to do to stop it except to maybe screw up
the prosecution." Id., at 108. Moreover, Dice's testimony
in state postconviction reveals his "radical" view of the pen-alty phase.

Id., at 122. When asked if the purpose of the
penalty phase was to "individualize the defendant," Dice replied "[t]hat's your view of it as a lawyer, not mine," id., at124, and when asked why a capital proceeding is bifurcated,

Dice replied "God only knows," id., at 125.6 His co-counsel'spostconviction testimony confirms Dice's misguided views.
Discussing the penalty phase, co-counsel stated: "I don't be-lieve I understood the separate nature of it. I don't believe

(1968) (finding no general constitutional bar to a State's "exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment," i. e., "death-qualification" of a jury,
because of no proof that such a bar "results in an unrepresentative jury
on the issue of guilt or substantially increases the risk of conviction").

6 Dice's comments concerning the penalty phase are not only erroneous

in content, but inappropriate in tone. For example, when asked about
capital sentencing, he rejected the notion that the Constitution requires
an individualized death penalty decision: "The reason's political as far as
I'm concerned. The method is insanity . . . . I don't care whether it's
legal or not. When you kill people who kill people to show that killing
people is wrong, it's insane." State Postconviction Tr. 124.

more evidence in mitigating circumstances, in that phasealso."

Id., at 49.
The parties agree that Dice did four things in the penaltyphase. See Brief for Respondent 36. First, he made a brief

opening argument in the penalty phase asking for mercy.Second, in this opening, he referenced the evidence concerning Vietnam Veterans Syndrome that had been presented in
the guilt phase. Third, he brought out on cross-examinationof the State's witness who presented court records of respondent's prior convictions that Cone had been awarded theBronze Star in Vietnam, though he did not explain the significance of that decoration to the jury because he made no
closing remarks after the cross-examination. And, fourth,
outside of the jury's presence, he successfully objected to
the State's introduction of two photographs of the murder
victims. Aside from doing these things, however, Dice
did nothing before or during the penalty phase--he did not
interview witnesses aside from those relevant to the guilt
phase; he did not present testimony relevant to mitigation
from the witnesses who were available; and he made no plea
for Cone's life or closing remarks after the State's case.

Dice conceded that he did not interview various people
from Cone's past, such as his high school teachers and classmates, who could have testified that Cone was a good person
who did not engage in criminal behavior pre-Vietnam. Dice
agreed that such witnesses would likely have been available if Dice had, in his words, "been stupid enough to put
them on." State Postconviction Tr. 104. Apparently, Dice
did not interview these individuals in preparation for the
penalty phase, because he assumed that the State's crossexamination of those witnesses would emphasize the seriousness of Cone's post-Vietnam criminal behavior. Id., at 104-
105, 137. Dice's reasoning is doubtful to say the least
because, regardless of the state of Tennessee law, see ante,
at 696, n. 3, these post-Vietnam crimes were already known
to the jury through the State's penalty phase evidence of

Stevens, J., dissenting
respondent's prior convictions. Further, it is hard to imagine how evidence of Cone's post-Vietnam behavior would
change their assessments--indeed, Dice's whole case was
that Cone had changed.7

Dice also failed to present to the jury mitigation evidence
that he did have on hand. He admitted that other witnesses--including those whose testimony he promised to the
jury in the guilt phase opening, such as Cone's mother, sister,
and aunts--had been interviewed and were available to testify at the penalty phase. Dice had ready access to other
mitigation evidence as well: testimony from Cone himself (in
which he could have, among other things, expressed remorse
and discussed his brother's drowning and his fiance' e's murder), the letter of forgiveness from the victim's sister, the
Bronze Star, and the medical experts. Dice's post hoc reasons for not putting on these additional witnesses and evidence are puzzling, but appear to rest largely on his incorrect
assumption that the guilt phase record already included
"what little mitigating circumstances we had," State Postconviction Tr. 133, and his fear of the prosecutor, "who by all
accounts was an extremely effective advocate," ante, at 692;
see, e. g., State Postconviction Tr. 105, 107-108, 123, 136, 137.

7 The Court's brief descriptions of Dice's reasoning for his choices, see
ante, at 699-702, gives this reasoning more legitimacy than it merits.
Only by reading Dice's lengthy answers from the postconviction hearing
is it clear how confused and misguided Dice was. For example, with respect to the supposed damage that these mitigation witnesses could do,
Dice speaks in generalities about unsubstantiated fears: "Picture this scenario. You've got them on the stand; once you've put on this trial for life,
as we call it, you and I, and the burden is what now? It's only preponderance of the evidence. Comes now the skilled prosecutor, Mr. Strother,
over there, and says, oh, he was a good student in high school; right? And
Vietnam affected his mind; right? What about all the robberies he
pulled? They have him in prison in Oklahoma. I mean, he was in prison
once. Did you know about those things? And how about this and that,
you know, and other things Mr. Cone told me about? " State Postconviction Tr. 104-105.

710 BELL v. CONE

Stevens, J., dissenting
Although the guilt phase evidence included informationabout Cone's post-Vietnam behavior, it told the jury little

about Cone's earlier life.8 During the guilt phase, Dice hada difficult enough time convincing the court to allow him to
present evidence of respondent's post-Vietnam behavior anddrug addiction as an insanity defense, that he did not seriously attempt to introduce evidence of respondent's childhood. However, such evidence would have been permissible
mitigation in the penalty phase. This evidence would have
revealed Cone to be "a quiet, studious child," with "absolutely no suggestion of any behavioral disturbance, even in
adolescence." App. 93. Indeed, his mother could have described him as a "perfect" child, ibid., and she "absolutely"
wanted to testify at the penalty hearing to make a plea for
Cone's life, but Dice "wouldn't put her on even if she'd
wanted to," because he "did not feel that she did well on the
stand," and because of "the cross-examination skills of the
District Attorney involved." State Postconviction Tr. 97-
98, 193. Dice's claim that she had not made a good witness
at the guilt phase, see ante, at 700, is contradicted by the
transcript of her straightforward trial testimony, Tr. 1631-
1656, and his desire not to subject her to cross-examination
is surely an insufficient reason, absent more, to prevent her
from asking the jury to spare her son's life.

Dice also did not call as witnesses in mitigation either of
Cone's sisters or his aunt, all of whom were promised in
Dice's opening statement. Dice's statement that Cone's sister Sue "did not want to testify," ante, at 700, is contradicted
by his opening statement. And his fear that she might have
been questioned "about the fact that [Cone] called her from
the [victims'] house just after the killings," ibid., is unfounded: Evidence of this call was already in the record, and
further reference to the call could do no conceivable additional harm to Cone's case. Indeed, Dice's justification for

8 Cf. Levin, 46 Am. Jur. Trials $ 37 ("Counsel needs to clearly draw the
contrast in the client from before and after Vietnam").

Stevens, J., dissenting
not calling Sue merely illustrates Dice's extraordinary fearof his adversaries. Dice's explanation for his failure to call

Cone's other sister, Rita, is even more unsatisfying: "I thinkthat we had a letter exchange or a phone call. My tactics
do not necessarily involve putting the family on down herebecause, again, . . . I thought that we were in a position
which we should say was tenuous from the outset." State
Postconviction Tr. 136. His failure to call Cone's aunt is un-explained. His failure to offer into evidence the letter written by the victim's sister, offering her prayers for Cone, isalso unexplained. See n. 2,

supra.
Dice did not put Cone on the stand during the penaltyphase, forfeiting the opportunity for him to express the

remorse he apparently felt, see Tr. 1675. Dice testifiedthat he discussed with Cone the possibility of testifying,
but opted not to call him at the penalty phase because offear that respondent might "lash out if pressed on crossexamination." Ante, at 700. He also claimed that Conemade the decision not to testify at the penalty phase because
Cone feared the prosecutor. In Dice's words, Cone "realized
that [the prosecutor] was a very intelligent and skilledcross-examiner and [Cone] felt that he would go off if he took

the stand." State Postconviction Tr. 103. However, this
explanation conspicuously echoes Dice's own fears about the
prosecutor's prowess. Furthermore, respondent testified
that Dice never "urged [him] as to the importance of testifying at the penalty stage," id., at 204, and Dice testified that
his duties did not include urging Cone to testify, id., at 119.
Given the undisputed evidence of Cone's intelligence and no
indication that his behavior in the courtroom was anything
but exemplary, it is difficult to imagine why any competent
lawyer would so readily abandon any effort to persuade his
client to take the stand when his life was at stake. Dice's
claim that he did no more than permit Cone to reach his own
decision about testifying in the penalty phase is simply not
credible. Rather, it appears that Dice, fearful of the prosecutor, did not specifically discuss testifying in the penalty

phase with Cone, but rather discussed with him the possibil-ity of taking the stand on only one occasion--during the guilt

phase of the trial.9Dice's failure to recall the medical experts who testified in
the guilt phase is a closer question, and may have been justi-fied by his belief that they could not add anything that had
not already been presented to the jury.10 Nevertheless, hadthey been called, Dice could have made the point, likely lost
on the jury as a result of Dice's "strategy," that the experts'appraisal of Cone had mitigating significance, even if it did
not establish his insanity. For there is a vast difference be-tween insanity--which the defense utterly failed to prove--
and the possible mitigating effect of drug addiction incurredas a result of honorable service in the military. By not emphasizing this distinction, Dice made it far less likely thatthe jury would treat either the trauma resulting from Cone's
tour of duty in Vietnam 11 or other traumatic events in his

9 This conclusion follows from Cone's testimony that he was only
consulted once, in a three-person conference, about testifying, before he
got on the stand to state that he would not be testifying. State Postconviction Tr. 203-204. Cone initially recalled that this meeting occurred in
the penalty stage, though he then expressed uncertainty on this point;
however, he remained certain that there had been only one meeting.
See ibid. The conference must have concerned the guilt phase, because
it was during the guilt phase that Cone waived his right to testify. See
Tr. 1865-1866. Furthermore, Dice's co-counsel does not remember a discussion concerning Cone's possible testimony at the penalty phase, State
Postconviction Tr. 35, 48; Dice himself testified repeatedly that Cone does
not lie, id., at 117, 120, 139, 141; and Dice himself was unable to state for
certain that Cone was consulted about penalty phase testimony, id., at 118.

10 Indeed, had counsel's performance not been so completely deficient,

this would be the sort of strategic choice about which counsel would be
owed deference under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 689 (1984).
In this case, however, because of Dice's total failure in the penalty phase,
it is difficult to credit even arguably reasonable choices as the result of
"reasonable professional judgment," id., at 690. See infra, at 717-718.

and traumatic experiences while there. For example, the stench from the

life 12 as mitigating. And, again, the reason for Dice's failureis that Dice himself failed to appreciate this distinction, for

he believed that the "jury had completely rejected" the ex-perts' testimony after losing at the guilt phase. Id., at 156.

In addition to performing no penalty phase investigationand failing to introduce available mitigation, Dice made no
closing statement after the State's affirmative case for death.Rather, Dice's "strategy" was to rely on his brief penalty
phase opening statement. This opening statement did referto the evidence of drug addiction and the expert testimony
already in the record, though it is unclear to what end, asDice believed that the jury had "completely rejected" this
testimony, ibid. Dice's statement also explained that re-spondent's drug abuse began under the "stress and strain of
combat service," Tr. 2118, even though the jurors knew thatCone had not been in combat. Otherwise, Dice failed to describe the substantial mitigating evidence of which he wasaware: Cone's Bronze Star; his good character before entering the military; the deaths in his family; the rape and mur-der of his fiance' e; and his loving relationships with his
mother, his sisters, and his aunt. At best, Dice's openingstatement and plea for Cone's life was perfunctory; indeed,
it occupies only 41/2 of the total 2,158 trial transcript pages.Dice's decision not to make a closing argument was most
strongly motivated by his fear that his adversary wouldmake a persuasive argument depicting Cone as a heartless

food; witnessing death; being required, even on occasion to fire a weapon;
the long hours of guard duty; and the escalating drug abuse, often ostensibly sanctioned by superior officers." App. 96.

12 According to a defense psychologist's report about Cone, the major

traumas in his life have been: "witnessing his brother's body being removed from the lake"; "[h]is grandmother's death, just after high school
graduation. Gary lived with her, and clearly viewed her as a safe haven
from his father"; "[d]uty in Vietnam, 1968-1969. Although not a combat
soldier, experiences were beyond the realm of normal experiences for a
20-year-old"; and the "[r]ape and murder of his fiance'e in December 1972."

killer. At all costs, Dice wanted to avoid the prosecutor"slash[ing] me to pieces on rebuttal," as "[h]e's done . . . a

hundred times." State Postconviction Tr. 123. Dice hopedthat by not making a closing statement, the prosecutor would
"kind of follo[w] me right down the primrose path." Id., at107. Of course, at the time Dice waived closing argument,
the aggravating circumstances had already been proved, andDice knew that the judge would instruct the jury to return
a verdict of death unless the jurors were persuaded that theaggravating circumstances were outweighed by mitigating
evidence. Perhaps that burden was insurmountable, but thejury must have viewed the absence of any argument in response to the State's case for death as Dice's concession thatno case for life could be made. A closing argument provided
the only chance to avoid the inevitable outcome of the "prim-rose path"--a death sentence.

13

Both of the experienced criminal lawyers who testified asexpert witnesses in the state postconviction proceedings refused to state categorically that it would never be appro-priate to waive closing argument, to fail to put the defendant
on the stand during the penalty phase of the trial, or to offerno mitigating evidence in the penalty phase. Both witnesses agreed, however, that Dice's tactical decisions were

13 In his postconviction testimony, Dice offered another reason for waiving closing argument. He claimed that the State, in its penalty phase
case, had "screw[ed] up the aggravated circumstances" by arguing to the
jury an aggravating factor that was unsupported by the evidence--that
the lives of two or more people other than the victims were endangered
by the defendant. State Postconviction Tr. 108. Dice testified that he
was concerned that if he made a closing argument, the State might realize
its mistake and correct the error in its rebuttal closing argument. See
id., at 103-104. Not only is Dice's explanation incredible, but, unsurprisingly, Dice's "strategy" did not work "perfectly," as Dice claimed it did,
id., at 103, because the State Supreme Court found any error concerning
the aggravators to be harmless, State v. Cone, 665 S. W. 2d 87, 95 (Tenn.
1984). More importantly, such a "strategy" is never appropriate; counsel's
hope for an appellate victory concerning one trial error cannot justify abdication of his duty as advocate for the remainder of the proceeding.

highly abnormal, and perhaps unprecedented in a capitalcase.

II
On these facts, and as a result of Dice's overwhelming fail-ure at the penalty phase, the Court of Appeals properly concluded that Cronic controls the Sixth Amendment claim inthis case, and that prejudice to respondent should be presumed. Given Dice's repeated and unequivocal testimonyabout Cone's truthfulness, together with Cone's apparent
feelings of remorse, see Tr. 1675, Dice's decision not to offerCone's testimony in the penalty phase is simply bewildering.
And his decisions to present no mitigation case in the penaltyphase,

14 and to offer no closing argument in the face of the

prosecution's request for death,15 are nothing short of incred-ible. Moreover, Dice's explanations for his decisions not

only were uncorroborated, but were, in my judgment, pat-ently unsatisfactory. Indeed, his rambling and often incoherent descriptions of his unusual trial strategy lend strongsupport to the Court of Appeals' evaluation of this case and
its decision not to defer to Dice's lack of meaningful partici-pation in the penalty phase as "strategy."

16

Although the state courts did not have the benefit of evi-dence concerning Dice's mental health, it appears from Dice's

14 Cf. Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 319 (1989) ("If the sentencer is
to make an individualized assessment of the appropriateness of the death
penalty, `evidence about the defendant's background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who
commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background,
or to emotional and mental problems, may be less culpable than defendants
who have no such excuse' " (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538,
545 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring))).

15 Cf. Herring v. New York, 422 U. S. 853, 862 (1975) ("In a criminal trial,

which is in the end basically a factfinding process, no aspect of such advocacy could be more important than the opportunity finally to marshal the
evidence for each side before submission of the case to judgment").

16 Dice's main explanation of his decision to waive closing argument at

the close of the penalty hearing is quoted in an appendix to this opinion.

Stevens, J., dissenting
medical records that he suffered from a severe mental im-pairment. He began treatment for this illness a couple of

years after trial, and he committed suicide approximately sixmonths after the postconviction hearing in this case. See
App. 88-89. The symptoms of his disorder included "con-fused thinking, impaired memory, inability to concentrate for
more than a short period of time, paranoia, grandiosity, [and]
inappropriate behavior." Id., at 88. While these mentalhealth problems may have onset after Cone's trial, a complete reading of the trial transcript and an assessment ofDice's actions at trial suggest this not to be the case.

A theme of fear of possible counterthrusts by his adversaries permeates Dice's loquacious explanations of his tactical
decisions. But fear of the opponent cannot justify such absolute dereliction of a lawyer's duty to the client--especially
a client facing death. For "[t]he very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on
both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective
that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free." Herring v. New York, 422 U. S. 853, 862 (1975). There may be
cases in which such timidity is consistent with a "meaningful
adversarial testing" of the prosecution's case, Cronic, 466
U. S., at 659, but my examination of the record has produced
a firm conviction that this is not such a case.

The Court claims that Cronic's second prong only applies
when "counsel failed to oppose the prosecution throughout
the sentencing proceeding as a whole." Ante, at 697 (emphasis added). But that is exactly what Dice did. It is
true, as the Court claims, that respondent's complaints about
Dice's performance can be framed as complaints about what
Dice failed to do "at specific points," ibid. However, when
those complaints concern "points" that encompass all of counsel's fundamental duties at a capital sentencing proceeding--
performing a mitigation investigation, putting on available
mitigation evidence, and making a plea for the defendant's
life after the State has asked for death--counsel has failed

535US3 Unit: $U51 [09-22-03 21:02:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

717Cite as: 535 U. S. 685 (2002)
Stevens, J., dissenting
"entirely," ibid. (quoting Cronic, 466 U. S., at 659 (emphasisomitted)). The Court of Appeals' conclusion in this regard

exemplifies a court's proper use of its judgment to recognizewhen failures "at specific points" amount to an "entir[e] fail[ure]" within the meaning of Cronic. We recognized the im-portance of the exercise of such judgment in

Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), in which we explained that
Sixth Amendment principles are "not . . . mechanical rules,"and that "[i]n every case the court should be concerned with

whether, despite the strong presumption of reliability, theresult of the particular proceeding is unreliable because of a
breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts
on to produce just results." Id., at 698.

The majority also claims that Cronic's second prong does
not apply because this Court has previously analyzed claims
"of the same ilk," ante, at 697, under Strickland, not Cronic.
However, in none of our previous cases applying Strickland
to a penalty phase ineffectiveness claim did the challenged
attorney not only fail to conduct a penalty phase investigation, but also fail to put on available mitigation evidence and
fail to make a closing argument asking to spare the defendant's life. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000);
Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776 (1987); and Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168 (1986). Furthermore, in none of these
cases was there evidence that counsel had as "radical" a view
of the penalty phase as Dice's, and in none of these cases
was the lawyer's own mental health called into question, as
it has been here. It is, of course, true that a "total" failure
claim, which we confront here, could theoretically be analyzed under Strickland. However, as Cronic makes clear,
see ante, at 695-696, although Strickland could apply in all
Sixth Amendment right to counsel cases, it does not.

Moreover, presuming prejudice when counsel has entirely
failed to function as an adversary makes sense, for three reasons. First, counsel's complete failure to advocate, coupled
here with his likely mental illness, undermines Strickland's

535US3 Unit: $U51 [09-22-03 21:02:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
718 BELL v. CONE

Stevens, J., dissenting
basic assumption: that counsel has "made all significant deci-sions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment."

466 U. S., at 690. Second, a proper Strickland inquiry isdifficult, if not impossible, to conduct when counsel has completely abdicated his role as advocate, because the abdicationresults in an incomplete trial record from which a court cannot properly evaluate whether a defendant has or has notsuffered prejudice from the attorney's conduct. Finally,
counsel's total failure as an adversary renders "the likelihoodthat the verdict is unreliable" to be "so high that a caseby-case inquiry is unnecessary." Mickens v. Taylor, ante,at 166.

The Court's holding today is entirely consistent with itsrecent decision in

Mickens. In both cases, according to theCourt, a presumption that every lawyer in every capital case

has performed ethically, diligently, and competently is appro-priate because such performance generally characterizes the
members of an honorable profession. It is nevertheless truethat there are rare cases in which blind reliance on that presumption, or uncritical analysis of a lawyer's proffered explanations for aberrant behavior in the courtroom, may resultin the denial of the constitutional "right to the effective assistance of counsel." McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759,771, n. 14 (1970). The importance of protecting this right in
capital cases cannot be overstated.17 Effective representa17 A recent, comprehensive report issued by the Governor's Commission
reviewing Illinois' capital punishment system concluded: " `Providing qualified counsel is perhaps the most important safeguard against the wrongful
conviction, sentencing, and execution of capital defendants. It is also a
safeguard far too often ignored.' " Report of the Governor's Commission
on Capital Punishment 105 (2002) (quoting Constitution Project, Mandatory Justice: Eighteen Reforms to the Death Penalty 6 (2001)).

Members of this Court have similarly recognized both the importance
of qualified counsel in death cases, and the frequent lack thereof. See,
e. g., McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 1256 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting
from denial of certiorari) (describing the "crisis in trial and state postconviction legal representation for capital defendants"); Lane, O'Connor Ex535US3 Unit: $U51 [09-22-03 21:02:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion provides "the means through which the other rights ofthe person on trial are secured." Cronic, 466 U. S., at 653.

For that reason, there is "a denial of Sixth Amendmentrights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively
unreliable" whenever defense counsel "entirely fails to sub-ject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversary testing."
Id., at 659. That is exactly what happened in the penaltyphase of Gary Cone's trial.

I respectfully dissent.

tell you this much. Let's say that when we'd gotten downthere that Mr. Strother had gotten up and made the first

have made it. But once Patterson made the first argument,and then those statements that were reported in the press

FESTO CORP. v. SHOKETSU KINZOKU KOGYOKABUSHIKI CO., LTD.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 00-1543. Argued January 8, 2002--Decided May 28, 2002
Petitioner Festo Corporation owns two patents for an industrial device.

When the patent examiner rejected the initial application for the first
patent because of defects in description, 35 U. S. C. $ 112, the application
was amended to add the new limitations that the device would contain
a pair of one-way sealing rings and that its outer sleeve would be made
of a magnetizable material. The second patent was also amended during a reexamination proceeding to add the sealing rings limitation.
After Festo began selling its device, respondents (hereinafter SMC) entered the market with a similar device that uses one two-way sealing
ring and a nonmagnetizable sleeve. Festo filed suit, claiming that
SMC's device is so similar that it infringes Festo's patents under the
doctrine of equivalents. The District Court ruled for Festo, rejecting
SMC's argument that the prosecution history estopped Festo from saying that SMC's device is equivalent. A Federal Circuit panel initially
affirmed, but this Court granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded in
light of Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S.
17, 29, which had acknowledged that competitors may rely on the prosecution history to estop the patentee from recapturing subject matter
surrendered by amendment as a condition of obtaining the patent. On
remand, the en banc Federal Circuit reversed, holding that prosecution
history estoppel applied. The court ruled that estoppel arises from any
amendment that narrows a claim to comply with the Patent Act, not
only from amendments made to avoid the prior art, as the District Court
had held. The Federal Circuit also held that, when estoppel applies, it
bars any claim of equivalence for the element that was amended. The
court acknowledged that, under its prior cases, prosecution history estoppel constituted a flexible bar, foreclosing some, but not all, claims
of equivalence, depending on the purpose of the amendment and the
alterations in the text. However, the court overruled its precedents
on the ground that their case-by-case approach had proved unworkable.

Held: Prosecution history estoppel may apply to any claim amendment

made to satisfy the Patent Act's requirements, not just to amendments
made to avoid the prior art, but estoppel need not bar suit against every
equivalent to the amended claim element. Pp. 730-742.

Syllabus
(a) To enable a patent holder to know what he owns, and the public
to know what he does not, the inventor must describe his work in "full,
clear, concise, and exact terms." $ 112. However, patent claim language may not describe with complete precision the range of an invention's novelty. If patents were always interpreted by their literal
terms, their value would be greatly diminished. Insubstantial substitutes for certain elements could defeat the patent, and its value to inventors could be destroyed by simple acts of copying. Thus, a patent's
scope is not limited to its literal terms, but embraces all equivalents
to the claims described. See Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330, 347.
Nevertheless, because it may be difficult to determine what is, or is not,
an equivalent, competitors may be deterred from engaging in legitimate
manufactures outside the patent's limits, or lulled into developing competing products that the patent secures, thereby prompting wasteful
litigation. Each time the Court has considered the doctrine of equivalents, it has acknowledged this uncertainty as the price of ensuring the
appropriate incentives for innovation, and it has affirmed the doctrine
over dissents that urged a more certain rule. See, e. g., id., at 343, 347.
Most recently, Warner-Jenkinson, supra, at 28, reaffirmed the doctrine. Pp. 730-733.

(b) Prosecution history estoppel requires that patent claims be interpreted in light of the proceedings before the Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO). When the patentee originally claimed the subject matter
alleged to infringe but then narrowed the claim in response to a rejection, he may not argue that the surrendered territory comprised an
unforeseen equivalent. See Exhibit Supply Co. v. Ace Patents Corp.,
315 U. S. 126, 136-137. The rejection indicates that the patent examiner does not believe the original claim could be patented. While the
patentee has the right to appeal, his decision to forgo an appeal and
submit an amended claim is taken as a concession that the invention as
patented does not reach as far as the original claim. See, e. g., Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222, 228. Were it otherwise, the inventor might avoid the PTO's gatekeeping role and seek to
recapture in an infringement action the very subject matter surrendered as a condition of receiving the patent. Pp. 733-735.

(c) Prosecution history estoppel is not limited to amendments intended to narrow the patented invention's subject matter, e. g., to avoid
prior art, but may apply to a narrowing amendment made to satisfy any
Patent Act requirement, including $ 112's requirements concerning the
patent application's form. In Warner-Jenkinson, the Court made clear
that estoppel applies to amendments made for a "substantial reason related to patentability," 520 U. S., at 33, but did not purport to catalog
every reason that might raise an estoppel. Indeed, it stated that even

Syllabus

if the amendment's purpose were unrelated to patentability, the court
might consider whether it was the kind of reason that nonetheless might
require estoppel. Id., at 40-41. Simply because estoppel has been discussed most often in the context of amendments made to avoid the prior
art, see, e. g., id., at 30, it does not follow that amendments made for
other purposes will not give rise to estoppel. Section 112 requires that
the application describe, enable, and set forth the best mode of carrying
out the invention. The patent should not issue if these requirements
are not satisfied, and an applicant's failure to meet them could lead to
the issued patent being held invalid in later litigation. Festo's argument that amendments made to comply with $ 112 concern the application's form and not the invention's subject matter conflates the patentee's reason for making the amendment with the impact the amendment
has on the subject matter. Estoppel arises when an amendment is
made to secure the patent and the amendment narrows the patent's
scope. If a $ 112 amendment is truly cosmetic, it would not narrow the
patent's scope or raise an estoppel. But if a $ 112 amendment is necessary and narrows the patent's scope--even if only for better description--estoppel may apply. Pp. 735-737.

(d) Prosecution history estoppel does not bar the inventor from asserting infringement against every equivalent to the narrowed element.
Though estoppel can bar challenges to a wide range of equivalents, its
reach requires an examination of the subject matter surrendered by
the narrowing amendment. The Federal Circuit's complete bar rule is
inconsistent with the purpose of applying the estoppel in the first
place--to hold the inventor to the representations made during the application process and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn from
the amendment. By amending the application, the inventor is deemed
to concede that the patent does not extend as far as the original claim,
not that the amended claim is so perfect in its description that no one
could devise an equivalent. The Court's view is consistent with precedent and PTO practice. The Court has consistently applied the doctrine in a flexible way, considering what equivalents were surrendered
during a patent's prosecution, rather than imposing a complete bar that
resorts to the very literalism the equivalents rule is designed to overcome. E. g., Goodyear Dental, supra, at 230. The Federal Circuit
ignored Warner-Jenkinson's instruction that courts must be cautious
before adopting changes that disrupt the settled expectations of the
inventing community. See 520 U. S., at 28. Inventors who amended
their claims under the previous case law had no reason to believe they
were conceding all equivalents. Had they known, they might have
appealed the rejection instead. Warner-Jenkinson struck the appropriate balance by placing the burden on the patentee to prove that an

Syllabus
amendment was not made for a reason that would give rise to estoppel.
Id., at 33. Similarly, the patentee should bear the burden of showing
that the amendment does not surrender the particular equivalent in
question. As the author of the claim language, his decision to narrow
his claims through amendment may be presumed to be a general disclaimer of the territory between the original claim and the amended
claim. Exhibit Supply, supra, at 136-137. However, in cases in which
the amendment cannot reasonably be viewed as surrendering a particular equivalent--e. g., where the equivalent was unforeseeable at the time
of the application or the rationale underlying the amendment bears but
a tangential relation to the equivalent--the patentee can rebut the presumption that prosecution history estoppel bars a finding of equivalence
by showing that at the time of the amendment one skilled in the art
could not reasonably be expected to have drafted a claim that would
have literally encompassed the alleged equivalent. Pp. 737-741.

(e) Whether Festo has rebutted the presumptions that estoppel
applies and that the equivalents at issue have been surrendered should
be determined in the first instance by further proceedings below.

Opinion of the Court
firmed that a patent protects its holder against efforts ofcopyists to evade liability for infringement by making only

insubstantial changes to a patented invention. At the sametime, we appreciated that by extending protection beyond
the literal terms in a patent the doctrine of equivalents cancreate substantial uncertainty about where the patent monopoly ends. Id., at 29. If the range of equivalents is unclear, competitors may be unable to determine what is apermitted alternative to a patented invention and what is

an infringing equivalent.To reduce the uncertainty,

Warner-Jenkinson acknowledged that competitors may rely on the prosecution history,
the public record of the patent proceedings. In some cases
the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) may have rejected
an earlier version of the patent application on the ground
that a claim does not meet a statutory requirement for patentability. 35 U. S. C. $ 132 (1994 ed., Supp. V). When the
patentee responds to the rejection by narrowing his claims,
this prosecution history estops him from later arguing that
the subject matter covered by the original, broader claim
was nothing more than an equivalent. Competitors may
rely on the estoppel to ensure that their own devices will not
be found to infringe by equivalence.

In the decision now under review the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit held that by narrowing a claim to obtain
a patent, the patentee surrenders all equivalents to the
amended claim element. Petitioner asserts this holding departs from past precedent in two respects. First, it applies
estoppel to every amendment made to satisfy the requirements of the Patent Act and not just to amendments made
to avoid pre-emption by an earlier invention, i. e., the prior
art. Second, it holds that when estoppel arises, it bars suit
against every equivalent to the amended claim element.
The Court of Appeals acknowledged that this holding departed from its own cases, which applied a flexible bar when
considering what claims of equivalence were estopped by the

Opinion of the Court

prosecution history. Petitioner argues that by replacing theflexible bar with a complete bar the Court of Appeals cast

doubt on many existing patents that were amended duringthe application process when the law, as it then stood, did
not apply so rigorous a standard.We granted certiorari to consider these questions.

I
Petitioner Festo Corporation owns two patents for an im-proved magnetic rodless cylinder, a piston-driven device that

relies on magnets to move objects in a conveying system.The device has many industrial uses and has been employed
in machinery as diverse as sewing equipment and the Thun-der Mountain ride at Disney World. Although the precise
details of the cylinder's operation are not essential here, theprosecution history must be considered.

Petitioner's patent applications, as often occurs, wereamended during the prosecution proceedings. The application for the first patent, the Stoll Patent (U. S. PatentNo. 4,354,125), was amended after the patent examiner rejected the initial application because the exact method ofoperation was unclear and some claims were made in an
impermissible way. (They were multiply dependent.) 35U. S. C. $ 112 (1994 ed.). The inventor, Dr. Stoll, submitted
a new application designed to meet the examiner's objectionsand also added certain references to prior art. 37 CFR

$ 1.56 (2000). The second patent, the Carroll Patent (U. S.Patent No. 3,779,401), was also amended during a reexamination proceeding. The prior art references were added tothis amended application as well. Both amended patents
added a new limitation--that the inventions contain a pair ofsealing rings, each having a lip on one side, which would
prevent impurities from getting on the piston assembly.The amended Stoll Patent added the further limitation that
the outer shell of the device, the sleeve, be made of a magne-tizable material.

Opinion of the Court
After Festo began selling its rodless cylinder, respondents(whom we refer to as SMC) entered the market with a device

similar, but not identical, to the ones disclosed by Festo'spatents. SMC's cylinder, rather than using two one-way
sealing rings, employs a single sealing ring with a two-waylip. Furthermore, SMC's sleeve is made of a nonmagnetizable alloy. SMC's device does not fall within the literal
claims of either patent, but petitioner contends that it is sosimilar that it infringes under the doctrine of equivalents.

SMC contends that Festo is estopped from making thisargument because of the prosecution history of its patents.
The sealing rings and the magnetized alloy in the Festo
product were both disclosed for the first time in the amended
applications. In SMC's view, these amendments narrowed
the earlier applications, surrendering alternatives that are
the very points of difference in the competing devices--the
sealing rings and the type of alloy used to make the sleeve.
As Festo narrowed its claims in these ways in order to obtain
the patents, says SMC, Festo is now estopped from saying
that these features are immaterial and that SMC's device is
an equivalent of its own.

The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts disagreed. It held that Festo's amendments were
not made to avoid prior art, and therefore the amendments
were not the kind that give rise to estoppel. A panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. 72 F. 3d
857 (1995). We granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded
in light of our intervening decision in Warner-Jenkinson Co.
v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U. S. 17 (1997). After a
decision by the original panel on remand, 172 F. 3d 1361
(1999), the Court of Appeals ordered rehearing en banc to
address questions that had divided its judges since our decision in Warner-Jenkinson. 187 F. 3d 1381 (1999).

The en banc court reversed, holding that prosecution history estoppel barred Festo from asserting that the accused
device infringed its patents under the doctrine of equiva535US3 Unit: $U52 [09-25-03 20:46:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

lents. 234 F. 3d 558 (2000). The court held, with only onejudge dissenting, that estoppel arises from any amendment

that narrows a claim to comply with the Patent Act, not onlyfrom amendments made to avoid prior art. Id., at 566.
More controversial in the Court of Appeals was its furtherholding: When estoppel applies, it stands as a complete bar
against any claim of equivalence for the element that wasamended.

Id., at 574-575. The court acknowledged thatits own prior case law did not go so far. Previous decisions

had held that prosecution history estoppel constituted a flex-ible bar, foreclosing some, but not all, claims of equivalence,
depending on the purpose of the amendment and the alter-ations in the text. The court concluded, however, that its
precedents applying the flexible-bar rule should be overruledbecause this case-by-case approach has proved unworkable.
In the court's view a complete-bar rule, under which estoppelbars all claims of equivalence to the narrowed element,
would promote certainty in the determination of infringe-ment cases.

Four judges dissented from the decision to adopt a com-plete bar.

Id., at 562. In four separate opinions, the dis-senters argued that the majority's decision to overrule precedent was contrary to Warner-Jenkinson and would unsettlethe expectations of many existing patentees. Judge Michel,
in his dissent, described in detail how the complete bar re-quired the Court of Appeals to disregard 8 older decisions of
this Court, as well as more than 50 of its own cases. 234F. 3d, at 601-616.

We granted certiorari. 533 U. S. 915 (2001).

The patent laws "promote the Progress of Science and use-ful Arts" by rewarding innovation with a temporary monopoly. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8. The monopoly is a prop-erty right; and like any property right, its boundaries should
be clear. This clarity is essential to promote progress, be535US3 Unit: $U52 [09-25-03 20:46:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cause it enables efficient investment in innovation. A patentholder should know what he owns, and the public should

know what he does not. For this reason, the patent lawsrequire inventors to describe their work in "full, clear, concise, and exact terms," 35 U. S. C. $ 112, as part of the deli-cate balance the law attempts to maintain between inventors, who rely on the promise of the law to bring the
invention forth, and the public, which should be encouragedto pursue innovations, creations, and new ideas beyond the

inventor's exclusive rights. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder
Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 150 (1989).

Unfortunately, the nature of language makes it impossibleto capture the essence of a thing in a patent application.

The inventor who chooses to patent an invention and discloseit to the public, rather than exploit it in secret, bears the risk
that others will devote their efforts toward exploiting thelimits of the patent's language:

"An invention exists most importantly as a tangiblestructure or a series of drawings. A verbal portrayal
is usually an afterthought written to satisfy the require-ments of patent law. This conversion of machine to
words allows for unintended idea gaps which cannot besatisfactorily filled. Often the invention is novel and
words do not exist to describe it. The dictionary does
not always keep abreast of the inventor. It cannot.Things are not made for the sake of words, but words

for things." Autogiro Co. of America v. United States,384 F. 2d 391, 397 (Ct. Cl. 1967).

The language in the patent claims may not capture every
nuance of the invention or describe with complete precision
the range of its novelty. If patents were always interpreted
by their literal terms, their value would be greatly diminished. Unimportant and insubstantial substitutes for certain elements could defeat the patent, and its value to inventors could be destroyed by simple acts of copying. For this

Opinion of the Court

reason, the clearest rule of patent interpretation, literalism,may conserve judicial resources but is not necessarily the

most efficient rule. The scope of a patent is not limited toits literal terms but instead embraces all equivalents to the
claims described. See Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330,347 (1854).

It is true that the doctrine of equivalents renders the
scope of patents less certain. It may be difficult to deter-mine what is, or is not, an equivalent to a particular element

of an invention. If competitors cannot be certain about apatent's extent, they may be deterred from engaging in legitimate manufactures outside its limits, or they may invest by
mistake in competing products that the patent secures. In
addition the uncertainty may lead to wasteful litigation between competitors, suits that a rule of literalism might avoid.
These concerns with the doctrine of equivalents, however,
are not new. Each time the Court has considered the doctrine, it has acknowledged this uncertainty as the price of
ensuring the appropriate incentives for innovation, and it has
affirmed the doctrine over dissents that urged a more certain
rule. When the Court in Winans v. Denmead, supra, first
adopted what has become the doctrine of equivalents, it
stated that "[t]he exclusive right to the thing patented is not
secured, if the public are at liberty to make substantial copies of it, varying its form or proportions." Id., at 343. The
dissent argued that the Court had sacrificed the objective of
"[f]ul[l]ness, clearness, exactness, preciseness, and particularity, in the description of the invention." Id., at 347 (opinion of Campbell, J.).

The debate continued in Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde
Air Products Co., 339 U. S. 605 (1950), where the Court reaffirmed the doctrine. Graver Tank held that patent claims
must protect the inventor not only from those who produce
devices falling within the literal claims of the patent but also
from copyists who "make unimportant and insubstantial
changes and substitutions in the patent which, though adding

535US3 Unit: $U52 [09-25-03 20:46:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nothing, would be enough to take the copied matter outside
the claim, and hence outside the reach of law." Id., at 607.
Justice Black, in dissent, objected that under the doctrine of
equivalents a competitor "cannot rely on what the language
of a patent claims. He must be able, at the peril of heavy
infringement damages, to forecast how far a court relatively
unversed in a particular technological field will expand the
claim's language . . . ." Id., at 617.

Most recently, in Warner-Jenkinson, the Court reaffirmed
that equivalents remain a firmly entrenched part of the settled rights protected by the patent. A unanimous opinion
concluded that if the doctrine is to be discarded, it is Congress and not the Court that should do so:

"[T]he lengthy history of the doctrine of equivalents
strongly supports adherence to our refusal in Graver
Tank to find that the Patent Act conflicts with that doctrine. Congress can legislate the doctrine of equivalents out of existence any time it chooses. The various
policy arguments now made by both sides are thus best
addressed to Congress, not this Court." 520 U. S., at
28.

III

Prosecution history estoppel requires that the claims of a
patent be interpreted in light of the proceedings in the PTO
during the application process. Estoppel is a "rule of patent
construction" that ensures that claims are interpreted by
reference to those "that have been cancelled or rejected."
Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., 311 U. S. 211,
220-221 (1940). The doctrine of equivalents allows the patentee to claim those insubstantial alterations that were not
captured in drafting the original patent claim but which
could be created through trivial changes. When, however,
the patentee originally claimed the subject matter alleged to
infringe but then narrowed the claim in response to a rejection, he may not argue that the surrendered territory com535US3 Unit: $U52 [09-25-03 20:46:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

prised unforeseen subject matter that should be deemedequivalent to the literal claims of the issued patent. On the

contrary, "[b]y the amendment [the patentee] recognized andemphasized the difference between the two phrases[,] . . . and
[t]he difference which [the patentee] thus disclaimed must beregarded as material."

Exhibit Supply Co. v. Ace Patents
Corp., 315 U. S. 126, 136-137 (1942).

A rejection indicates that the patent examiner does notbelieve the original claim could be patented. While the patentee has the right to appeal, his decision to forgo an appealand submit an amended claim is taken as a concession that
the invention as patented does not reach as far as the original claim. See Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, 102
U. S. 222, 228 (1880) ("In view of [the amendment] there can
be no doubt of what [the patentee] understood he had patented, and that both he and the commissioner regarded the

by the detailed process"); Wang Laboratories, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Electronics America, Inc., 103 F. 3d 1571, 1577-1578
(CA Fed. 1997) ("Prosecution history estoppel . . . preclud[es]
a patentee from regaining, through litigation, coverage of
subject matter relinquished during prosecution of the application for the patent"). Were it otherwise, the inventor
might avoid the PTO's gatekeeping role and seek to recapture in an infringement action the very subject matter surrendered as a condition of receiving the patent.

Prosecution history estoppel ensures that the doctrine of
equivalents remains tied to its underlying purpose. Where
the original application once embraced the purported equivalent but the patentee narrowed his claims to obtain the patent or to protect its validity, the patentee cannot assert that
he lacked the words to describe the subject matter in question. The doctrine of equivalents is premised on language's
inability to capture the essence of innovation, but a prior
application describing the precise element at issue undercuts
that premise. In that instance the prosecution history has

Opinion of the Court
established that the inventor turned his attention to the sub-ject matter in question, knew the words for both the broader

and narrower claim, and affirmatively chose the latter.

A
The first question in this case concerns the kinds of amend-ments that may give rise to estoppel. Petitioner argues

that estoppel should arise when amendments are intendedto narrow the subject matter of the patented invention, for
instance, amendments to avoid prior art, but not when theamendments are made to comply with requirements concerning the form of the patent application. In Warner-Jenkinson we recognized that prosecution history estoppel
does not arise in every instance when a patent applicationis amended. Our "prior cases have consistently applied
prosecution history estoppel only where claims have beenamended for a limited set of reasons," such as "to avoid the
prior art, or otherwise to address a specific concern--suchas obviousness--that arguably would have rendered the
claimed subject matter unpatentable." 520 U. S., at 30-32.While we made clear that estoppel applies to amendments
made for a "substantial reason related to patentability," id.,at 33, we did not purport to define that term or to catalog
every reason that might raise an estoppel. Indeed, westated that even if the amendment's purpose were unrelated
to patentability, the court might consider whether it was thekind of reason that nonetheless might require resort to the
estoppel doctrine. Id., at 40-41.Petitioner is correct that estoppel has been discussed most
often in the context of amendments made to avoid the priorart. See

Exh ib i t Supply Co., supra, at 137; KeystoneDriller Co. v. Northwest Engineering Corp., 294 U. S. 42, 48

(1935). Amendment to accommodate prior art was theemphasis, too, of our decision in Warner-Jenkinson, supra,
at 30. It does not follow, however, that amendments forother purposes will not give rise to estoppel. Prosecution

KABUSHIKI CO.

Opinion of the Court

history may rebut the inference that a thing not describedwas indescribable. That rationale does not cease simply

because the narrowing amendment, submitted to secure apatent, was for some purpose other than avoiding prior art.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that a narrowingamendment made to satisfy any requirement of the Patent
Act may give rise to an estoppel. As that court explained,
a number of statutory requirements must be satisfied beforea patent can issue. The claimed subject matter must be useful, novel, and not obvious. 35 U. S. C. $$ 101-103 (1994 ed.and Supp. V). In addition, the patent application must describe, enable, and set forth the best mode of carrying out
the invention. $ 112 (1994 ed.). These latter requirements
must be satisfied before issuance of the patent, for exclusive
patent rights are given in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public. See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 150-151.
What is claimed by the patent application must be the same
as what is disclosed in the specification; otherwise the patent
should not issue. The patent also should not issue if the
other requirements of $ 112 are not satisfied, and an applicant's failure to meet these requirements could lead to the
issued patent being held invalid in later litigation.

Petitioner contends that amendments made to comply with

$ 112 concern the form of the application and not the subject
matter of the invention. The PTO might require the applicant to clarify an ambiguous term, to improve the translation
of a foreign word, or to rewrite a dependent claim as an
independent one. In these cases, petitioner argues, the applicant has no intention of surrendering subject matter and
should not be estopped from challenging equivalent devices.
While this may be true in some cases, petitioner's argument
conflates the patentee's reason for making the amendment
with the impact the amendment has on the subject matter.

Estoppel arises when an amendment is made to secure the
patent and the amendment narrows the patent's scope. If a

$ 112 amendment is truly cosmetic, then it would not narrow

Opinion of the Court
the patent's scope or raise an estoppel. On the other hand,if a $ 112 amendment is necessary and narrows the patent's

scope--even if only for the purpose of better description--estoppel may apply. A patentee who narrows a claim as a
condition for obtaining a patent disavows his claim to thebroader subject matter, whether the amendment was made
to avoid the prior art or to comply with $ 112. We mustregard the patentee as having conceded an inability to claim
the broader subject matter or at least as having abandonedhis right to appeal a rejection. In either case estoppel
may apply. B

Petitioner concedes that the limitations at issue--the seal-ing rings and the composition of the sleeve--were made for
reasons related to $ 112, if not also to avoid the prior art.Our conclusion that prosecution history estoppel arises when
a claim is narrowed to comply with $ 112 gives rise to thesecond question presented: Does the estoppel bar the inventor from asserting infringement against any equivalent tothe narrowed element or might some equivalents still infringe? The Court of Appeals held that prosecution historyestoppel is a complete bar, and so the narrowed element must
be limited to its strict literal terms. Based upon its experi-ence the Court of Appeals decided that the flexible-bar rule
is unworkable because it leads to excessive uncertainty andburdens legitimate innovation. For the reasons that follow,
we disagree with the decision to adopt the complete bar.Though prosecution history estoppel can bar a patentee
from challenging a wide range of alleged equivalents madeor distributed by competitors, its reach requires an examination of the subject matter surrendered by the narrowingamendment. The complete bar avoids this inquiry by establishing a per se rule; but that approach is inconsistent withthe purpose of applying the estoppel in the first place--to
hold the inventor to the representations made during theapplication process and to the inferences that may reason535US3 Unit: $U52 [09-25-03 20:46:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

KABUSHIKI CO.

Opinion of the Court

ably be drawn from the amendment. By amending the application, the inventor is deemed to concede that the patent
does not extend as far as the original claim. It does not
follow, however, that the amended claim becomes so perfect
in its description that no one could devise an equivalent.
After amendment, as before, language remains an imperfect
fit for invention. The narrowing amendment may demonstrate what the claim is not; but it may still fail to capture precisely what the claim is. There is no reason why
a narrowing amendment should be deemed to relinquish
equivalents unforeseeable at the time of the amendment and
beyond a fair interpretation of what was surrendered. Nor
is there any call to foreclose claims of equivalence for aspects
of the invention that have only a peripheral relation to the
reason the amendment was submitted. The amendment
does not show that the inventor suddenly had more foresight
in the drafting of claims than an inventor whose application
was granted without amendments having been submitted.
It shows only that he was familiar with the broader text and
with the difference between the two. As a result, there is
no more reason for holding the patentee to the literal terms
of an amended claim than there is for abolishing the doctrine
of equivalents altogether and holding every patentee to the
literal terms of the patent.

This view of prosecution history estoppel is consistent
with our precedents and respectful of the real practice before
the PTO. While this Court has not weighed the merits of
the complete bar against the flexible bar in its prior cases,
we have consistently applied the doctrine in a flexible way,
not a rigid one. We have considered what equivalents were
surrendered during the prosecution of the patent, rather
than imposing a complete bar that resorts to the very literalism the equivalents rule is designed to overcome. E. g.,
Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., 102 U. S., at 230; Hurlbut v.
Schillinger, 130 U. S. 456, 465 (1889).

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals ignored the guidance of Warner-Jenkinson, which instructed that courts must be cautious

before adopting changes that disrupt the settled expecta-tions of the inventing community. See 520 U. S., at 28. In
that case we made it clear that the doctrine of equivalentsand the rule of prosecution history estoppel are settled
law. The responsibility for changing them rests with Con-gress.

Ibid. Fundamental alterations in these rules riskdestroying the legitimate expectations of inventors in their

property. The petitioner in Warner-Jenkinson requestedanother bright-line rule that would have provided more certainty in determining when estoppel applies but at the costof disrupting the expectations of countless existing patent
holders. We rejected that approach: "To change so substan-tially the rules of the game now could very well subvert the
various balances the PTO sought to strike when issuing thenumerous patents which have not yet expired and which
would be affected by our decision." Id., at 32, n. 6; see also
id., at 41 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) ("The new presumption,if applied woodenly, might in some instances unfairly discount the expectations of a patentee who had no notice atthe time of patent prosecution that such a presumption
would apply"). As Warner-Jenkinson recognized, patentprosecution occurs in the light of our case law. Inventors
who amended their claims under the previous regime had noreason to believe they were conceding all equivalents. If
they had known, they might have appealed the rejection in-stead. There is no justification for applying a new and more
robust estoppel to those who relied on prior doctrine.In Warner-Jenkinson we struck the appropriate balance
by placing the burden on the patentee to show that anamendment was not for purposes of patentability:

"Where no explanation is established, however, thecourt should presume that the patent application had a
substantial reason related to patentability for includingthe limiting element added by amendment. In those

KABUSHIKI CO.

Opinion of the Court

circumstances, prosecution history estoppel would barthe application of the doctrine of equivalents as to that

element." Id., at 33.
When the patentee is unable to explain the reason for amend-ment, estoppel not only applies but also "bar[s] the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to that element." Ibid.These words do not mandate a complete bar; they are limited
to the circumstance where "no explanation is established."They do provide, however, that when the court is unable
to determine the purpose underlying a narrowing amend-ment--and hence a rationale for limiting the estoppel to the
surrender of particular equivalents--the court should pre-sume that the patentee surrendered all subject matter between the broader and the narrower language.Just as Warner-Jenkinson held that the patentee bears
the burden of proving that an amendment was not made fora reason that would give rise to estoppel, we hold here that
the patentee should bear the burden of showing that theamendment does not surrender the particular equivalent in
question. This is the approach advocated by the UnitedStates, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22-28,
and we regard it to be sound. The patentee, as the authorof the claim language, may be expected to draft claims encompassing readily known equivalents. A patentee's deci-sion to narrow his claims through amendment may be presumed to be a general disclaimer of the territory betweenthe original claim and the amended claim.

Exhibit Supply,315 U. S., at 136-137 ("By the amendment [the patentee]

recognized and emphasized the difference between the twophrases and proclaimed his abandonment of all that is embraced in that difference"). There are some cases, however,where the amendment cannot reasonably be viewed as surrendering a particular equivalent. The equivalent mayhave been unforeseeable at the time of the application; the
rationale underlying the amendment may bear no more thana tangential relation to the equivalent in question; or there

Opinion of the Court
may be some other reason suggesting that the patentee couldnot reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question. In those cases the patentee canovercome the presumption that prosecution history estoppel
bars a finding of equivalence.This presumption is not, then, just the complete bar by
another name. Rather, it reflects the fact that the interpre-tation of the patent must begin with its literal claims, and
the prosecution history is relevant to construing thoseclaims. When the patentee has chosen to narrow a claim,
courts may presume the amended text was composed withawareness of this rule and that the territory surrendered
is not an equivalent of the territory claimed. In thoseinstances, however, the patentee still might rebut the
presumption that estoppel bars a claim of equivalence. Thepatentee must show that at the time of the amendment one
skilled in the art could not reasonably be expected to havedrafted a claim that would have literally encompassed the
alleged equivalent. IV

On the record before us, we cannot say petitioner has re-butted the presumptions that estoppel applies and that the
equivalents at issue have been surrendered. Petitioner con-cedes that the limitations at issue--the sealing rings and the
composition of the sleeve--were made in response to a rejec-tion for reasons under $ 112, if not also because of the prior
art references. As the amendments were made for a reasonrelating to patentability, the question is not whether estoppel
applies but what territory the amendments surrendered.While estoppel does not effect a complete bar, the question
remains whether petitioner can demonstrate that the nar-rowing amendments did not surrender the particular equivalents at issue. On these questions, SMC may well prevail,for the sealing rings and the composition of the sleeve both
were noted expressly in the prosecution history. Thesematters, however, should be determined in the first instance

FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION v. SOUTH

CAROLINA STATE PORTS AUTHORITY et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 01-46. Argued February 25, 2002--Decided May 28, 2002
South Carolina Maritime Services, Inc. (Maritime Services), filed a complaint with petitioner Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), contending
that respondent South Carolina State Ports Authority (SCSPA) violated
the Shipping Act of 1984 when it denied Maritime Services permission
to berth a cruise ship at the SCSPA's port facilities in Charleston, South
Carolina; and praying that the FMC, inter alia, direct the SCSPA to
pay reparations to Maritime Services, order the SCSPA to cease and
desist from violating the Shipping Act, and ask the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to enjoin the SCSPA from
refusing berthing space and passenger services to Maritime Services.
The complaint was referred to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),
who found that the SCSPA, as an arm of the State of South Carolina,
was entitled to sovereign immunity and thus dismissed the complaint.
Reversing on its own motion, the FMC concluded that state sovereign
immunity covers proceedings before judicial tribunals, not Executive
Branch agencies. The Fourth Circuit reversed.

Held: State sovereign immunity bars the FMC from adjudicating a private party's complaint against a nonconsenting State. Pp. 751-769.

(a) Dual sovereignty is a defining feature of the Nation's constitutional blueprint, and an integral component of the sovereignty retained
by the States when they entered the Union is their immunity from private suits. While States, in ratifying the Constitution, consented to
suits brought by sister States or the Federal Government, they maintained their traditional immunity from suits brought by private parties.
Although the Eleventh Amendment provides that the "judicial Power
of the United States" does not "extend to any suit, in law or equity,"
brought by citizens of one State against another State, U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 11, that provision does not define the scope of the States' sovereign immunity; it is instead only one particular exemplification of that
immunity. As a result, this Court's assumption that the FMC does not
exercise the judicial power of the United States in adjudicating Shipping
Act complaints filed by private parties does not end the inquiry whether
sovereign immunity applies to such adjudications. Pp. 751-754.

Syllabus

(b) Formalized administrative adjudications were all but unheard of
in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, so it is unsurprising that
there is no specific evidence indicating whether the Framers believed
that sovereign immunity would apply to such proceedings. However,
because of the presumption that the Constitution was not intended to
"rais[e] up" any proceedings against the States that were "anomalous
and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted," Hans v. Louisiana,
134 U. S. 1, 18, this Court attributes great significance to the fact
that States were not subject to private suits in administrative adjudications at the time of the founding or for many years thereafter.
Pp. 754-756.

(c) To decide whether the Hans presumption applies here, this Court
must determine whether FMC adjudications are the type of proceedings
from which the Framers would have thought the States possessed immunity when they agreed to enter the Union. This Court previously
has noted that ALJs and trial judges play similar roles in adjudicative
proceedings and that administrative adjudications and judicial proceedings generally share numerous common features. Butz v. Economou,
438 U. S. 478, 513, 514. Turning to FMC adjudications specifically,
neither the FMC nor the United States disputes the Fourth Circuit's
characterization that such a proceeding walks, talks, and squawks like
a lawsuit or denies that the similarities identified in Butz between administrative adjudications and trial court proceedings are present here.
FMC administrative proceedings bear a remarkably strong resemblance
to federal civil litigation. The rules governing pleadings in both types
of proceedings are quite similar; discovery in FMC adjudications largely
mirrors that in federal civil litigation; the role of the ALJ is similar to
that of an Article III judge; and, in situations not covered by an FMC
rule, the FMC's own Rules of Practice and Procedure provide that Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are to be used if consistent with sound
administrative practice. Pp. 756-759.

(d) State sovereign immunity's preeminent purpose--to accord States
the dignity that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities--
and the overwhelming similarities between FMC adjudicative proceedings and civil litigation lead to the conclusion that the FMC is barred
from adjudicating a private party's complaint against a nonconsenting
State. If the Framers thought it an impermissible affront to a State's
dignity to be required to answer private parties' complaints in federal
court, they would not have found it acceptable to compel a State to do
the same thing before a federal administrative tribunal. And it would
be quite strange were Congress prohibited from exercising its Article
I powers to abrogate state sovereign immunity in Article III judicial
proceedings, but permitted to use those same powers to create court535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
like administrative tribunals where sovereign immunity would not
apply. Pp. 760-761.

(e) Two arguments made by the United States to support its claim
that sovereign immunity does not apply to FMC proceedings are unavailing. That the FMC's orders are not self-executing does not mean
that a State is not coerced into participating in an FMC adjudicative
proceeding. A State charged in a private party's complaint with violating the Shipping Act has the option of appearing before the FMC
in a bid to persuade that body of the strength of its position or substantially compromising its ability to defend itself because a sanctioned
party cannot litigate the merits of its position later in a federal-court
action brought by the Attorney General to enforce an FMC nonreparation order or civil penalty assessment. This choice clearly serves to
coerce States to participate in FMC adjudications. And the argument
that sovereign immunity should not apply because FMC proceedings do
not present the same threat to the States' financial integrity as do private judicial suits reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of sovereign
immunity's primary purpose, which is not to shield state treasuries but
to accord States the respect owed them as joint sovereigns. In any
event, an FMC reparation order may very well result in the withdrawal
of funds from a State's treasury because the FMC might be able to
assess a civil penalty against a State that refused to obey a reparation
order, and if the Attorney General, at the FMC's request, then sought
to recover the penalty in federal court, the State's sovereign immunity
would not extend to that suit brought by the Federal Government.
Pp. 761-767.

(f) The Court rejects the FMC's argument that it should not be
barred from adjudicating Maritime Services' complaint because the constitutional necessity of uniformity in maritime commerce regulation limits the States' sovereignty with respect to the Federal Government's
authority to regulate that commerce. This Court has already held that
state sovereign immunity extends to maritime commerce cases, and
Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 72, precludes the Court
from creating a new maritime commerce exception to state sovereign
immunity. Also rejected is the United States' argument that, even if
the FMC is barred from issuing a reparation order, it should not be
precluded from considering a private party's request for nonmonetary
relief. The type of relief sought by a plaintiff suing a State in court
is irrelevant to the question whether a suit is barred by the Eleventh
Amendment, id., at 58, and the Court sees no reason why that principle
should not also apply in the realm of administrative adjudications.
Pp. 767-769.
243 F. 3d 165, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether state sovereign
immunity precludes petitioner Federal Maritime Commis-sion (FMC or Commission) from adjudicating a private party's complaint that a state-run port has violated the ShippingAct of 1984, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1701

et seq. (1994 ed. and
Supp. V). We hold that state sovereign immunity bars suchan adjudicative proceeding.

I
On five occasions, South Carolina Maritime Services, Inc.
(Maritime Services), asked respondent South Carolina StatePorts Authority (SCSPA) for permission to berth a cruise

ship, the M/V Tropic Sea, at the SCSPA's port facilities inCharleston, South Carolina. Maritime Services intended to
offer cruises on the M/V Tropic Sea originating from thePort of Charleston. Some of these cruises would stop in the
Bahamas while others would merely travel in international
waters before returning to Charleston with no interveningports of call. On all of these trips, passengers would be permitted to participate in gambling activities while on board.The SCSPA repeatedly denied Maritime Services' requests, contending that it had an established policy ofdenying berths in the Port of Charleston to vessels whose
primary purpose was gambling. As a result, Maritime ServCooper of North Carolina, Wayne Stenehjem of North Dakota, Betty D.

Opinion of the Court

ices filed a complaint with the FMC,1 contending that theSCSPA's refusal to provide berthing space to the M/V Tropic

Sea violated the Shipping Act. Maritime Services allegedin its complaint that the SCSPA had implemented its antigambling policy in a discriminatory fashion by providingberthing space in Charleston to two Carnival Cruise Lines
vessels even though Carnival offered gambling activities onthese ships. Maritime Services therefore complained that
the SCSPA had unduly and unreasonably preferred Carnivalover Maritime Services in violation of 46 U. S. C. App.

$ 1709(d)(4) (1994 ed., Supp. V),2 and unreasonably refusedto deal or negotiate with Maritime Services in violation
of $ 1709(b)(10).3 App. 14-15. It further alleged that theSCSPA's unlawful actions had inflicted upon Maritime Services a "loss of profits, loss of earnings, loss of sales, and lossof business opportunities."

Id., at 15.To remedy its injuries, Maritime Services prayed that the

FMC: (1) seek a temporary restraining order and prelimi-nary injunction in the United States District Court for the
District of South Carolina "enjoining [the SCSPA] from uti-lizing its discriminatory practice to refuse to provide berthing space and passenger services to Maritime Services;" 4

1 See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1710(a) (1994 ed.) ("Any person may file with the
Commission a sworn complaint alleging a violation of this chapter . . . and
may seek reparation for any injury caused to the complainant by that
violation").

2 Section 1709(d)(4) provides that "[n]o marine terminal operator may

give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage or impose any

(2) direct the SCSPA to pay reparations to Maritime Serv-ices as well as interest and reasonable attorneys' fees;

(3) issue an order commanding, among other things, theSCSPA to cease and desist from violating the Shipping Act;

and (4) award Maritime Services "such other and further re-lief as is just and proper." Id., at 16.

Consistent with the FMC's Rules of Practice and Pro-cedure, Maritime Services' complaint was referred to an
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). See 46 CFR $ 502.223(2001). The SCSPA then filed an answer, maintaining,

interalia, that it had adhered to its antigambling policy in a nondiscriminatory manner. It also filed a motion to dismiss,asserting, as relevant, that the SCSPA, as an arm of the
State of South Carolina, was "entitled to Eleventh Amend-ment immunity" from Maritime Services' suit. App. 41.
The SCSPA argued that "the Constitution prohibits Con-gress from passing a statute authorizing Maritime Services
to file [this] Complaint before the Commission and, thereby,sue the State of South Carolina for damages and injunctive
relief." Id., at 44.The ALJ agreed, concluding that recent decisions of this

state sovereign immunity, the ALJ reasoned that "[i]f federalcourts that are established under Article III of the Constitution must respect States' 11th Amendment immunity andCongress is powerless to override the States' immunity
under Article I of the Constitution, it is irrational to arguethat an agency like the Commission, created under an Article
I statute, is free to disregard the 11th Amendment or its
related doctrine of State immunity from private suits."App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a (emphasis in original). The ALJ

noted, however, that his decision did not deprive the FMCof its "authority to look into [Maritime Services'] allegations
of Shipping Act violations and enforce the Shipping Act."
Id., at 60a. For example, the FMC could institute its own
formal investigatory proceeding, see 46 CFR $ 502.282
(2001), or refer Maritime Services' allegations to its Bureau
of Enforcement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a-61a.

While Maritime Services did not appeal the ALJ's dismissal of its complaint, the FMC on its own motion decided
to review the ALJ's ruling to consider whether state sovereign immunity from private suits extends to proceedings
before the Commission. Id., at 29a-30a. It concluded that
"[t]he doctrine of state sovereign immunity . . . is meant to
cover proceedings before judicial tribunals, whether Federal
or state, not executive branch administrative agencies like
the Commission." Id., at 33a. As a result, the FMC held
that sovereign immunity did not bar the Commission from
adjudicating private complaints against state-run ports and
reversed the ALJ's decision dismissing Maritime Services'
complaint. Id., at 35a.

The SCSPA filed a petition for review, and the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.
Observing that "any proceeding where a federal officer adjudicates disputes between private parties and unconsenting
states would not have passed muster at the time of the Constitution's passage nor after the ratification of the Eleventh
Amendment," the Court of Appeals reasoned that "[s]uch an

agency." 243 F. 3d 165, 173 (2001). Reviewing the "precisenature" of the procedures employed by the FMC for resolving private complaints, the Court of Appeals concluded thatthe proceeding "walks, talks, and squawks very much like
a lawsuit" and that "[i]ts placement within the Executive
Branch cannot blind us to the fact that the proceeding istruly an adjudication."

Id., at 174. The Court of Appeals
therefore held that because the SCSPA is an arm of the Stateof South Carolina,

6 sovereign immunity precluded the FMC

from adjudicating Maritime Services' complaint, and remanded the case with instructions that it be dismissed.

Dual sovereignty is a defining feature of our Nation's constitutional blueprint. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.
452, 457 (1991). States, upon ratification of the Constitution,
did not consent to become mere appendages of the Federal
Government. Rather, they entered the Union "with their
sovereignty intact." Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991). An integral component of that
"residuary and inviolable sovereignty," The Federalist
No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison), retained by

6 The SCSPA was created by the State of South Carolina "as an instrumentality of the State," for, among other purposes, "develop[ing] and improv[ing] the harbors or seaports of Charleston, Georgetown and Port
Royal for the handling of water-borne commerce from and to any part of
[South Carolina] and other states and foreign countries." S. C. Code Ann.

$ 54-3-130 (1992). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit has ruled that the SCSPA is protected by South Carolina's sovereign immunity because it is an arm of the State, see, e. g., Ristow v. South
Carolina Ports Authority, 58 F. 3d 1051 (1995), and no party to this case
contests that determination.

Opinion of the Court

the States is their immunity from private suits. Reflectingthe widespread understanding at the time the Constitution

was drafted, Alexander Hamilton explained:

"It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be
amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.This is the general sense and the general practice of

mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes ofsovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every
State of the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surren-der of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will
remain with the States . . . ." Id., No. 81, at 487-488(emphasis in original).

States, in ratifying the Constitution, did surrender aportion of their inherent immunity by consenting to suits
brought by sister States or by the Federal Government.See

Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 755 (1999). Nevertheless,
the Convention did not disturb States' immunity from pri-vate suits, thus firmly enshrining this principle in our constitutional framework. "The leading advocates of the Con-stitution assured the people in no uncertain terms that the
Constitution would not strip the States of sovereign immunity." Id., at 716.The States' sovereign immunity, however, fell into peril in

the early days of our Nation's history when this Court heldin

Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), that Article III
authorized citizens of one State to sue another State in fed-eral court. The "decision `fell upon the country with a profound shock.' " Alden, supra, at 720 (quoting 1 C. Warren,The Supreme Court in United States History 96 (rev. ed.
1926)). In order to overturn Chisholm, Congress quickly
passed the Eleventh Amendment and the States ratified it
speedily. The Amendment clarified that "[t]he Judicial
power of the United States shall not be construed to extend
to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted
against one of the United States by Citizens of another State,

535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." We havesince acknowledged that the Chisholm decision was erroneous. See, e. g., Alden, 527 U. S., at 721-722.Instead of explicitly memorializing the full breadth of the
sovereign immunity retained by the States when the Consti-tution was ratified, Congress chose in the text of the Eleventh Amendment only to "address the specific provisions ofthe Constitution that had raised concerns during the ratification debates and formed the basis of the Chisholm deci-sion."

Id., at 723. As a result, the Eleventh Amendmentdoes not define the scope of the States' sovereign immunity;

it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity.Cf. Blatchford, supra, at 779 ("[W]e have understood the
Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says,but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure
which it confirms"). III

We now consider whether the sovereign immunity enjoyedby States as part of our constitutional framework applies to
adjudications conducted by the FMC. Petitioner FMC andrespondent United States

7 initially maintain that the Court

of Appeals erred because sovereign immunity only shieldsStates from exercises of "judicial power" and FMC adjudications are not judicial proceedings. As support for theirposition, they point to the text of the Eleventh Amendment
and contend that "[t]he Amendment's reference to `judicialPower' and to `any suit in law or equity' clearly mark it

as an immunity from judicial process." Brief for UnitedStates 15.

7 While the United States is a party to this case and agrees with the
FMC that state sovereign immunity does not preclude the Commission
from adjudicating Maritime Services' complaint against the SCSPA, it is
nonetheless a respondent because it did not seek review of the Court of
Appeals' decision below. See this Court's Rule 12.6. The United States
instead opposed the FMC's petition for certiorari. See Brief for United
States in Opposition.

Opinion of the Court

For purposes of this case, we will assume, arguendo, thatin adjudicating complaints filed by private parties under the

Shipping Act, the FMC does not exercise the judicial powerof the United States. Such an assumption, however, does
not end our inquiry as this Court has repeatedly held thatthe sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment.8 See,
e. g., Alden, supra (holding that sovereign immunity shieldsStates from private suits in state courts pursuant to federal

causes of action); Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak,501 U. S. 775 (1991) (applying state sovereign immunity to
suits by Indian tribes); Principality of Monaco v. Missis-sippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934) (applying state sovereign immunity to suits by foreign nations); Ex parte New York, 256U. S. 490 (1921) (applying state sovereign immunity to admiralty proceedings); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900)(applying state sovereign immunity to suits by federal corporations); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890) (applyingstate sovereign immunity to suits by a State's own citizens under federal-question jurisdiction). Adhering to thatwell-reasoned precedent, see Part II,

supra, we must deter-mine whether the sovereign immunity embedded in our constitutional structure and retained by the States when theyjoined the Union extends to FMC adjudicative proceedings.

A
"[L]ook[ing] first to evidence of the original understand-ing of the Constitution," Alden, 527 U. S., at 741, as well as

8 To the extent that Justice Breyer, looking to the text of the Eleventh Amendment, suggests that sovereign immunity only shields States
from "the `[j]udicial power of the United States,' " post, at 777 (dissenting
opinion), he "engage[s] in the type of ahistorical literalism we have rejected in interpreting the scope of the States' sovereign immunity since
the discredited decision in Chisholm," Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 730
(1999). Furthermore, it is ironic that Justice Breyer adopts such a textual approach in defending the conduct of an independent agency that
itself lacks any textual basis in the Constitution.

Opinion of the Court
early congressional practice, see id., at 743-744, we find arelatively barren historical record, from which the parties

draw radically different conclusions. Petitioner FMC, forinstance, argues that state sovereign immunity should not
extend to administrative adjudications because "[t]here is noevidence that state immunity from the adjudication of complaints by executive officers was an established principle at
the time of the adoption of the Constitution." Brief for Peti-tioner 28 (emphasis in original). The SCSPA, on the other

hand, asserts that it is more relevant that "Congress did notattempt to subject the States to private suits before federal administrative tribunals" during the early days of our
Republic. Brief for Respondent SCSPA 19.

In truth, the relevant history does not provide direct guidance for our inquiry. The Framers, who envisioned a limited
Federal Government, could not have anticipated the vast
growth of the administrative state. See Alden, supra, at
807 (Souter, J., dissenting) ("The proliferation of Government, State and Federal, would amaze the Framers, and the
administrative state with its reams of regulations would
leave them rubbing their eyes"). Because formalized administrative adjudications were all but unheard of in the late
18th century and early 19th century, the dearth of specific
evidence indicating whether the Framers believed that the
States' sovereign immunity would apply in such proceedings
is unsurprising.

This Court, however, has applied a presumption--first
explicitly stated in Hans v. Louisiana, supra--that the Constitution was not intended to "rais[e] up" any proceedings
against the States that were "anomalous and unheard of
when the Constitution was adopted." Id., at 18. We therefore attribute great significance to the fact that States were
not subject to private suits in administrative adjudications
at the time of the founding or for many years thereafter.
For instance, while the United States asserts that "state
entities have long been subject to similar administrative

enforcement proceedings," Reply Brief for United States12, the earliest example it provides did not occur until 1918,

see id., at 14 (citing California Canneries Co. v. SouthernPacific Co., 51 I. C. C. 500 (1918)).

B
To decide whether the Hans presumption applies here,however, we must examine FMC adjudications to determine

whether they are the type of proceedings from which theFramers would have thought the States possessed immunity
when they agreed to enter the Union.In another case asking whether an immunity present in
the judicial context also applied to administrative adjudica-tions, this Court considered whether ALJs share the same
absolute immunity from suit as do Article III judges. See
Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978). Examining in thatcase the duties performed by an ALJ, this Court observed:

"There can be little doubt that the role of the modernfederal hearing examiner or administrative law judge
. . . is `functionally comparable' to that of a judge. Hispowers are often, if not generally, comparable to those
of a trial judge: He may issue subpoenas, rule on proffersof evidence, regulate the course of the hearing, and
make or recommend decisions. More importantly, theprocess of agency adjudication is currently structured
so as to assure that the hearing examiner exercises hisindependent judgment on the evidence before him, free
from pressures by the parties or other officials withinthe agency."

Id., at 513 (citation omitted).

Beyond the similarities between the role of an ALJ and thatof a trial judge, this Court also noted the numerous common

features shared by administrative adjudications and judicialproceedings:

"[F]ederal administrative law requires that agency adju-dication contain many of the same safeguards as are

535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
available in the judicial process. The proceedings areadversary in nature. They are conducted before a trier

of fact insulated from political influence. A partyis entitled to present his case by oral or documentary
evidence, and the transcript of testimony and exhibitstogether with the pleadings constitute the exclusive record for decision. The parties are entitled to know thefindings and conclusions on all of the issues of fact, law,
or discretion presented on the record." Ibid. (citationsomitted).

This Court therefore concluded in Butz that ALJs were"entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability for
their judicial acts." Id., at 514.Turning to FMC adjudications specifically, neither the
Commission nor the United States disputes the Court of Ap-peals' characterization below that such a proceeding "walks,
talks, and squawks very much like a lawsuit." 243 F. 3d, at174. Nor do they deny that the similarities identified in
Butz between administrative adjudications and trial courtproceedings are present here. See 46 CFR $ 502.142 (2001).

A review of the FMC's Rules of Practice and Procedureconfirms that FMC administrative proceedings bear a remarkably strong resemblance to civil litigation in federalcourts. For example, the FMC's Rules governing pleadings are quite similar to those found in the Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure. A case is commenced by the filing of a
complaint. See 46 CFR $ 502.61 (2001); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.3. The defendant then must file an answer, generally within
20 days of the date of service of the complaint, see$ 502.64(a); Rule 12(a)(1), and may also file a motion to
dismiss, see $ 502.227(b)(1); Rule 12(b). A defendant is alsoallowed to file counterclaims against the plaintiff. See

$ 502.64(d); Rule 13. If a defendant fails to respond to acomplaint, default judgment may be entered on behalf of

the plaintiff. See $ 502.64(b); Rule 55. Intervention is alsoallowed. See $ 502.72; Rule 24.

Opinion of the Court

Likewise, discovery in FMC adjudications largely mirrorsdiscovery in federal civil litigation. See 46 U. S. C. App.

$ 1711(a)(1) (1994 ed.) (instructing that in FMC adjudicatoryproceedings "discovery procedures . . . , to the extent practicable, shall be in conformity with the rules applicable in civilproceedings in the district courts of the United States"). In
both types of proceedings, parties may conduct depositions,
see, e. g., 46 CFR $ 502.202 (2001); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 28,which are governed by similar requirements. Compare

$$ 502.202, 502.203, and 502.204, with Rules 28, 29, 30, and 31.Parties may also discover evidence by: (1) serving written
interrogatories, see $ 502.205; Rule 33; (2) requesting thatanother party either produce documents, see $ 502.206(a)(1);
Rule 34(a)(1), or allow entry on that party's property for thepurpose of inspecting the property or designated objects
thereon, $ 502.206(a)(2); Rule 34(a)(2); and (3) submittingrequests for admissions, $ 502.207; Rule 36. And a party
failing to obey discovery orders in either type of proceedingis subject to a variety of sanctions, including the entry of
default judgment. See $ 502.210(a); Rule 37(b)(2).

Not only are discovery procedures virtually indistinguishable, but the role of the ALJ, the impartial officer 9 designated to hear a case, see $ 502.147, is similar to that of an
Article III judge. An ALJ has the authority to "arrange
and give notice of hearing." Ibid. At that hearing, he may

"prescribe the order in which evidence shall be presented; dispose of procedural requests or similar matters; hear and rule upon motions; administer oaths and
affirmations; examine witnesses; direct witnesses to testify or produce evidence available to them which will aid
in the determination of any question of fact in issue; rule

9 See 46 CFR $ 502.224 (2001) (requiring that ALJs be shielded from
political influence in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act).

Opinion of the Court
upon offers of proof . . . and dispose of any other matter
that normally and properly arises in the course of proceedings." Ibid.

The ALJ also fixes "the time and manner of filing briefs,"

$ 502.221(a), which contain findings of fact as well as legal
argument, see $ 502.221(d)(1). After the submission of these
briefs, the ALJ issues a decision that includes "a statement
of findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis
therefor, upon all the material issues presented on the record, and the appropriate rule, order, section, relief, or denial
thereof." $ 502.223. Such relief may include an order directing the payment of reparations to an aggrieved party.
See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1710(g) (1994 ed., Supp. V); 46 CFR

$ 502.251 (2001). The ALJ's ruling subsequently becomes
the final decision of the FMC unless a party, by filing exceptions, appeals to the Commission or the Commission decides to review the ALJ's decision "on its own initiative."

$ 502.227(a)(3). In cases where a complainant obtains reparations, an ALJ may also require the losing party to pay
the prevailing party's attorney's fees. See 46 U. S. C. App.

$ 1710(g); 46 CFR $ 502.254 (2001).

In short, the similarities between FMC proceedings and
civil litigation are overwhelming. In fact, to the extent that
situations arise in the course of FMC adjudications "which
are not covered by a specific Commission rule," the FMC's
own Rules of Practice and Procedure specifically provide
that "the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will be followed
to the extent that they are consistent with sound administrative practice." 10 $ 502.12.

10 In addition, "[u]nless inconsistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and [the FMC's Rules of Practice and Procedure],
the Federal Rules of Evidence [are] applicable" in FMC adjudicative proceedings. $ 502.156.

C
The preeminent purpose of state sovereign immunity is to
accord States the dignity that is consistent with their status
as sovereign entities. See In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 505
(1887). "The founding generation thought it `neither becoming nor convenient that the several States of the Union, invested with that large residuum of sovereignty which had
not been delegated to the United States, should be summoned as defendants to answer the complaints of private
persons.' " Alden, 527 U. S., at 748 (quoting In re Ayers,
supra, at 505).

Given both this interest in protecting States' dignity and
the strong similarities between FMC proceedings and civil
litigation, we hold that state sovereign immunity bars the
FMC from adjudicating complaints filed by a private party
against a nonconsenting State. Simply put, if the Framers
thought it an impermissible affront to a State's dignity to be
required to answer the complaints of private parties in federal courts, we cannot imagine that they would have found
it acceptable to compel a State to do exactly the same thing
before the administrative tribunal of an agency, such as the
FMC. Cf. Alden, supra, at 749 ("Private suits against nonconsenting States . . . present `the indignity of subjecting a
State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties,' regardless of the forum" (quoting
In re Ayers, supra, at 505) (citations omitted; emphasis
added)). The affront to a State's dignity does not lessen
when an adjudication takes place in an administrative tribunal as opposed to an Article III court.11 In both instances, a
State is required to defend itself in an adversarial proceeding

11 One, in fact, could argue that allowing a private party to haul a State
in front of such an administrative tribunal constitutes a greater insult to
a State's dignity than requiring a State to appear in an Article III court
presided over by a judge with life tenure nominated by the President of
the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.

against a private party before an impartial federal officer.12Moreover, it would be quite strange to prohibit Congress

from exercising its Article I powers to abrogate state sover-eign immunity in Article III judicial proceedings, see Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 72, but permit the use of those sameArticle I powers to create court-like administrative tribunals
where sovereign immunity does not apply.13

D
The United States suggests two reasons why we shoulddistinguish FMC administrative adjudications from judicial

proceedings for purposes of state sovereign immunity. Bothof these arguments are unavailing.

1
The United States first contends that sovereign immunityshould not apply to FMC adjudications because the Commission's orders are not self-executing. See Brief for UnitedStates 18-21. Whereas a court may enforce a judgment
through the exercise of its contempt power, the FMC cannotenforce its own orders. Rather, the Commission's orders

12 Contrary to the suggestion contained in Justice Breyer's dissenting
opinion, our "basic analogy" is not "between a federal administrative proceeding triggered by a private citizen and a private citizen's lawsuit
against a State" in a State's own courts. Post, at 779. Rather, as our
discussion above makes clear, the more apt comparison is between a complaint filed by a private party against a State with the FMC and a lawsuit
brought by a private party against a State in federal court.

13 While Justice Breyer asserts by use of analogy that this case implicates the First Amendment right of citizens to petition the Federal Government for a redress of grievances, see ibid., the Constitution no more
protects a citizen's right to litigate against a State in front of a federal
administrative tribunal than it does a citizen's right to sue a State in federal court. Both types of proceedings were "anomalous and unheard of
when the Constitution was adopted," Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 18
(1890), and a private party plainly has no First Amendment right to haul
a State in front of either an Article III court or a federal administrative
tribunal.

can only be enforced by a federal district court. See, e. g.,46 U. S. C. App. $ 1712(e) (1994 ed.) (enforcement of civil penalties); $$ 1713(c) and (d) (enforcement of nonreparation andreparation orders).

The United States presents a valid distinction between theauthority possessed by the FMC and that of a court. For
purposes of this case, however, it is a distinction without ameaningful difference. To the extent that the United States
highlights this fact in order to suggest that a party allegedto have violated the Shipping Act is not coerced to participate in FMC proceedings, it is mistaken. The relevant stat-utory scheme makes it quite clear that, absent sovereign
immunity, States would effectively be required to defendthemselves against private parties in front of the FMC.

A State seeking to contest the merits of a complaint filedagainst it by a private party must defend itself in front of
the FMC or substantially compromise its ability to defenditself at all. For example, once the FMC issues a nonreparation order, and either the Attorney General or the injuredprivate party seeks enforcement of that order in a federal
district court,14 the sanctioned party is not permitted to liti-gate the merits of its position in that court. See $ 1713(c)
(limiting district court review to whether the relevant order"was properly made and duly issued"). Moreover, if a party
fails to appear before the FMC, it may not then argue themerits of its position in an appeal of the Commission's determination filed under 28 U. S. C. $ 2342(3)(B)(iv). See UnitedStates v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 37
(1952) ("Simple fairness to those who are engaged in thetasks of administration, and to litigants, requires as a general
rule that courts should not topple over administrative deci-sions unless the administrative body not only has erred but

14 A reparation order issued by the FMC, by contrast, may be enforced
in a United States district court only in an action brought by the injured private party. See Part IV-B, infra. 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1713(d)

Should a party choose to ignore an order issued by theFMC, the Commission may impose monetary penalties for
each day of noncompliance. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1712(a)(1994 ed., Supp. V). The Commission may then request that
the Attorney General of the United States seek to recoverthe amount assessed by the Commission in federal district
court, see $ 1712(e) (1994 ed.), and a State's sovereign im-munity would not extend to that action, as it is one brought
by the United States. Furthermore, once the FMC issuesan order assessing a civil penalty, a sanctioned party may
not later contest the merits of that order in an enforcementaction brought by the Attorney General in federal district
court. See ibid. (limiting review to whether the assessmentof the civil penalty was "regularly made and duly issued");
United States v. Interlink Systems, Inc., 984 F. 2d 79, 83(CA2 1993) (holding that review of whether an order was
"regularly made and duly issued" does not include review ofthe merits of the FMC's order).

Thus, any party, including a State, charged in a complaintby a private party with violating the Shipping Act is faced
with the following options: appear before the Commission ina bid to persuade the FMC of the strength of its position
or stand defenseless once enforcement of the Commission'snonreparation order or assessment of civil penalties is sought
in federal district court.15 To conclude that this choice does

15 While Justice Breyer argues that States' access to "full judicial
review" of the Commission's orders mitigates any coercion to participate
in FMC adjudicative proceedings, post, at 784, he earlier concedes that a
State must appear before the Commission in order "to obtain full judicial
review of an adverse agency decision in a court of appeals," post, at 783.
This case therefore does not involve a situation where Congress has allowed a party to obtain full de novo judicial review of Commission orders
without first appearing before the Commission, and we express no opinion
as to whether sovereign immunity would apply to FMC adjudicative proceedings under such circumstances.

not coerce a State to participate in an FMC adjudicationwould be to blind ourselves to reality.

16

The United States and Justice Breyer maintain that anysuch coercion to participate in FMC proceedings is permissible because the States have consented to actions brought bythe Federal Government. See Alden, 527 U. S., at 755-756
("In ratifying the Constitution, the States consented to suitsbrought by . . . the Federal Government"). The Attorney
General's decision to bring an enforcement action against aState after the conclusion of the Commission's proceedings,
however, does not retroactively convert an FMC adjudica-tion initiated and pursued by a private party into one initiated and pursued by the Federal Government. The prose-cution of a complaint filed by a private party with the FMC
is plainly not controlled by the United States, but rather iscontrolled by that private party; the only duty assumed by
the FMC, and hence the United States, in conjunction witha private complaint is to assess its merits in an impartial
manner. Indeed, the FMC does not even have the discretionto refuse to adjudicate complaints brought by private parties. See, e. g., 243 F. 3d, at 176 ("The FMC had no choicebut to adjudicate this dispute"). As a result, the United
States plainly does not "exercise . . . political responsibility"for such complaints, but instead has impermissibly effected
"a broad delegation to private persons to sue nonconsentingStates."

17 Alden, supra, at 756.

16 Justice Breyer's observation that private citizens may pressure the
Federal Government in a variety of ways to take other actions that affect
States is beside the point. See post, at 783-784. Sovereign immunity
concerns are not implicated, for example, when the Federal Government
enacts a rule opposed by a State. See post, at 784. It is an entirely
different matter, however, when the Federal Government attempts to coerce States into answering the complaints of private parties in an adjudicative proceeding. See Part III-C, supra.

17 Moreover, a State obviously will not know ex ante whether the Attorney General will choose to bring an enforcement action. Therefore, it is

Opinion of the Court

The United States next suggests that sovereign immunity
should not apply to FMC proceedings because they do not
present the same threat to the financial integrity of States
as do private judicial suits. See Brief for United States 21.
The Government highlights the fact that, in contrast to a
nonreparation order, for which the Attorney General may
seek enforcement at the request of the Commission, a reparation order may be enforced in a United States district
court only in an action brought by the private party to whom
the award was made. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1713(d)(1).
The United States then points out that a State's sovereign
immunity would extend to such a suit brought by a private
party. Brief for United States 21.

This argument, however, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the purposes of sovereign immunity. While
state sovereign immunity serves the important function of
shielding state treasuries and thus preserving "the States'
ability to govern in accordance with the will of their citizens," Alden, supra, at 750-751, the doctrine's central purpose is to "accord the States the respect owed them as" joint
sovereigns. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 146 (1993); see
Part III-C, supra. It is for this reason, for instance, that
sovereign immunity applies regardless of whether a private
plaintiff 's suit is for monetary damages or some other type
of relief. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 58 ("[W]e have
often made it clear that the relief sought by a plaintiff suing

the mere prospect that he may do so that coerces a State to participate in
FMC proceedings. For if a State does not present its arguments to the
Commission, it will have all but lost any opportunity to defend itself in
the event that the Attorney General later decides to seek enforcement of a
Commission order or the Commission's assessment of civil penalties. See
supra, at 762-764.

Opinion of the Court

a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit is
barred by the Eleventh Amendment").

Sovereign immunity does not merely constitute a defense
to monetary liability or even to all types of liability. Rather,
it provides an immunity from suit. The statutory scheme,
as interpreted by the United States, is thus no more permissible than if Congress had allowed private parties to sue
States in federal court for violations of the Shipping Act but
precluded a court from awarding them any relief.

It is also worth noting that an FMC order that a State pay
reparations to a private party may very well result in the
withdrawal of funds from that State's treasury. A State
subject to such an order at the conclusion of an FMC adjudicatory proceeding would either have to make the required
payment to the injured private party or stand in violation
of the Commission's order. If the State were willfully and
knowingly to choose noncompliance, the Commission could
assess a civil penalty of up to $25,000 a day against the State.
See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1712(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V). And if the
State then refused to pay that penalty, the Attorney General,
at the request of the Commission, could seek to recover that
amount in a federal district court; because that action would
be one brought by the Federal Government, the State's sovereign immunity would not extend to it.

To be sure, the United States suggests that the FMC's
statutory authority to impose civil penalties for violations
of reparation orders is "doubtful." Reply Brief for United
States 7. The relevant statutory provisions, however, appear on their face to confer such authority. For while reparation orders and nonreparation orders are distinguished in
other parts of the statutory scheme, see, e. g., 46 U. S. C. App.

$$ 1713(c) and (d) (1994 ed.), the provision addressing civil
penalties makes no such distinction. See $ 1712(a) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V) ("Whoever violates . . . a Commission order is liable to the United States for a civil penalty"). The United

Opinion of the Court
States, moreover, does not even dispute that the FMC couldimpose a civil penalty on a State for failing to obey a nonreparation order, which, if enforced by the Attorney General,would also result in a levy upon that State's treasury.

IV
Two final arguments raised by the FMC and the UnitedStates remain to be addressed. Each is answered in part

by reference to our decision in Seminole Tribe.

A
The FMC maintains that sovereign immunity should notbar the Commission from adjudicating Maritime Services'

complaint because "[t]he constitutional necessity of uniform-ity in the regulation of maritime commerce limits the States'
sovereignty with respect to the Federal Government's au-thority to regulate that commerce." Brief for Petitioner 29.
This Court, however, has already held that the States' sover-eign immunity extends to cases concerning maritime commerce. See, e. g., Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490 (1921).Moreover, Seminole Tribe precludes us from creating a new
"maritime commerce" exception to state sovereign immunity.Although the Federal Government undoubtedly possesses an
important interest in regulating maritime commerce, seeU. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, we noted in

Seminole Tribethat "the background principle of state sovereign immunity

embodied in the Eleventh Amendment is not so ephemeralas to dissipate when the subject of the suit is an area . . .
that is under the exclusive control of the Federal Govern-ment,"

18 517 U. S., at 72. Thus, "[e]ven when the Constitu18 Justice Breyer apparently does not accept this proposition, see post,
at 776-778, maintaining that it is not supported by the text of the Tenth
Amendment. The principle of state sovereign immunity enshrined in our
constitutional framework, however, is not rooted in the Tenth Amendment.
See Part II, supra. Moreover, to the extent that Justice Breyer ar535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN
768 FEDERAL MARITIME COMM'N v. SOUTH CAROLINA

PORTS AUTHORITY

Opinion of the Court

tion vests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over aparticular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against uncon-senting States." Ibid. Of course, the Federal Government
retains ample means of ensuring that state-run ports complywith the Shipping Act and other valid federal rules governing ocean-borne commerce. The FMC, for example, remainsfree to investigate alleged violations of the Shipping Act,
either upon its own initiative or upon information suppliedby a private party, see,

e. g., 46 CFR $ 502.282 (2001), and toinstitute its own administrative proceeding against a staterun port, see 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1710(c) (1994 ed.); 46 CFR$ 502.61(a) (2001). Additionally, the Commission "may bring
suit in a district court of the United States to enjoin conductin violation of [the Act]." 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1710(h)(1).

19

Indeed, the United States has advised us that the Court ofAppeals' ruling below "should have little practical effect on

the FMC's enforcement of the Shipping Act," Brief forUnited States in Opposition 20, and we have no reason to
believe that our decision to affirm that judgment will lead tothe parade of horribles envisioned by the FMC.

B
Finally, the United States maintains that even if sovereignimmunity were to bar the FMC from adjudicating a private

gues that the Federal Government's Article I power "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States," U. S. Const.,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, allows it to authorize private parties to sue nonconsenting
States, see post, at 777-778, his quarrel is not with our decision today but
with our decision in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996).
See id., at 72.

19 For these reasons, private parties remain "perfectly free to complain to the Federal Government about unlawful state activity" and "the
Federal Government [remains] free to take subsequent legal action."
Post, at 776 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The only step the FMC may not
take, consistent with this Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, is to
adjudicate a dispute between a private party and a nonconsenting State.

Opinion of the Court
party's complaint against a state-run port for purposes ofissuing a reparation order, the FMC should not be precluded

from considering a private party's request for other formsof relief, such as a cease-and-desist order. See Brief for
United States 32-34. As we have previously noted, how-ever, the primary function of sovereign immunity is not to
protect state treasuries, see Part III-C, supra, but to afford
the States the dignity and respect due sovereign enti-ties. As a result, we explained in

Seminole Tribe that "the
relief sought by a plaintiff suing a State is irrelevant tothe question whether the suit is barred by the Eleventh

Amendment." 517 U. S., at 58. We see no reason why adifferent principle should apply in the realm of administrative adjudications. * * *

While some might complain that our system of dual sover-eignty is not a model of administrative convenience, see,

e. g.,
post, at 785-786 (Breyer, J., dissenting), that is not its pur-pose. Rather, "[t]he `constitutionally mandated balance of

power' between the States and the Federal Government wasadopted by the Framers to ensure the protection of `our fundamental liberties.' " Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985) (quoting Garcia v. San Antonio
Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 572 (1985)
(Powell, J., dissenting)). By guarding against encroach-ments by the Federal Government on fundamental aspects

of state sovereignty, such as sovereign immunity, we striveto maintain the balance of power embodied in our Constitution and thus to "reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse fromeither front."

Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 458. Although the Framers likely did not envision the intrusion on
state sovereignty at issue in today's case, we are nonetheless
confident that it is contrary to their constitutional design,
and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

Stevens, J., dissenting

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Justice Breyer has explained why the Court's recent
sovereign immunity jurisprudence does not support today's
decision. I join his opinion without reservation, but add
these words to emphasize the weakness of the two predicates
for the majority's holding. Those predicates are, first, the
Court's recent decision in Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706
(1999), and second, the "preeminent" interest in according
States the "dignity" that is their due. Ante, at 760.

Justice Souter has already demonstrated that Alden's
creative "conception of state sovereign immunity . . . is true
neither to history nor to the structure of the Constitution."
527 U. S., at 814 (dissenting opinion). And I have previously
explained that the "dignity" rationale is " `embarrassingly insufficient,' " Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44,
97 (1996) (dissenting opinion; citation omitted), in part because "Chief Justice Marshall early on laid to rest the view
that the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment was to protect
a State's dignity," id., at 96-97 (citing Cohens v. Virginia, 6
Wheat. 264, 406-407 (1821)).

This latter point is reinforced by the legislative history
of the Eleventh Amendment. It is familiar learning that
the Amendment was a response to this Court's decision in
Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). Less recognized,
however, is that Chisholm necessarily decided two jurisdictional issues: that the Court had personal jurisdiction over
the state defendant, and that it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.1 The first proposed draft of a constitutional amendment responding to Chisholm--introduced in
the House of Representatives in February 1793, on the day
after Chisholm was decided--would have overruled the first

holding, but not the second.2 That proposal was notadopted. Rather, a proposal introduced the following day in

the Senate,3 which was "cast in terms that we associate withsubject matter jurisdiction,"

4 provided the basis for the

present text of the Eleventh Amendment.This legislative history suggests that the Eleventh

Amendment is best understood as having overruled Chisholm's subject-matter jurisdiction holding, thereby re-stricting the federal courts' diversity jurisdiction. However, the Amendment left intact Chisholm's personaljurisdiction holding: that the Constitution does not immunize
States from a federal court's process. If the paramount con-cern of the Eleventh Amendment's framers had been protecting the so-called "dignity" interest of the States, surelyCongress would have endorsed the first proposed amend2 The House proposal read: "[N]o state shall be liable to be made a party
defendant, in any of the judicial courts, established, or which shall be established under the authority of the United States, at the suit of any person or persons, whether a citizen or citizens, or a foreigner or foreigners,
or of any body politic or corporate, whether within or without the United
States." Id., at 1602, and n. 211 (quoting Proceedings of the United States
House of Representatives (Feb. 19, 1793), Gazette of the United States,
Feb. 20, 1793, reprinted in 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court
of the United States, 1789-1800, pp. 605-606 (M. Marcus ed. 1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted).

3 The Senate proposal read: "The Judicial Power of the United States

shall not extend to any Suits in Law or Equity commenced or prosecuted
against any one of the United States by Citizens of another State or by
Citizens or Subjects of any foreign State." Nelson, supra, at 1603, and
n. 212 (quoting Resolution in the United States Senate (Feb. 20, 1793),
reprinted in 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court, supra, at 607-
608) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Senate version closely
tracked the ultimate language of the Eleventh Amendment. See U. S.
Const., Amdt. 11 ("The Judicial power of the United States shall not be
construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted
against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State").

ment granting the States immunity from process, rather
than the later proposal that merely delineates the subjectmatter jurisdiction of courts. Moreover, as Chief Justice
Marshall recognized, a subject-matter reading of the Amendment makes sense, considering the States' interest in avoiding their creditors. See Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat., at
406-407.

The reasons why the majority in Chisholm concluded that
the "dignity" interests underlying the sovereign immunity
of English Monarchs had not been inherited by the original
13 States remain valid today. See, e. g., Seminole Tribe of
Fla., 517 U. S., at 95-97 (Stevens, J., dissenting). By extending the untethered "dignity" rationale to the context of
routine federal administrative proceedings, today's decision
is even more anachronistic than Alden.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The Court holds that a private person cannot bring a complaint against a State to a federal administrative agency
where the agency (1) will use an internal adjudicative process to decide if the complaint is well founded, and (2) if so,
proceed to court to enforce the law. Where does the Constitution contain the principle of law that the Court enunciates?
I cannot find the answer to this question in any text, in any
tradition, or in any relevant purpose. In saying this, I do
not simply reiterate the dissenting views set forth in many of
the Court's recent sovereign immunity decisions. See, e. g.,
Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62 (2000); Alden v.
Maine, 527 U. S. 706 (1999); College Savings Bank v. Florida
Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666
(1999); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996).
For even were I to believe that those decisions properly
stated the law--which I do not--I still could not accept the
Court's conclusion here.

I
At the outset one must understand the constitutionalnature of the legal proceeding before us. The legal body

conducting the proceeding, the Federal Maritime Commis-sion, is an "independent" federal agency. Constitutionally
speaking, an "independent" agency belongs neither to theLegislative Branch nor to the Judicial Branch of Government. Although Members of this Court have referred toagencies as a "fourth branch" of Government,

FTC v. Ruber-oid Co., 343 U. S. 470, 487 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting), the

agencies, even "independent" agencies, are more appropri-ately considered to be part of the Executive Branch. See
Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 910 (1991) (Scalia,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The
President appoints their chief administrators, typically aChairman and Commissioners, subject to confirmation by the
Senate. Cf. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723 (1986).The agencies derive their legal powers from congressionally
enacted statutes. And the agencies enforce those statutes,
i. e., they "execute" them, in part by making rules or by adju-dicating matters in dispute. Cf. Panama Refining Co. v.

Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 428-429 (1935).The Court long ago laid to rest any constitutional doubts
about whether the Constitution permitted Congress to dele-gate rulemaking and adjudicative powers to agencies.

E. g.,ICC v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 167 U. S. 479, 494-495

(1897) (permitting rulemaking); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.22, 46 (1932) (permitting adjudication); Commodity Futures
Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 852 (1986) (same).That, in part, is because the Court established certain safeguards surrounding the exercise of these powers. See, e. g.,A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S.
495 (1935) (nondelegation doctrine); Crowell, supra (re-quiring judicial review). And the Court denied that those
activities as safeguarded, however much they might resemble the activities of a legislature or court, fell within the

scope of Article I or Article III of the Constitution. Schechter Poultry, supra, at 529-530; Crowell, supra, at 50-53; see
also INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 953, n. 16 (1983) (agency'suse of rulemaking "resemble[s]," but is not, lawmaking).

Consequently, in exercising those powers, the agency is en-gaging in an Article II, Executive Branch activity. And the
powers it is exercising are powers that the Executive Branch
of Government must possess if it is to enforce modern lawthrough administration.

This constitutional understanding explains why both com-mentators and courts have often attached the prefix "quasi"
to descriptions of an agency's rulemaking or adjudicative
functions. E. g., Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295
U. S. 602, 629 (1935); 3 C. Koch, Administrative Law and
Practice $ 12.13 (2d ed. 1997); Shapiro, The Choice of Rulemaking or Adjudication in the Development of Administrative Policy, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 921, 954-958 (1965); Friendly,
The Federal Administrative Agencies: The Need for Better
Definition of Standards, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 863, 869-870 (1962).
The terms "quasi legislative" and "quasi adjudicative" indicate that the agency uses legislative like or court like
procedures but that it is not, constitutionally speaking, either
a legislature or a court. See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 472-473 (2001); Freytag,
supra, at 910 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment).

The case before us presents a fairly typical example of a
federal administrative agency's use of agency adjudication.
Congress has enacted a statute, the Shipping Act of 1984
(Act or Shipping Act), 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1701 et seq. (1994
ed. and Supp. V), which, among other things, forbids marine
terminal operators to discriminate against terminal users.

$ 1709(d)(4) (1994 ed., Supp. V). The Act grants the Federal
Maritime Commission the authority to administer the Act.
The law grants the Commission the authority to enforce the
Act in a variety of ways, for example, by making rules and

regulations, $ 1716 (1994 ed.), by issuing or revoking licenses,$ 1718 (1994 ed., Supp. V), and by conducting investigations

and issuing reports, see generally $ 1710 (1994 ed. and Supp.V). It also permits a private person to file a complaint,
which the Commission is to consider. $ 1710(a) (1994 ed.).Interestingly enough, it does not say that the Commission
must determine the merits of the complaint through agency
adjudication, see $ 1710(g) (1994 ed., Supp. V)--though, forpresent purposes, I do not see that this statutory lacuna

matters.Regardless, the Federal Maritime Commission has decided
to evaluate complaints through an adjudicative process.
That process involves assignment to an administrative law
judge, 46 CFR $ 502.146(a) (2001), a hearing, an initial decision, $$ 502.147, 502.223, Commission review, and a final
Commission decision, $ 502.227, followed by federal appellate
court review, 28 U. S. C. $ 2342(3)(B). The initial hearing,
like a typical court hearing, involves a neutral decisionmaker, an opportunity to present a case or defense through
oral or documentary evidence, a right to cross-examination,
and a written record that typically constitutes the basis for
decision. 46 CFR $ 502.154 (2001). But unlike a typical
court proceeding, the agency process also may involve considerable hearsay, resolution of factual disputes through the
use of "official notice," $ 502.156; see also 5 U. S. C. $ 556, and
final decisionmaking by a Commission that remains free to
disregard the initial decision and decide the matter on its
own--indeed through the application of substantive as well
as procedural rules, that it, the Commission, itself has created. See 46 CFR $$ 502.226, 502.227, 502.230 (2001); see
also 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1716 (1994 ed.) (rulemaking authority);
46 CFR $$ 502.51-502.56 (2001) (same).

The outcome of this process is often a Commission order,
say, an order that tells a party to cease and desist from certain activity or that tells one party to pay money damages
(called "reparations") to another. The Commission cannot

itself enforce such an order. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1712(e).Rather, the Shipping Act says that, to obtain enforcement of

an order providing for money damages, the private partybeneficiary of the order must obtain a court order. $ 1713(d).
It adds that, to obtain enforcement of other commission or-ders, either the private party or the Attorney General must
go to court. $ 1713(c). It also permits the Commission to
seek a court injunction prohibiting any person from violatingthe Shipping Act. $ 1710(g) (1994 ed., Supp. V). And it

authorizes the Commission to assess civil penalties (payableto the United States) against a person who fails to obey a
Commission order; but to collect the penalties, the Commission, again, must go to court. $$ 1712(a), (c) (1994 ed. and
Supp. V).

The upshot is that this case involves a typical Executive
Branch agency exercising typical Executive Branch powers
seeking to determine whether a particular person has violated federal law. Cf. 2 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise 37-38 (1994) (describing typical agency
characteristics); cf. also SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S.
194 (1947). The particular person in this instance is a state
entity, the South Carolina State Ports Authority, and the
agency is acting in response to the request of a private
individual. But at first blush it is difficult to see why these
special circumstances matter. After all, the Constitution
created a Federal Government empowered to enact laws that
would bind the States and it empowered that Federal Government to enforce those laws against the States. See
Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U. S. 149, 160 (1920).
It also left private individuals perfectly free to complain to
the Federal Government about unlawful state activity, and
it left the Federal Government free to take subsequent legal
action. Where then can the Court find its constitutional
principle--the principle that the Constitution forbids an
Executive Branch agency to determine through ordinary
adjudicative processes whether such a private complaint is

justified? As I have said, I cannot find that principle any-where in the Constitution.

II
The Court's principle lacks any firm anchor in the Consti-tution's text. The Eleventh Amendment cannot help. It

says:

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not . . .extend to any suit . . . commenced or prosecuted against

one of the . . . States by Citizens of another State."(Emphasis added.)

Federal administrative agencies do not exercise the "[ j]udi-cial power of the United States." Compare Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22 (1932) (explaining why ordinary agency ad-judication, with safeguards, is not an exercise of Article III
power), with Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S., at 890-891(Tax Court, a special Article I court, exercises Article III
power), and Williams v. United States, 289 U. S. 553, 565-566 (1933) (same as to Court of Claims). Of course, this
Court has read the words "Citizens of another State" as ifthey also said "citizen of the same State." Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890). But it has never said that the words"[ j]udicial power of the United States" mean "the executive
power of the United States." Nor should it.The Tenth Amendment cannot help. It says:

"The powers not delegated to the United States by theConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
The Constitution has "delegated to the United States" thepower here in question, the power "[t]o regulate Commerce

with foreign Nations, and among the several States." U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3; see

California v. United States, 320U. S. 577, 586 (1944). The Court finds within this delegation

a hidden reservation, a reservation that, due to sovereignimmunity, embodies the legal principle the Court enunciates.

Breyer, J., dissenting

But the text of the Tenth Amendment says nothing aboutany such hidden reservation, one way or the other.

Indeed, the Court refers for textual support only to anearlier case, namely, Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706 (1999)
(holding that sovereign immunity prohibits a private citizenfrom suing a State in state court), and, through Alden, to
the texts that Alden mentioned. These textual referencesinclude: (1) what Alexander Hamilton described as a constitutional "postulate," namely, that the States retain their im-munity from "suits, without their consent," unless there has
been a "surrender" of that immunity "in the plan of the con-vention,"

id., at 730 (internal quotation marks omitted);(2) what the Alden majority called "the system of federalism

established by the Constitution," ibid.; and (3) what theAlden majority called "the constitutional design," id., at 731.
See also id., at 760-762 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting thatthe Court's opinion nowhere relied on constitutional text).

Considered purely as constitutional text, these words--"constitutional design," "system of federalism," and "plan of
the convention"--suffer several defects. Their language ishighly abstract, making them difficult to apply. They invite
differing interpretations at least as much as do the Constitu-tion's own broad liberty-protecting phrases, such as "due
process of law" or the word "liberty" itself. And comparedto these latter phrases, they suffer the additional disadvantage that they do not actually appear anywhere in the Con-stitution. Cf. generally

Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.957, 985-986 (1991). Regardless, unless supported by considerations of history, of constitutional purpose, or of relatedconsequence, those abstract phrases cannot support today's
result. III

Conceding that its conception of sovereign immunity is un-grounded in the Constitution's text, see ante, at 751-753,
767-768, n. 18, the Court attempts to support its holding withhistory. But this effort is similarly destined to fail, because

Breyer, J., dissenting
the very history to which the majority turned in Alden hereargues against the Court's basic analogy--between a federal

administrative proceeding triggered by a private citizen anda private citizen's lawsuit against a State.

In Alden the Court said that feudal law had createdan 18th-century legal norm to the effect that " `no lord could
be sued by a vassal in his own court, but each petty lord was
subject to suit in the courts of a higher lord.' " 527 U. S., at741. It added that the Framers' silence about the matter

had woven that feudal "norm" into the "constitutional de-sign,"

i. e., had made it part of our "system of federalism"
unchanged by the " `plan of the convention.' " Id., at 714-
717, 730, 740-743. And that norm, said the Alden Court,
by analogy forbids a citizen ("vassal") to sue a State ("lord")
in the "lord's" own courts. Here that same norm argues
against immunity, for the forum at issue is federal--belonging by analogy to the "higher lord." And total 18th-century
silence about state immunity in Article I proceedings would
argue against, not in favor of, immunity.

In any event, the 18th century was not totally silent. The
Framers enunciated in the "plan of the convention" the
principle that the Federal Government may sue a State
without its consent. See, e. g., West Virginia v. United
States, 479 U. S. 305, 311 (1987). They also described in the
First Amendment the right of a citizen to petition the Federal Government for a redress of grievances. See also
United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 552-553 (1876);
cf. generally Mark, The Vestigial Constitution: The History
and Significance of the Right to Petition, 66 Ford. L. Rev.
2153, 2227 (1998). The first principle applies here because
only the Federal Government, not the private party, can--in
light of this Court's recent sovereign immunity jurisprudence, see Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44
(1996)--bring the ultimate court action necessary legally to
force a State to comply with the relevant federal law. See
id., at 71, n. 14. The second principle applies here be535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting

cause a private citizen has asked the Federal Government todetermine whether the State has complied with federal law

and, if not, to take appropriate legal action in court.Of course these two principles apply only through analogy.
(The Court's decision also relies on analogy--one that jumpsthe separation-of-powers boundary that the Constitution establishes.) Yet the analogy seems apt. A private citizen,
believing that a State has violated federal law, seeks a deter-mination by an Executive Branch agency that he is right; the

agency will make that determination through use of its ownadjudicatory agency processes; and, if the State fails to comply, the Federal Government may bring an action against the
State in federal court to enforce the federal law.

Twentieth-century legal history reinforces the appropriateness of this description. The growth of the administrative state has led this Court to determine that administrative
agencies are not Article III courts, see Crowell v. Benson,
285 U. S., at 49-53, that they have broad discretion to proceed either through agency adjudication or through rulemaking, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S., at 203 ("[T]he
choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in the
informed discretion of the administrative agency"), and that
they may bring administrative enforcement proceedings
against States. At a minimum these historically established
legal principles argue strongly against any effort to analogize the present proceedings to a lawsuit brought by a
private individual against a State in a state court or to an
Eleventh Amendment type lawsuit brought by a private individual against a State in a federal court.

This is not to say that the analogy (with a citizen petitioning for federal intervention) is, historically speaking, a perfect one. As the Court points out, the Framers may not
have "anticipated the vast growth of the administrative
state," and the history of their debates "does not provide
direct guidance." Ante, at 755. But the Court is wrong to

ignore the relevance and importance of what the Framersdid say. And it is doubly wrong to attach "great" legal "significance" to the absence of 18th- and 19th-century adminis-trative agency experience. See ibid. Even if those alive in
the 18th century did not "anticipat[e] the vast growth of theadministrative state," ibid., they did write a Constitution designed to provide a framework for Government across thecenturies, a framework that is flexible enough to meet modern needs. And we cannot read their silence about particu-lar means as if it were an instruction to forbid their use.

IV
The Court argues that the basic purpose of "sovereign im-munity" doctrine--namely, preservation of a State's "dignity"--requires application of that doctrine here. It reststhis argument upon (1) its efforts to analogize agency proceedings to court proceedings, and (2) its claim that theagency proceedings constitute a form of "compulsion" exercised by a private individual against the State. As I havejust explained, I believe its efforts to analogize agencies to
courts are, constitutionally speaking, too frail to support itsconclusion. Neither can its claim of "compulsion" provide
the necessary support.Viewed from a purely legal perspective, the "compulsion"
claim is far too weak. That is because the private individuallacks the legal authority to compel the State to comply with
the law. For as I have noted, in light of the Court's recentsovereign immunity decisions, if an individual does bring suit
to enforce the Commission's order, see 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1713(1994 ed.), the State would arguably be free to claim sovereign immunity. See Seminole Tribe of Fla., supra. Onlythe Federal Government, acting through the Commission
or the Attorney General, has the authority to compel theState to act.

In a typical instance, the private individual will file a com-plaint, the agency will adjudicate the complaint, and the

agency will reach a decision. The State subsequently may
take the matter to court in order to obtain judicial review of
any adverse agency ruling, but, if it does so, its opponent in
that court proceeding is not a private party, but the agency
itself. 28 U. S. C. $ 2344. (And unlike some other administrative schemes, see, e. g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of Md., ante, at 651-653 (Souter, J., concurring),
the Commission would not be a party in name only.) Alternatively, the State may do nothing, in which case either the
Commission or the Attorney General must seek a court order
compelling the State to obey. 46 U. S. C. App. $$ 1710, 1713
(1994 ed. and Supp. V). The Commission, but not a private
party, may assess a penalty against the State for noncompliance, $ 1712; and only a court acting at the Commission's request can compel compliance with a penalty order. In sum,
no one can legally compel the State's obedience to the Shipping Act's requirements without a court order, and in no case
would a court issue such an order (absent a State's voluntary
waiver of sovereign immunity, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238 (1985)) absent the request
of a federal agency or other federal instrumentality.

In Alden this Court distinguished for sovereign immunity
purposes between (a) a lawsuit brought by the Federal Government and (b) a lawsuit brought by a private person. It
held that principles of "sovereign immunity" barred suit in
the latter instance but not the former, because the former--
a suit by the Federal Government--"require[s] the exercise
of political responsibility for each suit prosecuted against a
State." 527 U. S., at 756. That same "exercise of political
responsibility" must take place here in every instance prior
to the issuance of an order that, from a legal perspective,
will compel the State to obey. To repeat: Without a court
proceeding the private individual cannot legally force the
State to act, to pay, or to desist; only the Federal Government may institute a court proceeding; and, in deciding

535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
whether to do so, the Federal Government will exerciseappropriate political responsibility. Cf.

ibid.
Viewed from a practical perspective, the Court's "com-pulsion" claim proves far too much. Certainly, a private

citizen's decision to file a complaint with the Commissioncan produce practical pressures upon the State to respond
and eventually to comply with a Commission decision. By
appearing before the Commission, the State will be ableto obtain full judicial review of an adverse agency decision

in a court of appeals (where it will face in opposition theCommission itself, not the private party). By appearing,
the State will avoid any potential Commission-assessed monetary penalty. And by complying, it will avoid the adverse
political, practical, and symbolic implications of being labeled
a federal "lawbreaker."

Practical pressures such as these, however, cannot sufficiently "affront" a State's "dignity" as to warrant constitutional "sovereign immunity" protections, for it is easy to
imagine comparable instances of clearly lawful private citizen complaints to Government that place a State under far
greater practical pressures to comply. No one doubts, for
example, that a private citizen can complain to Congress,
which may threaten (should the State fail to respond) to
enact a new law that the State opposes. Nor does anyone
deny that a private citizen, in complaining to a federal
agency, may seek a rulemaking proceeding, which may lead
the agency (should the State fail to respond) to enact a new
agency rule that the State opposes. A private citizen may
ask an agency formally to declare that a State is not in compliance with a statute or federal rule, even though from that
formal declaration may flow a host of legal consequences adverse to a State's interests. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 300g-3
(Environmental Protection Agency may declare that a State
is in noncompliance with federal water quality regulations).
And one can easily imagine a legal scheme in which a private
individual files a complaint like the one before us, but asks

an agency staff member to investigate the matter, whichinvestigation would lead to an order similar to the order

at issue here with similar legal and practical consequences.Viewed solely in terms of practical pressures, the pressures upon a State to respond before Congress or the agency,to answer the private citizen's accusations, to oppose his requests for legally adverse agency or congressional action,
would seem no less powerful than those at issue here. Onceone avoids the temptation to think (mistakenly) of an agency

as a court, it is difficult to see why the practical pressuresat issue here would "affront" a State's "dignity" any more
than those just mentioned. And if the latter create no constitutional "dignity" problem, why should the former? The
Court's answer--that "[s]overeign immunity concerns are
not implicated" unless the "Federal Government attempts to
coerce States into answering the complaints of private parties in an adjudicative proceeding," ante, at 764, n. 16--simply begs the question of when and why States should be entitled to special constitutional protection.

The Court's more direct response lies in its claim that the
practical pressures here are special, arising from a set of
statutes that deprive a nonresponding State of any meaningful judicial review of the agency's determinations. See ante,
at 760-764. The Court does not explain just what makes
this kind of pressure constitutionally special. But in any
event, the Court's response is inadequate. The statutes
clearly provide the State with full judicial review of the
initial agency decision should the State choose to seek that
review. 28 U. S. C. $ 2342(3)(B)(iv). That review cannot
"affront" the State's "dignity, for it takes place in a court
proceeding in which the Commission, not the private party,
will oppose the State. $ 2344.

Even were that not so, Congress could easily resolve the
resulting problem by making clear that the relevant statutes
authorize full judicial review in an enforcement action
brought against a State. For that matter, one might in535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
terpret existing statutes as permitting in such actions what-ever form of judicial review the Constitution demands.

Cf. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S., at 45-47. Statutory lan-guage that authorizes review of whether an order was "properly made and duly issued," 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1713(c), doesnot forbid review that the Constitution requires. But even
were I to make the heroic assumption (which I do not be-lieve) that this case implicates a reviewing court's statutory
inability to apply constitutionally requisite standards of judi-cial review, I should still conclude that the Constitution permits the agency to consider the complaint here before us.The "review standards" problem concerns the later enforceability of the agency decision, and the Court must considerany such problem later in the context of a court order granting or denying review. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288,347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (" `It is not the habit of
the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature un-less absolutely necessary to a decision of the case' ").

V
The Court cannot justify today's decision in terms of itspractical consequences. The decision, while permitting an

agency to bring enforcement actions against States, forbidsit to use agency adjudication in order to help decide whether
to do so. Consequently the agency must rely more heavilyupon its own informal staff investigations in order to decide
whether a citizen's complaint has merit. The natural resultis less agency flexibility, a larger federal bureaucracy, less
fair procedure, and potentially less effective law enforce-ment. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV
Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654-656 (1990); cf. also Shapiro, 78 Harv.L. Rev., at 921 ("One of the most distinctive aspects of the
administrative process is the flexibility it affords in the selec-tion of methods for policy formulation"). And at least one
of these consequences, the forced growth of unnecessary fed-eral bureaucracy, undermines the very constitutional objec535US3 Unit: $U53 [09-29-03 15:03:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tives the Court's decision claims to serve. Cf. Printz v.United States, 521 U. S. 898, 959 (1997) (

Stevens, J., dissent-ing) ("In the name of State's rights, the majority would have

the Federal Government create vast national bureaucraciesto implement its policies");

id., at 976-978 (Breyer, J.,dissenting).

These consequences are not purely theoretical. TheCourt's decision may undermine enforcement against state
employers of many laws designed to protect worker healthand safety. See,

e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 7622 (1994 ed.) (Clean AirAct); 33 U. S. C. $ 1367 (Clean Water Act); 15 U. S. C. $ 2622

(Toxic Substances Control Act); 42 U. S. C. $ 6971 (1994 ed.)(Solid Waste Disposal Act); see also Rhode Island Dept. of
Environmental Management v. United States, 286 F. 3d 27,36-40 (CA1 2002). And it may inhibit the development of
federal fair, rapid, and efficient informal nonjudicial re-sponses to complaints, for example, of improper medical care
(involving state hospitals). Cf. generally Macchiaroli, Medi-cal Malpractice Screening Panels: Proposed Model Legislation to Cure Judicial Ills, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 181 (1990).

* * *
The Court's decision threatens to deny the Executive andLegislative Branches of Government the structural flexibility that the Constitution permits and which modern govern-ment demands. The Court derives from the abstract notion
of state "dignity" a structural principle that limits the pow-ers of both Congress and the President. Its reasoning rests
almost exclusively upon the use of a formal analogy, which,as I have said, jumps ordinary separation-of-powers bounds.
It places "great significance" upon the 18th-century absenceof 20th-century administrative proceedings. See ante, at
755. And its conclusion draws little support from considera-tions of constitutional purpose or related consequence. In
its readiness to rest a structural limitation on so little evi-dence and in its willingness to interpret that limitation so

Breyer, J., dissenting
broadly, the majority ignores a historical lesson, reflected ina constitutional understanding that the Court adopted long

ago: An overly restrictive judicial interpretation of the Con-stitution's structural constraints (unlike its protections of
certain basic liberties) will undermine the Constitution's ownefforts to achieve its far more basic structural aim, the creation of a representative form of government capable of
translating the people's will into effective public action.This understanding, underlying constitutional interpretation since the New Deal, reflects the Constitution's demandsfor structural flexibility sufficient to adapt substantive laws
and institutions to rapidly changing social, economic, and
technological conditions. It reflects the comparative inability of the Judiciary to understand either those conditions or
the need for new laws and new administrative forms they
may create. It reflects the Framers' own aspiration to write
a document that would "constitute" a democratic, libertyprotecting form of government that would endure through
centuries of change. This understanding led the New Deal
Court to reject overly restrictive formalistic interpretations
of the Constitution's structural provisions, thereby permitting Congress to enact social and economic legislation that
circumstances had led the public to demand. And it led that
Court to find in the Constitution authorization for new forms
of administration, including independent administrative
agencies, with the legal authority flexibly to implement, i. e.,
to "execute," through adjudication, through rulemaking, and
in other ways, the legislation that Congress subsequently
enacted. See, e. g., Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414
(1944); Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 45-47.

Where I believe the Court has departed from this basic
understanding I have consistently dissented. See, e. g.,
Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S., at 92 (Stevens,
J., dissenting in part and concurring in part); Alden v. Maine,

unless the consequences of the Court's approach prove ano-dyne, as I hope, rather than randomly destructive, as I fear.

GISBRECHT et al. v. BARNHART, COMMISSIONER

OF SOCIAL SECURITY

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-131. Argued March 20, 2002--Decided May 28, 2002
An attorney who successfully represents a Social Security benefits claimant in court may be awarded as part of the judgment "a reasonable
fee . . . not in excess of 25 percent of the . . . past-due benefits" awarded
to the claimant. 42 U. S. C. $ 406(b)(1)(A). The fee is payable "out of,
and not in addition to, the amount of [the] past-due benefits." Ibid. In
many cases, as in the instant case, the Equal Access to Justice Act
(EAJA) effectively increases the portion of past-due benefits the successful Social Security claimant may pocket. Under EAJA, a party
prevailing against the United States in court may be awarded fees payable by the United States if the Government's position in the litigation
was not "substantially justified." 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(A). Congress
harmonized fees payable by the Government under EAJA with fees
payable under $ 406(b) out of the Social Security claimant's past-due benefits: Fee awards may be made under both prescriptions, but the claimant's attorney must refund to the claimant the amount of the smaller
fee, up to the point the claimant receives 100 percent of the past-due
benefits.

Petitioners Gisbrecht, Miller, and Sandine brought separate actions in
the District Court seeking Social Security disability benefits under Title
II of the Social Security Act. All three were represented by the same
attorneys and prevailed on the merits of their claims. Each petitioner
then successfully sought attorneys' fees under EAJA. Pursuant to
contingent-fee agreements standard for Social Security claimant representation, each petitioner had agreed to pay counsel 25 percent of all
past-due benefits recovered. Their attorneys accordingly requested
$7,091.50 from Gisbrecht's recovery, $7,514 from Miller's, and $13,988
from Sandine's. Given the EAJA offsets, the amounts in fact payable
from each client's past-due benefits recovery would have been $3,752.39
from Gisbrecht's recovery, $2,349.25 from Miller's, and $7,151.90 from
Sandine's. Following Ninth Circuit precedent, the District Court in
each case declined to give effect to the attorney-client fee agreement,
instead employing a "lodestar" method, under which the number of
hours reasonably devoted to each case was multiplied by the reasonable
hourly fee. This method yielded as $ 406(b) fees $3,135 from Gisbrecht's

Syllabus
recovery, $5,461.50 from Miller's, and $6,550 from Sandine's. Offsetting
the EAJA awards against the lodestar determinations, the court determined that no portion of Gisbrecht's or Sandine's past-due benefits
was payable to counsel, and that only $296.75 of Miller's recovery was
payable to her counsel. The Ninth Circuit consolidated the cases and
affirmed.

Held: Section 406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements within

the statutory ceiling; instead, $ 406(b) instructs courts to review for reasonableness fees yielded by those agreements. Pp. 799-809.

(a) Section 406(b)'s words, read in isolation, could be construed
to allow either the Ninth Circuit's lodestar approach or petitioners'
position that the attorney-client fee agreement should control, if not
"in excess of 25 percent of . . . the past-due benefits." Because the
statute's text is inconclusive, this Court takes into account, as interpretive guides, the origin and standard application of the proffered
approaches. Pp. 799-800.

(b) The lodestar method, though rooted in accounting practices
adopted in the 1940's, did not gain a firm foothold in the federal courts
until the mid-1970's. The lodestar method today holds sway in federalcourt adjudication of disputes over the amount of fees properly shifted
to the loser in the litigation. Fees shifted to the losing party, however,
are not at issue here. Pp. 800-802.

(c) Section 406(b) authorizes fees payable from the successful party's
recovery. Characteristically in Social Security benefits cases, attorneys
and clients enter into contingent-fee agreements specifying that the attorney's fee will be 25 percent of any past-due benefits to which the
claimant becomes entitled. Contingent-fee arrangements, though problematic, particularly when not exposed to court review, are common in
the United States in many settings, and Social Security representation
operates largely on a contingent-fee basis. Before 1965, the Social
Security Act imposed no limits on contingent-fee agreements drawn by
counsel and signed by benefits claimants. Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees reserved for lawyers one-third to one-half of the accrued
benefits; the longer the litigation persisted, the greater the buildup of
past-due benefits and, correspondingly, of legal fees awardable from
those benefits if the claimant prevailed. Attending to these realities,
Congress provided for a reasonable fee, not in excess of 25 percent of
accrued benefits, as part of the court's judgment, and specified that no
other fee would be payable. Violation of these limitations was made a
criminal offense. In addition to protecting claimants against inordinately large fees, Congress sought to ensure that attorneys successfully
representing Social Security claimants would not risk nonpayment by

Syllabus
their clients. Congress therefore authorized agency payment of fees
directly to counsel from funds withheld from the claimant's past-due
benefits. But nothing in $ 406(b)'s text or history reveals a design to
prohibit or discourage attorneys and claimants from entering into
contingent-fee agreements. Given the prevalence of such agreements
between attorneys and Social Security benefits claimants, it is unlikely
that Congress, simply by prescribing "reasonable fees," meant to outlaw,
rather than to contain, the fee agreements. Pp. 802-805.

(d) This conclusion is bolstered by Congress' 1990 authorization of
contingent-fee agreements under $ 406(a), which governs fees for
agency-level representation. It would be anomalous if contract-based
fees expressly authorized by $ 406(a)(2) at the administrative level were
disallowed for court representation under $ 406(b). It is also unlikely
that Congress, legislating in 1965, intended to install a lodestar method
that courts did not develop and employ until years later. Furthermore,
the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the
losing party. In such cases, nothing prevents the attorney for the prevailing party from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from
his own client. But $ 406(b) governs the total fee a successful Social
Security claimant's attorney may receive for court representation.
Nothing more may be demanded or received from the benefits claimant. Pp. 805-807.

(e) Most plausibly read, $ 406(b) does not displace contingent-fee
agreements as the primary means by which fees are set for successfully
representing Social Security benefits claimants in court. Rather,

$ 406(b) calls for court review of such arrangements to assure that they
yield reasonable results in particular cases. Within the 25 percent
boundary Congress provided, the attorney for the successful claimant
must show that the fee sought is reasonable for the services rendered.
Courts have reduced the attorney's recovery based on the character of
the representation and the results the representative achieved. If the
attorney is responsible for delay, for example, a reduction is in order so
that the attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefits during
the pendency of the case in court. And if the benefits are large in
comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward
adjustment is similarly in order. Pp. 807-808.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the fees that may be awarded attorneys
who successfully represent Social Security benefits claimants
in court. Under 42 U. S. C. $ 406(b) (1994 ed. and Supp. V),1
a prevailing claimant's fees are payable only out of the benefits recovered; in amount, such fees may not exceed 25 percent of past-due benefits. At issue is a question that has
sharply divided the Federal Courts of Appeals: What is the
appropriate starting point for judicial determinations of
"a reasonable fee for [representation before the court]"?
See ibid. Is the contingent-fee agreement between claimant
and counsel, if not in excess of 25 percent of past-due benefits, presumptively reasonable? Or should courts begin with
a lodestar calculation (hours reasonably spent on the case
times reasonable hourly rate) of the kind we have approved
under statutes that shift the obligation to pay to the loser in
the litigation? See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 426

ney's fee as part of the costs" (internal quotation marksomitted)).

Congress, we conclude, designed $ 406(b) to control, notto displace, fee agreements between Social Security benefits
claimants and their counsel. Because the decision before usfor review rests on lodestar calculations and rejects the primacy of lawful attorney-client fee agreements, we reversethe judgment below and remand for recalculation of counsel

A
Fees for representation of individuals claiming Social Se-curity old-age, survivor, or disability benefits, both at the

administrative level and in court, are governed by prescrip-tions Congress originated in 1965. Social Security Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 403, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 406.2

2 Before 1965, Congress did not explicitly authorize attorney's fees for
in-court representation of Social Security benefits claimants. At least
two Courts of Appeals, however, concluded that 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g) implicitly authorized such fees. See Bowen v. Galbreath, 485 U. S. 74, 75-76
(1988) (citing Celebrezze v. Sparks, 342 F. 2d 286 (CA5 1965)) ("Under 42
U. S. C. $ 405(g), a court reviewing [a Social Security benefits decision] has
the power to enter `a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the
decision . . . .' The court in Sparks reasoned that where a statute gives
a court jurisdiction, it must be presumed, absent any indication to the
contrary, that the court was intended to exercise all the powers of a court,
including the power to provide for payment of attorney's fees out of any
recovery. 342 F. 2d, at 288-289 [citing Folsom v. McDonald, 237 F. 2d
380, 382-383 (CA4 1956)].").

As to administrative proceedings, the Social Security Act originally
made no provision for attorney's fees. 49 Stat. 620 (1935). Four years
later, Congress amended the Act to permit the Social Security Board to
prescribe maximum fees attorneys could charge for representation of
claimants before the agency. Social Security Act Amendments of 1939,
53 Stat. 1360. Congress expected the need for counsel in agency proceedings to be slim. H. R. Rep. No. 728, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 44-45 (1939);
S. Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 53 (1939). The Board subsequently
established a maximum fee of $10, permitting a higher fee only by petition

794 GISBRECHT v. BARNHART

Opinion of the Court
The statute deals with the administrative and judicial reviewstages discretely: $ 406(a) governs fees for representation in

administrative proceedings; $ 406(b) controls fees for repre-sentation in court. See also 20 CFR $ 404.1728(a) (2001).

For representation of a benefits claimant at the adminis-trative level, an attorney may file a fee petition or a fee
agreement. 42 U. S. C. $ 406(a). In response to a petition,the agency may allow fees "for services performed in connection with any claim before" it; if a determination favorableto the benefits claimant has been made, however, the Commissioner of Social Security "shall . . . fix . . . a reasonablefee" for an attorney's services. $ 406(a)(1) (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). In setting fees under this method, the agencytakes into account, in addition to any benefits award, several
other factors. See 20 CFR $ 404.1725(b) (2001).3 Fees may
to the agency. 20 CFR $ 403.713(d) (1949). The agency later prescribed
separate fees for representation at the initial and appellate levels of the
administrative process. 20 CFR $ 404.976 (1961).

3 Title 20 CFR $ 404.1725(b) provides:

"Evaluating a request for approval of a fee.
"(1) When we evaluate a representative's request for approval of a fee,
we consider the purpose of the social security program, which is to provide
a measure of economic security for the beneficiaries of the program, together with--

"(i) The extent and type of services the representative performed;
"(ii) The complexity of the case;
"(iii) The level of skill and competence required of the representative
in giving the services;

"(iv) The amount of time the representative spent on the case;
"(v) The results the representative achieved;
"(vi) The level of review to which the claim was taken and the level of
the review at which the representative became your representative; and

"(vii) The amount of fee the representative requests for his or her services, including any amount authorized or requested before, but not including the amount of any expenses he or she incurred.

"(2) Although we consider the amount of benefits, if any, that are payable, we do not base the amount of fee we authorize on the amount of the
benefit alone, but on a consideration of all the factors listed in this section.
The benefits payable in any claim are determined by specific provisions

Opinion of the Court
be authorized, on petition, even if the benefits claimant wasunsuccessful. $ 404.1725(b)(2).

As an alternative to fee petitions, the Social Security Act,as amended in 1990, accommodates contingent-fee agreements filed with the agency in advance of a ruling on theclaim for benefits. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1990, 104 Stat. 1388-266 to 1388-267, as amended, 42 U. S. C.$$ 406(a)(2)-(4) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). If the ruling on the
benefits claim is favorable to the claimant, the agency willgenerally approve the fee agreement, subject to this limitation: Fees may not exceed the lesser of 25 percent of past-duebenefits or $4,000 (increased to $5,300 effective February
2002). $$ 406(a)(2)(A)(ii), (iii) (1994 ed.); 67 Fed. Reg. 2477(2002); see Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings
and Appeals, Litigation Law Manual (HALLEX) I-5-109III.A (Feb. 5, 1999).

For proceedings in court, Congress provided for fees onrendition of "a judgment favorable to a claimant." 42
U. S. C. $ 406(b)(1)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V). The Commis-sioner has interpreted $ 406(b) to "prohibi[t] a lawyer from
charging fees when there is no award of back benefits."Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38; see Brief in Opposition 12, n. 12 (reading $ 406(b) to "prohibi[t] other [fee] arrangements such asnon-contingent hourly fees").

As part of its judgment, a court may allow "a reasonablefee . . . not in excess of 25 percent of the . . . past-due benefits" awarded to the claimant. $ 406(b)(1)(A). The fee ispayable "out of, and not in addition to, the amount of [the]
past-due benefits." Ibid. Because benefits amounts fig-uring in the fee calculation are limited to those past due, attorneys may not gain additional fees based on a claimant'scontinuing entitlement to benefits.

The prescriptions set out in $$ 406(a) and (b) establish theexclusive regime for obtaining fees for successful represenof law and are unrelated to the efforts of the representative. We may
authorize a fee even if no benefits are payable."

Opinion of the Court
tation of Social Security benefits claimants. Collecting or
even demanding from the client anything more than the authorized allocation of past-due benefits is a criminal offense.

$$ 406(a)(5), (b)(2) (1994 ed.); 20 CFR $$ 404.1740-1799 (2001).

In many cases, as in the instant case, the Equal Access to
Justice Act (EAJA), enacted in 1980, effectively increases
the portion of past-due benefits the successful Social Security claimant may pocket. 94 Stat. 2329, as amended, 28
U. S. C. $ 2412. Under EAJA, a party prevailing against the
United States in court, including a successful Social Security
benefits claimant, may be awarded fees payable by the
United States if the Government's position in the litigation
was not "substantially justified." $ 2412(d)(1)(A). EAJA
fees are determined not by a percent of the amount recovered, but by the "time expended" and the attorney's
"[hourly] rate," $ 2412(d)(1)(B), capped in the mine run of
cases at $125 per hour, $ 2412(d)(2)(A).4 Cf. 5 U. S. C. $ 504
(authorizing payment of attorney's fees by the Government
when a party prevails in a federal agency adjudication).

Congress harmonized fees payable by the Government
under EAJA with fees payable under $ 406(b) out of the
claimant's past-due Social Security benefits in this manner:
Fee awards may be made under both prescriptions, but the
claimant's attorney must "refun[d] to the claimant the
amount of the smaller fee." Act of Aug. 5, 1985, Pub. L.
99-80, $ 3, 99 Stat. 186. "Thus, an EAJA award offsets an
award under Section 406(b), so that the [amount of the total
past-due benefits the claimant actually receives] will be increased by the . . . EAJA award up to the point the claimant
receives 100 percent of the past-due benefits." Brief for
United States 3.

4 A higher fee may be awarded if "the court determines that an increase
in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of
qualified attorneys for the proceeding involved, justifies a higher fee." 28
U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii).

Petitioners Gary Gisbrecht, Barbara Miller, and NancySandine brought three separate actions in the District Court

for the District of Oregon under 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g) (1994ed.),

5 seeking Social Security disability benefits under

Title II of the Social Security Act. All three petitionerswere represented by the same attorneys, and all three prevailed on the merits of their claims. Gisbrecht was awarded$28,366 in past-due benefits; Miller, $30,056; and Sandine, $55,952. Each petitioner then successfully soughtattorneys' fees payable by the United States under EAJA:
Gisbrecht was awarded $3,339.11, Miller, $5,164.75, andSandine, $6,836.10.

Pursuant to contingent-fee agreements standard for SocialSecurity claimant representation, see 1 B. Samuels, Social
Security Disability Claims $ 21:10 (2d ed. 1994), Gisbrecht,Miller, and Sandine had each agreed to pay counsel 25 percent of all past-due benefits recovered, App. to Pet. for Cert.72-86. Their attorneys accordingly requested $ 406(b) fees
of $7,091.50 from Gisbrecht's recovery, $7,514 from Miller's,and $13,988 from Sandine's. Given the EAJA offsets, the
amounts in fact payable from each client's past-due benefitsrecovery would have been $3,752.39 from Gisbrecht's recovery, $2,349.25 from Miller's, and $7,151.90 from Sandine's.

Following Circuit precedent, see Allen v. Shalala, 48 F. 3d456, 458-459 (CA9 1995), the District Court in each case declined to give effect to the attorney-client fee agreement.

hourly fee. This method yielded as $ 406(b) fees $3,135 fromGisbrecht's recovery, $5,461.50 from Miller's, and $6,550 from

Sandine's. Offsetting the EAJA awards, the court deter-mined that no portion of Gisbrecht's or Sandine's past-due
benefits was payable to counsel, and that only $296.75 of Mill-er's recovery was payable to her counsel as a $ 406(b) fee.
The three claimants appealed.6Adhering to Circuit precedent applying the lodestar

the District Court's fee dispositions. Gisbrecht v. Apfel, 238F. 3d 1196 (2000). The Appeals Court noted that fees determined under the lodestar method could be adjusted by apply-ing 12 further factors, one of them, "whether the fee is fixed
or contingent." Id., at 1198 (quoting Kerr v. Screen Extras
Guild, Inc., 526 F. 2d 67, 70 (CA9 1975)).8 While "a district

we nonetheless refer to claimants as petitioners. See Hopkins v. Cohen,
390 U. S. 530, 531, n. 2 (1968). We also note that the Commissioner of
Social Security here, as in the Ninth Circuit, has no direct financial stake
in the answer to the $ 406(b) question; instead, she plays a part in the fee
determination resembling that of a trustee for the claimants. See, e. g.,
Lewis v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 707 F. 2d 246, 248
(CA6 1983).

7 A fourth case, Anderson v. Apfel, No. CV-96-6311-HO (Ore., Sept. 29,

Opinion of the Court
instructs "a reasonable fee," which could be measured by alodestar calculation. But $ 406(b)'s language does not exclude contingent-fee contracts that produce fees no higherthan the 25 percent ceiling. Such contracts are the most
common fee arrangement between attorneys and Social Se-curity claimants. See Department of Health and Human
Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings
and Appeals, Report to Congress: Attorney Fees UnderTitle II of the Social Security Act 15, 66, 70 (July 1988) (hereinafter SSA Report); Brief for National Organization of So-cial Security Claimants' Representatives as

Amicus Curiae
1-2. Looking outside the statute's inconclusive text, we
next take into account, as interpretive guides, the origin and
standard application of the proffered approaches.

The lodestar method has its roots in accounting practices
adopted in the 1940's to allow attorneys and firms to determine whether fees charged were sufficient to cover overhead
and generate suitable profits. W. Ross, The Honest Hour:
The Ethics of Time-Based Billing by Attorneys 16 (1996)
(hereinafter Honest Hour). An American Bar Association
(ABA) report, published in 1958, observed that attorneys'
earnings had failed to keep pace with the rate of inflation;
the report urged attorneys to record the hours spent on each
case in order to ensure that fees ultimately charged afforded
reasonable compensation for counsels' efforts. See Special
Committee on Economics of Law Practice, The 1958 Lawyer
and His 1938 Dollar 9-10 (reprint 1959).

Hourly records initially provided only an internal accounting check. See Honest Hour 19. The fees actually charged
might be determined under any number of methods: the
annual retainer; the fee-for-service method; the "eyeball"
method, under which the attorney estimated an annual fee
for regular clients; or the contingent-fee method, recognized
by this Court in Stanton v. Embrey, 93 U. S. 548, 556 (1877),
and formally approved by the ABA in 1908. See Honest
Hour 13-19. As it became standard accounting practice to

Opinion of the Court
record hours spent on a client's matter, attorneys increas-ingly realized that billing by hours devoted to a case was

administratively convenient; moreover, as an objective meas-ure of a lawyer's labor, hourly billing was readily impartable
to the client. Id., at 18. By the early 1970's, the practiceof hourly billing had become widespread. See

id., at 19, 21.
The federal courts did not swiftly settle on hourly rates as
the overriding criterion for attorney's fee awards. In 1974,for example, the Fifth Circuit issued an influential opinion

holding that, in setting fees under Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(k) (1970 ed.), courts
should consider not only the number of hours devoted to acase but also 11 other factors.

Johnson v. Georgia Highway
Express, Inc., 488 F. 2d 714, 717-719 (1974).10 The lodestarmethod did not gain a firm foothold until the mid-1970's, see

Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadelphia v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F. 2d 161 (CA3 1973),

in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983), Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886 (1984), and Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546 (1986).

Opinion of the Court
"[i]deally, . . . litigants will settle the amount of a fee." 461
U. S., at 437.11 But where settlement between the parties
is not possible, "[t]he most useful starting point for [court
determination of] the amount of a reasonable fee [payable by
the loser] is the number of hours reasonably expended on
the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate." Id.,
at 433. Thus, the lodestar method today holds sway in
federal-court adjudication of disputes over the amount of
fees properly shifted to the loser in the litigation. See id.,
at 440 (Burger, C. J., concurring) (decision addresses statute
under which "a lawyer seeks to have his adversary pay the
fees of the prevailing party").

Fees shifted to the losing party, however, are not at issue
here. Unlike 42 U. S. C. $ 1988 (1994 ed. and Supp. V) and
EAJA, 42 U. S. C. $ 406(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V) does not authorize the prevailing party to recover fees from the losing
party. Section 406(b) is of another genre: It authorizes fees
payable from the successful party's recovery. Several statutes governing suits against the United States similarly provide that fees may be paid from the plaintiff 's recovery.
See, e. g., Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. $ 2678
("No attorney shall charge, demand, receive, or collect for
services rendered, fees in excess of 25 per centum of any
[court] judgment rendered [in an FTCA suit], or in excess of
20 per centum of any award, compromise, or settlement made
[by a federal agency to settle an FTCA claim]."); Veterans'
Benefits Act, 38 U. S. C. $ 5904(d)(1) (1994 ed.) ("When
a claimant [for veterans' benefits] and an attorney have
entered into a [contingent-]fee agreement [under which fees
are paid by withholding from the claimant's benefits award],
the total fee payable to the attorney may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded

contingent-fee agreements drawn by counsel and signed bybenefits claimants. In formulating the 1965 Social Security
Act amendments that included $ 406(b), Congress recognizedthat "attorneys have upon occasion charged . . . inordinately
large fees for representing claimants [in court]." S. Rep.No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 122 (1965). Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees, the Senate Report observed,reserved for the lawyer one-third to one-half of the accrued

benefits and, correspondingly, of legal fees awardable fromthose benefits if the claimant prevailed. Ibid.

Congress authorized the agency "to certify the amount ofthe fee to the attorney out of the amount of the accrued

[appropriate] fees." SSA Report 66 (internal quotationmarks omitted). But nothing in the text or history of

$ 406(b) reveals a "desig[n] to prohibit or discourage attor-neys and claimants from entering into contingent fee agreements. " Ibid. Given the prevalence of contingent-feeagreements between attorneys and Social Security claimants, it is unlikely that Congress, simply by prescribing "rea-sonable fees," meant to outlaw, rather than to contain, such
agreements.14This conclusion is bolstered by Congress' 1990 authorization of contingent-fee agreements under $ 406(a), the provi-sion governing fees for agency-level representation. Before
enacting this express authorization, Congress instructed theSocial Security Administration to prepare a report on attor14 Cf., e. g., Act of Mar. 3, 1891, $ 9, 26 Stat. 851-854 (regulating fees for

See SSA Report 10-11. This review led the agency to in-form Congress that, although the contingency method was
hardly flawless, the agency could "identify no more effective
means of ensuring claimant access to attorney representa-tion."

Id., at 25.
Congress subsequently altered $ 406(a) to validatecontingent-fee agreements filed with the agency prior to disposition of the claim for benefits. See 42 U. S. C. $ 406(a)(2)(1994 ed.);

supra, at 795. As petitioners observe, Brief for
Petitioners 24, it would be anomalous if contract-based feesexpressly authorized by $ 406(a)(2) at the administrative

level were disallowed for court representation under $ 406(b).It is also unlikely that Congress, legislating in 1965, and
providing for a contingent fee tied to a 25 percent of past-duebenefits boundary, intended to install a lodestar method
courts did not develop until some years later. See supra,
at 801-802. Furthermore, we again emphasize, the lodestarmethod was designed to govern imposition of fees on the

losing party. See, e. g., Dague, 505 U. S., at 562. In such
cases, nothing prevents the attorney for the prevailing party
from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from his
own client. See Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 89-90
(1990) ("[None] of our cases has indicated that [42 U. S. C.]

benefits claimants in court. Rather, $ 406(b) calls for courtreview of such arrangements as an independent check, to assure that they yield reasonable results in particular cases.15Congress has provided one boundary line: Agreements are
unenforceable to the extent that they provide for fees ex-ceeding 25 percent of the past-due benefits. $ 406(b)(1)(A)

Opinion of the Court
Courts that approach fee determinations by looking firstto the contingent-fee agreement, then testing it for reasonableness, have appropriately reduced the attorney's recoverybased on the character of the representation and the results
the representative achieved. See, e. g., McGuire, 873 F. 2d,at 983 ("Although the contingency agreement should be
given significant weight in fixing a fee, a district judge mustindependently assess the reasonableness of its terms.");
Lewis v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 707 F. 2d246, 249-250 (CA6 1983) (instructing reduced fee when representation is substandard). If the attorney is responsiblefor delay, for example, a reduction is in order so that the
attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefitsduring the pendency of the case in court. See

Rodriquez,865 F. 2d, at 746-747. If the benefits are large in comparison

to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downwardadjustment is similarly in order. See id., at 747 (reviewing
court should disallow "windfalls for lawyers"); Wells, 907F. 2d, at 372 (same). In this regard, the court may require
the claimant's attorney to submit, not as a basis for satel-lite litigation, but as an aid to the court's assessment of the
reasonableness of the fee yielded by the fee agreement, arecord of the hours spent representing the claimant and a
statement of the lawyer's normal hourly billing charge fornoncontingent-fee cases. See

Rodriquez, 865 F. 2d, at 741.Judges of our district courts are accustomed to making reasonableness determinations in a wide variety of contexts,and their assessments in such matters, in the event of an
appeal, ordinarily qualify for highly respectful review.

agreements. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
I do not know what the judges of our district courts andcourts of appeals are to make of today's opinion. I have

no idea what the trial judge is to do if he finds the fee pro-duced by the ("presumptively reasonable,"

ante, at 792)contingent-fee agreement to be 25% above the lodestar

amount; or 40%; or 65%. Or what the appellate court is todo in an appeal from a district judge's reduction of the contingent fee to 300% of the lodestar amount; or 200%; or tothe lodestar amount itself. While today's opinion gets this
case out of our "in" box, it does nothing whatever to subjectthese fees to anything approximating a uniform rule of law.
That is, I think, the inevitable consequence of trying to com-bine the incompatible. The Court tells the judge to commence his analysis with the contingent-fee agreement, butthen to adjust the figure that agreement produces on the
basis of factors (most notably, the actual time spent multi-plied by a reasonable hourly rate,

ante, at 808) that are, in asense, the precise antithesis of the contingent-fee agreement,

since it was the very purpose of that agreement to eliminatethem from the fee calculation. In my view, the only possible
way to give uniform meaning to the statute's "reasonablefee" provision is to understand it as referring to the fair
value of the work actually performed, which we have held isbest reflected by the lodestar.

1 See Hensley v. Eckerhart,

461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983).

1 The Court finds it "unlikely," ante, at 806, that 42 U. S. C. $ 406(b) (1994
ed.), enacted in 1965, contemplated application of the lodestar method that
the courts had not yet even developed. Of course it did not. But it did

Scalia, J., dissenting
I think it obvious that the reasonableness of a contingentfee arrangement has to be determined by viewing the matter
ex ante, before the outcome of the lawsuit and the hours of
work expended on the outcome are definitively known. For
it is in the nature of a contingent-fee agreement to gamble
on outcome and hours of work--assigning the risk of an unsuccessful outcome to the attorney, in exchange for a percentage of the recovery from a successful outcome that will
(because of the risk of loss the attorney has borne) be higher,
and perhaps much higher, than what the attorney would receive in hourly billing for the same case. That is why, in
days when obtaining justice in the law courts was thought
to be less of a sporting enterprise, contingent fees were unlawful. See, e. g., Butler v. Legro, 62 N. H. 350, 352 (1882)
("Agreements of this kind are contrary to public justice and
professional duty, tend to extortion and fraud, and are champertous and void").

It is one thing to say that a contingent-fee arrangement is,
ex ante, unreasonable because it gives the attorney a percentage of the recovery so high that no self-respecting legal
system can tolerate it; the statute itself has made this determination for Social-Security-benefit cases, prescribing a
maximum contingent fee of 25%. And one can also say that
a contingent-fee arrangement is, ex ante, unreasonable because the chances of success in the particular case are so
high, and the anticipated legal work so negligible, that the
percentage of the recovery assured to the lawyer is exorbitant; but neither I nor the Court thinks that the "reasonable

contemplate an ex post determination of a reasonable fee for an attorney's
work--which our post-1965 cases have held is best achieved by using the
lodestar. We have not hesitated to apply the lodestar method to other
fee statutes enacted before the method was developed. See, e. g., Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 561-562 (1992) (explaining that "our case
law construing what is a `reasonable' fee applies uniformly" to fee-shifting
statutes that use similar language, including, inter alia, 42 U. S. C. $ 1988
and 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(k) (Civil Rights Act of 1964)).

fee" provision of the statute anticipates such a case-by-case
ex post assessment of ex ante predictions in the thousands of
(mostly small recovery) Social-Security-benefit cases. It issomething quite different, however--and something quite

irrational--to look at the consequences of a contingent-feeagreement

after the contingencies have been resolved, and
proclaim those consequences unreasonable because the attorney has received too much money for too little work. Thatis rather like declaring the purchase of the winning lottery

ticket void because of the gross disparity between the $2ticket price and the million-dollar payout.

2

I think, in other words, that the "reasonable fee" provisionmust require

either an assessment of the reasonableness of
the contingent-fee agreement when it was concluded, or anassessment of the reasonableness of the fee charged after

the outcome and work committed to it are known; it cannotcombine the two. And since an

ex post assessment of the
ex ante reasonableness of the contingent-fee agreement
(already limited by statute to a maximum 25% of the recovery) is not what the statute could conceivably have contemplated, I conclude that a "reasonable fee" means not the
reasonableness of the agreed-upon contingent fee, but a reasonable recompense for the work actually done. We have
held that this is best calculated by applying the lodestar,

2 There is one ex post element prominent in Social-Security-benefit cases
that assuredly should reduce the amount of an otherwise reasonable (that
is to say, an ex ante reasonable) contingent-fee award: Since the award
is based upon past-due benefits, and since the amount of those benefits
increases with the duration of the litigation, a lawyer can increase
his contingent-fee award by dragging his feet. It is unreasonable to be
rewarded for dilatoriness. But that element need not be made part of
an overall ex post reasonableness assessment, as the Court would do,
see ante, at 808. For it is not only unreasonable; it is a breach of contract.
Surely the representation agreement contains as an implicit term that the
lawyer will bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as practicable--or
at least will not intentionally delay its conclusion. Any breach of that
condition justifies a reduction of the contracted contingent-fee award.

which focuses on the quality and amount of the legal workperformed, and "provides an objective basis on which to . . .

estimate . . . the value of a lawyer's services." Hensley, 461U. S., at 433.

This is less of a departure than the Court suggests fromthe normal practice of enforcing privately negotiated fee
agreements. The fee agreements in these Social-Securitycases are hardly negotiated; they are akin to adherence contracts. It is uncontested that the specialized Social-Securitybar charges uniform contingent fees (the statutory maximum
of 25%), which are presumably presented to the typically un-sophisticated client on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Nor does
the statute's explicit approval of contingency-fee agreementsat the agency stage, see 42 U. S. C. $ 406(a) (1994 ed. and
Supp. V), imply that contingency-fee agreements at thejudicial-review stage should be regarded as presumptively
reasonable. The agreements approved at the agency stageare limited not merely by a 25% maximum percentage of
recovery, but also by a firm $5,300 maximum. With the lat-ter limitation, there is no need to impose a reasonableness
requirement. Once a reasonableness requirement is im-posed, however, I think it can only refer to the reasonableness of the actual compensation.

* * *
Because I think there is no middle course between, on theone hand, determining the reasonableness of a contingent-fee

agreement and, on the other hand, determining the reason-ableness of the actual fee; because I think the statute's reference to a "reasonable fee" must connote the latter; andbecause I think the Court's hybrid approach establishes
no clear criteria and hence will generate needless satellitelitigation; I respectfully dissent.

Syllabus

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.ZANDFORD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 01-147. Argued March 18, 2002--Decided June 3, 2002
Respondent broker persuaded William Wood, an elderly man, to open a

joint investment account for himself and his mentally retarded daughter.
The Woods gave respondent discretion to manage the account and a
general power of attorney to engage in securities transactions without
their prior approval. When Mr. Wood died a few years later, all of
the money he had entrusted to respondent was gone. Respondent was
subsequently indicted on federal wire fraud charges for, inter alia, selling securities in the Woods' account and making personal use of the
proceeds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) then filed
a civil complaint in the same District Court, alleging that respondent
had violated $ 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act) and the
SEC's Rule 10b-5 by engaging in a scheme to defraud the Woods and
misappropriating their securities without their knowledge or consent.
After respondent's conviction in the criminal case, the District Court
granted the SEC summary judgment in the civil case. The Fourth Circuit reversed and directed the District Court to dismiss the complaint,
holding that neither the criminal conviction nor the allegations in the
complaint established that respondent's fraud was "in connection with
the purchase or sale of any security." Because the scheme was to steal
the Woods' assets, not to manipulate a particular security, and it had no
relationship to market integrity or investor understanding, the court
held that there was no $ 10(b) violation.

Held: Assuming that the complaint's allegations are true, respondent's

conduct was "in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."
Among Congress' objectives in passing the Act was to ensure honest
securities markets and thereby promote investor confidence after the
1929 market crash. Congress sought " `to substitute a philosophy of
full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor and thus to achieve
a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry.' " Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U. S. 128, 151. To effectuate its remedial purposes, the Act should be construed flexibly, not
technically and restrictively. The SEC has consistently adopted a
broad reading of "in connection with the purchase or sale of any secu535US3 Unit: $U55 [11-30-02 19:23:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

rity," maintaining that a broker who accepts payment for securities that
he never intends to deliver, or who sells securities with intent to misappropriate the proceeds, violates $ 10(b) and Rule 10(b)-5. This interpretation of the statute's ambiguous text in the context of formal adjudication is entitled to deference. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533
U. S. 218, 229-230. Neither the SEC nor this Court has ever held that
there must be a misrepresentation about a particular security's value in
order to run afoul of the Act. This Court disagrees with respondent's
claim that his misappropriation of the proceeds, though fraudulent, does
not have the requisite connection with the sales, which were perfectly
lawful. The securities sales and respondent's practices were not independent events. Taking the complaint's allegations as true, each sale
was made to further his fraudulent scheme; and each was deceptive
because it was neither authorized by, nor disclosed to, the Woods. In
the aggregate, the sales are properly viewed as a course of business
that operated as a fraud or deceit on a stockbroker's customer. As in
Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404
U. S. 6; Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. v. United Int'l Holdings, Inc., 532 U. S.
588; and United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, all cases in which
this Court found a $ 10(b) violation, the SEC complaint here describes a
fraudulent scheme in which the securities transactions and breaches of
fiduciary duty coincide. Those breaches were therefore "in connection
with" securities sales within $ 10(b)'s meaning. Pp. 819-825.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed acivil complaint alleging that a stockbroker violated both

$ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891,as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b), and the SEC's Rule 10b-5,
by selling his customer's securities and using the proceedsfor his own benefit without the customer's knowledge or consent. The question presented is whether the alleged fraud-ulent conduct was "in connection with the purchase or sale
of any security" within the meaning of the statute and theRule.

I
Between 1987 and 1991, respondent was employed as asecurities broker in the Maryland branch of a New York

brokerage firm. In 1987, he persuaded William Wood, anelderly man in poor health, to open a joint investment

account for himself and his mentally retarded daughter. Ac-cording to the SEC's complaint, the "stated investment
objectives for the account were `safety of principal andincome.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. The Woods granted
respondent discretion to manage their account and a generalpower of attorney to engage in securities transactions for
their benefit without prior approval. Relying on respond-ent's promise to "conservatively invest" their money, the
Woods entrusted him with $419,255. Before Mr. Wood'sdeath in 1991, all of that money was gone.

In 1991, the National Association of Securities Dealers(NASD) conducted a routine examination of respondent's
firm and discovered that on over 25 separate occasions,money had been transferred from the Woods' account to accounts controlled by respondent. In due course, respondentwas indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on 13 counts of wire fraud in violation of18 U. S. C. $ 1343. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a. The first
count alleged that respondent sold securities in the Woods'account and then made personal use of the proceeds.

Id., at

816 SEC v. ZANDFORD

Opinion of the Court
42a. Each of the other counts alleged that he made wire
transfers between Maryland and New York that enabled him
to withdraw specified sums from the Woods' accounts. Id.,
at 42a-50a. Some of those transfers involved respondent
writing checks to himself from a mutual fund account held
by the Woods, which required liquidating securities in order
to redeem the checks. Respondent was convicted on all
counts, sentenced to prison for 52 months, and ordered to
pay $10,800 in restitution.

After respondent was indicted, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the same District Court alleging that respondent
violated $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by engaging in a scheme to
defraud the Woods and by misappropriating approximately
$343,000 of the Woods' securities without their knowledge or
consent. Id., at 27a. The SEC moved for partial summary
judgment after respondent's criminal conviction, arguing
that the judgment in the criminal case estopped respondent
from contesting facts that established a violation of $ 10(b).1
Respondent filed a motion seeking discovery on the question
whether his fraud had the requisite "connection with" the
purchase or sale of a security. The District Court refused
to allow discovery and entered summary judgment against
respondent. It enjoined him from engaging in future violations of the securities laws and ordered him to disgorge
$343,000 in ill-gotten gains.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the
summary judgment and remanded with directions for the
District Court to dismiss the complaint. 238 F. 3d 559

1 The scope of Rule 10b-5 is coextensive with the coverage of $ 10(b),
see United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651 (1997); Ernst & Ernst
v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 214 (1976); therefore, we use $ 10(b) to refer
to both the statutory provision and the Rule.

The complaint also contained allegations that respondent had engaged
in excessive trading, or "churning," to generate commission income. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 30a. That claim was originally excluded from the summary judgment motion, and later abandoned by the SEC.

Opinion of the Court
(2001). It first held that the wire fraud conviction, whichonly required two findings--(1) that respondent engaged in

a scheme to defraud and (2) that he used interstate wirecommunications in executing the scheme--did not establish
all the elements of a $ 10(b) violation. Specifically, the con-viction did not necessarily establish that his fraud was
"in connection with" the sale of a security. Id., at 562.2
The court then held that the civil complaint did not suffi-ciently allege the necessary connection because the sales of

the Woods' securities were merely incidental to a fraud that"lay in absconding with the proceeds" of sales that were conducted in "a routine and customary fashion," id., at 564. Re-spondent's "scheme was simply to steal the Woods' assets"
rather than to engage "in manipulation of a particular secu2 A summary of the evidence in the Court of Appeals' opinion affirming
the judgment in respondent's criminal case supports the conclusion that
the verdict did not necessarily determine that the fraud was connected
with the sale of a security:

"The Government presented ample direct and circumstantial evidence
showing that Zandford had engaged in a scheme to defraud the Woods.
It showed that: (1) Zandford had systematically transferred large sums of
money from the Woods' account to his own accounts over a nineteen month
period; (2) prior to November 1987, the Woods had no relationship with
Zandford; (3) Zandford, and not the Woods, benefited from the money
transfers; (4) the Woods were vulnerable victims due to their physical and
mental limitations; (5) the personal services agreement, the loan, and the
vintage car restoration business were not only contrary to the Woods'
stated investment objectives, but they violated the rules of NASD and
those of Zandford's employer that prohibited brokers from engaging in
such arrangements; and (6) vehicles owned as part of the vintage car restoration business were titled in the name of Zandford's girlfriend as opposed
to the Woods' names. Additional evidence showing a scheme to defraud
included Zandford's failure to disclose to his employer the existence of the
agreements and personal loans; his failure to report on his taxes or bank
loan applications that he received income from acting as the personal representative; and his failure to disclose on his taxes his involvement in
a vintage car restoration business. Zandford's contention that there is
insufficient evidence supporting that he had engaged in a scheme to defraud the Woods is meritless." Id., at 36a-37a.

Opinion of the Court
rity." Id., at 565. Ultimately, the court refused "to stretch
the language of the securities fraud provisions to encompass
every conversion or theft that happens to involve securities."
Id., at 566. Adopting what amounts to a "fraud on the market" theory of the statute's coverage, the court held that
without some "relationship to market integrity or investor
understanding," there is no violation of $ 10(b). Id., at 563.

We granted the SEC's petition for a writ of certiorari, 534
U. S. 1015 (2001), to review the Court of Appeals' construction of the phrase "in connection with the purchase or sale
of any security." Because the Court of Appeals ordered the
complaint dismissed rather than remanding for reconsideration, we assume the allegations contained therein are true
and affirm that disposition only if no set of facts would entitle petitioner to relief. See Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U. S. 764, 811 (1993). We do not reach the question whether the record supports the District Court's grant
of summary judgment in the SEC's favor--a question that
requires all potential factual disputes to be resolved in respondent's favor.3 We merely hold that the allegations of
the complaint, if true, entitle the SEC to relief; therefore,
the Court of Appeals should not have directed that the complaint be dismissed.

3 Nor do we review the District Court's decision denying respondent
discovery--a decision that may have been influenced by respondent's frequent filings while incarcerated. The District Court noted that respondent "has been an active litigant before and during his incarceration." Id.,
at 16a, n. 1 (citing Zandford v. NASD, 30 F. Supp. 2d 1 (DC 1998); Zandford v. NASD, 19 F. Supp. 2d 1 (DC 1998); Zandford v. NASD, 19

Opinion of the Court

II
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act makes it "un-lawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ, in connection

with the purchase or sale of any security . . . , any manipu-lative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention
of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe."15 U. S. C. $ 78j. Rule 10b-5, which implements this provision, forbids the use, "in connection with the purchase or saleof any security," of "any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud" or any other "act, practice, or course of business" that"operates . . . as a fraud or deceit." 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5
(2000). Among Congress' objectives in passing the Act was"to insure honest securities markets and thereby promote
investor confidence" after the market crash of 1929. UnitedStates v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 658 (1997); see also United
States v. Naftalin, 441 U. S. 768, 775 (1979). More generally,Congress sought " `to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor and thus to achievea high standard of business ethics in the securities industry.' " Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406U. S. 128, 151 (1972) (quoting SEC v. Capital Gains Research
Bureau, Inc., 375 U. S. 180, 186 (1963)).Consequently, we have explained that the statute should
be "construed `not technically and restrictively, but flexiblyto effectuate its remedial purposes.' " 406 U. S., at 151
(quoting Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U. S., at195). In its role enforcing the Act, the SEC has consistently
adopted a broad reading of the phrase "in connection withthe purchase or sale of any security." It has maintained
that a broker who accepts payment for securities that henever intends to deliver, or who sells customer securities
with intent to misappropriate the proceeds, violates $ 10(b)and Rule 10b-5. See,

e. g., In re Bauer, 26 S. E. C. 770(1947); In re Southeastern Securities Corp., 29 S. E. C. 609

(1949). This interpretation of the ambiguous text of $ 10(b),in the context of formal adjudication, is entitled to deference

820 SEC v. ZANDFORD

Opinion of the Court
if it is reasonable, see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S.218, 229-230, and n. 12 (2001). For the reasons set forth

below, we think it is. While the statute must not be con-strued so broadly as to convert every common-law fraud that
happens to involve securities into a violation of $ 10(b), Marine Bank v. Weaver, 455 U. S. 551, 556 (1982) ("Congress, in
enacting the securities laws, did not intend to provide a
broad federal remedy for all fraud"), neither the SEC northis Court has ever held that there must be a misrepresentation about the value of a particular security in order to runafoul of the Act.

The SEC claims respondent engaged in a fraudulent
scheme in which he made sales of his customer's securities
for his own benefit. Respondent submits that the sales
themselves were perfectly lawful and that the subsequent
misappropriation of the proceeds, though fraudulent, is not
properly viewed as having the requisite connection with the
sales; in his view, the alleged scheme is not materially different from a simple theft of cash or securities in an investment
account. We disagree.

According to the complaint, respondent "engaged in a
scheme to defraud" the Woods beginning in 1988, shortly
after they opened their account, and that scheme continued
throughout the 2-year period during which respondent made
a series of transactions that enabled him to convert the
proceeds of the sales of the Woods' securities to his own
use. App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a-29a. The securities sales
and respondent's fraudulent practices were not independent
events. This is not a case in which, after a lawful transaction had been consummated, a broker decided to steal
the proceeds and did so. Nor is it a case in which a thief
simply invested the proceeds of a routine conversion in the
stock market. Rather, respondent's fraud coincided with
the sales themselves.

Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, each sale
was made to further respondent's fraudulent scheme; each

535US3 Unit: $U55 [11-30-02 19:23:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

821Cite as: 535 U. S. 813 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
was deceptive because it was neither authorized by, nor dis-closed to, the Woods. With regard to the sales of shares in

the Woods' mutual fund, respondent initiated these transac-tions by writing a check to himself from that account, knowing that redeeming the check would require the sale of secu-rities. Indeed, each time respondent "exercised his power
of disposition for his own benefit," that conduct, "without
more," was a fraud. United States v. Dunn, 268 U. S. 121,131 (1925). In the aggregate, the sales are properly viewed

as a "course of business" that operated as a fraud or deceiton a stockbroker's customer.

Insofar as the connection between respondent's deceptive
practices and his sale of the Woods' securities is concerned,
the case is remarkably similar to Superintendent of Ins.
of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U. S. 6 (1971).
In that case the directors of Manhattan Casualty Company
authorized the sale of the company's portfolio of treasury
bonds because they had been "duped" into believing that the
company would receive the proceeds of the sale. Id., at 9.
We held that "Manhattan was injured as an investor through
a deceptive device which deprived it of any compensation for
the sale of its valuable block of securities." Id., at 10. In
reaching this conclusion, we did not ask, as the Fourth Circuit did in this case, whether the directors were misled about
the value of a security or whether the fraud involved "manipulation of a particular security." 238 F. 3d, at 565. In fact,
we rejected the Second Circuit's position in Superintendent
of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 430 F. 2d
355, 361 (1970), that because the fraud against Manhattan did
not take place within the context of a securities exchange it
was not prohibited by $ 10(b). 404 U. S., at 10. We refused
to read the statute so narrowly, noting that it "must be read
flexibly, not technically and restrictively." Id., at 12. Although we recognized that the interest in " `preserving the
integrity of the securities markets' " was one of the purposes
animating the statute, we rejected the notion that $ 10(b) is

535US3 Unit: $U55 [11-30-02 19:23:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
822 SEC v. ZANDFORD

Opinion of the Court
limited to serving that objective alone. Ibid. ("We agreethat Congress by $ 10(b) did not seek to regulate transactions

which constitute no more than internal corporate misman-agement. But we read $ 10(b) to mean that Congress meant
to bar deceptive devices and contrivances in the purchase orsale of securities whether conducted in the organized markets or face to face").

Like the company directors in Bankers Life, the Woodswere injured as investors through respondent's deceptions,

which deprived them of any compensation for the sale oftheir valuable securities. They were duped into believing
respondent would "conservatively invest" their assets in the
stock market and that any transactions made on their behalf
would be for their benefit for the " `safety of principal and
income.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. The fact that respondent misappropriated the proceeds of the sales provides
persuasive evidence that he had violated $ 10(b) when he
made the sales, but misappropriation is not an essential
element of the offense. Indeed, in Bankers Life, we flatly
stated that it was "irrelevant" that "the proceeds of the sale
that were due the seller were misappropriated." 404 U. S.,
at 10. It is enough that the scheme to defraud and the sale
of securities coincide.

The Court of Appeals below distinguished Bankers Life on
the ground that it involved an affirmative misrepresentation,
whereas respondent simply failed to inform the Woods of his
intent to misappropriate their securities. 238 F. 3d, at 566.
We are not persuaded by this distinction. Respondent was
only able to carry out his fraudulent scheme without making
an affirmative misrepresentation because the Woods had
trusted him to make transactions in their best interest without prior approval. Under these circumstances, respondent's fraud represents an even greater threat to investor
confidence in the securities industry than the misrepresentation in Bankers Life. Not only does such a fraud prevent
investors from trusting that their brokers are executing

535US3 Unit: $U55 [11-30-02 19:23:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
transactions for their benefit, but it undermines the value ofa discretionary account like that held by the Woods. The

benefit of a discretionary account is that it enables individu-als, like the Woods, who lack the time, capacity, or know-how
to supervise investment decisions, to delegate authority to abroker who will make decisions in their best interests without prior approval. If such individuals cannot rely on a
broker to exercise that discretion for their benefit, then theaccount loses its added value. Moreover, any distinction between omissions and misrepresentations is illusory in thecontext of a broker who has a fiduciary duty to her clients.
See Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222, 230 (1980) (noting that "silence in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities may operate as a fraud actionable under $ 10(b)"
when there is "a duty to disclose arising from a relationship
of trust and confidence between parties to a transaction");
Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U. S.,
at 153.

More recently, in Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. v. United Int'l
Holdings, Inc., 532 U. S. 588 (2001), our decision that the
seller of a security had violated $ 10(b) focused on the secret
intent of the seller when the sale occurred. The purchaser
claimed "that Wharf sold it a security (the option) while secretly intending from the very beginning not to honor the
option." Id., at 597. Although Wharf did not specifically
argue that the breach of contract underlying the complaint
lacked the requisite connection with a sale of securities, it
did assert that the case was merely a dispute over ownership
of the option, and that interpreting $ 10(b) to include such a
claim would convert every breach of contract that happened
to involve a security into a violation of the federal securities
laws. Id., at 596. We rejected that argument because the
purchaser's claim was not that the defendant failed to carry
out a promise to sell securities; rather, the claim was that
the defendant sold a security while never intending to honor
its agreement in the first place. Id., at 596-597. Similarly,

535US3 Unit: $U55 [11-30-02 19:23:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
824 SEC v. ZANDFORD

Opinion of the Court
in this case the SEC claims respondent sold the Woods' secu-rities while secretly intending from the very beginning to

keep the proceeds. In Wharf, the fraudulent intent de-prived the purchaser of the benefit of the sale whereas here
the fraudulent intent deprived the seller of that benefit, butthe connection between the deception and the sale in each
case is identical.

In United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642 (1997), we heldthat the defendant had committed fraud "in connection with"

a securities transaction when he used misappropriated con-fidential information for trading purposes. We reasoned
that "the fiduciary's fraud is consummated, not when the
fiduciary gains the confidential information, but when, without disclosure to his principal, he uses the information to
purchase or sell securities. The securities transaction and
the breach of duty thus coincide. This is so even though
the person or entity defrauded is not the other party to the
trade, but is, instead, the source of the nonpublic information." Id., at 656. The Court of Appeals distinguished
O'Hagan by reading it to require that the misappropriated
information or assets not have independent value to the client outside the securities market, 238 F. 3d, at 565. We do
not read O'Hagan as so limited. In the chief passage cited
by the Court of Appeals for this proposition, we discussed
the Government's position that "[t]he misappropriation theory would not . . . apply to a case in which a person defrauded
a bank into giving him a loan or embezzled cash from another, and then used the proceeds of the misdeed to purchase
securities," because in that situation "the proceeds would
have value to the malefactor apart from their use in a securities transaction, and the fraud would be complete as soon as
the money was obtained." 521 U. S., at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if this passage could be read to
introduce a new requirement into $ 10(b), it would not affect
our analysis of this case, because the Woods' securities did
not have value for respondent apart from their use in a secu535US3 Unit: $U55 [11-30-02 19:23:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

825Cite as: 535 U. S. 813 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
rities transaction and the fraud was not complete before thesale of securities occurred.

As in Bankers Life, Wharf, and O'Hagan, the SEC com-plaint describes a fraudulent scheme in which the securities
transactions and breaches of fiduciary duty coincide. Thosebreaches were therefore "in connection with" securities sales
within the meaning of $ 10(b).4 Accordingly, the judgmentof the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

4 Contrary to the Court of Appeals' prediction, 238 F. 3d 559, 566 (CA4
2001), our analysis does not transform every breach of fiduciary duty into
a federal securities violation. If, for example, a broker embezzles cash
from a client's account or takes advantage of the fiduciary relationship to
induce his client into a fraudulent real estate transaction, then the fraud
would not include the requisite connection to a purchase or sale of securities. Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. Likewise, if the broker told his client he was
stealing the client's assets, that breach of fiduciary duty might be in connection with a sale of securities, but it would not involve a deceptive
device or fraud. Cf. Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U. S. 462,
474-476 (1977).

HOLMES GROUP, INC. v. VORNADO AIRCIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 01-408. Argued March 19, 2002--Decided June 3, 2002
Petitioner filed a federal-court action, seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that its products did not infringe respondent's trade
dress and an injunction restraining respondent from accusing it of such
infringement. Respondent's answer asserted a compulsory patentinfringement counterclaim. The District Court ruled in petitioner's
favor. Respondent appealed to the Federal Circuit, which, notwithstanding petitioner's challenge to its jurisdiction, vacated the District
Court's judgment and remanded the case.

Held: The Federal Circuit cannot assert jurisdiction over a case in which

the complaint does not allege a patent-law claim, but the answer contains a patent-law counterclaim. Pp. 829-834.

(a) The Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is fixed with reference to that
of the district court, 28 U. S. C. $ 1295(a)(1), and turns on whether the
action is one "arising under" federal patent law, $ 1338(a). Because

$ 1338(a) uses the same operative language as $ 1331, which confers
general federal-question jurisdiction, the well-pleaded-complaint rule
governing whether a case arises under $ 1331 also governs whether a
case arises under $ 1338(a). As adapted to $ 1338(a), the rule provides
that whether a case arises under patent law is determined by what
appears in the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint. Christianson v. Colt
Industries Operating Corp., 486 U. S. 800, 809. Because petitioner's
well-pleaded complaint asserted no claim arising under patent law,
the Federal Circuit erred in asserting jurisdiction over this appeal.
Pp. 829-830.

(b) The well-pleaded-complaint rule does not allow a counterclaim
to serve as the basis for a district court's "arising under" jurisdiction.
To rule otherwise would contravene the face-of-the-complaint principle
set forth in this Court's prior cases, see, e. g., Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386, 392, and the longstanding policies furthered by that
principle: It would leave acceptance or rejection of a state forum to the
master of the counterclaim rather than to the plaintiff; it would radically
expand the class of removable cases; and it would undermine the clarity and ease of administration of the well-pleaded-complaint doctrine.
Pp. 830-832.

$$ 1295(a)(1) and 1338(a) to confer appellate jurisdiction on the Federal
Circuit whenever a patent-law counterclaim is raised is necessary to
effectuate Congress's goal of promoting patent-law uniformity: This
Court's task is not to determine what would further Congress's goal,
but to determine what the statute's words must fairly be understood to
mean. It would be impossible to say that $ 1338(a)'s "arising under"
language means the well-pleaded-complaint rule when read on its own,

828 HOLMES GROUP, INC. v. VORNADO AIR

CIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.

Opinion of the Court

respondent sued a competitor, Duracraft Corp., claiming that
Duracraft's use of a "spiral grill design" in its fans infringed
respondent's trade dress. The Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit found for Duracraft, holding that Vornado had
no protectable trade-dress rights in the grill design. See
Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. v. Duracraft Corp.,
58 F. 3d 1498 (1995) (Vornado I).

Nevertheless, on November 26, 1999, respondent lodged a
complaint with the United States International Trade Commission against petitioner, The Holmes Group, Inc., claiming
that petitioner's sale of fans and heaters with a spiral grill
design infringed respondent's patent and the same trade
dress held unprotectable in Vornado I. Several weeks later,
petitioner filed this action against respondent in the United
States District Court for the District of Kansas, seeking,
inter alia, a declaratory judgment that its products did not
infringe respondent's trade dress and an injunction restraining respondent from accusing it of trade-dress infringement
in promotional materials. Respondent's answer asserted a
compulsory counterclaim alleging patent infringement.

The District Court granted petitioner the declaratory
judgment and injunction it sought. 93 F. Supp. 2d 1140
(Kan. 2000). The court explained that the collateralestoppel effect of Vornado I precluded respondent from relitigating its claim of trade-dress rights in the spiral grill
design. It rejected respondent's contention that an intervening Federal Circuit case, Midwest Industries, Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F. 3d 1356 (1999), which disagreed
with the Tenth Circuit's reasoning in Vornado I, constituted
a change in the law of trade dress that warranted relitigation
of respondent's trade-dress claim. The court also stayed all
proceedings related to respondent's counterclaim, adding
that the counterclaim would be dismissed if the declaratory
judgment and injunction entered in favor of petitioner were
affirmed on appeal.

Opinion of the Court
Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fed-eral Circuit. Notwithstanding petitioner's challenge to its

jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit vacated the District Court'sjudgment, 13 Fed. Appx. 961 (2001), and remanded for consideration of whether the "change in the law" exception tocollateral estoppel applied in light of TrafFix Devices, Inc.
v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U. S. 23 (2001), a case de-cided after the District Court's judgment which resolved a
Circuit split involving Vornado I and Midwest Industries.We granted certiorari to consider whether the Federal Circuit properly asserted jurisdiction over the appeal. 534U. S. 1016 (2001).

II
Congress vested the Federal Circuit with exclusive juris-diction over "an appeal from a final decision of a district

court of the United States . . . if the jurisdiction of that courtwas based, in whole or in part, on [28 U. S. C. $ ] 1338 . . . ."
28 U. S. C. $ 1295(a)(1) (emphasis added). Section 1338(a), inturn, provides in relevant part that "[t]he district courts
shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arisingunder any Act of Congress relating to patents . . . ." Thus,
the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is fixed with reference tothat of the district court, and turns on whether the action
arises under federal patent law.1Section 1338(a) uses the same operative language as
28 U. S. C. $ 1331, the statute conferring general federal-question jurisdiction, which gives the district courts "original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Consti-tution, laws, or treaties of the United States." (Emphasis
added.) We said in Christianson v. Colt Industries Operat1 Like Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 U. S. 800,
814-815 (1988), this case does not call upon us to decide whether the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is fixed with reference to the complaint as initially filed or whether an actual or constructive amendment to the complaint raising a patent-law claim can provide the foundation for the
Federal Circuit's jurisdiction.

ing Corp., 486 U. S. 800, 808 (1988), that "[l]inguistic consist-ency" requires us to apply the same test to determine

whether a case arises under $ 1338(a) as under $ 1331.The well-pleaded-complaint rule has long governed
whether a case "arises under" federal law for purposes of$ 1331.

2 See, e. g., Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Texaco Inc., 415

U. S. 125, 127-128 (1974) (per curiam). As "appropriatelyadapted to $ 1338(a)," the well-pleaded-complaint rule provides that whether a case "arises under" patent law "must bedetermined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff 's
statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration . . . ."
Christianson, 486 U. S., at 809 (internal quotation marksomitted). The plaintiff 's well-pleaded complaint must "establis[h] either that federal patent law creates the causeof action or that the plaintiff 's right to relief necessarily
depends on resolution of a substantial question of federalpatent law . . . ." Ibid. Here, it is undisputed that petitioner's well-pleaded complaint did not assert any claim arisingunder federal patent law. The Federal Circuit therefore
erred in asserting jurisdiction over this appeal.

A
Respondent argues that the well-pleaded-complaint rule,properly understood, allows a counterclaim to serve as the

basis for a district court's "arising under" jurisdiction. Wedisagree.

2 The well-pleaded-complaint rule also governs whether a case is removable from state to federal court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a), which
provides in relevant part:

"Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil
action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United
States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the
defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and
division embracing the place where such action is pending."

Opinion of the Court
Admittedly, our prior cases have only required us to address whether a federal defense, rather than a federal counterclaim, can establish "arising under" jurisdiction. Nevertheless, those cases were decided on the principle that
federal jurisdiction generally exists "only when a federal
question is presented on the face of the plaintiff 's properly
pleaded complaint." Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S.
386, 392 (1987) (emphasis added). As we said in The Fair v.
Kohler Die & Specialty Co., 228 U. S. 22, 25 (1913), whether
a case arises under federal patent law "cannot depend upon
the answer." Moreover, we have declined to adopt proposals that "the answer as well as the complaint . . . be consulted
before a determination [is] made whether the case `ar[ises]
under' federal law . . . ." Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463
U. S. 1, 10-11, n. 9 (1983) (citing American Law Institute,
Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts $ 1312, pp. 188-194 (1969)). It follows that

a counterclaim--which appears as part of the defendant's answer, not as part of the plaintiff 's complaint--cannot serve
as the basis for "arising under" jurisdiction. See, e. g.,
In re Adams, 809 F. 2d 1187, 1188, n. 1 (CA5 1987); FDIC
v. Elefant, 790 F. 2d 661, 667 (CA7 1986); Takeda v. Northwestern National Life Ins. Co., 765 F. 2d 815, 822 (CA9 1985);
14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and
Procedure $ 3722, pp. 402-414 (3d ed. 1998).

Allowing a counterclaim to establish "arising under" jurisdiction would also contravene the longstanding policies
underlying our precedents. First, since the plaintiff is
"the master of the complaint," the well-pleaded-complaint
rule enables him, "by eschewing claims based on federal
law, . . . to have the cause heard in state court." Caterpillar
Inc., supra, at 398-399. The rule proposed by respondent,
in contrast, would leave acceptance or rejection of a state
forum to the master of the counterclaim. It would allow a

CIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.

Opinion of the Court

defendant to remove a case brought in state court understate law, thereby defeating a plaintiff 's choice of forum,

simply by raising a federal counterclaim. Second, confer-ring this power upon the defendant would radically expand
the class of removable cases, contrary to the "[d]ue regardfor the rightful independence of state governments" that our
cases addressing removal require. See Shamrock Oil & Gas
Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S. 100, 109 (1941) (internal quotationmarks omitted). And finally, allowing responsive pleadings

by the defendant to establish "arising under" jurisdictionwould undermine the clarity and ease of administration
of the well-pleaded-complaint doctrine, which serves as a"quick rule of thumb" for resolving jurisdictional conflicts.
See Franchise Tax Bd., supra, at 11.For these reasons, we decline to transform the longstanding well-pleaded-complaint rule into the "well-pleaded-complaint-or-counterclaim rule" urged by respondent.

B
Respondent argues, in the alternative, that even if a coun-terclaim generally cannot establish the original "arising

under" jurisdiction of a district court, we should interpretthe phrase "arising under" differently in ascertaining the
Federal Circuit's jurisdiction. In respondent's view, effectu-ating Congress's goal of "promoting the uniformity of patent
law," Brief for Respondent 21, requires us to interpret$$ 1295(a)(1) and 1338(a) to confer exclusive appellate jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit whenever a patent-law coun-terclaim is raised.

3 Echoing a variant of this argument, Justice Ginsburg contends that
"giv[ing] effect" to Congress's intention "to eliminate forum shopping and
to advance uniformity in . . . patent law" requires that the Federal Circuit
have exclusive jurisdiction whenever a patent claim was "actually adjudicated." Post, at 840 (opinion concurring in judgment). We rejected precisely this argument in Christianson, viz., the suggestion that the Federal

535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

833Cite as: 535 U. S. 826 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
We do not think this option is available. Our task hereis not to determine what would further Congress's goal of

ensuring patent-law uniformity, but to determine whatthe words of the statute must fairly be understood to mean.
It would be difficult enough to give "arising under" themeaning urged by respondent if that phrase appeared
in $ 1295(a)(1)--the jurisdiction-conferring statute--itself.
Cf. Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, $ 211(b)(2), 85 Stat.749 (providing the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals

with exclusive jurisdiction over appeals "in cases and contro-versies arising under this title"). Even then the phrase
would not be some neologism that might justify our advert-ing to the general purpose of the legislation, but rather a
term familiar to all law students as invoking the well-pleaded-complaint rule. Cf.

Coastal States Marketing, Inc.
v. New England Petroleum Corp., 604 F. 2d 179, 183 (CA21979) ("The use of the phrase `cases and controversies arising

under' . . . is strong evidence that Congress intended to bor-row the body of decisional law that has developed under 28
U. S. C. $ 1331 and other grants of jurisdiction to the district
courts over cases `arising under' various regulatory stat-utes"). But the present case is even weaker than that, since

$ 1295(a)(1) does not itself use the term, but rather refers tojurisdiction under $ 1338, where it is well established that
"arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents"invokes, specifically, the well-pleaded-complaint rule. It
would be an unprecedented feat of interpretive necromancy
to say that $ 1338(a)'s "arising under" language means one
thing (the well-pleaded-complaint rule) in its own right,

Circuit's jurisdiction is "fixed `by reference to the case actually litigated.' "
486 U. S., at 813 (quoting Brief for Respondent in Christianson v. Colt
Industries Operating Corp., O. T. 1987, No. 87-499, p. 31). We held that
the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction, like that of the district court, "is determined by reference to the well-pleaded complaint, not the well-tried case."

but something quite different (respondent's complaint-or-counterclaim rule) when referred to by $ 1295(a)(1).

* * *
Not all cases involving a patent-law claim fall withinthe Federal Circuit's jurisdiction. By limiting the Federal

Circuit's jurisdiction to cases in which district courts wouldhave jurisdiction under $ 1338, Congress referred to a wellestablished body of law that requires courts to considerwhether a patent-law claim appears on the face of the plaintiff 's well-pleaded complaint. Because petitioner's com-plaint did not include any claim based on patent law, we
vacate the judgment of the Federal Circuit and remandthe case with instructions to transfer the case to the Court

of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1631.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

The Court correctly holds that the exclusive jurisdictionof the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in patent
4 Although Justice Stevens agrees that a correct interpretation of

$ 1295(a)(1) does not allow a patent-law counterclaim to serve as the basis
for the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction, he nevertheless quibbles that "there
is well-reasoned precedent" supporting the contrary conclusion. See post,
at 835 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). There is
not. The cases relied upon by Justice Stevens and by the court in
Aerojet-General Corp. v. Machine Tool Works, Oerlikon-Buehrle Ltd., 895
F. 2d 736 (CA Fed. 1990), simply address whether a district court can
retain jurisdiction over a counterclaim if the complaint (or a claim therein)
is dismissed or if a jurisdictional defect in the complaint is identified.
They do not even mention the well-pleaded-complaint rule that the statutory phrase "arising under" invokes. Nor do any of these cases interpret

$ 1295(a)(1) or another statute conferring appellate jurisdiction with reference to the jurisdiction of the district court. Thus, the cases relied upon
by Justice Stevens have no bearing on whether the phrase "arising
under" can be interpreted differently in ascertaining the jurisdiction of
the Federal Circuit than that of the district court.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
cases is "fixed with reference to that of the district court,"
ante, at 829. It is important to note the general rule, however, that the jurisdiction of the court of appeals is not"fixed" until the notice of appeal is filed. See

Griggs v.
Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58-59 (1982)
(per curiam) ("The filing of a notice of appeal is an event
of jurisdictional significance--it confers jurisdiction on the
court of appeals and divests the district court of its controlover those aspects of the case involved in the appeal").

Thus, if a case began as an antitrust case, but an amend-ment to the complaint added a patent claim that was pending
or was decided when the appeal is taken, the jurisdiction of
the district court would have been based "in part" on 28
U. S. C. $ 1338(a), and therefore $ 1295(a)(1) would grant the
Federal Circuit jurisdiction over the appeal. Conversely, if
the only patent count in a multicount complaint was voluntarily dismissed in advance of trial, it would seem equally
clear that the appeal should be taken to the appropriate regional court of appeals rather than to the Federal Circuit.
See Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486
U. S. 800, 823-824 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring). Any
other approach "would enable an unscrupulous plaintiff to
manipulate appellate court jurisdiction by the timing of the
amendments to its complaint." Id., at 824. To the extent
that the Court's opinion might be read as endorsing a contrary result by reason of its reliance on cases involving the
removal jurisdiction of the district court, I do not agree
with it.

I also do not agree with the Court's statement that an
interpretation of the "in whole or in part" language of

$ 1295(a)(1) to encompass patent claims alleged in a compulsory counterclaim providing an independent basis for the district court's jurisdiction would be a "neologism" that would
involve "an unprecedented feat of interpretive necromancy,"
ante, at 833. For there is well-reasoned precedent supporting precisely that conclusion. See Aerojet-General Corp. v.

I am nevertheless persuaded that a correct interpretation of

to those cases in which the patent claim is alleged in either
the original complaint or an amended pleading filed by the

$ 1295(a)(1). Ante, at 834, n. 4. But surely it is not a "quibbl[e]" to acknowledge them as supporting the Aerojet court's conclusion that the jurisdiction of the district court can be based on a patent counterclaim,
thereby satisfying the "in whole or in part" requirement of $ 1295(a)(1).

In any event, the assertion that only the power of black magic could
give "arising under" a different meaning with respect to appellate jurisdiction is belied by case law involving the Temporary Emergency Court of
Appeals (TECA), which had exclusive jurisdiction over appeals in cases
"arising under" the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 (ESA), $ 211(b)(2),
85 Stat. 749. Most courts departed from the traditional understanding
of "arising under" and interpreted the statute to grant TECA appellate
jurisdiction over ESA issues, including those raised as a defense. Courts
nevertheless interpreted the statute's identical language respecting the
district courts to grant traditional "arising under" jurisdiction. See
Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. New England Petroleum Corp., 604 F. 2d
179, 185-186 (CA2 1979) ("It must be candidly recognized that according
the TECA some form of `issue' jurisdiction places on the phrase, `cases
and controversies arising under,' . . . a construction that differs from the
meaning associated with these words in other jurisdictional statutes, and
differs even from the grant of jurisdiction to the district courts in [the
ESA]"). Thus, although I am in agreement with the Court's ultimate decision not to determine appellate jurisdiction by reference to the defendant's patent counterclaim, I find it unnecessary and inappropriate to slight
the contrary reasoning of the Court of Appeals.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
plaintiff. In my judgment, each of the three policies thatthe Court has identified as supporting the "well-pleadedcomplaint" rule governing district court jurisdiction, ante, at831-832, points in the same direction with respect to appellate jurisdiction.First, the interest in preserving the plaintiff 's choice of
forum includes not only the court that will conduct the trial
but the appellate court as well. A plaintiff who has a legiti-mate interest in litigating in a circuit whose precedents support its theory of the case might omit a patent claim in orderto avoid review in the Federal Circuit. In some cases that
interest would be defeated by a rule that allowed a patentcounterclaim to determine the appellate forum.

Second, although I doubt that a rule that enabled the coun-terclaimant to be the occasional master of the appellate
forum "would radically expand" the number of cases heardby the Federal Circuit,

ante, at 832, we must recognize that
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit defined in

$ 1295(a)(1) does not comprise claims arising under the trademark and copyright laws, which are included in the district
court's grant of jurisdiction under $ 1338(a).2 As the instant
litigation demonstrates, claims sounding in these other areas
of intellectual property law are not infrequently bound up
with patent counterclaims. The potential number of cases
in which a counterclaim might direct to the Federal Circuit
appeals that Congress specifically chose not to place within
its exclusive jurisdiction is therefore significant.

Third, the interest in maintaining clarity and simplicity in
rules governing appellate jurisdiction will be served by lim2 The statute grants the Federal Circuit "exclusive jurisdiction . . . if the
jurisdiction of [the district] court was based, in whole or in part, on [28
U. S. C.] section 1338 . . . , except that a case involving a claim arising

works, or trademarks and no other claims under section 1338(a) shall
be governed" by provisions relating to appeals to the regional courts of

iting the number of pleadings that will mandate review inthe Federal Circuit. In his opinion in Aerojet, Chief Judge

Markey merely held that a counterclaim for patent infringe-ment that was "compulsory" and not "frivolous" or "insubstantial" sufficed to establish jurisdiction; he made a point ofnoting that there was no assertion in the case that the patent
counterclaim at issue had been filed "to manipulate the juris-diction of [the Federal Circuit]." 895 F. 2d, at 738. The
text of the statute, however, would not seem to distinguishbetween that counterclaim and those that are permissive,
insubstantial, or manipulative, and there is very good reasonnot to make the choice of appellate forum turn on such distinctions. Requiring assessment of a defendant's motive inraising a patent counterclaim or the counterclaim's relative
strength wastes judicial resources by inviting "unhappyinteractions between jurisdiction and the merits."

Kennedyv. Wright, 851 F. 2d 963, 968 (CA7 1988).

There is, of course, a countervailing interest in directingappeals in patent cases to the specialized court that was created, in part, to promote uniformity in the development ofthis area of the law. But we have already decided that the
Federal Circuit does not have exclusive jurisdiction over allcases raising patent issues.

3 In explicit contrast with the TECA, see n. 1, supra, the Federal Circuit
was granted appellate jurisdiction over cases involving patent law claims,
not issues. See Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486
U. S. 800, 820-821, n. 1 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring) (quoting H. R.

Considerations of convenience to the parties and the courts support Congress' decision to determine the Federal Circuit's appellate jurisdiction
based on the claims alleged in the well-pleaded complaint rather than the
issues resolved by the district court's judgment. If, for example, the dis535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

An occasional conflict in decisions may be useful in identify-ing questions that merit this Court's attention. Moreover,
occasional decisions by courts with broader jurisdiction willprovide an antidote to the risk that the specialized court may
develop an institutional bias.4In sum, I concur in the Court's judgment and join Parts I
and II-A of its opinion.

For reasons stated by Chief Judge Markey, writing for aunanimous en banc Federal Circuit in

Aerojet-General Corp.v. Machine Tool Works, Oerlikon-Buehrle Ltd., 895 F. 2d

736 (1990), I conclude that, when the claim stated in a com-pulsory counterclaim "aris[es] under" federal patent law and
is adjudicated on the merits by a federal district court, theFederal Circuit has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over that
adjudication and other determinations made in the samecase. See id., at 741-744 (distinguishing Christianson v.

affirmed the jurisdictional decision of theFederal Circuit; in discussing the "well-pleaded complaint

relatively straightforward matter by reference to the complaint. As
Judge Easterbrook explains in Kennedy v. Wright, 851 F. 2d 963 (CA7
1988), fixing appellate jurisdiction with respect to the complaint also ensures that a case that has been appealed and remanded will return to the
same appellate court if there is a subsequent appeal. Id., at 968 (describing the risk of "a game of jurisdictional ping-pong" if subsequent appeals
are directed based on the grounds for decision rather than the pleadings).

4 See Dreyfuss, The Federal Circuit: A Case Study in Specialized

Courts, 64 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1, 25-30, 54 (1989) (evaluating criticism that
the Federal Circuit demonstrates a greater pro-patent bias than regional
circuits).

840 HOLMES GROUP, INC. v. VORNADO AIR

CIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.

Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment

ment counterclaim, unlike a patent issue raised only as a de-fense, has as its own, independent jurisdictional base 28

U. S. C. $ 1338, i. e., such a claim discretely "arises under thepatent laws").

The question now before this Court bears not at all on aplaintiff 's choice of trial forum. The sole question presented
here concerns Congress' allocation of adjudicatory authorityamong the federal courts of appeals. At that appellate level,
Congress sought to eliminate forum shopping and to advanceuniformity in the interpretation and application of federal
patent law. See generally Dreyfuss, The Federal Circuit:A Case Study in Specialized Courts, 64 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1,
30-37 (1989).The Court's opinion dwells on district court authority.
See ante, at 829-832. But, all agree, Congress left that au-thority entirely untouched. I would attend, instead, to the
unique context at issue, and give effect to Congress' en-deavor to grant the Federal Circuit exclusive appellate jurisdiction at least over district court adjudications of patentclaims. See Dreyfuss, supra, at 36.

In the instant case, however, no patent claim was actu-ally adjudicated. For that sole reason, I join the Court's
judgment.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Scalia and JusticeKennedy join, dissenting.
The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 provides for automatic annualadjustments in judicial pay to take account of inflation. In each
of fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1999, Congress included lan-guage in appropriations legislation that prevented the Ethics Act
adjustments from taking effect for that fiscal year. The petition-ers in this case, federal judges sitting when the Ethics Act became law, claim that the latter legislation violates the Consti-tution's Compensation Clause. In my view the Compensation
Clause question is both difficult and important. I would grantcertiorari and hear this case.

I
On January 1, 1990, the Ethics Reform Act (Ethics Act or Act)took effect as law. Pub. L. 101-194, 103 Stat. 1716. Insofar as

that statute applied to federal judges it accomplished two impor-tant objectives. First, it strictly limited the amount of outside
income that any judge could earn. It forbade the receipt of hono-raria, speaking or lecture fees, payments for articles, or other
income earned other than by teaching or writing books. And itimposed a dollar limit (now just over $21,000) on the income a
judge could earn through classroom teaching. 5 U. S. C. App.$$ 501-502.

Second, the Act sought to maintain real judicial compensationat a nearly constant level. The Quadrennial Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries had told Congress thata continuous inflation-driven reduction in the real level of judicial
salaries, at a time when most other real salaries in America had

remained constant or increased, was "threatening to diminish thequality of justice in this country . . . ." Report of 1989 Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries, Fairness forour Public Servants 27 (1988). And the Congressional Bipartisan
Task Force on Ethics had added that "[f]ederal judges are resign-ing at a higher rate than ever before." 135 Cong. Rec. 30752
(1989). Failure to protect against the negative impact of infla-tion, the task force stated, was "the single, most important explanation" for the increasing disparity between the salaries of high-level Government officials and comparable positions in the private
sector. Id., at 30753. Hence, the Act focused on inflation, assur-ing federal judges (as well as Members of Congress and high-level
Executive Branch officials) that their real salaries, compared tothose of the average worker, would decline only slightly, if at

all.The Act provided this assurance as follows: First, it said that
each year "each [judicial] salary rate . . . shall be adjusted by
an amount . . . as determined under section 704(a)(1) . . . ." 28U. S. C. $ 461(a)(1) (1994 ed.). Second, it provided in $ 704(a)(1)

that the adjustment amount would equal the quarterly percentage set forth in the Employment Cost Index (a measurement ofchange in private sector salaries published by the Bureau of

Labor Statistics) minus one-half of one percent with a ceiling offive percent.

Ibid. Third, it said that this adjustment "shall"
take place whenever there was a similar adjustment in the salaryof federal civil servants under "section 5303 of [Title 5]." 5

U. S. C. $ 5318. Fourth, it made clear that this latter adjustment
would take place annually and automatically unless the Presidentdetermined that there was either (1) a "national emergency"

or (2) "serious economic conditions affecting the general wel-fare." $ 5303(b)(1).

The Act mandates adjustments to judicial salaries; the adjustments are mechanical and precise; and they are to take placeautomatically, for they are tied to the adjustments provided to

General Schedule employees which themselves are automatic butfor the two possible exceptions. These features of the law assured federal judges, as I have said, that their real salarieswould stay approximately level unless the real salaries of the
average private sector worker or those of the typical civil servant declined significantly as well.

The adjustments for which the Ethics Act provided took effectas required by the Act in fiscal years 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1998.
In fiscal year 1994, the President applied the special circumstanceexception, invoking "serious economic conditions" (namely, huge
budget deficits) as a basis for denying General Schedule employ-ees an adjustment, and, consequently, federal judges received no
adjustment in their salaries either. In each of fiscal years 1995,1996, 1997, and 1999, however, the adjustment in the salaries of
General Schedule employees took effect. But the related adjust-ment in the salaries of federal judges did not take effect. That
is because, in each year, Congress included in its appropriationslegislation language specifying that, other laws to the contrary
notwithstanding, the salaries of Members of Congress, certainhigh-level Executive Branch employees, and federal judges would
not be adjusted. Pub. L. 103-329, $ 630(a)(2), 108 Stat. 2424;Pub. L. 104-52, $ 632, 109 Stat. 507; Pub. L. 104-208, $ 637, 110
Stat. 3009-364; Pub. L. 105-277, $ 621, 112 Stat. 2681-518.In 1997, a group of federal judges, all members of the Federal
Judiciary prior to 1989, filed this lawsuit against the UnitedStates. The judges argued that the first three special "blocking
laws" diminished their compensation in violation of Article III'scommand. The District Court agreed and granted summary
judgment in the judges' favor. The same judges then filed asimilar suit based on the fourth blocking law, which had now
taken effect, and the District Court granted them summaryjudgment on this suit as well. The United States appealed, and
the cases were consolidated. The Court of Appeals reversed ina 2-to-1 panel decision. 240 F. 3d 1019 (CA Fed. 2001). The
judges now seek certiorari. II

The judges argue that the appropriations legislation blockingthe Ethics Act adjustments violates the literal language of the
Compensation Clause and runs contrary to its basic purposes.In respect to the language, they point out that the Clause says
that judges "shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, aCompensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office." U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1. The Ethics Act,they say, sets forth the level of "compensation" that judges
"shall . . . receive" at a "stated time," i. e., each year. Thesubsequent appropriations legislation "diminished" that fixed

Breyer, J., dissenting 535 U. S.
"compensation" by removing the previously legislated adjust-ment. And it did so during the plaintiff judges' "continuance
in office."Moreover, the judges argue, the blocking statutes represent
precisely the kind of legislation that the Compensation Clausewas designed to prohibit. The Founders wrote the Compensation
Clause in order to help ensure "complete independence of thecourts of justice." The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). As Hamilton explicitly stated: "Next topermanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support."Id., No.

79, at 472. A "power over a man's subsistence," Hamil-ton added, "amounts to a power over his will."

Ibid. (emphasisdeleted).

Moreover, when the Founders considered the Constitution's spe-cific provisions, they took inflation into account. Hamilton, fully
aware of then-prevalent inflation, wrote that "fluctuations in thevalue of money and in the state of society rendered a fixed rate
of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible." Id., at 473.For that reason, he insisted that the Constitution "leave it to the
discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformityto the variations in circumstances." Ibid. But once the legislature has chosen to vary a provision, he added, the CompensationClause "put[s] it out of the power of that body to change the
condition of the individual for the worse." Ibid. The reason isthat a judge must "be sure of the ground upon which he stands,
and . . . never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension ofbeing placed in a less eligible situation."

Ibid. In a nutshell,the Founders created a one-way compensation ratchet because

they believed that permitting the legislature to diminish judicialcompensation would allow the legislature to threaten judicial
independence.Three examples will help illustrate how, in the judges' view, the
appropriations legislation undermines these basic CompensationClause objectives:
Example One assumes that Congress has enacted a statute takingeffect on January 1, 2000, specifying that federal district court
salaries for the next five years shall be paid according to thefollowing schedule:

535ORD Unit: $PT1 [09-12-03 13:11:39] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

Breyer, J., dissenting911
2000 $150,0002001 $150,000
2002 $150,0002003 $150,000
2004 $150,000
Example Two assumes that Congress, believing that inflation islikely to occur, has enacted a statute taking effect on January 1,

2000, specifying that federal district court salaries for the nextfive years shall be paid according to the following schedule:

2000 $150,0002001 $160,000
2002 $170,0002003 $180,000
2004 $190,000
Example Three is a simplified version of the present case. Itassumes a statute that specifies a mechanically determined adjustment for inflation (yielding a, b, c, and d dollars) added on tothe fiscal year 2000 salary each year according to the following
table:

2000 $150,0002001 $150,000

\Delta a2002 $150,000
\Delta a\Delta b2003 $150,000
\Delta a\Delta b\Delta c2004 $150,000
\Delta a\Delta b\Delta c\Delta d

Example One presents circumstances where Congress could notsubsequently (say, in 2003) reduce the pay of previously sitting

federal judges below the amount previously specified for that year($150,000). But what about Example Two and Example Three?
It is difficult to see any difference between a later statute,enacted, say, in 2003, that removes Example Two's $10,000 increase due in 2004, and a similar statute that removes ExampleThree's increase of mechanically determined amount "d." Those
two examples would seem virtually identical from a constitutionalpoint of view.

But does the Compensation Clause distinguish Example Onefrom Examples Two and Three? The lower court answered this
question affirmatively. Its answer assumes that the Constitutionforbids only a reduction in the nominal dollar rate of pay that

Breyer, J., dissenting 535 U. S.
a judge actually has earned for at least some minimal periodof time.

The judges concede that such a reading is possible logically.But they point out that that reading, in significantly restricting
the protective scope of the Compensation Clause, would mockHamilton's claim that the Constitution (while granting to Congress
the power to decide when to increase a judge's nominal pay)"put[s] it out of the power" of Congress "to change the condition
of the individual for the worse." Ibid. That is because the threeexamples are virtually identical in terms of the Compensation
Clause's basic purposive focus: a judge's reasonable expectations.A sitting judge has no greater, and no lesser, reason to believe
he will receive the amounts provided in Examples Two and Threethan the amount provided in Example One. Assuming in each
case that a statute already in effect has similarly determined,fixed, and mandated the figures listed in the schedule, a judge
similarly will expect to receive the salary that the statute man-dates. And any subsequent reduction in the amounts contained
in any of the three statutes would similarly diminish the judge'scompensation below the level that the law had previously entitled
that judge to expect. Cf. United States v. Hatter, 532 U. S. 557,585 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(arguing that repeal of judges' exemption from Medicare taxconstituted diminishment in compensation because judges "had
an employment expectation of a preferential exemption fromtaxation . . ."); ibid. ("This benefit Congress took away, much as
a private employer might terminate a contractual commitment topay Medicare taxes on behalf of its employees"). Moreover, the
expected level here is a level that does not increase a judge's realsalary; it simply keeps that real salary from being reduced.

The federal appeals court majority did not reject this argumentdirectly on the merits. Rather, it wrote that this Court had rejected the argument in United States v. Will, 449 U. S. 200 (1980),a unanimous decision, and it did not believe it could reopen the
issue. 240 F. 3d, at 1035. In Will, the Court considered "when,if ever, . . . the Compensation Clause prohibit[s] the Congress
from repealing salary increases that otherwise take effect auto-matically pursuant to a formula previously enacted." 449 U. S.,
at 221. The Court held that Congress could block a "cost-of-living" increase due judges (under pre-existing law) because the
blocking legislation took effect in the fiscal year prior to the year

Breyer, J., dissenting911
in which the increase would become payable. And the Courtwrote that "a salary increase `vests' . . . only when it takes effect
as part of the compensation due and payable to Article IIIjudges." Id., at 229. This language and holding, in the Court of
Appeals' view, distinguishes Example One from Examples Twoand Three, offering protection in Example One, but not in either
of the latter two examples.The judges, however, offer a strong argument distinguishing
Will in terms of the Compensation Clause's basic, expectations-related purpose. Will involved a set of interlocking statutes
which, in respect to future cost-of-living adjustments, were nei-ther definite nor precise. The statute providing for judicial costof-living adjustments, like the statute now before us, tied thoseadjustments to adjustments provided others in the civil service.
But the civil service statute, unlike the comparable statute herebefore us, was imprecise as to amount and uncertain as to effect.
The Will statutes required the President to appoint an adjustmentagent. The agent was to compare salaries in the civil service
with those in the private sector and then recommend an adjust-ment to an Advisory Committee. Subsequently, the Committee
would make its own recommendation to the President, accepting,rejecting, or modifying the agent's recommendation as the Committee thought desirable. The President would have to acceptthe Committee's recommendation--unless he determined that national emergency or special economic conditions warranted its re-jection. But that recommendation would not take effect as law
if either House of Congress rejected it. See id., at 203-204.Put in terms of the Compensation Clause's basic purpose, the
judges argue that the Will statutes created a series of hurdlesthat prevented those statutes from creating a firm judicial expectation that the statutes' potential beneficiaries, e. g., sittingjudges, would in fact receive any inflation-compensating adjustment. Neither did the statutes provide for calculation of anysuch adjustment in a mechanical way.

The judges add two further subsidiary distinctions: (1) The Eth-ics Act, unlike the statutes in Will, simultaneously eliminated
other (outside) income that judges had previously received, 5U. S. C. App. $$ 501-502; and (2) the Ethics Act, unlike the statutes in Will, was directly intended to protect judges from "ridersto appropriations bills to deny them COLAs when other Federal
employees receive theirs." 135 Cong. Rec., at 30753.

918 OCTOBER TERM, 2001

Breyer, J., dissenting 535 U. S.
The judges recognize that the Ethics Act does not fix salariesquite as definitively as hypothetical Example Three suggests.
That is because the Act's adjustment will not take place if thePresident determines that there exists either a "national emergency" or "serious economic conditions affecting the general wel-fare," and then reduces or eliminates General Schedule salary
adjustments accordingly. But these circumstances, they argue,are defined precisely enough and are uncommon enough not to
affect expectations significantly. In any event, that, according tothe judges, is the question that this Court must decide--whether
the 1989 statute is sufficiently precise and definite to have cre-ated an "expectation" that the Compensation Clause protects.
Cf. Boehner v. Anderson, 30 F. 3d 156 (CADC 1994) (finding equiv-alent of such "vesting" for purposes of the Twenty-seventh
Amendment in Ethics Act's adjustment provision as it applied toMembers of Congress).

In my view, the Court in Will did not focus on this question.To read that opinion as the lower court read it would render
ineffectual any congressional effort to protect judges' real com-pensation, even from the most malignant hyperinflation, Hamilton's views to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed, that read-ing would permit legislative repeal of even the most precise and
definite salary statute--any time before the operative fiscal yearin which the new nominal salary rate is to be paid. I very much
doubt that the Court in Will intended these consequences.The Government alternatively claims that $ 140 of a fiscal year
1982 appropriations bill, Pub. L. 97-92, 95 Stat. 1200, provides aseparate basis for rejecting the judges' claim. I do not see how
that is so. Section 140 provides in relevant part:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law . . . none ofthe funds appropriated by this joint resolution or by any

other Act shall be obligated or expended to increase, afterthe date of enactment of this joint resolution, any salary of
any Federal judge or Justice of the Supreme Court, exceptas may be specifically authorized by Act of Congress hereafter enacted."
This provision refers specifically to federal judges, and it imposesa special legislative burden upon their salaries alone. The singling out of judges must throw the constitutionality of the pro-vision into doubt. Hatter, supra, at 564 (striking down as un535ORD Unit: $PT1 [09-12-03 13:11:39] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

919ORDERS
Breyer, J., dissenting911
constitutionally discriminatory the imposition of a Social Securitypayroll tax upon a small group of federal employees consisting
"almost exclusively of federal judges"). Regardless, the Govern-ment fails to explain how, in light of the fact that the Ethics Act
"specifically authorized" (indeed mandated) future adjustments injudicial pay, the language of $ 140 (enacted in 1981) could make a
legal difference. The Government adds that Congress reenactedthis 1982 provision in 2001. But it does not explain how that
reenactment could affect the years here at issue.For these reasons, I believe the judges have raised an important constitutional question, the answer to which at present isuncertain.

III
I recognize that not every petition raising a difficult constitu-tional question warrants review in this Court. And there are

prudential considerations that some might believe warrant deny-ing certiorari here. For one thing, we face the serious embarrassment of deciding a matter that would directly affect our ownpocketbooks; and, in doing so, we may risk the public's high opinion of the Court insofar as that opinion rests upon a belief thatits judges are not self-interested. But the law requires judges
to decide cases in which they have a self-interest where, as here," `no provision is made for calling another in, or where no one
else can take his place.' " Will, 449 U. S., at 214 (quoting Phila-delphia v. Fox, 64 Pa. 169, 185 (1870)). Nor should judges, who
are called upon to protect the least popular cause and the leastpopular person where the Constitution demands it, be moved by
potential personal embarrassment. Whenever a court considersa matter where public sentiment is strong, it risks public alienation. But the American public has understood the need andthe importance of judges deciding important constitutional issues
without regard to considerations of popularity.One might also argue that the matter is not important enough
to consider now, because over time Congress will deal with thedecline in judicial compensation, making good on the 1989 Act's
inflation-adjustment promise--that real judicial salaries will notfall significantly unless those of the typical American worker or
the typical civil servant decline significantly as well. The imple-mentation of the Ethics Act, however, does not support this view.
Since 1989, Congress has refused to follow the Act's mandateabout half the time. The real salaries of district court judges

Breyer, J., dissenting 535 U. S.
have declined about 25 percent in the past several decades. TheAmerican Bar Association, the Federal Bar Association, and the
American College of Trial Lawyers, in support of the petitionerjudges, tell us that, while real judicial compensation fell below
that of typical mid-level (and a few first-year) law firm associatesand many law school teachers and administrators, the real compensation earned by the average private sector worker has in-creased, as has that in nearly all employment categories outside
high levels of Government. See Appendix, infra. See also Fisk,What Lawyers Earn, National Law Journal, Oct. 2, 2000, p. A31;
2001 Society of American Law Teachers Equalizer, Issue 1, p. 2(Apr. 2001). The consequence, in the professional organizations'
view, is that compensation-related judicial resignations havereached an all time high, a particularly serious matter given rapidly rising caseloads. Cf. The Federalist No. 78, at 471-472(stressing importance of professional experience).

The Compensation Clause, of course, is not concerned with theabsolute level of judicial compensation. Judges are paid significantly more than most Americans and no less than Members ofCongress and many other high-level Government workers. It is
up to Congress to decide what that level of pay ought to be. Butthis case is not about what judges' labor should be worth. It is
about a congressional decision in 1989 to protect federal judgesagainst undue diminishment in real pay by providing cost-ofliving adjustments to guarantee that their salaries would not falltoo far behind inflation. Cf.

Rehnquist, C. J., 2001 Year-EndReport on the Federal Judiciary 2 (Jan. 1, 2002) ("But a COLA

only keeps judges from falling further behind the median incomeof the profession"). This congressional decision was tempered
only with the caveat that judges would not be protected againstsalary diminishment if such protection would give judges a benefit that the average American worker and the average federalemployee had been denied. The Compensation Clause assures
judges that, once Congress has made such a decision, a laterCongress cannot overturn it. This is not a novel concept; it has
been engrained since the Founders drafted the Clause to protectagainst the risk that Congress would attempt to change the conditions of judges "for the worse." The Federalist No. 79, at 473(A. Hamilton).

Congress, of course, has treated judges no worse than it hastreated itself. It has cut its own real salaries just as it has cut

535ORD Unit: $PT1 [09-12-03 13:11:39] PGT: ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

921ORDERS
Breyer, J., dissenting911
those of the judges. And its doing so may well work similarharm upon all Federal Government institutions. The Compensation Clause, however, protects judicial compensation, not becauseof the comparative importance of the Judiciary, but because of the
special nature of the judicial enterprise. That enterprise, ChiefJustice Marshall explained, may call upon a judge to decide "between the Government and the man whom that Government isprosecuting: between the most powerful individual in the community, and the poorest and most unpopular." Proceedings and De-bates of the Virginia State Convention of 1829-1830, p. 616 (1830).
Independence of conscience, freedom from subservience to otherGovernment authorities, is necessary to the enterprise. The
Compensation Clause helps to secure that judicial independence.When a case presents a serious Compensation Clause question,
as this case does, we should hear and decide it.

IV
To summarize: this case focuses upon monetary inflation--aphenomenon familiar to the Nation's founders, but absent during

much of the 19th century. By reducing the purchasing power ofsalaries specified in fixed dollar amounts, inflation leaves it to
Congress to determine whether a judge's standard of living willbe reduced or maintained. The judges concede that the Compensation Clause itself does not require periodic readjustment ofjudicial salaries in order to maintain their real value. The question in the present case is whether that Clause offers protectionwhen Congress chooses to promise a stable purchasing power.

Here, Congress, not the Constitution, wrote the guarantee atissue. It enacted a statute promising that real federal judicial
salaries will be essentially maintained, but only if, and insofar as,both (1) the average worker and (2) the average civil servant also
have seen their own real salaries maintained. The constitutionalquestion is whether the Compensation Clause permits a later Congress to renege on that commitment. The court below held, ineffect, that there is no way in which Congress can assure prospective judges that the purchasing power of their promised salarywill be maintained: Any commitment by one Congress (even one
accompanied by a reduction in judges' permissible outside income)can be repudiated by a later Congress, no matter how serious the
inflation-produced erosion of real compensation. For the reasonsset forth, I believe that holding may well be wrong. And because

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and JusticeThomas join, dissenting.
I dissent from the Court's orders of May 1 and May 7, 2002,granting the applications of Curtis Moore and Brian Edward
Davis for stay of execution of sentence of death. The Court hasentered these stays even though the judgments of the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals from which review is sought dismissedthe applicants' habeas petitions on adequate and independent
state grounds. In each case, the Court disrupts the State's crimi-nal process to entertain a last-minute claim (unconstitutionality
of executing the mentally retarded) that was not raised previouslyat trial, or in extensive proceedings for direct and collateral re*[Reporter's Note: The following opinion of Justice Scalia, which alsoapplies to Davis v. Texas, post, p. 1050, was filed on June 3, 2002.]

view. Indeed, in each case even the factual predicate for the newclaim (mental retardation) had not been asserted at trial--and in

Davis's case had not been asserted even in subsequent proceed-ings, right up until the day of scheduled execution. The Court's
action is unprecedented. I

The first of these murderers, Curtis Moore, participated inthree brutal killings during the course of a drug deal and robbery.
One victim was stuffed in the trunk of a car, shot, doused withgasoline, and lit afire. The second victim was driven to his girlfriend's home, where he and the third victim, the girlfriend, wereshot dead. Before trial, Moore had discussed with his counsel the
possibility of introducing into evidence an IQ test administered toMoore when he was 12 years old, showing a score of 68, a figure
within the "mildly retarded" range. Counsel advised Moore thatif the defense presented psychological testimony, the State could
have an expert witness interview him to determine whether heposed a continuing threat to society. Because a pretrial IQ test
(administered at counsel's request) showed a score of 76, withinthe "normal" range, Moore's counsel believed that introduction of
the results of the earlier test would do more harm than good.Moore himself did not believe the earlier test result, insisted
he was normal, and told counsel he did not want psychologicaltestimony introduced.

Moore was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to deathin November 1996. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, Moore v. State, No. 72,705 (Apr. 28, 1999). Moore's firststate habeas petition alleged trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present evidence of his mental retardation at sentencing.The petition was denied, Ex parte Moore, No. C-297-3899-
0631559-A (Dist. Ct. Tarrant County, Tex., Sept. 9, 1999), aff 'd,No. 42,810-01 (Tex. Crim. App., Nov. 3, 1999). So was his first
federal habeas petition, which raised the same claim of ineffectiveassistance, Moore v. Johnson, No. 4:99-CV-960-A (ND Tex., July
13, 2000), aff 'd sub nom. Moore v. Cockrell, No. 00-10870 (CA5,Oct. 10, 2001), cert. denied, ante, p. 1040. On the day before his
scheduled execution, Moore filed a second state habeas petition inwhich he claimed, for the first time, that his execution would
violate the Eighth Amendment because he is mentally retarded.In support of this claim, Moore presented the same evidence that,

in prior habeas petitions, he had claimed his attorney should havepresented at sentencing. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
dismissed the petition as an abuse of the writ under Tex. CodeCrim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071, $ 5(a) (Vernon Supp. 2002), which
generally precludes second or subsequent habeas petitions involv-ing claims that could have been raised previously.

Ex parteMoore, No. 42,810-02 (Apr. 30, 2002). Moore petitioned this

Court for a stay of execution pending its decision in Atkins v.Virginia, No. 00-8452, cert. granted, 533 U. S. 976 (2001).

The second murderer, Brian Edward Davis, was convicted andsentenced to death in June 1992 for a killing during the course of
a robbery. The mentally retarded victim was found in his ran-sacked apartment with a swastika drawn on his abdomen and 11
stab wounds to his neck, chest, abdomen, and back. AlthoughDavis's trial attorney introduced evidence of a learning disability,
he did not argue that Davis was mentally retarded. Indeed, apsychologist testified at trial that Davis was not mentally retarded, and Davis's score of 74 on a 1984 IQ test placed him inthe range of normal intellectual functioning. The Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals affirmed Davis's conviction and sentence, Davis
v. State, 961 S. W. 2d 156 (1998), denied his first application forstate postconviction relief,

Ex parte Davis, No. 40,339-01 (Mar.
10, 1999), and dismissed his second state habeas petition as anabuse of the writ,

Ex parte Davis, No. 40,339-02 (Sept. 13, 2000).
After his federal habeas petition was denied, Davis v. Cockrell,No. 00-CV-852 (SD Tex., Oct. 1, 2001), Davis filed his third state

habeas petition, which was likewise dismissed as an abuse of

the writ, Ex parte Davis, No. 40,339-03 (Tex. Crim. App., Apr.29, 2002). The Fifth Circuit denied Davis's request for authorization to file a successive federal habeas petition, In re Davis,No. 02-20479 (May 6, 2002); we denied his petition for an original
writ of habeas corpus, In re Davis, post, p. 1050. On the day of
his scheduled execution, Davis filed a fourth state habeas petition,raising an Eighth Amendment claim, and asserting the fact of

mental retardation, for the first time. The Texas Court of Crimi-nal Appeals once again dismissed the petition as an abuse of the
writ, and Davis petitioned this Court for a stay of executionpending its decision in

Atkins, supra.
It is apparent on the face of both these applications that the
conditions for stay do not exist.

A stay is appropriate only when there is a " `reasonable proba-bility' " that four Members of this Court will grant certiorari, a

" `significant possibility' " that the Court, after hearing the case,will reverse the decision below, and a " `likelihood' " that the applicant will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. Barefoot v. Es-telle, 463 U. S. 880, 895 (1983); see also Rubin v. United States,
524 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1998) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers); Ed-wards v. Hope Medical Group for Women, 512 U. S. 1301, 1302
(1994) (Scalia, J., in chambers). It is a firm rule that "[t]hisCourt will not review a question of federal law decided by a state
court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground thatis independent of the federal question and adequate to support
the judgment." Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991).That rule applies "whether the state law ground is substantive
or procedural," and in the case of direct review of a state-courtjudgment (which is at issue here) it is jurisdictional.

Ibid.The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed each of these

applicants' successive habeas petitions as an abuse of the writunder Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071, $ 5(a) (Vernon
Supp. 2002), which declares in relevant part:

"[A] court may not consider the merits of or grant reliefbased on the subsequent application unless the application

contains sufficient specific facts establishing that . . ."(1) the current claims and issues have not been and could
not have been presented previously . . . because the factualor legal basis for the claim was unavailable on the date the
applicant filed the previous application; . . . or. . . . .

"(3) by clear and convincing evidence, but for a violationof the United States Constitution no rational juror would
have answered in the state's favor one or more of the specialissues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant's trial
under Article 37.071 or 37.0711 [which list aggravating andmitigating factors] . . . ."

There is no question that this procedural bar is an adequate stateground; it is firmly established and has been regularly followed
by Texas courts since at least 1994. See Barrientes v. Johnson,
221 F. 3d 741, 758-759 (CA5 2000).

Scalia, J., dissenting 535 U. S.
Nor could there be a question whether it is independent offederal law. Insofar as $ 5(a)(1) is concerned, Texas courts did
not pass on any issue of federal law in deciding whether appli-cants' Eighth Amendment claim was "previously unavailable." A
claim is "unavailable" under Texas law only "if the legal basiswas not recognized by or could not have been reasonably formulated from a final decision of the United States Supreme Court,a court of appeals of the United States, or a court of appellate
jurisdiction of this state on or before" the date of the initialhabeas application. Art. 11.071, $ 5(d). The question whether
a particular claim is "reasonably formula[ble]" from federal orstate appellate decisions within the meaning of the Texas statute
is a question of Texas, not federal, law. To be sure, Texas's an-swer cannot be so arbitrary or unreasonable as to violate due
process, but that is not a problem here. On any assessment,applicants' claim--that execution of the mentally retarded violates
the Eighth Amendment--was "available" when applicants filed
their first state habeas petitions in 1999. In fact, the claim was
made in at least two pre-1999 cases before the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals itself. See Bell v. State, 938 S. W. 2d 35, 55
(1996) (en banc); Ramirez v. State, 815 S. W. 2d 636, 654-655(1991) (en banc).

The application of $ 5(a)(3) to these cases is similarly independ-ent of federal law. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was
not required to pass on any federal question in deciding whether"clear and convincing evidence" showed that "but for a violation
of the United States Constitution no rational juror would have
answered in the state's favor one or more of the special issuesthat were submitted to the jury." The Eighth Amendment violation that applicants have alleged (failure to exempt the mentallyretarded from the death penalty) could not possibly have caused
any rational juror to give a different answer to the special issues--viz., whether there is a probability that the defendantwould commit criminal acts of violence in the future, Tex. Code

Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, $$ 2(b)(1), 3(b)(2) (Vernon Supp.2001), and (in Moore's case only) whether "mitigating circumstances" outweigh aggravating factors, $ 2(e)(1). Not only is theconstitutional point irrelevant to those issues, but the jury had
no cause to think that either applicant was retarded, since neither
had asserted mental retardation at trial or in the penalty phase.

The decisions of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, then,clearly rest on adequate and independent state grounds. It is
equally clear that applicants have neither demonstrated cause fortheir procedural default nor have raised even a colorable claim of
mental retardation. They present the same evidence that theirtrial attorneys concluded was too insubstantial to support an argument of mental retardation. IQ tests place both applicantsabove the highest cutoff used in state legislation prohibiting execution of the mentally retarded.* Brief for Respondent in Atkinsv. Virginia, O. T. 2001, No. 00-8452, pp. 40-41. And in Davis's
case, a psychologist testified at trial that the defendant wasnot mentally retarded. Thus, the specter of a "fundamental miscarriage of justice" (if Atkins should proscribe execution of thementally retarded) could not possibly induce the Court to ignore
the adequate and independent state grounds. Coleman, supra,at 750.

If prior law is to be adhered to, there is no possibility, muchless a "significant" one (as the granting of a stay requires), that
this Court will reverse the judgments of the Texas Court of Crim-inal Appeals. And I have not mentioned a further consideration,
which should weigh heavily in the present circumstances: TheCourt "may consider the last-minute nature of an application to
stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief."Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal.,
503 U. S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam). The Court's granting ofthese stays not only disrupts settled law but invites meritless
last-minute applications to disrupt the orderly state administra-tion of the death penalty.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

APRIL 29, 2002
Ordered:

1. That the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure be, and
they hereby are, amended by including therein amendments
to Criminal Rules 1 through 60.[See

infra, pp. 1171-1259.]
2. That the foregoing amendments to the Federal Rules ofCriminal Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 2002,

and shall govern in all proceedings in criminal cases there-after commenced and, insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings then pending.

3. That The Chief Justice be, and hereby is, authorized
to transmit to the Congress the foregoing amendments to
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2072 of Title 28, United States
Code.

Justice Scalia filed a statement.
I share the majority's view that the Judicial Conference's
proposed Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26(b) is of dubious validity under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth
Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that serious constitutional doubt is an appropriate reason for this
Court to exercise its statutory power and responsibility to
decline to transmit a Conference recommendation.

In Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836 (1990), the Court held
that a defendant can be denied face-to-face confrontation
during live testimony at trial only if doing so is "necessary
to further an important public policy," id., at 850, and only
"where there is a case-specific finding of [such] necessity," id.,
at 857-858 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court
allowed the witness in that case to testify via one-way video
transmission because doing so had been found "necessary to

1159

protect a child witness from trauma." Id., at 857. The pres-ent proposal does not limit the use of testimony via video

transmission to instances where there has been a "case-specific finding" that it is "necessary to further an important
public policy." To the contrary, it allows the use of videotransmission whenever the parties are merely unable to take
a deposition under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 15.Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 26,
p. 54. See App. to statement of Breyer, J., post, at 1165-1166. Indeed, even this showing is not necessary: the
Committee says that video transmission may be used generally as an alternative to depositions. Advisory Committee'sNotes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 26, at 57. See

post, at 1169.
This is unquestionably contrary to the rule enunciated in
Craig. The Committee reasoned, however, that "the use of
a two-way transmission made it unnecessary to apply the
Craig standard." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 26, at 55 (citing United States v. Gigante,166 F. 3d 75, 81 (CA2 1999) ("Because Judge Weinstein employed a two-way system that preserved . . . face-to-faceconfrontation . . . , it is not necessary to enforce the

Craig
standard in this case"), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 1114 (2000)).See

post, at 1167. I cannot comprehend how one-way transmission (which Craig says does not ordinarily satisfy confrontation requirements) becomes transformed into full-fledged confrontation when reciprocal transmission is added.

As we made clear in Craig, supra, at 846-847, a purpose ofthe Confrontation Clause is ordinarily to compel accusers to
make their accusations in the defendant's presence--whichis not equivalent to making them in a room that contains a
television set beaming electrons that portray the defendant'simage. Virtual confrontation might be sufficient to protect
virtual constitutional rights; I doubt whether it is sufficientto protect real ones.

The Committee argues that the proposal is constitutional
because it allows video transmission only where depositionsof unavailable witnesses may be read into evidence pursuant

to Rule 15. This argument suffers from two shortcomings.First, it ignores the fact that the constitutional test we apDate/Time: 09-18-03 12:41:56
Job: 535RUL Unit: U$CR Pagination Table: RULES1

1161STATEMENT OF SCALIA, J.
plied to live testimony in Craig is different from the test
we have applied to the admission of out-of-court statements.
White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 358 (1992) ("There is thus no
basis for importing the `necessity requirement' announced in
[Craig] into the much different context of out-of-court declarations admitted under established exceptions to the hearsay
rule"). Second, it ignores the fact that Rule 15 accords
the defendant a right to face-to-face confrontation during the
deposition. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 15(b) ("The officer having
custody of a defendant shall be notified of the time and place
set for the examination and shall, unless the defendant
waives in writing the right to be present, produce the defendant at the examination and keep the defendant in the
presence of the witness during the examination . . .").

Justice Breyer says that our refusal to transmit "denies
all litigants--prosecutors and consenting defendants alike--
the benefits of advances in modern technology . . . that will
help to create trial procedures that are both more efficient
and more fair." Post, at 1164. This is an exaggeration for
two reasons: First, because Congress is free to adopt the proposal despite our action. And second, because nothing prevents a defendant who believes this procedure is "more efficient and more fair" from voluntarily waiving his right of
confrontation.* The only issue here is whether he can be
compelled to hazard his life, liberty, or property in a criminal teletrial.

Finally, I disagree with Justice Breyer's belief that we
should forward this proposal despite our constitutional
doubts, so that we can "later consider fully any constitutional problem when the Rule is applied in an individual
case." Post, at 1163. I see no more reason for us to for*Justice Breyer's assertion to the contrary notwithstanding, existing
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26 does not prohibit the use of video
transmission by consent. United States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U. S. 196, 201
(1995) ("The provisions of [the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure] are
presumptively waivable [unless] an express waiver clause . . . suggest[s]
that Congress intended to occupy the field and to preclude waiver under
other, unstated circumstances").

1162 DISSENTING STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
ward a proposal that we believe to be of dubious constitu-tionality than there would be for the Conference to make a

proposal that it believed to be of dubious constitutionality.We do not live under a system in which the motto for legislation is "anything goes, and litigation will correct our consti-tutional mistakes." It seems to me that among the reasons
Congress has asked us to vet the Conference's proposals--indeed, perhaps

foremost among those reasons--is to provide
some assurance that the proposals do not raise serious con-stitutional doubts. Congress is of course not bound to accept our judgment, and may adopt the proposed Rule 26(b)
if it wishes. But I think we deprive it of the advice it hassought (in this area peculiarly within judicial competence) if

we pass along recommendations that we believe to be consti-tutionally doubtful.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
filed a dissenting statement.

I would transmit to Congress the Judicial Conference's
proposed Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26(b), author-izing the use of two-way video transmissions in criminal

cases in (1) "exceptional circumstances," with (2) "appro-priate safeguards," and

if (3) "the witness is unavailable."
The Rules Committee intentionally designed the proposed
Rule with its three restrictions to parallel circumstances inwhich federal courts are authorized now to admit depositions

in criminal cases. See Rule 15. Indeed, the Committeestates that its proposal permits "use of video transmission of
testimony only in those instances when deposition testimonycould be used." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 26, p. 53. See Appendix, infra, at 1164.The Court has decided not to transmit the proposed Rule
because, in its view, the proposal raises serious concernsunder the Confrontation Clause. But what are those concerns? It is not obvious how video testimony could abridgea defendant's Confrontation Clause rights in circumstances
where an absent witness' testimony could be admitted in
nonvisual form via deposition regardless. And where the

1163DISSENTING STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
defendant seeks the witness' video testimony to help secureexoneration, the Clause simply does not apply.

Justice Scalia believes that the present proposal doesnot much concern itself with the limitations on the use of
out-of-court statements set forth in Maryland v. Craig, 497U. S. 836 (1990). I read the Committee's discussion differently than does Justice Scalia, and I attach a copy of theCommittee's discussion so that the reader can form an independent judgment. In its five pages of explanation, theCommittee refers to

Maryland v. Craig five times. It begins by stating that "arguably" its test is "at least as stringent as the standard set out in [that case]." It devotes alengthy paragraph to explaining why it believes that its proposal satisfies Craig, and it refers to the two relevant Courtof Appeals decisions, both of which have so held. See
United States v. Gigante, 166 F. 3d 75 (CA2 1999), cert. de-nied, 528 U. S. 1114 (2000);

Harrell v. Butterworth, 251 F. 3d
926 (CA11 2001), cert. denied, 535 U. S. 958 (2002). Giventhe Committee's discussion of the matter, its logic, the legal

authority to which it refers, and the absence of any dissent-ing views, I believe that any constitutional problems will
arise, if at all, only in a limited subset of cases. And, in anyevent, I would not overturn the unanimous views of the
Rules Committee and the Judicial Conference of the United
States without a clearer understanding of just why their con-clusion is wrong. Cf. Statement of Justice White, 507 U. S.

1091, 1095 (1993) (The Court's role ordinarily "is to transmitthe Judicial Conference's recommendations without change
and without careful study, as long as there is no suggestionthat the committee system has not operated with integrity").

To transmit the proposed Rule to Congress is not equiva-lent to upholding the proposed Rule as constitutional. Were
the proposal to become law, the Court could later considerfully any constitutional problem when the Rule is applied in
an individual case. At that point the Court would have the
benefit of the full argument that now is lacking. At the same
time, that approach would permit application of the proposed
Rule in those cases in which application is clearly constituDate/Time: 09-18-03 12:41:56

1164 APPENDIX TO STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
tional. And, while Justice Scalia is correct that Congressis free to consider the matter more deeply and to adopt the

proposal despite our action, the Court's refusal to transmitthe proposed Rule makes full consideration of the constitutional arguments much less likely.Without the proposed Rule, not only prosecutors but also
defendants will find it difficult, if not impossible, to securenecessary out-of-court testimony via two-way video--

Justice Scalia's statement to the contrary notwithstanding.Cf. ante, at 1161. Without proposed Rule 26(b), some courts

may conclude that other Rules prohibit its use. See, e. g.,Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 26 (testimony must "be taken orally
in open court, unless otherwise provided by an Act of Con-gress or by these rules, the Federal Rules of Evidence, or
other Rules adopted by the Supreme Court"). Others mayhesitate to rely on highly general and uncertain sources of
legal authority. Cf. United States v. Gigante, 971 F. Supp.755, 758-759 (EDNY 1997) (relying on court's "inherent
power" to structure a criminal trial in a just manner underRules 2 and 57(b));

United States v. Nippon Paper Indus-tries Co., 17 F. Supp. 2d 38, 43 (Mass. 1998) (relying on

"a constitutional hybrid" procedure that "borrow[ed] fromthe precedent associated with Rule 15 videotaped depositions [and] marr[ied] it to the advantages of video teleconfer-encing"). Thus, rather than consider the constitutional matter in the context of a defendant who objects, the Courtdenies all litigants--prosecutors and consenting defendants
alike--the benefits of advances in modern technology. Andit thereby deprives litigants, judges, and the public of technology that will help to create trial procedures that are bothmore efficient and more fair.

I consequently dissent from the Court's decision not totransmit the proposed Rule.

APPENDIX TO STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
Rule 26. Taking Testimony.

(a) In General.--In every trial the testimony of witnessesmust be taken in open court, unless otherwise provided by

Date/Time: 09-18-03 12:41:56
Job: 535RUL Unit: U$CR Pagination Table: RULES1

1165APPENDIX TO STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
a statute or by rules adopted under 28 U. S. C. $$ 2072-2077.

(b) Transmitting Testimony from a Different Location.In the interest of justice, the court may authorize contemporaneous, two-way video presentation in open court of testi-mony from a witness who is at a different location if:

(1) the requesting party establishes exceptional cir-cumstances for such transmission;
(2) appropriate safeguards for the transmission areused; and
(3) the witness is unavailable within the meaning ofFederal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(4)-(5).

COMMITTEE NOTE
The language of Rule 26 has been amended as part of thegeneral restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more

easily understood and to make style and terminology consist-ent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be
stylistic only, except as noted below.Rule 26(a) is amended, by deleting the word "orally," to
accommodate witnesses who are not able to present oral tes-timony in open court and may need, for example, a sign language interpreter. The change conforms the rule, in thatrespect, to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 43.

A substantive change has been made to Rule 26(b). Thatamendment permits a court to receive the video transmission
of an absent witness if certain conditions are met. As cur-rently written, Rule 26 indicates that normally only testimony given in open court will be considered, unless other-wise provided by these rules, an Act of Congress, or any
other rule adopted by the Supreme Court. An example ofa rule that provides otherwise is Rule 15. That Rule recognizes that depositions may be used to preserve testimony ifthere are exceptional circumstances in the case and it is in
the interest of justice to do so. If the person is "unavail-able" under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a), then the deposition may be used at trial as substantive evidence. Theamendment to Rule 26(b) extends the logic underlying that

Date/Time: 09-18-03 12:41:56
Job: 535RUL Unit: U$CR Pagination Table: RULES1

1166 APPENDIX TO STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
exception to contemporaneous video testimony of an unavail-able witness. The amendment generally parallels a similar

provision in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 43.The Committee believed that permitting use of video
transmission of testimony only in those instances whendeposition testimony could be used is a prudent and measured step. A party against whom a deposition may be intro-duced at trial will normally have no basis for objecting if
contemporaneous testimony is used instead. Indeed, theuse of such transmitted testimony is in most regards superior to other means of presenting testimony in the courtroom. The participants in the courtroom can see for them-selves the demeanor of the witness and hear any pauses in

the testimony, matters that are not normally available in non-video deposition testimony. Although deposition testimony
is normally taken with all counsel and parties present withthe witness, there may be exceptions. See,

e. g., United
States v. Salim, 855 F. 2d 944, 947-948 (2d Cir. 1988) (convic-tion affirmed where deposition testimony, taken overseas,

was used although defendant and her counsel were not per-mitted in same room with witness, witness's lawyer answered some questions, lawyers were not permitted to ques-tion witness directly, and portions of proceedings were not
transcribed verbatim).

The revised rule envisions several safeguards to addresspossible concerns about the Confrontation Clause rights of a

defendant. First, under the rule, the court is authorized touse "contemporaneous two-way" video transmission of testimony. Thus, this rule envisions procedures and techniquesvery different from those used in

Maryland v. Craig, 497
U. S. 836 (1990) (transmission of one-way closed circuit tele-vision of child's testimony). Two-way transmission ensures

that the witness and the persons present in the courtroomwill be able to see and hear each other. Second, the court
must first find that there are "exceptional circumstances" for
using video transmissions, a standard used in United States

cumstances considered to be "exceptional," the inability ofthe defendant and the defense counsel to be at the witness's

location would normally be an exceptional circumstance.Third, arguably the exceptional circumstances test, when
combined with the requirement in Rule 26(b)(3) that the wit-ness be unavailable, is at least as stringent as the standard
set out in Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836 (1990). In thatcase the Court indicated that a defendant's confrontation
rights "may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face con-frontation at trial only where denial of such confrontation is
necessary to further an important government public policy
and only where the reliability of the testimony is otherwiseassured."

Craig, 497 U. S. at 850. In Gigante, the court
noted that because the video system in Craig was a one-wayclosed circuit transmission, the use of a two-way transmission made it unnecessary to apply the Craig standard.The Committee recognized that there is a need for the
trial court to impose appropriate safeguards and proceduresto insure the accuracy and quality of the transmission, the
ability of the jurors to hear and view the testimony, andthe ability of the judge, counsel, and the witness to hear
and understand each other during questioning. See, e. g.,
United States v. Gigante, 166 F. 3d 75 (2d Cir. 1999).

Deciding what safeguards are appropriate is left to the
sound discretion of the trial court. The Committee envi-sions that in establishing those safeguards the court will be

sensitive to a number of key issues. First, it is importantthat the procedure maintain the dignity and decorum normally associated with a federal judicial proceeding. Thatwould normally include ensuring that the witness's testimony is transmitted from a location where there are no, orminimal, background distractions, such as persons leaving
or entering the room. Second, it is important to insure thequality and integrity of the two-way transmission itself.
That will usually mean employment of technologies and
equipment that are proven and reliable. Third, the court
may wish to use a surrogate, such as an assigned marshal or
special master, as used in Gigante, supra, to appear at the

1168 APPENDIX TO STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
witness's location to ensure that the witness is not being in-fluenced from an off-camera source and that the equipment

is working properly at the witness's end of the transmission.Fourth, the court should ensure that the court, counsel, and
jurors can clearly see and hear the witness during the trans-mission. And it is equally important that the witness can
clearly see and hear counsel, the court, and the defendant.Fifth, the court should ensure that the record reflects the
persons who are present at the witness's location. Sixth,the court may wish to require that representatives of the
parties be present at the witness's location. Seventh, the
court may inquire of counsel, on the record, whether addi-tional safeguards might be employed. Eighth, the court

should probably preserve any recording of the testimony,should a question arise about the quality of the transmission.
Finally, the court may consider issuing a pretrial order set-ting out the appropriate safeguards employed under the rule.
See United States v. Gigante, 971 F. Supp. 755, 759-760(E. D. N. Y. 1997) (court order setting out safeguards and
procedures).The Committee believed that including the requirement
of "unavailability" as that term is defined in Federal Rule ofEvidence 804(a)(4) and (5) will insure that the defendant's
Confrontation Clause rights are not infringed. In deciding
whether to permit contemporaneous transmission of the tes-timony of a government witness, the Supreme Court's decision in Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836 (1990) is instructive.In that case, the prosecution presented the testimony of a
child sexual assault victim from another room by one-wayclosed circuit television. The Court outlined four elements
that underlie Confrontation Clause issues: (1) physical pres-ence; (2) the oath; (3) cross-examination; and (4) the opportunity for the trier-of-fact to observe the witness's demeanor.
Id., at 847. The Court rejected the notion that a defendant's
Confrontation Clause rights could be protected only if all
four elements were present. The trial court had explicitly
concluded that the procedure was necessary to protect the
child witness, i. e., the witness was psychologically unavailDate/Time: 09-18-03 12:41:56

1169APPENDIX TO STATEMENT OF BREYER, J.
able to testify in open court. The Supreme Court noted thatany harm to the defendant resulting from the transmitted

testimony was minimal because the defendant received mostof the protections contemplated by the Confrontation Clause,
i. e., the witness was under oath, counsel could cross-examinethe absent witness, and the jury could observe the demeanor
of the witness. See also United States v. Gigante, supra(use of remote transmission of unavailable witness's testimony did not violate confrontation clause); Harrell v. Butter-worth, [251] F. 3d [926] (11th Cir. 2001) (remote transmission
of unavailable witnesses' testimony in state criminal trial didnot violate confrontation clause).

Although the amendment is not limited to instances suchas those encountered in

Craig, it is limited to situations whenthe witness is unavailable for any of the reasons set out in

Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(4) and (5). Whether underparticular circumstances a proposed transmission will satisfy
some, or all, of the four protective factors identified by theSupreme Court in Craig is a decision left to the trial court.

The amendment provides an alternative to the use ofdepositions, which are permitted under Rule 15. The choice
between these two alternatives for presenting the testimonyof an otherwise unavailable witness will be influenced by the
individual circumstances of each case, the available technol-ogy, and the extent to which each alternative serves the values protected by the Confrontation Clause. See Marylandv.

Craig, supra.

(1) In general.--As soon as practicable after a verdict orfinding of guilty, or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere

is accepted, on any count in an indictment or informationregarding which criminal forfeiture is sought, the court must
determine what property is subject to forfeiture under theapplicable statute. If the government seeks forfeiture of
specific property, the court must determine whether the government has established the requisite nexus between theproperty and the offense. If the government seeks a personal money judgment, the court must determine the amountof money that the defendant will be ordered to pay. The
court's determination may be based on evidence already inthe record, including any written plea agreement or, if the
forfeiture is contested, on evidence or information presentedby the parties at a hearing after the verdict or finding of
guilt.(

2) Preliminary order.--If the court finds that property
is subject to forfeiture, it must promptly enter a preliminaryorder of forfeiture setting forth the amount of any money

judgment or directing the forfeiture of specific property
without regard to any third party's interest in all or part ofit. Determining whether a third party has such an interest

must be deferred until any third party files a claim in anancillary proceeding under Rule 32.2(c).

(3) Seizing property.--The entry of a preliminary order offorfeiture authorizes the Attorney General (or a designee) to
seize the specific property subject to forfeiture; to conductany discovery the court considers proper in identifying,
locating, or disposing of the property; and to commenceproceedings that comply with any statutes governing thirdparty rights. At sentencing--or at any time before sentencing if the defendant consents--the order of forfeiture becomes final as to the defendant and must be made a part of
the sentence and be included in the judgment. The court

Date/Time: 05-14-03 20:34:48

1234 RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
may include in the order of forfeiture conditions reasonablynecessary to preserve the property's value pending any

appeal.

(4) Jury determination.--Upon a party's request in a case
in which a jury returns a verdict of guilty, the jury must
determine whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense committed
by the defendant.

(c) Ancill ary proceeding; enter ing a final order of
forfeiture.

(1) In general.--If, as prescribed by statute, a third party
files a petition asserting an interest in the property to be
forfeited, the court must conduct an ancillary proceeding, but
no ancillary proceeding is required to the extent that the
forfeiture consists of a money judgment.

(A) In the ancillary proceeding, the court may, on motion, dismiss the petition for lack of standing, for failure
to state a claim, or for any other lawful reason. For
purposes of the motion, the facts set forth in the petition
are assumed to be true.

(B) After disposing of any motion filed under Rule
32.2(c)(1)(A) and before conducting a hearing on the petition, the court may permit the parties to conduct discovery in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the court determines that discovery is necessary
or desirable to resolve factual issues. When discovery
ends, a party may move for summary judgment under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.

(2) Entering a final order.--When the ancillary proceeding ends, the court must enter a final order of forfeiture by
amending the preliminary order as necessary to account for
any third-party rights. If no third party files a timely petition, the preliminary order becomes the final order of forfeiture if the court finds that the defendant (or any combination
of defendants convicted in the case) had an interest in the
property that is forfeitable under the applicable statute.
The defendant may not object to the entry of the final order

Date/Time: 05-14-03 20:34:48
Job: 535RUL Unit: UTCR Pagination Table: RULES1

1235RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
on the ground that the property belongs, in whole or in part,
to a codefendant or third party; nor may a third party object to the final order on the ground that the third party had
an interest in the property.

(3) Multiple petitions.--If multiple third-party petitions
are filed in the same case, an order dismissing or granting
one petition is not appealable until rulings are made on all
the petitions, unless the court determines that there is no
just reason for delay.

(4) Ancillary proceeding not part of sentencing.--An ancillary proceeding is not part of sentencing.

(d) Stay pending appeal.--If a defendant appeals from a
conviction or an order of forfeiture, the court may stay the
order of forfeiture on terms appropriate to ensure that the
property remains available pending appellate review. A
stay does not delay the ancillary proceeding or the determination of a third party's rights or interests. If the court
rules in favor of any third party while an appeal is pending,
the court may amend the order of forfeiture but must not
transfer any property interest to a third party until the decision on appeal becomes final, unless the defendant consents
in writing or on the record.

(e) Subsequently located property; substitute property.
(1) In general.--On the government's motion, the court
may at any time enter an order of forfeiture or amend an
existing order of forfeiture to include property that:

(A) is subject to forfeiture under an existing order of
forfeiture but was located and identified after that order
was entered; or

(B) is substitute property that qualifies for forfeiture
under an applicable statute.

(2) Procedure.--If the government shows that the property is subject to forfeiture under Rule 32.2(e)(1), the court
must:

(A) enter an order forfeiting that property, or amend
an existing preliminary or final order to include it; and

under Rule 32.2(e).

Rule 33. New trial.

(a) Defendant's motion.--Upon the defendant's motion,
the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trialif the interest of justice so requires. If the case was tried

without a jury, the court may take additional testimony andenter a new judgment.

(b) Time to file.(

1) Newly discovered evidence.--Any motion for a new
trial grounded on newly discovered evidence must be filed
within 3 years after the verdict or finding of guilty. If anappeal is pending, the court may not grant a motion for a

new trial until the appellate court remands the case.(

2) Other grounds.--Any motion for a new trial grounded
on any reason other than newly discovered evidence must befiled within 7 days after the verdict or finding of guilty, or

within such further time as the court sets during the 7-dayperiod.

Rule 34. Arresting judgment.

(a) In general.--Upon the defendant's motion or on its
own, the court must arrest judgment if:

(1) the indictment or information does not charge anoffense; or

(2) the court does not have jurisdicti on of the
charged offense.

(B) reducing the sentence accords with the Sentencing Commission's guidelines and policy statements.

(2) Later motion.--Upon the government's motion made
more than one year after sentencing, the court may reduce
a sentence if the defendant's substantial assistance involved:

(A) information not known to the defendant until one
year or more after sentencing;

(B) information provided by the defendant to the government within one year of sentencing, but which did
not become useful to the government until more than
one year after sentencing; or

(C) information the usefulness of which could not reasonably have been anticipated by the defendant until
more than one year after sentencing and which was
promptly provided to the government after its usefulness was reasonably apparent to the defendant.

whether the defendant has provided substantial assistance,
the court may consider the defendant's presentence
assistance.

35(b), the court may reduce the sentence to a level below the

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICEIN CHAMBERS
BARTLETT et al. v. STEPHENSON et al.

on application for stay
No. 01A848. Decided May 17, 2002
The application of North Carolina officials to stay a State Supreme Court

decision invalidating the 2001 state legislative redistricting plan under
the State Constitution is denied. That court held that the plan violated
a state constitutional provision that does not allow a county to be divided when forming a senate or representative district. Harmonizing
that provision with federal law, the court found that any new plan must
preserve county lines except to the extent counties must be divided to
comply with the United States Constitution and the Voting Rights Act.
Applicants, who claim that a 1981 Department of Justice (DOJ) letter
bars any consideration of the whole county provision in redistricting, do
not satisfy the threshold requirement for the issuance of a stay. It is
unlikely that four Members of this Court will vote to grant certiorari to
resolve a dispute about the meaning of a single DOJ letter. This issue
does not satisfy any of the criteria for the exercise of the Court's discretionary jurisdiction. And this case does not present the same situation
as Lopez v. Monterey County, 519 U. S. 9, 19, 21, and Clark v. Roemer,
500 U. S. 646, 654-655, in which this Court issued stays enjoining a covered jurisdiction from conducting imminent elections under an unprecleared voting plan.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.
Applicants, North Carolina officials charged with administering the State's elections, seek a stay of a decision of the
Supreme Court of North Carolina invalidating North Carolina's 2001 state legislative redistricting plan under the North
Carolina Constitution. The application is denied.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina held that the 2001
plan violated what is known as the "whole county provision"
of the North Carolina Constitution, which provides that "no

Opinion in Chambers
county shall be divided in the formation of a senate or representative district," N. C. Const., Art. II, $ 3(3). See 355
N. C. 354, 363, 562 S. E. 2d 377, 384 (2002). The court thus
affirmed a lower court injunction enjoining applicants from
conducting any elections under the 2001 plan and ordered
that a new plan be drawn. Id., at 359-360, 386, 562 S. E.
2d, at 382, 398. The court directed the state trial court to
conduct a hearing on whether it is feasible for the state legislature to develop a new plan for the 2002 elections. If it is
not, then the trial court is directed to solicit plans and adopt
one. Id., at 385, 562 S. E. 2d, at 398.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina recognized, however, that requirements of federal law will preclude the new
plan from giving full effect to the "whole county provision."
Id., at 371, 381, 562 S. E. 2d, at 389, 396. The court therefore
"harmonized" the state constitutional provision with federal
law, ordering that the new plan "must preserve county lines
to the maximum extent possible, except to the extent counties must be divided to comply with Section 5 of the Voting
Rights Act [of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973c (1994 ed.)], and to comply with Section 2 of the Voting
Rights Act, and to comply with the U. S. Constitution, including the federal one-person one-vote requirements." Id., at
359, 562 S. E. 2d, at 382. The court cited decisions in four
other States that have reconciled similar county boundary
requirements with federal law. Id., at 372, n. 3, 562 S. E.
2d, at 390, n. 3 (citing In re Apportionment of Colo. Gen. Assembly, 45 P. 3d 1237 (Colo. 2002); Hellar v. Cenarrusa, 106
Idaho 571, 574-575, 682 P. 2d 524, 527-528 (1984); Fischer
v. State Bd. of Elections, 879 S. W. 2d 475, 479 (Ky. 1994); State
ex rel. Lockert v. Crowell, 631 S. W. 2d 702, 714-715 (Tenn.
1982)). And the Supreme Court of North Carolina ordered
that the trial court shall seek preclearance of the new plan,
with respect to the districts in the 40 North Carolina counties that are covered jurisdictions under $ 5 of the Voting

Opinion in Chambers
Rights Act, before elections are held. 355 N. C., at 385, 562
S. E. 2d, at 398.

Applicants contend that a stay is warranted because the
Supreme Court of North Carolina's decision "defies the Voting Rights Act" and directs applicants "to violate the Voting
Rights Act and to administer or enforce unprecleared state
constitutional provisions." Application 13, 20. In support
of these assertions, applicants rely on a 1981 Department
of Justice (DOJ) letter that objected to the "whole county
provision." In 1981, North Carolina submitted both its 1981
redistricting plan, which was faithful to the "whole county
provision," and the "whole county provision" itself to the
DOJ. The DOJ objected to both, stating that it was "unable
to conclude that this amendment, prohibiting the division of
counties in reapportionments, does not have a discriminatory
purpose or effect." App. 2 to Application 1. The letter also
stated that "until the objection is withdrawn or [a] judgment
from the [United States District Court for the] District of
Columbia is obtained, the effect of the objection by the
Attorney General is to make the [whole county provision]
legally unenforceable." Id., at 2.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina rejected applicants'
view that this letter bars any consideration of the whole
county provision in redistricting. In its view, other statements in the letter demonstrate that the letter "merely disallows a redistricting plan that adheres strictly to a `whole
county' criterion without complying with the [Voting Rights
Act]." 355 N. C., at 374, 562 S. E. 2d, at 391. The court
quoted the following statement from the DOJ letter: " `This
determination with respect to the jurisdictions covered by
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act should in no way be regarded as precluding the State from following a policy of
preserving county lines whenever feasible in formulating
its new districts. Indeed, this is the policy in many states,
subject only to the preclearance requirements of Section 5,

535US2IC1H 09-11-03 14:24:48 PAGES IC13PGT
1304 BARTLETT v. STEPHENSON

Opinion in Chambers
where applicable.' " Id., at 372-373, 562 S. E. 2d, at 390.
The court thought this interpretation of the letter consistent
with DOJ administrative guidance that provides " `criteria
which require the jurisdiction to . . . follow county, city, or
precinct boundaries . . . may need to give way to some degree
to avoid retrogression.' " Id., at 373, 562 S. E. 2d, at 391
(quoting 66 Fed. Reg. 5413 (2001)) (emphasis added).

A "single Justice will grant a stay only in extraordinary
circumstances." Whalen v. Roe, 423 U. S. 1313, 1316 (Marshall, J., in chambers). Applicants do not satisfy the threshold requirement for the issuance of a stay. There is not a
reasonable probability that four Members of this Court will
vote to grant certiorari to resolve what is largely a dispute
about the meaning of a single DOJ letter from 1981. See
Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U. S. 1301, 1304 (1988) (Kennedy, J.,
in chambers). This issue, which has few if any ramifications
beyond the instant case, does not satisfy any of the criteria
for the exercise of this Court's discretionary jurisdiction.
See this Court's Rule 10.

Applicants cite two cases in which the Court issued stays
enjoining a covered jurisdiction from conducting imminent
elections "under an unprecleared voting plan." Lopez v.
Monterey County, 519 U. S. 9, 19, 21 (1996); Clark v. Roemer,
500 U. S. 646, 654-655 (1991). This case does not present
the same situation. The Supreme Court of North Carolina
ordered that the new plan would have to be precleared before elections could be held in the 40 covered counties. On
remand, the trial court has already made clear its understanding of this requirement, issuing an order stating that
"[n]o plan submitted by the General Assembly and approved
by this Court, or in the absence of such a plan, no plan
adopted by the Court, shall be administered in the 2002 elections until such time as it is precleared pursuant to Section
5 of the Voting Rights Act." App. 13 to Response in Opposition 3. As there is no plan in North Carolina to hold elec535US2IC1H 09-11-03 14:24:48 PAGES IC13PGT

tions in unprecleared districts, there are no grounds forgranting a stay. The stay application is denied.

1. Child Online Protection Act--Harmful to minors--Community
standards.--Act's reliance on "community standards" to identify what
World Wide Web material "is harmful to minors" does not by itself render
statute substantially overbroad for First Amendment purposes. Ashcroft
v. American Civil Liberties Union, p. 564.

2. Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996--Virtual pornography.--
Act's provisions prohibiting "any visual depiction" that "is, or appears to
be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct," as well as any sexually explicit image "advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression" it depicts a minor
engaging in such conduct, are overbroad and therefore violate First
Amendment. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, p. 234.

3. City ordinance--Ban on multiple-use adult entertainment establishments.--Ninth Circuit's judgment striking down a Los Angeles ordinance that bans multiple-use adult entertainment establishments under
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, is reversed. Los Angeles
v. Alameda Books, Inc., p. 425.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.

4. Commercial speech--Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997.--Act's prohibitions on soliciting prescriptions for, and
advertising, compounded drugs are unconstitutional restrictions on commercial speech violative of First Amendment. Thompson v. Western
States Medical Center, p. 357.

III. Right to Counsel.

1. Conflict of interest--Trial court's inquiry.--In order to demonstrate
a Sixth Amendment violation where trial court fails to inquire into defense
counsel's potential conflict of interest about which court knew or reasonably should have known, defendant must establish that conflict adversely
affected counsel's performance. Mickens v. Taylor, p. 162.

2. Effective assistance of counsel--Sentencing hearing.--Respondent's
claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during his sentencing hearing was governed by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.
Bell v. Cone, p. 685.

3. Misdemeanor offense punishable by incarceration--Suspended sentence.--Under Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, 40, a suspended sentence that may end up in actual deprivation of a person's liberty may not
be imposed unless defendant was accorded "guiding hand of counsel" in
prosecution for crime charged. Alabama v. Shelton, p. 654.

IV. States' Immunity from Suit.

1. Federal Maritime Commission suit--Private party's complaint.--
State sovereign immunity bars Commission from adjudicating a private
party's complaint against a nonconsenting State. Federal Maritime
Comm'n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, p. 743.

2. Telecommunications regulation--Suit against state public utilities
commissions.--Doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, permits telecommunication carrier's suit--which claims that state public utility commission's order requiring reciprocal compensation for telephone calls to
Internet service providers is pre-empted by federal law--to go forward
against state commissioners in their official capacities. Verizon Md. Inc.
v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Md., p. 635.

3. Waiver of immunity--Effect of removal.--A State waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity when it removes a case from state court to
federal court. Lapides v. Board of Regents of Univ. System of Ga., p. 613.

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure--Withdrawal of guilty plea--
Trial court's Rule 11 error.--A defendant who does not object to a trial
court's error under Rule 11--which lays out steps a judge must take to
ensure a knowing and voluntary guilty plea--must satisfy Rule 52(b)'s
plain-error rule in order to withdraw a guilty plea; a reviewing court may
look beyond plea colloquy to whole record in determining whether defendant's substantial rights were affected by Rule 11 error. United States v.

Validity of Labor Department regulation--Failure to inform employee
of rights.--Regulation requiring an employer to grant an additional 12
weeks' leave to an employee because it did not inform employee that a

2. Recusal--Judge's name associated with similar suit.--In this
tobacco-products liability case, District Judge, whose name appeared erroneously, prior to his appointment to bench, on a motion to file an amicus

electricity costs when billing their retail consumers to transmit competitors' electricity over their lines on same terms that utilities apply to their
own transmissions; and FERC's decision not to impose that requirement
on utilities offering only "bundled" retail sales was a permissible policy
choice. New York v. FERC, p. 1.

2. Federal courts--Telecommunications regulation--State public utility commission order.--Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 provides a basis for federalcourt jurisdiction over a telecommunication carrier's claim that a state
public utility commission's order requiring reciprocal compensation for
telephone calls to Internet Service Providers is pre-empted by federal law.
