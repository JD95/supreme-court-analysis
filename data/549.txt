CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT

OCTOBER TERM, 2006

PURCELL et al. v. GONZALEZ et al.

on application for stay
No. 06A375 (06-532). Decided October 20, 2006*
Plaintiffs below, Arizona residents, Indian tribes, and community groups,

brought suit in federal court challenging the State's new voter identification requirements. The District Court denied their request for a preliminary injunction but issued no findings of fact or conclusions of law
at that time. When, on appeal, plaintiffs received a briefing schedule
concluding after the November election, they sought an injunction pending appeal, which the Ninth Circuit granted without explanation. Subsequently, the District Court issued its findings of fact and conclusions
of law.

Held: There is no indication that the Ninth Circuit gave the necessary

deference to the discretion of the District Court, and this was error.
By failing to provide any factual findings or reasoning of its own, the
Ninth Circuit left this Court in the position of evaluating the Circuit's
bare order in light of the District Court's ultimate findings, which have
not been shown to be incorrect. While this Court expresses no opinion
on the correct disposition of the appeals or ultimate resolution of the
cases, vacating the Ninth Circuit's order shall of necessity allow the
election to proceed without an injunction suspending the requirements.

Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.

*Together with No. 06A379 (06-533), Arizona et al. v. Gonzalez et al.,
also on application for stay.

2 PURCELL v. GONZALEZ

Per Curiam
Per Curiam.
The State of Arizona and county officials from four of itscounties seek relief from an interlocutory injunction entered

by a two-judge motions panel of the Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit.

Justice Kennedy has referred the appli-cants' filings to the Court. We construe the filings of the

State and the county officials as petitions for certiorari; wegrant the petitions; and we vacate the order of the Court
of Appeals. I

In 2004, Arizona voters approved Proposition 200. Themeasure sought to combat voter fraud by requiring voters
to present proof of citizenship when they register to voteand to present identification when they vote on election day.

The election procedures implemented to effect Proposition200 do not necessarily result in the turning away of qualified,
registered voters by election officials for lack of proper iden-tification. A voter who arrives at the polls on election day
without identification may cast a conditional provisional bal-lot. For that ballot to be counted, the voter is allowed five
business days to return to a designated site and presentproper identification. In addition any voter who knows he
or she cannot secure identification within five business daysof the election has the option to vote before election day
during the early voting period. The State has determinedthat, because there is adequate time during the early voting
period to compare the voters' signatures on the ballot withtheir signatures on the registration rolls, voters need not
present identification if voting early.Arizona is a covered jurisdiction under $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. So it was required to preclear any newvoting "standard, practice, or procedure" with either the
United States Attorney General or the District Court for theDistrict of Columbia to ensure its new voting policy did "not
have the purpose [or] effect of denying or abridging the rightto vote on account of race or color," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. See

Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 461-462 (2003). OnMay 6, 2005, the United States Attorney General precleared

the procedures Arizona adopted under Proposition 200.In the District Court the plaintiffs in this action are residents of Arizona, Indian tribes, and various community orga-nizations. In May 2006, these plaintiffs brought suit challenging Proposition 200's identification requirements. On
September 11, 2006, the District Court denied their requestfor a preliminary injunction, but it did not at that time issue

findings of fact or conclusions of law. These findings wereimportant because resolution of legal questions in the Court
of Appeals required evaluation of underlying factual issues.

The plaintiffs appealed the denial, and the Clerk of the
Court of Appeals set a briefing schedule that concluded on
November 21, two weeks after the upcoming November 7
election. The plaintiffs then requested an injunction pending appeal from the Court of Appeals. Pursuant to the
Court of Appeals' rules, the request for an injunction was
assigned to a two-judge motions/screening panel. See Rule
3-3 (CA9 2002). On October 5, after receiving lengthy written responses from the State and the county officials but
without oral argument, the panel issued a four-sentence
order enjoining Arizona from enforcing Proposition 200's
provisions pending disposition, after full briefing, of the appeals of the denial of a preliminary injunction. The Court of
Appeals offered no explanation or justification for its order.
Four days later, the court denied a motion for reconsideration. The order denying the motion likewise gave no rationale for the court's decision.

Despite the time-sensitive nature of the proceedings and
the pendency of a request for emergency relief in the Court
of Appeals, the District Court did not issue its findings of
fact and conclusions of law until October 12. It then concluded that "plaintiffs have shown a possibility of success on
the merits of some of their arguments but the Court cannot
say that at this stage they have shown a strong likelihood."

public interest counseled in favor of denying the injunction.

"A State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserv-ing the integrity of its election process."

Eu v. San Fran-cisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231

(1989). Confidence in the integrity of our electoral proc-esses is essential to the functioning of our participatory
democracy. Voter fraud drives honest citizens out of thedemocratic process and breeds distrust of our government.
Voters who fear their legitimate votes will be outweighedby fraudulent ones will feel disenfranchised. "[T]he right of
suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of theweight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise." Reynolds v.Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 555 (1964). Countering the State's compelling interest in preventing voter fraud is the plaintiffs'strong interest in exercising the "fundamental political
right" to vote. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336 (1972)(internal quotation marks omitted). Although the likely effects of Proposition 200 are much debated, the possibilitythat qualified voters might be turned away from the polls
would caution any district judge to give careful considerationto the plaintiffs' challenges.

Faced with an application to enjoin operation of voteridentification procedures just weeks before an election, the
Court of Appeals was required to weigh, in addition to the
harms attendant upon issuance or nonissuance of an injunc-tion, considerations specific to election cases and its own

institutional procedures. Court orders affecting elections,
especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter

Per Curiam
confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the
polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.
So the Court of Appeals may have deemed this consideration
to be grounds for prompt action. Furthermore, it might
have given some weight to the possibility that the nonprevailing parties would want to seek en banc review. In the
Ninth Circuit that procedure, involving voting by all active
judges and an en banc hearing by a court of 15, can consume
further valuable time. These considerations, however, cannot be controlling here. It was still necessary, as a procedural matter, for the Court of Appeals to give deference to
the discretion of the District Court. We find no indication
that it did so, and we conclude this was error.

Although at the time the Court of Appeals issued its order
the District Court had not yet made factual findings to which
the Court of Appeals owed deference, see Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 52(a), by failing to provide any factual findings or indeed any reasoning of its own the Court of Appeals left this
Court in the position of evaluating the Court of Appeals'
bare order in light of the District Court's ultimate findings.
There has been no explanation given by the Court of Appeals
showing the ruling and findings of the District Court to be
incorrect. In view of the impending election, the necessity
for clear guidance to the State of Arizona, and our conclusion
regarding the Court of Appeals' issuance of the order we
vacate the order of the Court of Appeals.

We underscore that we express no opinion here on the
correct disposition, after full briefing and argument, of the
appeals from the District Court's September 11 order or on
the ultimate resolution of these cases. As we have noted,
the facts in these cases are hotly contested, and "[n]o bright
line separates permissible election-related regulation from
unconstitutional infringements." Timmons v. Twin Cities
Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 359 (1997). Given the imminence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve the

Stevens, J., concurring
factual disputes, our action today shall of necessity allow theelection to proceed without an injunction suspending the

voter identification rules.The order of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cases
are remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion. Pursuant to this Court's Rule 45.3, the Clerk is
directed to issue the judgment in these cases forthwith.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
Allowing the election to proceed without enjoining thestatutory provisions at issue will provide the courts with a

better record on which to judge their constitutionality. Atleast two important factual issues remain largely unresolved:
the scope of the disenfranchisement that the novel identifi-cation requirements will produce, and the prevalence and
character of the fraudulent practices that allegedly justifythose requirements. Given the importance of the constitutional issues, the Court wisely takes action that will enhancethe likelihood that they will be resolved correctly on the
basis of historical facts rather than speculation.

a  "reasonable  probability"  that  the  jury  did  not  consider  evidence  of 
respondent's future potential.  414 F. 3d 1094, 1138.  Pp. 14-24. 

(1)  The  Circuit  adopted  a  narrow  and  unrealistic  interpretation  of 
factor  (k),  ruling  that "this  instruction allows  the  jury to consider evi-
dence  that  bears  upon  the  commission  of  the  crime  by  the  defendant 
and  excuses  or  mitigates  his  culpability  for  the  offense,"  414  F.  3d,  at 
1134.  As  Boyde  and Payton explain,  the  jury  is  directed  "to  consider 
any  other  circumstance  that  might  excuse  the  crime."  Boyde,  supra, 
at  382.  Just  as precrime  background and  character (Boyde) and  post-
crime  rehabilitation  (Payton)  may  "extenuat[e]  the  gravity  of  the 
crime," so may some likelihood of future good conduct count as a circum-
stance tending to make a defendant less deserving of the death penalty. 
The  Ninth  Circuit  failed  to  heed  the  full  import  of  Payton's  holding, 
which  is  significant  even  where  AEDPA  is  inapplicable.  Moreover, 
since  respondent  sought  to  extrapolate  future  behavior  from  precrime 
conduct, his mitigation theory was more analogous to the good-character 
evidence Boyde found to fall within factor (k)'s purview.  Pp. 15-16. 

(2)  This Court's interpretation of factor (k) is the one most consist-
ent  with  the  evidence  presented  to  the  jury,  the  parties'  closing  argu-
ments,  and  the  trial  court's  other  instructions.  It  is  improbable  that 
the jury believed that the parties were engaged in an exercise in futility 
when respondent presented extensive forward-looking evidence in open 
court.  Both prosecution and defense arguments assumed the evidence 
was  relevant.  The  prosecutor's  remarks  that  the  evidence  was  weak 
and  his  opinion  about  the  weight  it  should  be  given  confirmed  to  the 
jury that it should analyze respondent's future potential.  Respondent's 
personal pleas were  consistent with a trial in which the jury would as-
sess his future prospects in determining what sentence to impose.  This 
analysis is confirmed by defense counsel's closing arguments.  The trial 
court's other instructions make it quite implausible that the jury would 
deem itself foreclosed from considering respondent's full case in mitiga-
tion.  The  judge  told  the  jury  to  consider  all  of  the  evidence,  which 
included respondent's forward-looking mitigation case.  The sharp con-
trast  between  the  aggravation  instruction  (only  enumerated  factors 
could be considered) and the mitigation one (listed factors were merely 
examples)  also  made  clear  that  the  jury  was  to  take  a  broad  view  of 
mitigating  evidence.  In  concluding  otherwise,  the  Ninth  Circuit  cited 
juror  queries  as  evidence  of  confusion.  Assuming  that  interpretation 
is  correct,  the  court's  conclusion  that  a  juror  likely  ignored  forward-
looking evidence presupposes what it purports to establish, namely, that 
forward-looking evidence could not fall within factor (k).  Pp. 16-24.

be sentenced to death.  The issue before us concerns a jury instruction in the sentencing phase. 

The  trial  court,  following  the  statute  then  in  effect,  di-rected  the  jury,  with  other  instructions  and  in  a  context  to 
be  discussed  in  more  detail,  to  consider  certain  specific  fac-tors  either  as  aggravating  or  mitigating.  The  trial  court 
further  instructed  the  jury  to  consider  "[a]ny  other  circum-
stance  which  extenuates  the  gravity  of  the  crime  even though  it  is  not  a  legal  excuse  for  the  crime."  App.  184. 

Under  the  then-applicable  statutory  scheme  this  general  or catchall factor was codified at Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.3(k) 
(West 1988); and it is referred to as "factor (k)." 

Belmontes  contended,  on  direct  review,  in  state  collateral 
proceedings,  and  in  the  federal  habeas  proceedings  giving 
rise  to  this  case,  that  factor  (k)  and  the  trial  court's  other 
instructions  barred  the  jury  from  considering  his  forward-
looking  mitigation  evidence--specifically  evidence  that  he 
likely  would  lead  a  constructive  life  if  incarcerated  instead 
of  executed.  The  alleged  limitation,  in  his  view,  prevented 
the  jury  from  considering  relevant  mitigation  evidence,  in 
violation of his Eighth Amendment right to present all miti-
gating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.  See, e. g., 
Penry v.  Johnson, 532 U. S. 782, 797 (2001); Skipper v.  South 
Carolina,  476  U. S.  1,  4-5,  8  (1986);  Eddings  v.  Oklahoma, 
455  U. S.  104,  112  (1982).  The  California  Supreme  Court, 
affirming  the  judgment  and  sentence,  rejected  this  conten-
tion  and  other  challenges.  People  v.  Belmontes,  45  Cal.  3d 
744, 799-802, 819, 755 P. 2d 310, 341-343, 355 (1988). 

In  February  1994,  after  exhausting  state  remedies,  re-
spondent  filed  an  amended  federal  habeas  petition.  The 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Cali-
fornia  denied  relief,  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  140a-141a,  145a, 
but  a  divided  panel  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, Belmontes v. 
Woodford,  350  F.  3d  861,  908  (2003).  Over  the  dissent  of 
eight judges, the Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.

Opinion of the Court 
Belmontes  v.  Woodford,  359  F.  3d  1079  (2004).  This  Court granted  certiorari,  vacated the  judgment,  and remanded for 

further  consideration  in  light  of  Brown  v.  Payton, 544  U. S. 133  (2005).  Brown  v.  Belmontes,  544  U. S.  945  (2005).  On 
remand,  a  divided  panel  again  invalidated  respondent's  sen-tence; it distinguished Payton on the grounds that the Anti-
terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, though applicable in that case, does not apply 
here.  Belmontes v.  Brown, 414 F. 3d 1094, 1101-1102 (2005). Over yet another dissent, the Court of Appeals again denied 
rehearing  en  banc.  Belmontes  v.  Stokes,  427  F.  3d  663 (2005).  We  granted  certiorari,  547  U. S.  1110  (2006),  and 
now reverse.  I 

The  evidence  at  trial  showed  that  in  March  1981,  while burglarizing  a  home  where  two  accomplices  had  attended 
a  party,  respondent  unexpectedly  encountered  19-year-old Steacy  McConnell.  Respondent  killed  her  by  striking  her 
head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar.  Respondent had  armed  himself  with  the  dumbbell  bar  before  entering 
the  victim's  home.  See  Belmontes,  supra,  at  760-764,  755 P. 2d, at 315-317. 

In  the  sentencing  phase  of  his  trial  Belmontes  introduced mitigating evidence  to show, 

inter  alia, that he would make positive contributions to society in a structured prison envi-

ronment.  Respondent testified that, during a previous term under the California Youth Authority (CYA), he had behaved 
in  a  constructive  way,  working  his  way  to  the  number  two position  on  a  fire  crew  in  the  CYA  fire  camp  in  which  he 
was incarcerated.  App. 44-45, 53.  About that time he had embraced Christianity and entered into a Christian sponsor-
ship program.  He  admitted  that initially  he participated  in this  program  to  spend  time  away  from  the  camp.  Later, 
after  forming  a  good  relationship  with  the  married  couple who  were  his  Christian  sponsors,  he  pursued  a  more  reli-
gious life and was baptized.  Although his religious commit-

Opinion of the Court 
ment lapsed upon his release from the CYA, he testified that he  would  once  again  turn  to  religion  whenever  he  could  re-

dedicate  himself  fully  to  it.  Id.,  at  46-48,  53-55.  Finally, he  answered  in  the  affirmative  when  asked  if  he  was  "pre-
pared to contribute in anyway [he] can to society if [he was] put in prison for the rest of [his] life."  Id., at 58. 

Respondent's  former  CYA  chaplain  testified  at  the  sen-tencing hearing that respondent's conversion appeared genu-
ine.  The  chaplain,  describing  respondent  as  "salvageable," expressed  hope  that  respondent  would  contribute  to  prison 
ministries if given a life sentence.  Id., at 79-83.  An assist-ant  chaplain  similarly  testified  that,  based  on  past  experi-
ence,  respondent  likely  would  be  adept  at  counseling  other prisoners to avoid the mistakes he had made when they leave 
prison.  Id., at 95-96.  And respondent's Christian sponsors testified  he  was  like  a  son  to  them  and  had  been  a  positive 
influence on their own son.  They also indicated he had par-ticipated  in  various  activities  at  their  church. 

Id.,  at  99- 103, 110-114. 

After  respondent  presented  his  mitigating  evidence,  the parties made closing arguments discussing respondent's miti-
gating  evidence  and  how  the  jury  should  consider  it.  Re-spondent  was  also  allowed  to  provide  his  own  statement. 
The trial judge included in his instructions the disputed fac-tor (k) language, an instruction that has since been amended, 
see Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.85(k) (2005). 

II 
In two earlier cases this Court considered a constitutional challenge  to  the  factor  (k)  instruction.  See  Brown  v.  Pay-

ton,  supra;  Boyde  v.  California,  494  U. S.  370  (1990).  In Boyde,  the  Court  rejected  a  claim  that  factor  (k),  with  its 
focus  on  circumstances  " `extenuat[ing]  the  gravity  of  the crime, ' " precluded consideration of mitigating evidence 
unrelated  to  the  crime,  such  as  evidence  of  the  defend-ant's  background  and  character. 

Id.,  at  377-378,  386.  The

Opinion of the Court 
"proper inquiry," the Court explained, "is whether there is a 
reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged 
instruction  in  a  way  that  prevents  the  consideration  of  con-
stitutionally  relevant  evidence."  Id.,  at  380.  Since  the  de-
fendant  in  Boyde  "had  an  opportunity  through  factor  (k)  to 
argue that his background and character `extenuated' or `ex-
cused' the seriousness of the crime," the Court saw "no rea-
son  to  believe  that  reasonable  jurors  would  resist  the  view, 
`long  held  by  society,'  that  in  an  appropriate  case  such  evi-
dence  would  counsel  imposition  of  a  sentence  less  than 
death."  Id.,  at 382  (citing  Penry v.  Lynaugh,  492  U. S. 302, 
319  (1989)).  During  the  sentencing  phase  in  Boyde,  more-
over,  the  defense  had  presented  extensive  evidence  regard-
ing  background  and  character,  so  construing  factor  (k)  to 
preclude consideration of that evidence would have required 
the  jurors  not  only  to  believe  that  "the  court's  instructions 
transformed  all  of  this  `favorable  testimony  into  a  virtual 
charade,' "  494  U. S.,  at  383  (quoting  California  v.  Brown, 
479  U. S.  538,  542  (1987)),  but  also  to  disregard  another  in-
struction requiring the jury to " `consider all of the evidence 
which  has  been  received  during  any  part  of  the  trial  of  this 
case,' " 494 U. S., at 383. 

In Payton, the Court again evaluated arguments that fac-
tor  (k)  barred  consideration  of  constitutionally  relevant  evi-
dence--this  time,  evidence  relating  to  postcrime  rehabilita-
tion,  rather  than  precrime  background  and  character.  See 
544  U. S.,  at  135-136.  Payton  did  not  come  to  this  Court, 
as had Boyde, on direct review, but rather by federal habeas 
petition  subject  to  AEDPA.  Relief  was  available  only  if 
"the state court's adjudication of the claim `resulted in a deci-
sion that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli-
cation  of,  clearly  established  Federal  law,  as  determined  by 
the Supreme Court of  the United States.' "  Payton, supra, 
at 141 (quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1)).  Although the prose-
cutor  in  Payton  had  argued  to  the  jury--incorrectly--that 

549US1 Unit: $$U2 [04-07-10 15:43:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
14  AYERS  v.  BELMONTES 

Opinion of the Court 
factor (k) did not permit consideration of postcrime rehabili-tation evidence, this Court concluded that the California Su-

preme  Court reasonably  applied Boyde  in  finding  no  Eighth Amendment  violation.  544  U. S.,  at  142,  146-147.  Accept-
ing  the  prosecutor's  reading  would  have  required  "the  sur-prising  conclusion  that  remorse  could  never  serve  to  lessen 
or  excuse  a  crime."  Id.,  at  142.  Furthermore,  countering any  misimpression  created  by  the  prosecution's  argument, 
the defense in Payton had presented extensive evidence and argument  regarding  a  postcrime  religious  conversion  and 
other good behavior.  The trial court had instructed the jury to  consider  all  evidence  admitted  " `during  any  part  of  the 
trial  in  this  case,  except  as  you  may  be  hereafter  in-structed,' "  and  the  prosecution  itself  "devoted  substantial 
attention  to  discounting  [the  postcrime  evidence's]  impor-tance as compared to the aggravating factors." 

Id., at 145- 146.  Hence,  the  state  court  in  Payton  could  reasonably 

have  concluded  that,  as  in  Boyde,  there  was  no  reasonable likelihood  that  the  jury  understood  the  instruction  to  pre-
clude  consideration  of  the  postcrime  mitigation  evidence  it had heard.  544 U. S., at 147. 

III 
As the Court directed in Boyde, we inquire "whether there is  a  reasonable  likelihood  that  the  jury  has  applied  the 

challenged  instruction  in  a  way  that  prevents  the  consider-ation  of  constitutionally  relevant  evidence."  494  U. S.,  at 
380.  Here,  as  in  Payton,  respondent  argues  that  factor (k)  prevented  the  jury  from  giving  effect  to  his  forward-
looking  evidence.  And,  as  in  Payton,  respondent's  case comes  to  this  Court  in  federal  habeas  proceedings  collater-
ally  attacking  the  state  court's  ruling.  Unlike  in  Payton, however,  the  federal  petition  in  this  case  was  filed  before 
AEDPA's effective date.  AEDPA and its deferential stand-ards of review are  thus  inapplicable.  See 

Woodford v.  Gar-
ceau, 538 U. S. 202, 210 (2003).  The Court of Appeals distin-

Opinion of the Court 
guished Payton on this ground.  See 414 F. 3d, at 1101-1102. It was mistaken, however, to find a "reasonable probability" 

that  the  jury  did  not  consider  respondent's  future  potential. Id., at 1138. 

A 
The Court of Appeals erred by adopting a narrow and, we conclude,  an  unrealistic  interpretation  of  factor  (k).  "Most 

naturally  read,"  the  Court  of  Appeals  reasoned,  "this  in-struction  allows  the  jury  to  consider  evidence  that  bears 
upon  the  commission  of  the  crime  by  the  defendant  and  ex-cuses  or  mitigates  his  culpability  for  the  offense." 

Id.,  at 1134.  As both 
Boyde and Payton explain, however, this in-terpretation  is  too  confined.  "The  instruction  did  not . . .  

limit  the  jury's  consideration  to  `any  other  circumstance  of the  crime  which  extenuates  the  gravity  of  the  crime.'  The 
jury  was  directed  to  consider  any  other  circumstance  that might  excuse  the  crime."  Boyde,  supra,  at  382;  see  also 
Payton,  supra,  at  141-142.  And  just  as  precrime  back-ground  and  character  (Boyde)  and  postcrime  rehabilitation 
(Payton) may "extenuat[e] the gravity of the crime," so may some  likelihood  of  future  good  conduct  count  as  a  circum-
stance  tending  to  make  a  defendant  less  deserving  of  the death penalty.  Cf. Skipper, 476 U. S., at 4-5 (explaining that 
while inferences regarding future conduct do not "relate spe-cifically  to  [a  defendant's]  culpability  for  the  crime  he  com-
mitted,"  those  inferences  are  " `mitigating'  in  the  sense  that they might serve `as a basis for a sentence less than death' " 
(quoting  Lockett  v.  Ohio,  438  U. S.  586,  604  (1978)  (plurality opinion))). 

The Court of Appeals failed to heed the full import of Pay-
ton's  holding,  a  holding  that  has  significance  even  where AEDPA is  inapplicable.  Payton indicated that reading fac-

tor (k) to preclude consideration of postcrime evidence would require  "the  surprising  conclusion that  remorse  could  never 
serve  to  lessen  or  excuse  a  crime."  544  U. S.,  at  142.  So, too,  would  it  be  counterintuitive  if  a  defendant's  capacity  to

16  AYERS  v.  BELMONTES 

Opinion of the Court 
redeem himself  through good works  could not  extenuate his 
offense  and  render  him  less  deserving  of  a  death  sentence. 

In  any  event,  since  respondent  sought  to  extrapolate  fu-
ture  behavior  from  precrime  conduct,  his  mitigation  theory 
was  more  analogous  to  the  good-character  evidence  exam-
ined  in  Boyde  and  held  to  fall  within  factor  (k)'s  purview. 
See  494  U. S.,  at  381  (describing  the  evidence  at  issue  as  in-
cluding evidence of the defendant's "strength of character"). 
Both  types  of  evidence  suggest  the  crime  stemmed  more 
from adverse circumstances than from an irredeemable char-
acter.  See  414  F.  3d,  at  1141-1142  (O'Scannlain,  J.,  concur-
ring  in  part  and  dissenting  in  part);  cf.  Johnson  v.  Texas, 
509  U. S.  350,  369  (1993)  (noting  that  the  "forward-looking" 
future-dangerousness  inquiry  "is  not  independent  of  an  as-
sessment of personal culpability"). 

B 
Our interpretation of factor  (k) is  the  one most  consistent 
with  the  evidence  presented  to  the  jury,  the  parties'  closing 
arguments,  and  the  other  instructions  provided  by  the  trial 
court.  Each of these will be discussed in turn. 

As  the  Court  of  Appeals  recognized,  future-conduct  evi-
dence  was  central  to  the  mitigation  case  presented  by  the 
defense.  See  414  F.  3d,  at  1134.  Indeed,  although  the  de-
fense  also  adduced  evidence  of  a  troubled  upbringing,  re-
spondent  testified  that  he  could  not  use  his  difficult  life  "as 
a  crutch  to  say  I  am  in  a  situation  right  now,  I'm  here  now 
because  of  that."  App.  40.  Given  this  assertion,  and  con-
sidering  the  extensive  forward-looking  evidence  presented 
at sentencing--evidence including testimony from two prison 
chaplains,  respondent's  church  sponsors,  and  respondent 
himself--the  jurors  could  have  disregarded  respondent's  fu-
ture  potential  only  if  they  drew  the  unlikely  inference  that 
"the  court's  instructions  transformed  all  of  this  `favorable 
testimony  into  a  virtual  charade,' "  Boyde,  supra,  at  383 
(quoting  Brown,  479  U. S.,  at  542).  It  is  improbable  the  ju-

17 Cite as: 549 U. S. 7 (2006) 
Opinion of the Court 
rors  believed  that  the  parties  were  engaging  in  an  exercise in futility when respondent presented (and both counsel later 

discussed) his mitigating evidence in open court. Arguments  by  the  prosecution  and  the  defense  assumed 
the  evidence  was  relevant.  The  prosecutor  initially  dis-cussed  the  various  factors  that  were  to  guide  the  jury.  He 
referred  to  factor  (k)  as  "a  catchall."  App.  153.  He  then discussed  respondent's  religious  experience  in  some  detail. 
With respect to whether this experience fit within factor (k), he  indicated:  "I'm  not  sure  it  really  fits  in  there.  I'm  not 
sure  it  really  fits  in  any  of  them.  But  I  think  it  appears  to be  a  proper  subject  of  consideration." 

Id.,  at  154.  These seemingly  contradictory  statements  are  explained  by  the 

prosecutor's following comments. The  prosecutor  suggested  (quite  understandably  on  the 
record)  that  respondent's  religious  evidence  was  weak.  He stated: "You know, first of all, it's no secret that the evidence 
upon  which  the  defendant's  religious  experience  rests  is somewhat  shaky." 

Ibid.  He  also  opined  that  the  experi-ence  had  to  be  taken  "with  a  grain  of  salt."  Id.,  at  155. 

The jury would have realized that, when the prosecutor sug-gested  respondent's  religious  experience  did  not  fit  within 
factor  (k),  he  was  discussing  the  persuasiveness  of  the  evi-dence,  not  the  jury's  ability  to  consider  it.  After  all,  he 
thought  religion  was  "a  proper  subject  of  consideration." Id., at 154. 

The prosecutor  then  discussed how  the  jury  should weigh respondent's "religious awakening": 

"I  suppose  you  can  say  it  would  be  appropriate  be-cause--in  this  fashion:  The  defendant  may  be  of  value 
to  the  community  later.  You  recall  the  people  talking about  how he  would  have the  opportunity  to work with 
other  prisoners  in  prison.  And  I  think  that  value  to the  community  is  something  that  you  have  to  weigh  in. 
There's something to that. "On the other hand, the fact that someone has religion 
as opposed to someone doesn't should be no grounds for

18  AYERS  v.  BELMONTES 

Opinion of the Court 
either  giving  or  withholding  life.  I  mean  let's  turn  it around  and look  at  the other  side  of the  coin.  Suppose 

someone said he didn't belong to a church and didn't talk to  a  minister.  Would  that  man  deserve  to  die  merely 
because  of  that?  So  if  he  says  he  has  religion,  does  he deserve  the  other  penalty,  life?  I  don't  think  that  that 
should  be  an  influencing  factor  at  all  in  that  respect. I don't think the law contemplates that and I don't think 
it's right."  Id., at 155. 
These remarks confirmed to the jury that it should analyze respondent's  future  potential,  his  future  "value  to  the  com-

munity."  Ibid.  This  is  what  respondent  himself  wanted  it to  do.  And  while  the  prosecutor  commented  that  the  law 
did  not  contemplate  jury  consideration  of  respondent's  reli-gious  conversion,  respondent  did  not  argue  that  the  jury 
should  consider  the  mere  fact  that  he  had  discovered  reli-gion.  Rather,  as  manifested  by  his  arguments  on  appeal, 
respondent  wanted  to  use  this  religious  evidence  to  demon-strate  his  future  "value  to  the  community,"  not  to  illustrate 
his  past  religious  awakening.  Nothing  the  prosecutor  said would  have  convinced  the  jury  that  it  was  forbidden  from 
even  considering  respondent's  religious  conversion,  though surely the jury could discount it; and nothing the prosecutor 
said  would  have  led  the  jury  to  think  it  could  not  consider respondent's  future  potential,  especially  since  he  indicated 
that this is exactly what the jury had "to weigh" in its delib-eration. 

Ibid. After  the  prosecutor  concluded  his  arguments,  the  trial 

judge  allowed  respondent  to  speak  on  his  own  behalf.  Re-spondent,  while  not  showing  any  remorse,  suggested  that 
life  imprisonment  offered  "an  opportunity  to  achieve  goals and  try  to  better  yourself."  Id.,  at  163.  He  also  stated: 
"I myself would really like to have my life and try to improve myself."  Id.,  at  164.  Respondent's  personal  pleas  were 
consistent  with  a  trial  in  which  the  jury  would  assess  his future  prospects  in  determining  what  sentence  to  impose.

19 Cite as: 549 U. S. 7 (2006) 
Opinion of the Court 
Defense counsel's closing arguments confirm this analysis. 
To  be  sure,  commenting  on  the  mitigating  evidence,  he  ini-
tially  indicated:  "I'm  not  going  to  insult  you  by  telling  you 
I  think  [the  mitigating  evidence]  excuses  in  any  way  what 
happened here.  That is not the reason I asked these people 
to come in."  Id., at 166.  Read in context defense counsel's 
remarks did not imply the jury should ignore the mitigating 
evidence.  Rather,  conforming  to  the  dichotomy  within  fac-
tor  (k)  itself,  his  remarks  merely  distinguished  between  a 
legal  excuse  and  an  extenuating  circumstance.  Cf.  Cal. 
Penal Code Ann. $ 190.3(k) ("[a]ny other circumstance which 
extenuates  the  gravity  of  the  crime  even  though  it  is  not  a 
legal excuse for the crime"). 

That  defense  counsel  did,  in  fact,  want  the  jury  to  take 
into  account  respondent's  future  potential  became  manifest 
near the end of his argument.  He suggested that the "peo-
ple who came in here [and] told you about [respondent]" pro-
vided the jury with "a game plan" for what respondent could 
do  with  his  life.  App.  170.  He  continued:  "We're  just  sug-
gesting  the  tip  of  the  iceberg  because  who  knows  in  20,  30, 
40,  50  years  what  sorts  of  things  he  can  do,  as  he  fits  into 
the system, as he learns to set his goals, to contribute some-
thing in whatever way he can."  Ibid.  This would have left 
the  jury  believing  it  could  and  should  contemplate  respond-
ent's potential. 

Other  instructions  from  the  trial  court  make  it  quite  im-
plausible  that  the  jury  would  deem  itself  foreclosed  from 
considering  respondent's  full  case  in  mitigation.  Before 
enumerating  specific  factors  for  consideration--factors  in-
cluding  the  circumstances  of  the  crime,  the  defendant's  age, 
and  "[t]he  presence  or  absence  of  any  prior  felony  convic-
tion," id., at 184, as well as the factor (k) catchall--the judge 
told the jury: "In determining which penalty is to be imposed 
on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which 
has  been  received  during  any  part  of  the  trial  of  this  case,

Opinion of the Court 
except  as  you  may  be  hereafter  instructed."  Id.,  at  183. After listing the factors, he indicated: 

"After having heard all of the evidence and after hav-ing heard and considered the arguments of counsel, you 
shall  consider,  take  into  account  and  be  guided  by  the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circum-
stances upon which you have been instructed. "If  you  conclude  that  the  aggravating  circumstances 
outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose a  sentence  of  death.  However,  if  you  determine  that 
the  mitigating  circumstances  outweigh  the  aggravating circumstances,  you  shall  impose  a  sentence  of  confine-
ment  in  the  state  prison  for  life  without  the  possibility of parole." 

Id., at 185. 

The judge then gave a supplemental instruction regarding aggravating and mitigating factors: 

"I have previously read to you the list of aggravating circumstances  which  the  law  permits  you  to  consider  if 
you find that any of them is established by the evidence. These  are  the  only  aggravating  circumstances  that  you 
may  consider.  You  are  not  allowed  to  take  account  of any  other  facts  or  circumstances  as  the  basis  for  decid-
ing that the death penalty would be an appropriate pun-ishment in this case. 

"However, the mitigating circumstances which I have read  for  your  consideration  are  given  to  you  merely  as 
examples  of  some  of  the  factors  that  you  may  take  into account  as  reasons  for  deciding  not  to  impose  a  death 
penalty  or  a  death  sentence  upon  Mr.  Belmontes.  You should  pay  careful  attention  to  each  of  these  factors. 
Any one of them standing  alone may support a decision that  death  is  not  the  appropriate  punishment  in  this 
case."  Id., at 185-186. 
Given  the  evidence  and  arguments  presented  to  the  jury, these instructions eliminate any reasonable likelihood that a

Opinion of the Court 
juror would consider respondent's future prospects to be be-yond  the  bounds  of  proper  consideration.  The  judge  told 

the  jury  to  consider  "all  of  the  evidence,"  and  "all  of  the evidence"  included  respondent's  forward-looking  mitigation 
case.  While  the  judge  did  end  his  broad  command  to  ap-praise all the evidence with the qualifier "except as you may 
be hereafter instructed," id., at 183, he did not later instruct 
the  jury  that  it  should  disregard  respondent's  future  poten-tial  in  prison.  The  jury  could  not  fairly  read  the  limitation 

in the instruction to apply to respondent's central mitigation theory.  By  contrast,  in  response  to  a  juror's  question,  the 
trial  judge  specifically  instructed  the  jury  not  to  consider 

whether respondent could receive psychiatric treatment 
while in prison. 

The sharp  contrast between the  court's instruction  on  ag-
gravation (that only enumerated factors could be considered) 
and  its  instruction  on  mitigation  (that  listed  factors  were 
"merely  .  .  .  examples,"  id.,  at  186)  made  it  clear  that  the 
jury was to take a broad view of mitigating evidence.  Com-
ing back to back, the instructions conveyed the message that 
the  jury  should weigh  the  finite  aggravators against  the  po-
tentially  infinite  mitigators.  That  the  trial  judge  told  the 
jury  to  "pay  careful  attention"  to  the  listed  mitigating  fac-
tors,  ibid.,  moreover,  did  not  compel  the  jury  to  give  them 
sole  consideration.  For  this  to  be  the  case,  the  jury  would 
have had to fail to take the judge at his word.  The judge did 
not  advise  the  jury  to  pay  exclusive  attention  to  the  listed 
mitigating circumstances, and he had told the jury that these 
circumstances were simply examples. 

It  is  implausible  that  the  jury  supposed  that  past  deeds 
pointing  to  a  constructive  future  could  not  "extenuat[e]  the 
gravity  of  the  crime,"  as  required  by  factor  (k),  much  less 
that  such  evidence  could  not  be  considered  at  all.  Boyde 
concludes  that  in  jury  deliberations  "commonsense  under-
standing of the instructions in the light of all that has taken 
place at the trial [is] likely to prevail over technical hairsplit-

ting."  494  U. S.,  at  381.  Here,  far  from  encouraging  the jury to ignore the defense's central evidence, the instructions 

supported giving it due weight. In  concluding  otherwise,  the  Court  of  Appeals  cited  que-
ries  from  some  of  the  jurors  as  evidence  of  confusion.  Al-though  the  jury's  initial  question  is  not  in  the  record,  it 
appeared  to  ask  the  judge  about  the  consequences  of failing 
to  reach  a  unanimous  verdict.  Cf.  414  F.  3d,  at  1135.  In response,  the  judge  reread  portions  of  the  instructions  and 

stated that "all 12 jurors must agree, if you can."  App. 190. Before the judge sent the jury back for further deliberation, 
the following exchange took place: 

"JUROR  HERN:  The  statement  about  the  aggrava-
tion  and  mitigation  of  the  circumstances,  now,  that  was the listing? 

"THE COURT:  That was the listing, yes, ma'am. "JUROR HERN:  Of those certain factors we were to 
decide one or the other and then balance the sheet? "THE COURT:  That is right.  It is a balancing proc-
ess.  Mr. Meyer? "JUROR MEYER:  A specific question, would this be 
an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other? "THE COURT:  No.  It is not that. 

"JUROR MEYER:  It is an either/or situation? 
"THE  COURT:  Exactly.  If  you  can  make  that either/or  decision.  If  you  cannot,  then  I  will  discharge 

you. "JUROR  HAILSTONE:  Could  I  ask  a  question?  I 
don't  know  if  it  is  permissible.  Is  it  possible  that  he 
could have psychiatric treatment during this time? 

"THE  COURT:  That  is  something  you  cannot  con-
sider in making your decision."  Id., at 191. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  decided  Juror  Hern's  questions  indi-
cated  she  thought  (incorrectly)  that  only  listed  mitigating 
factors were on the table--an error, in the Court of Appeals'

Opinion of the Court 
view, that should have prompted a clarifying instruction con-firming  that  all  the  mitigating  evidence  was  relevant.  414 

F.  3d,  at  1136.  The  Court  of  Appeals  further  supposed  the response to Juror Hailstone's question compounded the prob-
lem, since psychiatric treatment presumably would be neces-sary only in aid of future rehabilitation. 

Id., at 1137. 
The  Court  of  Appeals'  analysis  is  flawed.  To  begin  with, 
attributing  to  Juror  Hern  a  dilemma  over  the  scope  of  miti-gation is only one way to interpret her questions, and, as the 

California  Supreme  Court  observed  on  direct  review,  it  is not necessarily the correct one, see 

Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 
804,  755  P.  2d,  at  344.  It  is  at  least  as  likely  that  the  juror 
was simply  asking  for clarification  about California's  overall 
balancing process, which requires juries to consider and bal-
ance  enumerated  factors  (such  as  age  and  criminal  history) 
that  are  labeled  neither  as  mitigating  nor  as  aggravating. 
As  Juror  Hern  surmised  (but  sought  to  clarify),  the  jury  it-
self  must  determine  the  side  of  the  balance  on  which  each 
listed factor falls.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.3 (provid-
ing that, "[i]n determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall 
take into account" any relevant listed factors); see generally 
Tuilaepa v.  California, 512 U. S. 967, 978-979 (1994) (noting 
that  the  $ 190.3  sentencing  factors  "do  not  instruct  the  sen-
tencer how to weigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon 
the ultimate sentence"). 

Even assuming the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted 
Juror Hern's questions, the court's conclusion that this juror 
likely ignored forward-looking evidence presupposes what it 
purports to establish, namely, that forward-looking evidence 
could  not  fall  within  factor  (k).  As  discussed  earlier,  noth-
ing  barred  the  jury  from  viewing  respondent's  future  pros-
pects as "extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime," so nothing 
barred  it  from  considering  such  evidence  under  the  rubric 
of  the  "listing."  As  for  Juror  Hailstone's  psychiatric-care 
question,  this  inquiry  shows  that,  if  anything,  the  jurors 
were  considering  respondent's  potential.  The  trial  court's

the  very  context  in  which  the  phrase  "felony  punishable  under  the

there  are  good  reasons  to  think  it  was  doing  no  such  thing here.

First, an offense that necessarily counts as "illicit traffick-ing"  under  the  INA  is  a  "drug  trafficking  crime"  under 

$ 924(c),  that  is,  a  "felony  punishable  under  the  [CSA]," $ 924(c)(2).  And  if  we  want  to  know  what  felonies  might 
qualify, the place to go is to the definitions of crimes punish-able  as  felonies  under  the  CSA;  where  else  would  one  natu-
rally  look?  Although  the  Government  would  have  us  look to state law, we suspect that if Congress had meant us to do 
that it would have found a much less misleading way to make its  point.  Indeed,  other  parts  of  $ 924  expressly  refer  to 
guilt under state law, see $$ 924(g)(3), (k)(2), and the implica-tion confirms that the reference solely to a "felony punishable 
under  the  [CSA]"  in  $ 924(c)(2)  is  to  a  crime  punishable  as  a 
felony under the federal Act.  See Russello

Opinion of the Court 
makes sense to ask whether it would have some use short of wrenching the expectations raised by normal English usage, 

and in fact it has two perfectly straightforward jobs to do: it provides that a generic description of "an offense . . . in this 
paragraph," one not specifically couched as a state offense or a federal  one, covers  either one,  and it  confirms  that  a  state 
offense whose elements include the elements of a felony pun-ishable under the CSA is an aggravated felony.  Thus, if Lo-
pez's state crime actually fell within the general term "illicit trafficking,"  the  state  felony  conviction  would  count  as  an 
"aggravated  felony," regardless  of  the  existence  of a  federal felony  counterpart;  and  a  state  offense  of  possessing  more 
than  five  grams  of  cocaine  base  is  an  aggravated  felony  be-cause it is a felony under the CSA, 21 U. S. C. $ 844(a).

8 

The Government's reliance on the penultimate sentence of 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(43) is misplaced for a second reason.  The 

Government  tries  to  justify  its  unusual  reading  of  a  defined term  in  the  criminal  code  on  the  basis  of  a  single  sentence 
in  the  INA.  But  nothing  in  the  penultimate  sentence  of $ 1101(a)(43) suggests that Congress changed the meaning of 
"felony  punishable  under  the  [CSA]"  when  it  took  that phrase from Title 18 and incorporated it into Title 8's defini-
tion  of  "aggravated  felony."  Yet  the  Government  admits  it has never begun a prosecution under 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A) 
where  the  underlying  "drug  trafficking  crime"  was  a  state felony but a federal misdemeanor.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33- 
36.  This is telling: the failure of even a single eager Assist-

Opinion of the Court 
Two  examples  show  the  untoward  consequences  of  the 
Government's approach.  Consider simple possession of 
marijuana.  Not  only  is  it  a  misdemeanor  under  the  CSA, 
see  21  U. S. C.  $ 844(a),  but  the  INA  expressly  excludes 
"a single offense involving possession for one's own use of 30 
grams  or  less"  from  the  controlled  substance  violations  that 
are grounds for deportation, 8 U. S. C. $ 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).  Yet 
by  the  Government's  lights,  if  a  State  makes  it  a  felony  to 
possess  a  gram  of  marijuana  the  congressional  judgment  is 
supplanted,  and  a  state  convict  is  subject  to  mandatory  de-
portation  because  the  alien  is  ineligible  for  cancellation  of 
removal.  See  $ 1229b(a)(3).10  There  is  no  hint  in  the  stat-
ute's  text  that  Congress  was  courting  any  such  state-by-
state disparity. 

The  situation  in  reverse  flouts  probability  just  as  much. 
Possessing  more  than  five  grams  of  cocaine  base  is  a  felony 
under federal law.  See 21 U. S. C. $ 844(a).  If a State drew 
the misdemeanor-felony line at six grams plus, a person con-
victed  in  state  court  of  possessing  six  grams  would  not  be 
guilty of an aggravated felony on the Government's reading, 
which  makes  the  law  of  the  convicting  jurisdiction  disposi-
tive.  See  Brief  for  Respondent  48.  Again,  it  is  just  not 
plausible  that  Congress  meant  to  authorize  a  State  to  over-
rule its judgment about the consequences of federal offenses 
to which its immigration law expressly refers. 

True, the argument is not all one-sided.  The Government 
points out that some States graduate offenses of drug posses-
sion  from  misdemeanor  to  felony  depending  on  quantity, 

10 Indeed, several States treat possession of less than 30 grams of mari-
juana  as  a  felony.  See  Fla.  Stat.  $$ 893.13(6)(a)-(b),  775.082(3)(d)  (2006) 
(punishing  possession  of  over  20  grams  of  marijuana  as  a  felony);  Nev. 
Rev.  Stat. $$ 453.336(1)-(2)  (2004),  $$ 453.336(4),  193.130  (2003)  (punishing 
possession of more than one ounce, or 28.3 grams, of marijuana as a felony);

possible  prejudice  to  the  defendant."  App.  to  Pet.  for Cert. 74a. 

Musladin  appealed  his  conviction  to  the  California  Court of Appeal in 1997.  He argued that the buttons deprived him 
of his Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights. At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that 
Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed 
on his claim and cited Flynn,  supra,  at 570, as providing the test  for  inherent  prejudice.  The  Court  of  Appeal,  quoting 

part  of  Flynn's  test,  made  clear  that  it  "consider[ed]  the wearing  of  photographs  of  victims  in  a  courtroom  to  be  an 
`impermissible factor coming into play,' the practice of which 
should be discouraged."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting 
Flynn,  supra,  at  570).  Nevertheless,  the  court  concluded, 
again quoting Flynn,  supra,  at 571, that the buttons had not 
"branded  defendant  `with  an  unmistakable  mark  of  guilt'  in 
the  eyes  of  the  jurors"  because  "[t]he  simple  photograph  of 
Tom  Studer  was  unlikely  to  have  been  taken  as  a  sign  of 
anything  other  than  the  normal grief  occasioned  by the  loss 
of [a] family member."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  state  appellate  process,  Musladin 
filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in Federal Dis-
trict Court pursuant to $ 2254.  In his application, Musladin 
argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that 
the  California  Court  of  Appeal  erred  by  holding  that  the 
Studers' wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair 
trial.  The  District  Court  denied  habeas  relief  but  granted 
a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit  reversed  and 
remanded  for  issuance  of  the  writ,  finding  that  under  $ 2254 
the  state  court's  decision  "was  contrary  to,  or  involved  an 
unreasonable  application  of,  clearly  established  Federal  law, 
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." 

$ 2254(d)(1).  According to the Court of Appeals, this Court's 
decisions  in  Williams  and  Flynn  clearly  established  a  rule 
of  federal  law  applicable  to  Musladin's  case.  Musladin  v.

Opinion of the Court 
Lamarque,  427  F.  3d  653,  656-658  (2005).  Specifically,  the 
Court  of  Appeals  cited  its  own  precedent  in  support  of  its 
conclusion  that  Williams  and  Flynn  clearly  established  the 
test  for  inherent  prejudice  applicable  to  spectators'  court-
room conduct.  427 F. 3d, at 657-658 (citing Norris v.  Risley, 
918  F.  2d  828  (CA9  1990)).  The  Court  of  Appeals  held  that 
the  state  court's  application  of  a  test  for  inherent  prejudice 
that  differed  from  the  one  stated  in  Williams  and  Flynn 
"was  contrary  to  clearly  established  federal  law  and  consti-
tuted an unreasonable application of that law."  427 F. 3d, at 
659-660.  The  Court  of  Appeals  denied  rehearing  en  banc. 
427  F.  3d  647  (2005).  We  granted  certiorari,  547  U. S.  1069

Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 
of 1996, 110 Stat. 1219: 

"(d)  An application for a writ of habeas corpus on be-
half  of a person in custody  pursuant  to the  judgment of 
a  State  court  shall  not  be  granted  with  respect  to  any 
claim  that was  adjudicated  on the  merits  in  State  court 
proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim-- 

"(1)  resulted  in  a  decision  that  was  contrary  to,  or 
involved  an  unreasonable  application  of,  clearly  estab-
lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court 
of the United States."  28 U. S. C. $ 2254. 

In  Williams  v.  Taylor,  529  U. S.  362  (2000),  we  explained 
that  "clearly  established  Federal  law"  in  $ 2254(d)(1)  "refers 
to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's deci-
sions  as  of  the  time  of  the  relevant  state-court  decision." 
Id.,  at 412.  Therefore, federal habeas relief may be granted 
here if the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary 
to or involved an unreasonable application of this Court's ap-
plicable holdings.

Opinion of the Court 

A 
In  Estelle  v.  Williams  and  Flynn,  this  Court  addressed 
the  effect  of  courtroom  practices  on  defendants'  fair-trial 
rights.  In Williams,  the  Court  considered "whether  an ac-
cused  who  is  compelled  to  wear  identifiable  prison  clothing 
at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection 
of the laws."  425 U. S., at 502.  The Court stated that "the 
State  cannot, consistently  with the  Fourteenth Amendment, 
compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed 
in  identifiable  prison  clothes,"  id.,  at  512,  but  held  that  the 
defendant  in  that  case  had  waived  any  objection  to  being 
tried  in  prison  clothes  by  failing  to  object  at  trial,  id.,  at 
512-513. 

In Flynn,  the Court addressed whether seating "four uni-
formed state troopers" in the row of spectators' seats imme-
diately  behind  the  defendant  at  trial  denied  the  defendant 
his  right  to  a  fair  trial.  475  U. S.,  at  562.  The  Court  held 
that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prej-
udicial  that  it  denied  the  defendant  a  fair  trial.  Id.,  at  571. 
In reaching that holding, the Court stated that "the question 
must  be . . .  whether  `an  unacceptable  risk  is  presented  of 
impermissible  factors  coming  into  play.' "  Id.,  at  570  (quot-
ing Williams,  supra,  at 505). 

Both  Will i am s  and  Flynn  dealt  with  government-
sponsored  practices:  In  Williams,  the  State  compelled  the 
defendant  to stand  trial  in  prison  clothes,  and  in Flynn,  the 
State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant. 
Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices 
are  so  inherently  prejudicial  that  they  must  be  justified  by 
an  "essential  state"  policy  or  interest.  Williams,  supra,  at 
505  (concluding  that  the  practice  "further[ed]  no  essential 
state  policy");  Flynn,  supra,  at  568-569  (holding  that  the 
practice  was  not  of  the  sort  that  had  to  be  justified  by  an 
"essential state interest").

Opinion of the Court 

B 
In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the ef-
fect on a defendant's fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to  which  Musladin  objects  is  an  open  question  in  our  juris-

prudence.  This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor  courtroom  conduct  was  so  inherently  prejudi-
cial  that  it  deprived  a  defendant  of  a  fair  trial.2  And  al-though the  Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice 
that  applies  to  state  conduct  in  Williams  and  Flynn,  we have never applied that test to spectators' conduct.  Indeed, 
part  of  the  legal  test  of  Williams  and  Flynn--asking whether the practices furthered an essential 

state  interest-- 
suggests  that  those  cases  apply  only  to  state-sponsored 
practices. Reflecting  the  lack  of  guidance  from  this  Court,  lower 

courts  have  diverged  widely  in  their  treatment  of  defend-ants'  spectator-conduct  claims.  Some  courts  have  applied 
Williams  and Flynn  to spectators' conduct.  Norris  v.  Ris-
ley,  supra, at 830-831 (applying Williams  and Flynn  to hold 
spectators' buttons worn during a trial deprived the defend-ant  of  a  fair  trial); 

In  re  Woods,  154  Wash.  2d  400,  416-418, 
114  P.  3d  607,  616-617  (2005)  (applying  Flynn  but  conclud-
ing  that  ribbons  worn  by  spectators  did  not  prejudice  the 
defendant).  Other courts have declined to extend Williams 
and  Flynn  to  spectators'  conduct.  Billings  v.  Polk,  441 
F.  3d  238,  246-247  (CA4  2006)  ("These  precedents  do  not 

2 This Court has considered cases in which the proceedings were a sham 
or  were  mob  dominated.  See  Moore  v.  Dempsey,  261  U. S.  86,  91  (1923) 
(describing  allegations  that  "the  whole  proceeding  [was]  a  mask--that 
counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave 
of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong"); 
Frank  v.  Mangum,  237  U. S.  309,  324-325  (1915)  ("[T]he  disorder  in  and 
about  the  court-room  during  the  trial  and  up  to  and  at  the  reception  of 
the  verdict  amounted  to  mob  domination,  that  not  only  the  jury  but  the 
presiding judge succumbed to it").

clearly  establish  that  a  defendant's  right  to  a  fair  jury  trial is violated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial argu-

ably  conveys  a  message  about  the  matter  before  the  jury"); Davis  v.  State,  223  S.  W.  3d  466,  474-475  (Tex.  App.  2006) 
("Appellant does not cite any authority holding the display of this type of item by spectators creates inherent prejudice"). 
Other courts have  distinguished  Flynn  on the  facts.  Pachl v. 

Zenon,  145  Ore.  App.  350,  360,  n.  1,  929  P.  2d  1088,  1093- 1094, n. 1 (1996) (in banc).  And still other courts have ruled 

on  spectator-conduct  claims  without  relying  on,  discussing, or distinguishing Williams  or Flynn.  Buckner  v.  State,  714 
So. 2d 384, 388-389 (Fla. 1998) (per  curiam);  State  v.  Speed, 265  Kan.  26,  47-48,  961  P.  2d  13,  29-30  (1998);  Nguyen  v. 
State,  977 S. W. 2d 450, 457 (Tex. App. 1998); Kenyon  v.  State, 58  Ark.  App.  24,  33-35,  946  S.  W.  2d  705,  710-711  (1997); 
State  v.  Nelson,  96-0883,  pp.  9-10  (La.  App.  12/17/97),  705 So. 2d 758, 763. 

Given  the  lack  of  holdings  from  this  Court  regarding  the potentially  prejudicial  effect  of  spectators'  courtroom  con-
duct  of  the  kind  involved  here,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the state court "unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Fed-
eral  law."  $ 2254(d)(1).  No  holding  of  this  Court  required the California Court of Appeal to apply the test of 

Williams and  Flynn  to  the  spectators'  conduct  here.  Therefore,  the 

state court's decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 

III 
The Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the Cali-fornia  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  was  contrary  to  or  an  un-

reasonable  application  of  clearly  established  federal  law  as determined by this Court.  For these reasons, the judgment 
of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It  is  so  ordered.

Syllabus 
(b)  Petitioners'  assertion  that  $ 2415(a)'s  term  "action"  is  commonly 
used  to  refer  to  administrative,  as  well  as  judicial,  proceedings,  is  not 
persuasive.  The numerous  statutes and regulations cited to document 
this  supposed  usage  actually  undermine  petitioners'  argument,  since 
none of them uses the term "action" standing alone to refer to adminis-
trative  proceedings.  Rather,  each  includes  a  modifier,  referring  to  an 
"administrative  action,"  a  "civil  or  administrative  action,"  or  "adminis-
trative enforcement actions."  Section 2415(a)'s references to "every  ac-
tion for money damages" founded upon "any  contract" (emphasis added) 
do  not  assist petitioners, as  they  do not broaden  the  ordinary  meaning 
of  the  key term  "action."  Pennsylvania  v.  Delaware Valley  Citizens' 
Council  for Clean  Air,  478 U. S. 546, and West  v.  Gibson,  527 U. S. 212, 
distinguished.  Pp. 92-94. 

(c)  Petitioners' suggestion that an MMS payment order constitutes a 
"complaint" under $ 2415(a) is also rejected.  Their examples of statutes 
and  regulations  employing  the  term  "complaint"  in  the  administrative 
context are unavailing, since such occasional usage of the term does not 
alter its primary meaning, which concerns the initiation of a civil action. 
Moreover,  an  MMS  payment  order  lacks  the  essential  attributes  of  a 
complaint, which is a filing that commences a proceeding that may result 
in a legally binding order providing relief.  In contrast, an MMS order 
in  and  of  itself  imposes  a  legal  obligation  on  the  party  to  which  it  is 
issued.  Given that the failure to comply with such an order can result 
in  fines  of up to  $10,000  a  day, see 30 U. S. C. $ 1719(c), the order  plays 
an entirely different role from that of a "complaint."  P. 95. 

(d)  Any  remaining  doubts  are  erased  by  the  canon  that  statutes  of 
limitations  are  construed  narrowly  against  the  government.  This 
canon is rooted in the traditional rule that time does not run against the 
King.  A corollary of this rule is that a sovereign that elects to subject 
itself  to  a  statute  of  limitations  is  given  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  if  the 
statute's  scope is  ambiguous.  Bowers  v.  New York &  Albany Lighter-
age Co.,  273 U. S. 346, distinguished.  Pp. 95-96. 

(e)  The Court disagrees with petitioners' argument that interpreting 

$ 2415(a)  as  applying  only  to  judicial  actions  renders  $ 2415(i)--which 
specifies  that  "[t]he  provisions  of  this  section  shall  not  prevent  the 
United States . . . from collecting any claim . . . by  means of administra-
tive  offset"--superfluous  in  contravention  of  the  canon  against  reading 
a statute in a way that makes part of it redundant.  Under the Court's 
interpretation, $ 2415(i) is not mere surplusage, but clarifies that admin-
istrative offsets are not covered by $ 2415(a) even if they are viewed as 
an  adjunct  of  a  court  action.  To  accept  petitioners'  argument,  on  the 
other  hand,  the  Court  would  have  to  hold  either  that  $ 2415(a)  applied 
to  administrative  actions  when  it  was  enacted  in  1966  or  that  it  was

86  BP  AMERICA  PRODUCTION  CO.  v.  BURTON 

Syllabus 
extended  to  reach  administrative  actions  when  $ 2415(i)  was  added  in 
1982.  The  clear  meaning  of  $ 2415(a)'s  text,  which  has  not  been 
amended, refutes the first of these propositions, and accepting the latter 
would  require  the  unrealistic  conclusion  that  in  1982  Congress  pro-
ceeded  to  enlarge  $ 2415  to  cover  administrative  proceedings  by  the 
oblique and cryptic route of inserting text expressly excluding a single 
administrative vehicle from the statute's reach.  Pp. 96-99. 

(f)  Although interpreting $ 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions 
may  result  in  certain  peculiarities,  petitioners'  alternative  interpreta-
tion would  itself  result in  disharmony.  For instance, MMS  oil  and gas 
lease payment orders are now prospectively subject to a 7-year statute 
of limitations except with respect to obligations arising out of leases of 
Indian  land.  30  U. S. C.  $ 1724(b)(1).  Given  the  exhortation  that  the 
Interior Secretary "aggressively carry out his trust responsibility in the 
administration of Indian oil and gas," $ 1701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that 
Congress intended to impose a shorter, 6-year statute of limitations for 
payment orders regarding Indian lands.  Finally, while cogent, petition-
ers'  policy  arguments  as  to  why  limiting  $ 2415(a)  to  judicial  actions 
frustrates  the  statute's  purposes  must  be  viewed  in  perspective.  For 
example,  because  there  are  always  policy  arguments  against  affording 
the sovereign special treatment, the relevant inquiry in a case like this 
is  simply  how  far  Congress  meant  to  go  when  it  enacted  the  statute 
of  limitations in  question.  Prior  to  $ 2415(a)'s enactment,  Government 
contract  actions  were  not  subject  to  any  statute  of  limitations.  See 
Guaranty  Trust Co.  v.  United  States,  304  U. S.  126,  132.  Absent  con-
gressional  action  changing  this  rule,  it  remains  the  law,  and  $ 2415(a) 
betrays no intent to change the rule as it applies to administrative pro-
ceedings.  Pp. 99-101. 

410 F. 3d 722, affirmed.

lease sites [was] archaic and inadequate. "  $ 1701(a)(2). FOGRMA  ordered  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  to  "audit 

and reconcile,  to  the  extent practicable,  all current  and past lease  accounts  for  leases  of  oil  or  gas  and  take  appropriate 
actions  to  make  additional  collections  or  refunds  as  war-ranted."  $ 1711(c)(1).  The Secretary, in  turn, has  assigned 
these duties to MMS.  30 CFR $ 201.100 (2006). Under  FOGRMA,  lessees  are  responsible  in  the  first  in-
stance  for  the  accurate  calculation  and  payment  of  royal-ties.  30  U. S. C.  $ 1712(a).  MMS,  in  turn,  is  authorized  to 
audit  those  payments  to  determine  whether  a  royalty  has been  overpaid  or  underpaid.  $$ 1711(a)  and  (c);  30  CFR 

$$ 206.150(c), 206.170(d).  In the event that an audit suggests an  underpayment,  it  is  MMS' 

1  practice  to  send  the  lessee 

a  letter  inquiring  about  the  perceived  deficiency.  If,  after reviewing the lessee's response, MMS concludes that the les-

see owes additional royalties, MMS issues an order requiring payment of the amount due.  Failure to comply with such an 
order  carries  a  stiff  penalty:  "Any  person  who--(1)  know-ingly  or  willfully  fails  to  make  any  royalty  payment  by  the 
date as specified by [an] order . . . shall be liable for a penalty of  up  to  $10,000  per  violation  for  each  day  such  violation 
continues."  30  U. S. C.  $ 1719(c).  The  Attorney  General may enforce these orders in federal court.  $ 1722(a). 

An  MMS payment  order may be  appealed,  first to the  Di-rector  of  MMS  and  then  to  the  Interior  Board  of  Land  Ap-
peals  or  to  an  Assistant  Secretary.  30  CFR  $$ 290.105, 290.108.  While  filing an appeal  does  not  generally  stay  the 
payment order, $ 218.50(c), MMS will usually suspend the or-der's effect after the lessee complies with applicable bonding 
or financial solvency requirements, $ 243.8. Congress  supplemented  this  scheme  by  enacting  the  Fed-
eral  Oil  and  Gas  Royalty  Simplification  and  Fairness  Act  of 1996  (FOGRSFA),  110  Stat.  1700,  as  amended,  30  U. S. C.

$ 1701 et  seq.  FOGRSFA adopted a prospective 7-year stat-ute  of  limitations  for  any  "judicial  proceeding  or  demand" 

for  royalties  arising  under  a  federal  oil  or  gas  lease. $ 1724(b)(1).  The  parties  agree  that  this  provision  applies 
both to judicial actions ("judicial proceeding[s]") and to MMS' administrative  payment  orders  ("demand[s]")  arising  on  or 
after  September  1,  1996.  Ibid.  This  provision  does  not, however,  apply  to  judicial  proceedings  or  demands  arising 
from  leases  of Indian  land  or  underpayments of  royalties  on pre-September 1, 1996, production.  FOGRSFA $$ 9, 11, 110 
Stat. 1717, notes following 30 U. S. C. $ 1701. There is no dispute that a lawsuit in court to recover royal-
ties  owed  to  the  Government  on  pre-September  1,  1996, production  is  covered  by  28  U. S. C.  $ 2415(a),  which  sets 
out  a  general  6-year  statute  of  limitations  for  Government contract  actions.  That  section,  which  was  enacted  in  1966, 
provides in relevant part: 

"Subject to the provisions of section 2416 of this title, and  except  as  otherwise  provided  by  Congress,  every 

action  for  money  damages  brought by the United States or  an  officer  or  agency  thereof  which  is  founded  upon 
any  contract  express  or  implied  in  law  or  fact,  shall  be barred  unless  the  complaint  is  filed  within  six  years 
after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable adminis-
trative  proceedings  required  by  contract  or  by  law, whichever is later."  (Emphasis added.) 

Whether  this  general  6-year  statute  of  limitations  also  gov-erns  MMS  administrative  payment  orders  concerning  preSeptember  1,  1996,  production  is  the  question  that  we  must decide in this case.

Opinion of the Court 
entered  into  these  leases  nearly  50  years  ago,  and  these leases require the payment of the minimum 12.5 percent roy-

alty  prescribed  by  30  U. S. C.  $ 226(b)(1)(A).  For  years, Amoco calculated the royalty as a percentage of the value of 
the  gas  as  of  the  moment  it  was  produced  at  the  well.  In 1996,  MMS  sent  lessees  a  letter  directing  that  royalties 
should be calculated based not on the value of the gas at the well, but on the value of the gas after it was treated to meet 
the  quality  requirements  for  introduction  into  the  Nation's mainline pipelines.

2  Consistent with this guidance, MMS in 

1997  ordered  Amoco  to  pay  additional  royalties  for  the  pe-riod  from  January  1989  through  December  1996  in  order  to 

cover  the  difference  between  the  value  of  the  treated  gas and its lesser value at the well. 

Amoco appealed the order, disputing MMS' interpretation of its royalty obligations and arguing that the payment order 
was  in  any  event  barred  in  part  by  the  6-year  statute  of limitations in 28 U. S. C. $ 2415(a).  The Assistant Secretary 
of  the  Interior  denied  the  appeal  and  ruled  that  the  statute of limitations was inapplicable. 

Amoco,  together  with  petitioner  Atlantic  Richfield  Co., sought  review  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the 
District of Columbia, which agreed with the Assistant Secre-tary  that  $ 2415(a)  did  not  govern  the  administrative  order. 
Amoco  Production Co.  v.  Baca,  300  F.  Supp. 2d  1,  21 (2003). The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit 
affirmed,  Amoco  Production  Co.  v.  Watson,  410  F.  3d  722, 733  (2005),  and  we  granted  certiorari,  547  U. S.  1068  (2006), 
in order to resolve the conflict between that decision and the contrary  holding  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for 
the  Tenth  Circuit  in  OXY  USA,  Inc.  v.  Babbitt,  268  F.  3d 1001, 1005 (2001) (en banc).  We now affirm. 

2 MMS intended this letter to implement its regulations, which required 
lessees  "to  place  gas  in  marketable  condition  at  no  cost  to  the  Federal 
Government unless otherwise provided in the lease agreement."  30 CFR 

$ 206.152(i) (1996).

with  the  statutory  text.  Central 
Bank  of  Denver,  N.  A.  v.  First  Interstate  Bank  of  Denver, 
N.  A.,  511  U. S.  164,  173  (1994).  Unless  otherwise  defined, statutory terms are generally interpreted in accordance with 

their  ordinary  meaning.  Perrin  v.  United  States,  444  U. S. 37,  42  (1979).  Read  in  this  way,  the  text  of  $ 2415(a)  is 
quite clear. The  statute  of  limitations  imposed  by  $ 2415(a)  applies 
when  the  Government  commences  any  "action  for  money damages"  by  filing  a  "complaint"  to  enforce  a  contract,  and 
the  statute  runs  from  the  point  when  "the  right  of  action accrues."  The  key  terms  in  this  provision--"action"  and 
"complaint"--are ordinarily used in connection with judicial, 
not  administrative,  proceedings.  In  1966,  when  $ 2415(a) was  enacted,  a  commonly  used  legal  dictionary  defined  the 

term  "right  of  action"  as  "[t]he  right  to  bring  suit;  a  legal right  to  maintain  an  action,"  with  "suit"  meaning  "any  pro-
ceeding  .  .  .  in  a  court  of  justice."  Black's  Law  Dictionary 
1488,  1603  (4th  ed.  1951)  (hereinafter  Black's).  Likewise, 
"complaint"  was  defined  as  "the  first  or  initiatory  pleading 
on  the  part  of  the  plaintiff  in  a  civil  action." 3  Id.,  at  356. 
See  also  Unexcelled  Chemical  Corp.  v.  United  States,  345 
U. S. 59, 66 (1953) (holding that filing a complaint, in the ordi-
nary  sense  of  the  term,  means  filing  a  suit  in  court,  not  ini-
tiating  an  administrative  proceeding:  "Commencement  of 
an  action  by  the  filing  of  a  complaint  has  too  familiar  a  his-
tory . . . for  us  to  assume that Congress did not mean to use 
the words in their ordinary sense").  The phrase "action for 

3 These  primary  definitions  have  not  changed  in  substance  since  1966. 
Black's (8th ed. 2004) now defines "action" as "[a] civil or criminal judicial 
proceeding" and a "complaint" as "[t]he initial pleading that starts a civil 
action  and  states  the  basis  for  the  court's  jurisdiction,  the  basis  for  the 
plaintiff's claim, and the demand for relief."  Id.,  at 31, 303.

money  damages"  reinforces  this  reading  because  the  term "damages"  is  generally  used  to  mean  "pecuniary  compensa-

tion  or  indemnity,  which  may  be  recovered  in  the  courts." Black's 466 (emphasis added). 

Nothing  in  the  language  of  $ 2415(a)  suggests  that  Con-gress intended these terms to apply more broadly to admin-
istrative  proceedings.  On  the  contrary,  $ 2415(a)  distin-guishes  between  judicial  and  administrative  proceedings. 
Section  2415(a)  provides  that  an  "action"  must  commence "within  one  year  after  final  decisions  have  been  rendered 
in  applicable  administrative  proceedings."  Thus,  Congress knew  how  to  identify  administrative  proceedings  and  mani-
festly  had  two  separate  concepts  in  mind  when  it  enacted $ 2415(a).

B 
In  an  effort  to  show  that  the  term  "action"  is  commonly used  to  refer  to  administrative,  as  well  as  judicial,  proceed-

ings,  petitioners  have  cited  numerous  statutes  and  regula-tions  that,  petitioners  claim,  document  this  usage.

ceedings to commence within one year after the conclusion of administra-
tive proceedings. 

5 See, e. g.,  42 U. S. C. $ 5205(a)(1) (statute of limitations for "administra-

tive  action[s]  to  recover  any  payment[s]  made  to  a  State  or  local  govern-
ment  for  disaster  or  emergency  assistance");  12  U. S. C.  $ 1441a(b)(11)(G) 
(requiring  Resolution  Trust  Corporation  to  maintain  staff  to  assist  with

Opinion of the Court 
examples,  however,  actually  undermine  petitioners'  argu-ment,  since  none  of  them  uses  the  term  "action"  standing 

alone  to  refer  to  administrative  proceedings.  Rather,  each example  includes  a  modifier  of  some  sort,  referring  to  an 
"administrative  action,"  a  "civil  or  administrative  action," or  "administrative  enforcement  actions."  This  pattern  of 
usage  buttresses  the  point  that  the  term  "action,"  standing alone, ordinarily refers to a judicial proceeding. 

Petitioners  contend  that  their  broader  interpretation  of the  statutory  term  "action"  is  supported  by  the  reference 
to  "every  action  for  money  damages"  founded  upon  "any contract."  28  U. S. C.  $ 2415(a)  (emphasis  added).  But  the 
broad  terms  "every"  and  "any"  do  not  assist  petitioners,  as they  do  not  broaden  the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  key  term 
"action." Petitioners argue that their interpretation is supported by 
Pennsylvania  v.  Delaware  Valley  Citizens'  Council  for 
Clean  Air,  478 U. S. 546 (1986), and West v.  Gibson, 527 U. S. 212 (1999), but this reliance is misplaced.  In 

Delaware Val-ley Citizens' Council, we construed the attorney's fee provi-

sion  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  (CWA),  which  authorizes  a "court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursu-
ant to subsection (a) of this section, [to] award costs of litiga-tion . . . to any party."  42 U. S. C. $ 7604(d).  We permitted 
the recovery of fees both for work done in court and in subse-quent administrative proceedings.  But the pertinent statu-
tory provision in that case did not employ the key terms that appear  in  the  statute  at  issue  here.  Specifically,  the  CWA 
provision  referred  to  "litigation,"  not  to  an  "action"  com-menced by the filing of a "complaint."  Moreover, "the work 
done by counsel [in the administrative phase of the case] was 
IX-b (2006) ("Administrative actions, such as determination of award fees 
where [Department of Energy] contracts provide for such determinations, 
will be considered separately from any civil penalties that may be imposed 
under this Enforcement Policy").

West  helps  petitioners  even  less.  There,  we  considered 
whether  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission (EEOC)  could  order  a  federal  agency  to  pay  compensatory 

damages in an administrative proceeding.  Section 717(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e- 
16(b),  authorized  the  EEOC  to  employ  "appropriate  reme-
dies," but did not specifically authorize damages, and $ 717(c) 
authorized  a  subsequent  court  action  against  an  employer 
agency,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000e-16(c).  In  1991,  Congress  added 
Rev.  Stat.  $ 1977A(a)(1),  42  U. S. C.  $ 1981a(a)(1),  which  pro-
vided  that  "[i]n  an  action  brought  by  a  complaining  party 
under  section  706  or  717 . . . the  complaining  party  may  re-
cover compensatory . . .  damages."  In West, the respondent 
employee argued that the enactment of $ 1981a(a)(1) showed 
that Congress did not consider compensatory damages to be 
"appropriate  remedies"  in  an EEOC  proceeding,  as  opposed 
to an action brought by an aggrieved employee.  If Congress 
had wished to authorize the award of compensatory damages 
in an EEOC proceeding, the respondent employee reasoned, 
Congress  would  have  so  provided  in  $ 1981a(a)(l),  by  ex-
pressly  cross-referencing  $ 717(c).  We  rejected  this  argu-
ment, but in doing so we did not hold that an EEOC proceed-
ing  is  an  "action"  under  $ 1981a(a)(1).  Rather,  we  simply 
concluded  that  the  EEOC's  authorization  under  $ 717(b)  to 
award  "appropriate  remedies"  was  broad  enough  to  encom-
pass compensatory damages.  527 U. S., at 220-221. 

For  these  reasons,  we  are  not  persuaded  by  petitioners' 
argument  that  the  term  "action"  in  $ 2415(a)  applies  to  the 
administrative  proceedings  that  follow  the  issuance  of  an 
MMS payment order.

Opinion of the Court 

C 
We  similarly  reject  petitioners'  suggestion  that  an  MMS letter or payment order constitutes a "complaint" within the 

meaning of $ 2415(a).  Petitioners point to examples  of stat-utes and regulations that employ the term "complaint" in the 
administrative context.  See, e. g.,  15 U. S. C. $ 45(b) (requir-ing the Federal Trade Commission to serve a "complaint" on 
a party suspected of engaging in an unfair method of compe-tition); 29 CFR $ 102.15 (2006) (a "complaint" initiates unfair 
labor  practice  proceedings  before  the  National  Labor  Rela-tions Board).  But the occasional use of the term to describe 
certain  administrative  filings  does  not  alter  its  primary meaning,  which  concerns  the  initiation  of  "a  civil  action." 
Black's  356.  Moreover,  even  if  the  distinction  between  ad-ministrative  and  judicial  proceedings  is  put  aside,  an  MMS 
payment  order  lacks  the  essential  attributes  of  a  complaint. While  a  complaint  is  a  filing  that  commences  a  proceeding 
that may in the end result in a legally binding order provid-ing  relief,  an  MMS  payment  order in  and  of  itself  imposes  a 
legal obligation on the party to which it is issued.  As noted, the  failure  to  comply  with  such  an  order  can  result  in  fines 
of  up  to  $10,000  a  day.  An  MMS  payment  order,  therefore, plays  an  entirely  different  role  from  that  of  a  "complaint."

D 
To the extent that any doubts remain regarding the mean-ing  of  $ 2415(a),  they  are  erased  by  the  rule  that  statutes  of 

limitations  are  construed  narrowly  against  the  government. 
E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v.  Davis,  264 U. S. 456 (1924). 

6 There was some question at oral argument whether MMS' initial letter 
might constitute a "complaint" within the meaning of $ 2415(a).  Petition-
ers did not advance this argument, and recognized at  oral argument that 
neither the statute nor the regulations require the issuance of such a let-
ter.  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  7-9.  The  Government,  for  its  part,  observed  that 
all  such  a  letter  does  is  request  information,  as  the  agency  has  not  yet 
decided whether to assert a claim.  Id.,  at 28.  This is not a complaint.

96  BP  AMERICA  PRODUCTION  CO.  v.  BURTON 

Opinion of the Court 
This canon is rooted in the traditional rule quod  nullum  tem-pus  occurrit  regi--time  does  not  run  against  the  King. 

Guaranty  Trust  Co.  v.  United  States,  304  U. S.  126,  132 (1938).  A  corollary  of  this  rule  is  that  when  the  sovereign 
elects  to  subject  itself  to  a  statute  of  limitations,  the  sover-eign is given the benefit of the doubt if the scope of the stat-
ute is ambiguous. 

Bowers  v.  New  York  &  Albany  Lighterage  Co.,  273  U. S. 346  (1927),  cited  by  petitioners,  is  not  to  the  contrary. 

There, as here, the issue was the scope of a statute of limita-tions.  The  provision  in  that  case,  however,  provided  that 
" `[n]o suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes' " shall  commence  more  than  five  years  after  the  filing  of  the 
return.  Id.,  at  348-349.  The  Government  argued  that  the terms  "proceeding" and "suit"  were coterminous, and  urged 
further  that  any  ambiguity  should  be  resolved  in  its  favor. The  Court  recognized  the  canon,  restating  it  much  as  we 
have  above.  Id.,  at 349.  But the  Court  concluded that the canon had no application in that case because the text of the 
relevant  statute,  unlike  $ 2415(a),  applied  clearly  and  sepa-rately  to  "suits"  and  "proceedings,"  and  the  Court  saw  no 
reason to give these different terms the same meaning.  Id., at 349-350. 

E 
We  come  now  to  petitioners'  argument  that  interpreting $ 2415(a)  as  applying  only  to  judicial  actions  would  render 

subsection  (i)  of  the  same  statute  superfluous.  Subsection (i) provides as follows: 

"The  provisions  of  this  section  shall  not  prevent  the United  States  or  an  officer  or  agency  thereof  from  col-
lecting  any  claim  of  the  United  States  by  means  of  ad-ministrative  offset,  in  accordance  with  section  3716  of 
title 31."  28 U. S. C. $ 2415(i). 
An  administrative  offset  is  a  mechanism  by  which  the  Gov-ernment  withholds  payment  of  a  debt  that  it  owes  another

party in order to recoup a payment that this party owes the Government.  31  U. S. C.  $ 3701(a)(1).  Thus,  under  subsec-

tion (i), the Government may recover a debt via an adminis-trative  offset  even  if  the  Government  would  be  time  barred 
under subsection (a) from pursuing the debt in court. Petitioners  argue  that,  if  $ 2415(a)  applies  only  to  judicial 
proceedings  and  not  to  administrative  proceedings,  there  is no  need  for  $ 2415(i)'s  rule  protecting  a  particular  adminis-
trative  mechanism  (i.  e.,  an  administrative  offset)  from  the statute of limitations set out in subsection (a).  Invoking the 
canon  against  reading  a  statute  in  a  way  that  makes  part of  the  statute  redundant,  see, 

e. g., TRW  Inc.  v.  Andrews, 534  U. S.  19,  31  (2001),  petitioners  contend  that  subsection 

(i) shows that subsection (a) was meant to apply to adminis-trative, as well as judicial, proceedings.  We disagree. 

As  the  Court  of  Appeals  noted,  subsection  (i)  was  not enacted  at  the  same  time  as  subsection  (a)  but  rather  was 
added 16 years later by the Debt Collection Act of 1982.  96 Stat.  1749.  This  enactment  followed  a  dispute  between  the 
Office of the Comptroller General of the United States, head of  the  agency  then  named  the  General  Accounting  Office 
(GAO), and the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Coun-sel  (OLC)  over  whether  an  administrative  offset  could  be 
used  to  recoup  a  debt  where  a  judicial  recoupment  action was already time barred. 

In  1978,  in  response  to  a  question  from  the  United  States Civil  Service  Commission,  OLC  opined  that  an  administra-
tive  offset  could  not  be  used  to  recoup  a  debt  as  to  which  a judicial  action  was  already  time  barred.  OLC  reached  this 
conclusion  not  because  it  believed  that  $ 2415(a)  reached  ad-ministrative  proceedings  generally,

7  but  rather  because  of 

the  particular  purpose  of  an  administrative  offset.  "Where 

7 Indeed,  what  emerges  strikingly  from  OLC's  1978  opinion  is  that  no 
one at the time--neither OLC nor GAO--even contemplated that $ 2415(a) 
applied to administrative procedures in the first instance.  Nor have peti-
tioners pointed to any source demonstrating otherwise.

device."  Memorandum from John M. Harmon, Assistant At-torney  General,  OLC,  to  Alan  K.  Campbell,  Chairman,  U. S.

(Sept. 29, 1978), Joint Lodging.  OLC opined that a prejudg-
ment attachment device  such as  this  exists only  to preserve funds to  satisfy any judgment the  creditor  subsequently ob-

tains.  Id.,  at  4  (citing  cases).  OLC  therefore  concluded that,  where  a  lawsuit  is  already  foreclosed  by  $ 2415(a),  an 
administrative  offset  that  is  the  functional  equivalent  of  a pretrial attachment is also unavailable.

GAO  disagreed.  See  In  re  Collection  of  Debts--Statute 
of Limitations on  Administrative Setoff,  58 Comp. Gen. 501,

"[t]he general rule . . . that statutes of limitations appli-
cable  to  suits  for  debts  or  money  demands  bar  or  run only  against  the  remedy  (the  right  to  bring  suit)  to

309  (Ct.  Cl.  1930),  affirmed  282  U. S.  434;  and  33  Comp. Gen.  66  (1953).  See  also

That  Congress  had  time  barred  the  judicial  remedy,  GAO reasoned, imposed no limit on the administrative remedy. 

The OLC-GAO dispute reveals that, even under the inter-
pretation  of  subsection  (a)--the  one  we  are  adopting--that 
considers  it  applicable  only  to  court  proceedings,  subsection 
(i)  is  not  mere  surplusage.  It  clarifies  that  administrative 
offsets  are  not  covered  by  subsection  (a)  even  if  they  are 
viewed as an adjunct of a court action.

Opinion of the Court 
To  accept  petitioners'  argument,  on  the  other  hand,  we would  have  to  hold  either  that  $ 2415(a)  applied  to  adminis-

trative  actions  when  it  was  enacted  in  1966  or  that  it  was extended  to  reach  administrative  actions  when  subsection 
(i)  was  added  in  1982.  The  clear  meaning  of  the  text  of $ 2415(a),  which  has  not  been  amended,  refutes  the  first  of 
these propositions, and accepting the latter would require us to conclude that in 1982 Congress elected to enlarge $ 2415 to 
cover administrative proceedings by inserting text expressly excluding  a  single  administrative  vehicle  from  the  statute's 
reach.  It  is  entirely  unrealistic  to  suggest  that  Congress would proceed by such an oblique and cryptic route. 

III 
Petitioners contend that interpreting $ 2415(a) as applying only  to  judicial  actions  results  in  a  statutory  scheme  with 

peculiarities  that  Congress  could  not  have  intended.  For example,  petitioners  note  that  while  they  are  required  by 
statute  to  preserve  their  records  regarding  royalty  obliga-tions for only seven years, 30 U. S. C. $ 1724(f), the interpre-
tation  of  $ 2415(a)  adopted  by  the  Court  of  Appeals  permits MMS to issue payment orders that reach back much further. 

We  are  mindful  of  the  fact  that  a  statute  should  be  read where  possible  as  effecting  a  " `symmetrical  and  coherent 
regulatory scheme,' " FDA  v.  Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,  529  U. S.  120,  133  (2000),  but  here  petitioners'  alter-
native  interpretation  of  $ 2415(a)  would  itself  result  in  dis-harmony.  For  instance,  under  FOGRSFA,  MMS  payment 
orders  regarding  oil  and  gas  leases  are  now  prospectively subject to a 7-year statute of limitations except with respect 
to  obligations  arising  out  of  leases  of  Indian  land.  Conse-quently,  if  we  agreed  with  petitioners  that  $ 2415(a)  applies 
generally to administrative proceedings, payment orders re-lating  to  oil  and  gas  royalties  owed  under  leases  of  Indian 
land  would  be  subject  to  a  shorter  (i.  e.,  6-year)  statute  of limitations than similar payment orders relating to leases of

Opinion of the Court 
other  public-domain  lands  (which  would  be  governed  by FOGRSFA's  new  7-year  statute).  Particularly  in  light  of 

Congress' exhortation that the Secretary of the Interior "ag-gressively  carry  out  his  trust  responsibility  in  the  adminis-
tration of Indian oil and gas," 30 U. S. C. $ 1701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that  Congress  intended to  impose  a shorter  statute 
of limitations for payment orders regarding Indian lands. 

Petitioners  contend,  finally,  that  interpreting  $ 2415(a)  as applying only to judicial actions would frustrate the statute's 

purposes  of  providing  repose,  ensuring  that  actions  are brought  while  evidence  is  fresh,  lightening  recordkeeping 
burdens,  and  pressuring  federal  agencies  to  assert  federal 
rights  promptly.  These  are  certainly  cogent  policy  argu-
ments, but they must be viewed in perspective. 

For one thing, petitioners overstate the scope of the prob-
lem, since Congress of course can enact and has enacted spe-
cific  statutes  of  limitations  to  govern  specific  administrative 
actions.  See,  e. g.,  42  U. S. C.  $ 5205(a)(1)  (statute  of  limita-
tions for an administrative action to recover payments made 
to  state  governments  for  disaster  or  emergency  assistance). 
Indeed,  in  1996,  FOGRSFA  imposed  just  such  a  limitation 
prospectively on all non-Indian land, oil, and gas lease claims. 

Second,  and  more  fundamentally,  the  consequences  of  in-
terpreting  $ 2415(a)  as  limited  to  court  actions  must  be  con-
sidered in light of the traditional rule exempting proceedings 
brought by the sovereign  from  any time  bar.  There are  al-
ways  policy  arguments  against  affording  the  sovereign  this 
special  treatment,  and  therefore  in  a  case  like  this,  where 
the issue is how far Congress meant to go when it enacted a 
statute of limitations applicable to the Government, arguing 
that  an  expansive  interpretation  would  serve  the  general 
purposes  of  statutes  of  limitations  is  somewhat  beside  the 
point.  The relevant inquiry, instead, is simply how far Con-
gress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations 
in  question.  Here  prior  to  the  enactment  of  $ 2415(a)  in 
1966,  contract  actions  brought  by  the  Government  were  not

Opinion of the Court 
subject  to  any  statute  of  limitations.  See  Guaranty  Trust Co.,  304 U. S., at 132.  Absent congressional action changing 

this rule, it remains the law, and the text of $ 2415(a) betrays no  intent  to  change  this  rule  as  it  applies  to  administrative 
proceedings. In the final analysis, while we appreciate petitioners' argu-
ments,  they  are  insufficient  to  overcome  the  plain  meaning of  the  statutory  text.  We  therefore  hold  that  the  6-year 
statute of limitations in $ 2415(a) applies only to court actions and  not  to  the  administrative  proceedings  involved  in  this 
case.  * * * 

For  these  reasons,  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed. 

It  is  so  ordered.

allege  that  element,"  Pet.  for  Cert.  9,  n.  3,  " `[i]t  is  not  the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional na-
ture  unless  absolutely  necessary  to  a  decision  of  the  case,' " Ashwander  v.  TVA,  297  U. S.  288,  347  (1936)  (Brandeis,  J., 
concurring)  (quoting  Burton  v.  United  States,  196  U. S.  283, 295  (1905)).  For  that  reason,  after  oral  argument  we  or-
dered  the  parties  to  file  supplemental  briefs  directed  to  the question whether respondent's indictment was in  fact defec-
tive.  We  conclude  that  it  was  not  and  therefore  reverse without reaching the harmless-error issue. 

I 
Respondent was deported twice, once in 1988 and again in 2002, before his attempted reentry on June 1, 2003.  On that 

day,  respondent  walked  up  to  a  port  of  entry  and  displayed a photo identification of his cousin to the border agent.  Re-
spondent told the agent that he was a legal resident and that he was traveling to Calexico, California.  Because he did not 
resemble  his  cousin,  respondent  was  questioned,  taken  into custody, and ultimately charged with a violation of 8 U. S. C. 

$ 1326(a).1  The indictment alleged: 

1 Title 8 U. S. C. $ 1326 provides, in part: 
"Reentry of removed aliens 
"(a)  In general 

"Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien who--

Opinion of the Court 
"On  or  about  June  1,  2003,  JUAN  RESENDIZ-PONCE,  an  alien,  knowingly  and  intentionally  at-

tempted  to  enter  the  United  States  of  America  at  or near  San  Luis  in  the  District  of  Arizona,  after  having 
been  previously  denied  admission,  excluded,  deported, and removed from the United States at or near Nogales, 
Arizona,  on  or  about  October  15,  2002,  and  not  hav-ing  obtained  the  express  consent  of  the  Secretary  of 

the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  to  reapply  for admission. 

"In  violation  of  Title  8,  United  States  Code,  Sections 1326(a) and enhanced by (b)(2)."  App. 8. 

Respondent  moved  to  dismiss  the  indictment,  contending that  it  "fail[ed]  to  allege  an  essential  element,  an  overt  act, 
or to state  the essential facts of such overt  act."  Id.,  at 12. The  District  Court  denied  the  motion  and,  after  the  jury 
found  him  guilty,  sentenced  respondent  to  a  63-month  term of imprisonment. 

The Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning that an indictment's omission  of  "an  essential  element  of  the  offense  is  a  fatal 
flaw  not  subject  to  mere  harmless  error  analysis."  425  F. 3d  729,  732  (2005).  In  the  court's  view,  respondent's  indict-
ment  was  fatally  flawed  because  it  nowhere  alleged  "any specific overt act that is a substantial step" toward the com-
pletion of the unlawful reentry.2  Id., at 733.  The panel ma-jority explained: 

"shall  be  fined  under  title  18,  or  imprisoned  not  more  than  2  years,  or 
both." 

2 In the opinion of the Ninth Circuit, the five elements of the offense of 

attempted reentry in violation of $ 1326(a) are: 
"(1)  [T]he defendant had the purpose, i. e., conscious desire, to reenter the 
United States without the express consent of the Attorney General; (2) the 
defendant  committed  an  overt  act  that  was  a  substantial  step  towards 
reentering  without  that  consent;  (3)  the  defendant  was  not  a  citizen  of 
the United  States;  (4) the  defendant had  previously  been  lawfully  denied 
admission,  excluded,  deported  or  removed  from  the  United  States;  and

106  UNITED  STATES  v.  RESENDIZ-PONCE 

Opinion of the Court 
"The defendant has a right to be apprised of what overt act the government will try to prove at trial, and he has 

a right to have a grand jury consider whether to charge that specific overt act.  Physical crossing into a govern-
ment  inspection  area  is  but  one  of  a  number  of  other acts  that  the  government  might  have  alleged  as  a  sub-
stantial step toward entry into the United States.  The indictment  might  have  alleged  the  tendering  a  bogus 
identification  card;  it  might  have  alleged  successful clearance of the inspection area; or it might have alleged 
lying  to  an  inspection  officer  with  the  purpose  of  being admitted.  .  .  .  A  grand  jury  never  passed  on  a  specific 
overt  act, and Resendiz  was never  given  notice of what specific overt act would be proved at trial." 

Ibid. 

Judge  Reavley  concurred,  agreeing  that  Ninth  Circuit precedent  mandated  reversal.  If  not  bound  by  precedent, 

however, he would have found the indictment to be "constitu-tionally sufficient" because it clearly informed respondent "of 
the  precise  offense  of  which  he  [was]  accused  so  that  he [could]  prepare  his  defense  and  so  that  a  judgment  thereon 
[would] safeguard him from a subsequent prosecution for the same offense." 

Ibid.  II 

At  common  law,  the  attempt  to  commit  a  crime  was  itself a  crime  if  the  perpetrator  not  only  intended  to  commit  the 
completed  offense,  but  also  performed  " `some  open  deed tending to the execution of his intent.' "  2 W. LaFave, Sub-
stantive Criminal Law $ 11.2(a), p. 205 (2d ed. 2003) (quoting E. Coke, Third Institute 5 (6th ed. 1680)); see Keedy, Crimi-
nal  Attempts  at  Common  Law,  102  U.  Pa.  L.  Rev.  464,  468 (1954) (noting that common-law attempt required "that some 
act  must  be  done  towards  carrying  out  the  intent").  More

Opinion of the Court 
recently, the requisite "open deed" has been described as an "overt act" that constitutes a "substantial step" toward com-

pleting  the  offense.  2  LaFave,  Substantive  Criminal  Law $ 11.4; see ALI, Model Penal Code $ 5.01(1)(c) (1985) (defining 
"criminal attempt" to include "an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate 
in his commission of the crime"); see also Braxton  v.  United 
States,  500 U. S. 344, 349 (1991) ("For Braxton to be guilty of an  attempted  killing  under  18  U. S. C.  $ 1114,  he  must  have 

taken  a  substantial  step  towards  that  crime,  and  must  also have had the requisite 

mens  rea").  As was true at common 
law,  the  mere  intent  to  violate  a  federal  criminal  statute  is 
not  punishable  as  an  attempt  unless  it  is  also  accompanied 
by significant conduct. 

The Government does not disagree with respondent's sub-
mission that he cannot be guilty of attempted reentry in vio-
lation of 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(a) unless he committed an overt act 
qualifying  as  a  substantial  step  toward  completion  of  his 
goal.  See  Supplemental  Brief  for  United  States  7-8.  Nor 
does it dispute that "[a]n indictment must set forth each ele-
ment  of  the  crime  that  it  charges."  Almendarez-Torres  v. 
United  States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998).  It instead contends 
that the indictment at bar implicitly alleged that respondent 
engaged in  the  necessary overt  act  "simply by  alleging  that 
he  `attempted  to  enter  the  United  States.' "  Supplemental 
Brief for United States 8.  We agree. 

Not only does the word "attempt" as used in common par-
lance  connote  action  rather  than  mere  intent,  but  more  im-
portantly,  as  used  in  the  law  for  centuries,  it  encompasses 
both  the  overt  act  and  intent  elements.  Consequently,  an 
indictment alleging attempted illegal reentry under $ 1326(a) 
need  not  specifically  allege  a  particular  overt  act  or  any 
other  "component  par[t]"  of  the  offense.  See  Hamling  v. 
United  States,  418  U. S.  87,  119  (1974).  Just  as  it  was 
enough for the indictment in Hamling  to allege that the de-
fendant  mailed  "obscene"  material  in  violation  of  18  U. S. C.

108  UNITED  STATES  v.  RESENDIZ-PONCE 

Opinion of the Court 

$ 1461, see 418 U. S., at 117-118, it was enough for the indict-ment  in  this  case  to  point  to  the  relevant  criminal  statute 

and allege that "[o]n or about June 1, 2003,"  respondent "at-tempted  to  enter  the  United  States  of  America  at  or  near 
San Luis in the District of Arizona," 3  App. 8. In Hamling, we identified two constitutional requirements 
for an indictment: "first, [that it] contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge 
against  which  he  must  defend,  and,  second,  [that  it]  enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prose-
cutions  for  the  same  offense."  418  U. S.,  at  117.  In  this case, the  use  of the  word  "attempt,"  coupled with  the  speci-
fication of the time  and place of respondent's attempted  ille-gal reentry, satisfied both.  Indeed, the time-and-place infor-
mation provided respondent with more adequate notice than would an indictment describing particular overt acts.  After 
all,  a  given  defendant  may  have  approached  the  border  or lied  to  a  border-patrol  agent  in  the  course  of  countless  at-
tempts on innumerable occasions.  For the same reason, the time-and-date  specification  in  respondent's  indictment  pro-
vided  ample  protection against  the  risk  of  multiple prosecu-tions for the same crime.

Opinion of the Court 
Respondent  nonetheless  maintains  that  the  indictment would have been sufficient only if it had alleged any of three 

overt  acts  performed  during  his  attempted  reentry:  that  he walked into an inspection area; that he presented a mislead-
ing  identification  card; or that he  lied  to the  inspector.  See Supplemental Brief for  Respondent 7.  Individually  and cu-
mulatively,  those  acts  tend  to  prove  the  charged  attempt-- but  none  was  essential  to  the  finding  of  guilt  in  this  case. 
All three acts were rather part of a single course of conduct culminating  in  the  charged  "attempt."  As  Justice  Holmes 
explained  in  Swift & Co.  v.  United  States,  196  U. S.  375, 396 
(1905), "[t]he unity of the plan embraces all the parts." 5 Respondent  is  of  course  correct  that  while  an  indictment 

parroting  the language  of a  federal criminal  statute is  often sufficient,  there  are  crimes  that  must  be  charged  with 
greater specificity.  See Hamling, 418 U. S., at 117.  A clear example is  the  statute making it a  crime for  a witness  sum-
moned before a congressional committee to refuse to answer 
any  question  "pertinent  to  the  question  under  inquiry."  2 U. S. C.  $ 192.  As  we  explained  at  length  in  our  opinion  in 

Russell  v.  United  States,  369 U. S. 749  (1962), a  valid indict-ment for such a refusal to testify must go beyond the words 
of  $ 192  and  allege  the  subject  of  the  congressional  hearing in  order  to  determine  whether  the  defendant's  refusal  was 
"pertinent."  Based on a number of cases arising out of con-gressional  investigations,  we  recognized  that  the  relevant 
hearing's  subject  was  frequently  uncertain  but  invariably "central  to  every  prosecution  under  the  statute." 

Id., at  
764.  Both to provide fair notice to defendants and to ensure that  any  conviction  would  arise  out  of  the  theory  of  guilt 

5 Likewise, it would it be unrealistic to suggest that respondent actually 
committed three separate attempt offenses involving three different overt 
acts.  Indeed,  if  each  overt  act  were  treated  as  a  separate  element,  an 
attempt involving multiple overt acts might conceivably qualify for several 
separate  offenses,  thus  perversely  enhancing,  rather  than  avoiding,  the 
risk of successive prosecution for the same wrong.

110  UNITED  STATES  v.  RESENDIZ-PONCE 

Opinion of the Court 
presented to the grand jury, we held that indictments under $ 192 must do more than restate the language of the statute. 

Our  reasoning  in  Russell  suggests  that  there  was  no  in-firmity  in  the  present  indictment.  First,  unlike  the  statute 
at  issue  in  Russell,  guilt  under  8  U. S. C.  $ 1326(a)  does  not "depen[d]  so  crucially  upon  such  a  specific  identification  of 
fact."  369 U. S., at 764.  Second, before explaining the spe-cial need for particularity in charges brought under 2 U. S. C. 

$ 192,  Justice  Stewart  noted  that,  in  1872,  Congress  had enacted  a  statute  reflecting  "the  drift  of  the  law  away  from 
the  rules  of  technical  and  formalized  pleading  which  had characterized  an  earlier  era." 

6  369  U. S.,  at  762.  Other 

than  that  statute,  which  was repealed  in  1948,  there was  no other legislation dealing generally with the subject of indict-

ments  until  the  promulgation  of  Federal  Rule  of  Criminal Procedure  7(c)(1).  As  we  have  said,  the  Federal  Rules 
"were designed to eliminate technicalities  in  criminal  plead-ings  and  are  to  be  construed  to  secure  simplicity  in  proce-
dure."  United  States  v.  Debrow,  346  U. S.  374,  376  (1953). While  detailed  allegations  might  well  have  been  required 
under common-law  pleading rules,  see, e. g., Commonwealth v.  Peaslee,  177  Mass.  267,  59  N.  E.  55  (1901),  they  surely 
are  not  contemplated  by  Rule  7(c)(1),  which  provides  that an indictment  "shall  be a  plain, concise,  and definite  written 
statement  of  the  essential  facts  constituting  the  offense charged." 

7 

6 The 1872 statute provided that "no indictment found and presented by 
a grand jury in any district or circuit . . .  shall  be  deemed insufficient, nor 
shall the trial, judgment, or other proceeding thereon be affected by rea-
son  of  any  defect  or  imperfection  in  matter  of  form  only,  which  shall  not 
tend  to  the  prejudice  of  the  defendant."  $ 8,  17  Stat.  198.  The  opinion 
in Russell  noted that the 1872 statute had been repealed, but its substance 
had been preserved in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a).  See 369 
U. S., at 762.

censee to terminate  or be in breach of its  license agreement before  it  can  seek  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  underly-

ing patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. 

I 
Because the declaratory-judgment claims in this case were disposed  of  at  the  motion-to-dismiss  stage,  we  take  the  fol-

lowing  facts  from  the  allegations  in  petitioner's  amended complaint  and  the  unopposed  declarations  that  petitioner 
submitted  in  response  to  the  motion  to  dismiss.  Petitioner MedImmune, Inc., manufactures Synagis, a drug used to pre-
vent respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. In  1997,  petitioner  entered  into  a  patent  license  agreement 
with  respondent  Genentech,  Inc.  (which  acted  on  behalf  of itself as patent assignee and on behalf of the  coassignee, re-
spondent  City  of  Hope).  The  license  covered  an  existing patent  relating  to  the  production  of  "chimeric  antibodies" 
and  a  then-pending  patent  application  relating  to  "the  co-expression  of  immunoglobulin  chains  in  recombinant  host 
cells."  Petitioner  agreed  to  pay  royalties  on  sales  of  "Li-censed  Products,"  and  respondents  granted  petitioner  the 
right  to  make,  use,  and  sell  them.  The  agreement  defined "Licensed  Products"  as  a  specified  antibody,  "the  manufac-
ture,  use  or  sale  of  which  .  .  .  would,  if  not  licensed  under th[e]  Agreement,  infringe  one  or  more  claims  of  either  or 
both  of  [the  covered  patents,]  which  have  neither  expired nor  been held  invalid by  a court or other body of competent 
jurisdiction from which no appeal has been or may be taken." App.  399.  The  license  agreement  gave  petitioner  the  right 
to terminate upon six months' written notice. In December  2001, the "coexpression"  application covered 
by the 1997 license agreement matured into the "Cabilly II" patent.  Soon  thereafter,  respondent  Genentech  delivered 
petitioner a letter expressing its belief that Synagis was cov-ered  by  the  Cabilly  II  patent  and  its  expectation  that  peti-
tioner  would  pay  royalties  beginning  March  1,  2002.  Peti-tioner did not think royalties were owing, believing that the

Opinion of the Court 

II 
At  the  outset,  we  address  a  disagreement  concerning  the 
nature of the dispute at issue here--whether it involves only 
a  freestanding  claim  of  patent  invalidity  or  rather  a  claim 
that, both because of patent invalidity and because of nonin-
fringement,  no  royalties  are  owing  under  the  license  agree-
ment.2  That  probably  makes  no  difference  to  the  ultimate 
issue of subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is well to be clear 
about the nature of the case before us. 

Respondents contend that petitioner "is not seeking an in-
terpretation  of  its  present  contractual  obligations."  Brief 
for Respondent Genentech 37; see also Brief for Respondent 
City  of  Hope  48-49.  They  claim  this  for  two  reasons:  (1) 
because there is no dispute that Synagis infringes the Cabilly 
II patent, thereby making royalties payable; and (2) because 
while  there  is  a  dispute  over  patent  validity,  the  contract 
calls  for  royalties  on  an  infringing  product  whether  or  not 
the  underlying  patent  is  valid.  See  Brief  for  Respondent 
Genentech  7,  37.  The  first  point  simply  does  not  comport 
with the allegations of petitioner's amended complaint.  The 
very  first  count  requested  a  "DECLARATORY

(2000),1  but  the  trial  court  justified  such  a  sentence  on the  ground  that  running  the  three  terms  concurrently 
would  result  in  a  sentence  "clearly  too  lenient"  in  light  of the  purposes of Washington's sentencing scheme.  See 

$ 9.94A.390(2)(i).2  The  second  basis  on  which  the  court  cal-
culated a 562-month term was by running the sentences con-currently  but  imposing  an  exceptional  sentence  of  562 

months  solely  for  the  rape  conviction--again  on  the  ground that  the  total  sentence  would  otherwise  be  "clearly  too  le-
nient."  State  v.  Burton, 1997 WL 306429, at *13. After  an  unrelated  prior  conviction  was  overturned,  Bur-
ton  requested  resentencing.  Accordingly,  over  a  year  after the 1994 judgment, the trial court entered an amended judg-
ment and  sentence (1996 judgment),  which, after  recalculat-ing  Burton's  offender  scores,  imposed  a  new  sentence  that 
relied  solely  on  an  exceptional  562-month  sentence  for  the 
rape  conviction,  run  concurrently  with  the  other  two  terms. 
Ibid.;  App.  45.  On  direct  review,  the  Washington  Court  of 
Appeals  upheld  Burton's  conviction,  State  v.  Burton,  supra, 
a  decision  the  Washington  Supreme  Court  declined  to  re-
view, State  v.  Burton, 133 Wash. 2d 1025, 950 P. 2d 475 (1997), 
cert.  denied,  523  U. S.  1082  (1998).  The  State  Court  of  Ap-
peals remanded for resentencing, however, because the trial 
court's  exclusive  reliance  on  the  exceptional  rape  sentence 
decreased  Burton's  potential  early  release  credits,  raising 
vindictiveness  concerns.  State  v.  Burton,  1997  WL  306429,

In  response,  on  March  16,  1998,  the  trial  court  entered  a second  amended  judgment  and  sentence  (1998  judgment). 

App.  3.  In  this  judgment,  the  trial  court  recited  the  jury's 1994  guilty  verdicts, 

id.,  at  3-4,  and  again  imposed  a  562-
month sentence, reverting to its original basis for doing so-- running the three within-guidelines sentences consecutively, 

id., at 7, 29-32.  Burton sought review of this sentence, but 
the  Washington  courts  eventually  rejected  his  challenges both  on  direct  review  and  in  state  postconviction  proceed-

ings.  Id.,  at 43-55; App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a-4a. On  December  28,  1998,  while  state  review  of  his  sentence 
was  still  pending,  Burton  filed  a  petition  under  28  U. S. C. 

$ 2254  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  in  the  United  States  Dis-
trict Court for the Western District of Washington (1998 pe-
tition).  App.  34.  The  standard  form  he  filled  out  warned 
applicants that they must "ordinarily first exhaust . . . avail-
able  state  court  remedies  as  to  each  ground  on  which"  they 
sought "action by the federal court," or run the risk of being 
"barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date." 
Id.,  at  37-38.  Burton  nonetheless  challenged  his  custody 
only  by  disputing  the  constitutionality  of  his  three  convic-
tions,  not  by  pressing  any  sentencing  claims.  Where  the 
form  requested  the  "[d]ate  of judgment  of  conviction,"  Bur-
ton listed "Dec. 16, 1994," corresponding roughly to the date 
of the 1994 judgment.  Id.,  at 34.  The form asked whether 
the  applicant  had  "any  petition  or  appeal  now  pending  in 
any  court,  either  state  or  federal,  as to the judgment  under 
attack,"  to  which  Burton  answered  "Yes,"  explaining  that 
"[the]  sentence  I  received  at  resentencing  is  on  direct  ap-
peal."  Id.,  at 40 (emphasis  added).  The District Court de-
nied relief, id., at 42, and the United States Court of Appeals 
for  the  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed,  Burton  v.  Walter,  21  Fed. 
Appx. 632 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U. S. 1060 (2002). 

Over  three  years  subsequent  to  filing  the  1998  petition, 
after  the  Washington  courts  had  rejected  his  sentencing 
challenges, Burton filed another federal habeas petition (2002

petition), again in the Western District of Washington.  This time,  Burton  claimed  to  be  contesting  the  1998  judgment, 

and challenged only the constitutionality of his sentence.  In particular,  he  alleged  that  it  violated  our  decision  in  Ap-
prendi  v.  New Jersey,  530  U. S.  466  (2000),  to the  extent the sentencing  court  departed  from  a  standard  sentence  based 
on its own factual determinations.  The District Court again denied the petition,  App. 77,  and the Ninth Circuit again af-
firmed,  Burton  v.  Waddington,  142  Fed.  Appx.  297  (2005). Both courts rejected the State's contention that the District 
Court  lacked  jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  petition  because Burton had not obtained an order from the Court of Appeals 
authorizing  him  to file  a "second  or successive"  habeas peti-tion,  as  required  by  the  habeas  gatekeeping  provisions,  28 
U. S. C.  $ 2244(b)(3).  On  the  merits,  the  Ninth  Circuit  re-jected  Burton's 

Apprendi  claim  and  agreed  with  the  State that  Burton  could  not  benefit  from  Blakely  v.  Washington, 

542  U. S.  296,  because  that  decision  announced  a  new  rule that  did  not  apply  retroactively  to  Burton's  sentence.  142 
Fed. Appx., at 299. It is this petition, the 2002 petition, that is before us today. 
We conclude, though, that because the 2002 petition is a "sec-ond or successive" petition that Burton did not seek or obtain 
authorization to file in the District Court, the District Court never had jurisdiction to consider it in the first place. 

II 
The  Antiterrorism  and  Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of 1996  (AEDPA)  established  a  stringent  set  of  procedures 

that  a  prisoner  "in  custody  pursuant  to  the  judgment  of  a State  court,"  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254(a),  must  follow  if  he  wishes 
to  file  a  "second  or  successive"  habeas  corpus  application challenging that custody, $ 2244(b)(1).  In pertinent part, be-
fore  filing  the  application  in  the  district  court,  a  prisoner "shall move in the  appropriate court  of  appeals  for  an order 
authorizing  the  district  court  to  consider  the  application."

$ 2244(b)(3)(A).  A three-judge panel of the court of appeals may authorize  the  filing of the second or  successive applica-

tion  only  if  it  presents  a  claim  not  previously  raised  that satisfies  one  of  the  two  grounds  articulated  in  $ 2244(b)(2).

Felker  v.  Turpin,  518  U. S.  651,  656-657, 
664 (1996). 

Burton's 2002 petition was a "second or successive" habeas application  for  which  he  did  not  seek,  much  less  obtain,  au-

thorization  to  file.  When  Burton  filed  his  first  petition,  the 1998  petition,  he  was  being  held  in  custody  pursuant  to  the 
1998  judgment,  which  had  been  entered  some  nine  months 
earlier.  When he filed his second petition, the 2002 petition, 
he was still being held in custody pursuant to the same 1998 
judgment.  In  short,  Burton  twice  brought  claims  contest-
ing  the  same  custody  imposed  by  the  same  judgment  of  a 
state court.  As a result, under AEDPA, he was required to 
receive authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing 
his second challenge.  Because he did not do so, the District 
Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it. 

The  Ninth  Circuit  determined  that  the  2002  petition  was 
not  "second  or  successive"  because,  under  McCleskey  v. 
Zant,  499  U. S.  467  (1991),  Burton  had  a  "legitimate  excuse 
for failing to raise" his sentencing challenges in the 1998 peti-
tion.  142  Fed.  Appx.,  at  299  (quoting  McCleskey,  supra,  at 
490;  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Specifically,  the 
Ninth  Circuit  reasoned  that  because  Burton  had  not  ex-
hausted  his  sentencing  claims  in  state  court  when  he  filed 
the 1998 petition, "they were not ripe for federal habeas re-
view" at that time.  142 Fed. Appx., at 298. 

We assume for purposes of this case, without deciding, that 
the  Ninth  Circuit's  "legitimate  excuse"  approach  to  deter-
mining  whether  a  petition  is  "second  or  successive"  is  cor-
rect.  That  court's  ruling  that  Burton  had a  "legitimate ex-
cuse,"  however,  is  inconsistent  with  the  precise  practice  we 
have  explained  governs  in  circumstances  such  as  Burton's.

154  BURTON  v.  STEWART 

Per Curiam 
The  plurality  opinion  in  Rose  v.  Lundy,  455  U. S.  509,  520- 522  (1982),  stated that  district  courts should  dismiss "mixed 

petitions"--those  with  exhausted  and  unexhausted  claims-- and  that  petitioners  with  such  petitions  have  two  options. 
They may withdraw a mixed petition, exhaust the remaining claims,  and  return  to  district  court  with  a  fully  exhausted 
petition.  We have held that in such circumstances the later 
filed  petition would not be "second  or successive."  Slack  v. 
McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 485-486 (2000). 

Alternatively, prisoners filing mixed petitions may proceed with only the exhausted claims, but doing so risks subjecting 

later  petitions  that  raise  new  claims  to  rigorous  procedural obstacles. 

Lundy,  supra,  at 520-521 (plurality opinion); see 
also  Slack,  supra,  at  486-487.  As  noted,  the  form  Burton used  in  filing  his  first  petition  warned  of  just  that  conse-

quence.  App. 37-38; supra,  at 151.  There is no basis in our cases  for  supposing,  as  the  Ninth  Circuit  did,  that  a  peti-
tioner  with  unexhausted  claims  who  chooses  the  second  of these  options--who  elects  to  proceed  to  adjudication  of  his 
exhausted  claims--may  later  assert  that  a  subsequent  peti-
tion  is  not  "second  or  successive"  precisely  because  his  new claims  were  unexhausted  at  the  time  he  filed  his  first  peti-

tion.  This reasoning conflicts with both Lundy  and $ 2244(b) 
and  would  allow  prisoners  to  file  separate  habeas  petitions 
in  the  not  uncommon  situation  where  a  conviction  is  upheld 
but  a  sentence  is  reversed.  Such  a  result  would  be  incon-
sistent  with  both  the  exhaustion  requirement,  with  its  pur-
pose  of  reducing  "piecemeal  litigation,"  Duncan  v.  Walker, 
533  U. S.  167,  180  (2001),  and  AEDPA,  with  its  goal  of 
"streamlining federal habeas proceedings," Rhines  v.  Weber, 
544 U. S. 269, 277 (2005). 

Burton  directs  us  to  two  decisions,  Stewart  v.  MartinezVillareal,  523  U. S.  637  (1998),  and  Slack,  supra,  in  which 
we have not  regarded subsequent petitions to be "second or 
successive."  But  these  cases  are  readily  distinguishable. 
In  Martinez-Villareal,  we  held  that  the  claim  of  a  capital 
prisoner  that  he  was  insane  and  therefore  could  not  be  put

to death was necessarily unripe until the State issued a war-rant  for  his  execution,  and  so  the  prisoner's  subsequent  re-

quest  for  consideration  of  that  previously  unripe  claim  was not  "second  or  successive"  for  purposes  of  $ 2244(b).  523 
U. S., at 644-645.  But unlike Burton, the prisoner there had attempted  to  bring  this  claim  in  his  initial  habeas  petition, 
prompting  us  to  look  to  Lundy  in  concluding  that  the  claim 
"should be treated in the same manner as the claim of a peti-tioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting 

state  remedies,"  that  is,  characterizing  it  as  not  "second  or successive." 

Martinez-Villareal,  523 U. S., at 644.  Indeed, 
we  expressly  declined  to  address  the  situation  where  a  pe-titioner  fails  to  raise  the  claim  in  the  initial  petition.  See 

id.,  at  645,  n.  In  this  case,  Burton  did  not  raise  the  rele-vant  claims  in  his  1998  petition.  Without  more,  therefore, 
our  holding in  Martinez-Villareal  does  not  support  the  con-clusion  that  Burton's  2002  petition  was  not  "second  or 
successive." 

Slack  is equally unhelpful to Burton; that decision merely 
confirmed that when a "first" petition is dismissed because it 
contains unexhausted claims, a prisoner returning later with a  fully  exhausted  petition  would  not  confront  the  "second 

or  successive"  bar.  529  U. S.,  at  485-486.  We  held  that  a 
"petition  filed  after  a  mixed  petition  has  been  dismissed 
under  Rose  v.  Lundy  before  the  district  court  adjudicated 
any  claims  is  to  be  treated  as  `any  other  first  petition'  and 
is not a second or successive petition."  Id.,  at 487 (emphasis 
added).  See  also  id.,  at  478  ("[A]  habeas  petition  which  is 
filed  after  an  initial  petition  was  dismissed  without  adjudi-
cation  on  the  merits  for  failure  to  exhaust  state  remedies 
is  not  a  `second  or  successive'  petition"  (emphasis  added)). 
Burton's  case  is  quite  different--his  first  petition  was  not 
subject to dismissal as containing unexhausted claims, and in 
fact was adjudicated on the merits. 

Moving  beyond  the  ground  relied  upon  by  the  Ninth  Cir-
cuit,  Burton  argues  that  his  1998  and  2002  petitions  chal-
lenged different judgments.  He notes that his 1998 petition

Per Curiam 
identified the pertinent judgment as the 1994 judgment, App. 
34,  while  the  2002  petition  challenged  the  sentence  imposed 
in  the  1998  judgment.  The  1998  judgment,  however,  had 
been  entered  nine  months  before  Burton  filed  his  first  peti-
tion.  That judgment, the same one challenged in the subse-
quent  2002  petition,  was  the  judgment  pursuant  to  which 
Burton  was being  detained.  Unlike  In  re Taylor,  171  F. 3d 
185 (CA4 1999), cited by Burton, there was no new judgment 
intervening  between  the  two  habeas  petitions.  In  his  1998 
petition,  Burton  specifically  described  his  unexhausted  sen-
tencing  claims  as  claims  "as  to  the  judgment  under  attack," 
App.  40,  belying  any  notion  that  those  claims  arose  from  a 
judgment distinct from the one challenged in 1998.3 

Burton finally contends that had he not filed the 1998 peti-
tion  when  he  did,  and  instead  waited  until  state  review  of 
his sentencing claims  was complete, he risked losing the op-
portunity  to  challenge  his  conviction  in  federal  court  due  to 
AEDPA's  1-year  statute  of  limitations.  See  $ 2244(d)(1). 
But  this  argument  misreads  AEDPA,  which  states  that  the 
limitations  period  applicable  to  "a  person  in  custody  pursu-
ant to the judgment of a State court" shall run from, as rele-
vant here, "the date on which the judgment became final by 
the  conclusion of direct review  or  the  expiration of the  time 
for seeking such review."  $ 2244(d)(1)(A).  "Final judgment 
in  a  criminal  case  means  sentence.  The  sentence  is  the 
judgment."  Berman  v.  United  States,  302  U. S.  211,  212 
(1937).  Accordingly,  Burton's  limitations  period  did  not 
begin  until  both  his  conviction  and  sentence  "became  final 

3 For the same reasons, Burton's reliance on Castro v.  United  States, 540 
U. S. 375 (2003), is misplaced.  That case reversed a lower court's rechar-
acterization of a  motion requesting a  new trial  pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Criminal Procedure 33 as a first habeas petition.  Here Burton filed his 
first habeas petition as such in 1998; it involves no similar "recharacteriza-
tion"  to  recognize  that  the judgment  pursuant to  which  Burton was  con-
fined  at  the  time  was  the  same  judgment  that  gave  rise  to  the  sentence 
later challenged in his second habeas petition.

by  the  conclusion  of  direct  review  or  the  expiration  of  the time  for  seeking  such  review"--which  occurred  well  after 

Burton filed his 1998 petition. Burton argues in rebuttal that this reasoning would neces-
sarily mean the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the 1998 petition, but he is mistaken.  Section 2254(a) states 
that  a  district  court  "shall  entertain"  a  habeas  petition  "in behalf  of  a  person  in  custody  pursuant  to  the  judgment  of 
a  State  court."  When  he  filed  the  1998  petition,  Burton assuredly  was  "in  custody  pursuant  to  the  judgment  of  a 
State  court"--even  if,  at  that  point,  the  1998  judgment  was not  final  for  purposes  of  triggering  AEDPA's  statute  of 
limitations. The long and short of it is that Burton neither sought nor 
received  authorization  from  the  Court  of  Appeals  before  fil-ing  his  2002  petition,  a  "second  or  successive"  petition  chal-
lenging  his  custody,  and  so  the  District  Court  was  without jurisdiction  to  entertain  it.  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of 
Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit  is  therefore  vacated,  and  the case  is  remanded  with  instructions  to  direct  the  District 
Court  to  dismiss  the  habeas  petition  for  lack  of  jurisdiction. 

It  is  so  ordered.

the  causation  standards  for  negligence  and  contributory  negligence 
were the same, and FELA did not expressly depart from this approach. 
This is strong evidence against Missouri's practice of applying different 
standards,  which  is  apparently  unique  among  the  States.  Departing 
from the common-law practice would in any event have been a peculiar 
approach  for  Congress  to  take  in  FELA:  As  a  practical  matter,  it  is 
difficult to reduce damages "in proportion" to the employee's negligence 
if  the  relevance  of  each  party's  negligence  is  measured  by  a  different 
causation standard.  The Court  thinks it  far simpler for  a jury to con-
duct the apportionment FELA mandates if the jury compares like with 
like.  Contrary to Sorrell's argument, the use of the language "in whole 
or in part" with respect to railroad negligence in FELA Section 1, but 
not with respect to employee contributory negligence in Section 3, does 
not justify a departure from the common-law practice of applying a sin-
gle causation standard.  It would have made little sense to include the 
"in whole or in part" language in Section 3; if the employee's contribu-
tory negligence contributed "in whole" to his injury, there would be no 
recovery  against  the  railroad  in  the  first  place.  The  language  made 
sense  in  Section  1,  however,  to  clarify  that  there  could  be  recovery 
against  the  railroad  even  if  it  were  only  partially  responsible  for  the 
injury.  In any event, there is no reason to read the statute as a whole 
to encompass different causation standards, since Section 3 simply does 
not address causation.  Finally, FELA's remedial  purpose cannot  com-
pensate  for  the  lack  of  statutory  text:  FELA  does  not  abrogate  the 
common-law approach.  A review of FELA model instructions indicates 
that  there  are  a  variety  of  ways  to  instruct  a  jury  to  apply  the  same 
causation  standard  to  railroad  negligence  and  employee  contributory 
negligence.  Missouri  has  the  same  flexibility  as  other  jurisdictions  in 
deciding how to do so, so long as it now joins them in applying a single 
standard.  On  remand,  the  Missouri  Court  of  Appeals  should  address 
Sorrell's argument that any error in the jury instructions was harmless, 
and  should  determine  whether  a  new  trial  is  required.  Pp.  165-172.

off  the  road;  according  to  Woodin,  Sorrell  drove  his  truck into a ditch. 

On June 18, 2002, Sorrell filed suit against Norfolk in Mis-souri  state  court  under  FELA,  alleging  that  Norfolk  failed 
to provide him with a reasonably safe place to work and that its  negligence  caused  his  injuries.  Norfolk  responded  that 
Sorrell's own negligence caused the accident. Missouri  purports  to  apply  different  standards  of  causa-
tion  to  railroad  and  employee  contributory  negligence  in  its approved  jury  instructions  for  FELA  liability.  The  in-

negligence  would  have  been  a  peculiar  approach  for  Con-gress  to  take  in  FELA.  As  one  court  explained,  under 

FELA, 

"[a]s  to  both  attack  or  defense,  there  are  two  common elements,  (1)  negligence,  i. e.,  the  standard  of  care,  and 

(2)  causation,  i. e.,  the  relation  of  the  negligence  to  the injury.  So far as negligence is concerned, that standard 
is  the  same--ordinary  prudence--for  both  Employee and Railroad alike.  Unless a contrary result is impera-
tive, it is, at best, unfortunate if two standards of causa-tion are used."

Opinion of the Court 
that  contributory  negligence  is  no  longer  a  complete  bar  to recovery, there is no reason to read the statute as a whole to 

encompass  different  causation  standards.  Section  3  simply does not address causation.  On the question whether a dif-
ferent standard of causation applies as between the two par-ties, the statutory text is silent. 

Finally,  in  urging  that  a  higher  standard  of  causation  for 
plaintiff  contributory  negligence  is  acceptable,  Sorrell  in-vokes  FELA's  remedial  purpose  and  our  history  of  liberal 

construction.  We  are  not  persuaded.  FELA  was  indeed enacted to benefit railroad employees, as the express abroga-
tion of such common-law defenses as assumption of risk, the 
contributory  negligence  bar,  and  the  fellow  servant  rule 
make clear.  See Ayers,

definition  accepted  by  the  BIA  and  the  Ninth  and  other  Circuits:  the 
"taking of property or an exercise of control over property without con-
sent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits 
of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent." 
Penuliar  v.  Gonzales,  435  F.  3d  961,  969.  Since,  as  the  record  shows, 
state and federal criminal law now uniformly treats principals and aid-
ers and abettors alike, "the generic sense in which" the term "theft" "is 
now  used  in  the  criminal  codes  of  most  States,"  Taylor,  supra,  at  598, 
covers such "aiders and abettors" as well as principals.  And the crimi-
nal  activities  of  these  aiders  and  abettors  of  a  generic  theft  thus  fall 
within the scope of the term "theft" in the federal statute.  Pp. 189-190. 

(b)  The  Court  rejects  respondent's  argument  that  Cal.  Veh.  Code 
Ann. $ 10851, through the California courts' application of a "natural and 
probable consequences" doctrine, creates a subspecies of the crime fall-
ing outside the generic "theft" definition.  The fact that, under Califor-
nia  law,  an  aider  and  abettor  is  criminally  responsible  not  only  for  the 
crime  he  intends,  but  also  for  any  crime  that  naturally  and  probably 
results  from  his  intended  crime,  does  not  in  itself  show  that  the  state 
statute  covers  a  nongeneric  theft  crime.  Relatively  few  jurisdictions 
have  expressly  rejected  the  "natural  and  probable  consequences"  doc-
trine,  and  many  States  and  the  Federal  Government  apply  some  form 
or  variation  of  that  doctrine  or  permit  jury  inferences  of  intent  in  cir-
cumstances similar to those in which California has applied the doctrine. 
To succeed, respondent must show something special about California's 
version  of  the  doctrine.  His  attempt  to  show  that,  unlike  most  other 
States,  California  makes  a  defendant  criminally  liable  for  conduct  he 
did not intend, not even as a known or  almost certain byproduct of his 
intentional  acts,  fails  because  the  California  cases  respondent  cites  do 
not show that California's law is applied in such a way that is somehow 
broader in  scope than other  States' laws.  Moreover, to  find that state 
law creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a 
federal statute requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibil-
ity, that the State would apply its statute to conduct falling outside the 
generic  definition.  To  make  that  showing,  an  offender  must  at  least 
point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did 
apply  the  statute  in  the  special  (nongeneric)  manner  for  which  he  ar-
gues.  Respondent makes no such showing.  Pp. 190-194. 

(c)  Respondent's additional claims--that $ 10851 (1) holds liable acces-
sories after the fact, who need not be shown to have committed a theft, 
and (2) applies to joyriding, which falls outside the generic "theft" defi-
nition--are  not  considered  here  because  they  do  not  fall  within  the 
terms of the question presented, the lower court did not consider them, 
and this Court declines to reach them in the first instance.  P. 194.

186  GONZALES  v.  DUENAS-ALVAREZ 

Opinion of the Court 
a  listed  offense  (e. g.,  "theft  offense"),  the  lower  courts  uni-formly have applied the approach this Court set forth in 

Tay-
lor v.  United  States,  495  U. S.  575  (1990).  E. g.,  Soliman  v. 
Gonzales,  419  F.  3d  276,  284  (CA4  2005);  Abimbola  v.  Ash-
croft, 378 F. 3d 173, 176-177 (CA2 2004);  Huerta-Guevara v. 
Ashcroft,  321  F.  3d  883,  886-888  (CA9  2003);  HernandezMancilla v.  INS, 246 F. 3d 1002, 1008-1009 (CA7 2001). 

Taylor  concerned  offenses  listed  in  the  federal  Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e) (2000 ed. and  Supp. 

IV).  That  Act  mandates  a  lengthy  prison  sentence  for  of-fenders with previous convictions for, 

e. g., a "violent felony"; 
and  the  Act  sets  forth  certain  specific  crimes,  e. g.,  "bur-
glary," included in this category.  The Court, in Taylor, con-
sidered  whether  a  conviction  for  violating  a  state  statute 
criminalizing  certain  burglary-like  behavior  fell  within  the 
listed federal term "burglary."  495 U. S., at 589, 598. 

The Court held  that Congress  meant its  listed  term "bur-
glary"  to  refer  to  a  specific  crime,  i. e.,  " `burglary' "  in  "the 
generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal 
codes  of  most  States."  Id.,  at  598  (emphasis  added).  The 
Court also held that a state conviction qualifies as a burglary 
conviction,  "regardless  of "  the  "exact  [state]  definition  or 
label" as long as it has the "basic elements" of "generic" bur-
glary,  namely,  "unlawful  or  unprivileged  entry  into,  or  re-
maining  in,  a  building  or  structure,  with  intent  to  commit  a 
crime."  Id., at 599.  The Court added that, when a sentenc-
ing court seeks to determine whether a particular prior con-
viction was for a generic burglary offense, it should normally 
look  not  to  the  facts  of  the  particular  prior  case,  but  rather 
to  the  state  statute  defining  the  crime  of  conviction.  Id., 
at 599-600. 

The Court further noted that a "few States' burglary stat-
utes"  "define  burglary  more  broadly"  to  include  both  a  (ge-
nerically defined) listed crime and also one or more nonlisted 
crimes.  Id.,  at  599.  For  example,  Massachusetts  defines 
"burglary" as including not only breaking into " `a building' "

Opinion of the Court 
but  also  breaking  into  a  "vehicle"  (which  falls  outside  the 
generic  definition of  "burglary," for  a car  is  not  a  " `building 
or structure' ").  See Shepard v.  United States, 544 U. S. 13, 
16,  17  (2005);  see  also  Taylor,  495  U. S.,  at  599  (discussing 
Missouri burglary statutes).  In such cases the Court's "cat-
egorical  approach"  permits  the  sentencing  court  "to  go  be-
yond  the  mere  fact  of  conviction"  in  order  to  determine 
whether  the  earlier  "jury  was  actually  required  to  find  all 
the  elements  of  generic  burglary."  Id.,  at  602;  see  also 
Conteh  v.  Gonzales,  461  F.  3d  45,  54  (CA1  2006)  (observing 
that  some  courts  refer  to  this  step  of  the  Taylor  inquiry  as 
a "modified categorical approach").  "For example," the sen-
tencing court might examine "the indictment or information 
and jury instructions" in the earlier case.  495 U. S., at 602. 
In Shepard, we added that, in a nonjury case, the sentencing 
court  might  examine  not  only  the  "charging  document"  but 
also "the terms of a plea agreement," the "transcript of collo-
quy between judge and defendant," or "some comparable ju-
dicial record" of  information about  the  "factual  basis for  the 
plea."  544 U. S., at 26. 

II 

The  case  before  us  concerns  the  application  of  the  frame-
work  just  set  forth  to  Luis  Duenas-Alvarez,  the  respondent 
here,  a  permanent  resident  alien  of  the  United  States.  In 
2002,  Duenas-Alvarez  was  convicted  of  violating  Cal.  Veh. 
Code Ann. $ 10851(a) (West 2000).  That section states: 

"Any person who drives or takes a vehicle not his or her 
own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with 
intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the 
owner  thereof  of  his  or  her  title  to  or  possession  of  the 
vehicle,  whether  with  or  without  intent  to  steal  the 
vehicle,  or  any  person  who  is  a  party  or  an  accessory 
to or an accomplice in the driving or unauthorized tak-
ing or stealing, is  guilty  of a public  offense."  (Empha-

sis added.)

188  GONZALES  v.  DUENAS-ALVAREZ 

Opinion of the Court 
After  Duenas-Alvarez  was  convicted,  the  Federal  Govern-
ment,  claiming  that  the  conviction  was  for  a  generic  theft 
offense,  began  removal  proceedings.  A  Federal  Immigra-
tion  Judge,  agreeing  with  the  Government  that  the  Cali-
fornia  offense  is  "a  theft  offense  .  .  .  for  which  the  term  of 
imprisonment  [is]  at  least  one  year,"  found  Duenas-Alvarez 
removable.  8  U. S. C.  $ 1101(a)(43)(G)  (footnote  omitted); 

$ 1227(a)(2)(A).  The  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals  (BIA) 
affirmed.  Duenas-Alvarez  sought  review  of  the  BIA's  deci-
sion in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 

While respondent's petition for court review was pending, 
the  Ninth  Circuit,  in  Penuliar  v.  Ashcroft,  395  F.  3d  1037 
(2005),  held that  the  relevant  California  Vehicle  Code  provi-
sion,  $ 10851(a),  sweeps  more  broadly  than  generic  theft. 
See id., at  1044-1045.  In particular, the court said  that ge-
neric theft has as an element the taking or control of others' 
property.  But,  the  court  added,  the  California  statutory 
phrase  " `[who]  is  a  party  or  an  accessory  .  .  .  or  an  accom-
plice' "  would  permit  conviction  "for  aiding  and  abetting  a 
theft."  Id.,  at  1044  (emphasis  deleted).  And  the  court  be-
lieved  that  one might  "aid" or  "abet"  a  theft  without  taking 
or  controlling property.  Id.,  at  1044-1045  (citing  MartinezPerez v.  Ashcroft, 393 F. 3d 1018 (CA9 2004), withdrawn and 
amended, 417 F. 3d 1022 (2005)).  Hence, in the Court of Ap-
peals'  view,  the  provision  must  cover  some  generically  de-
fined  "theft"  crimes  and  also  some  other  crimes  (aiding  and 
abetting  crimes)  that,  because  they  are  not  generically  de-
fined  "theft"  crimes,  fall  outside  the  scope  of  the  term 
"theft" in the immigration statute.  395 F. 3d, at 1044-1045. 

The  Ninth  Circuit  subsequently  heard  Duenas-Alvarez's 
petition for review and summarily remanded the case to the 
agency  for  further  proceedings  in  light  of  Penuliar.  176 
Fed.  Appx.  820  (2006).  We  granted  the  Government's  peti-
tion  for  certiorari  in  order  to  consider  the  legal  validity  of 
the Ninth Circuit's holding set forth in Penuliar and applied

Opinion of the Court 
here,  namely,  the  holding  that  "aiding  and  abetting"  a  theft is not itself a crime that falls within the generic definition of 

theft.  We conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred. 

III 
The  Ninth  Circuit,  like  other  Circuits  and  the  BIA,  ac-cepted  as  a  generic  definition  of  theft,  the  "taking  of  prop-

erty or an exercise of control over property without consent with  the  criminal  intent  to  deprive  the  owner  of  rights  and 
benefits  of  ownership,  even  if  such  deprivation  is  less  than total  or  permanent." 

Penuliar  v.  Gonzales,  435  F.  3d  961, 969  (2006)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  See  Abim-

bola,  378  F.  3d,  at  176  (analyzing  the  BIA's  definition  and citing  cases  from  three  other  Circuits,  including  the  Ninth 
Circuit,  approving  that  definition).  The  question  before  us is whether one who aids or abets a theft falls, like a principal, 
within the scope of this generic definition.  We conclude that he does. 

The common law divided participants in a felony into four basic  categories:  (1) 

first-degree  principals,  those  who  actu-ally committed the crime in question; (2) second-degree prin-

cipals, aiders and abettors present at the scene of the crime; (3)  accessories  before  the  fact,  aiders  and  abettors  who 
helped  the  principal  before  the  basic  criminal  event  took place;  and  (4) 

accessories  after  the  fact,  persons  who  helped the  principal after  the basic criminal  event  took  place.  See 

Standefer  v.  United  States,  447  U. S.  10,  15  (1980).  In  the course  of  the  20th  century,  however,  American  jurisdictions 
eliminated  the  distinction  among  the  first  three  categories. Id.,  at  16-19;  Nye  &  Nissen  v.  United  States,  336  U. S.  613, 
618 (1949). Indeed,  every  jurisdiction--all  States  and  the  Federal 
Government--has "expressly abrogated the distinction" among  principals  and  aiders  and  abettors  who  fall  into  the 
second  and  third  categories.  2  W.  LaFave,  Substantive

190  GONZALES  v.  DUENAS-ALVAREZ 

Opinion of the Court 
Criminal  Law  $ 13.1(e),  p.  333  (2d  ed.  2003)  (LaFave).  The Solicitor General has presented us with a comprehensive ac-

count of the law of all States and federal jurisdictions as well. And we have verified that these jurisdictions treat similarly 
principals and aiders and abettors who fall into the second or third common-law category.  See Appendix A, infra.  Since 
criminal  law  now  uniformly  treats  those  who  fall  into  the first three categories alike, "the generic sense in which" the 
term  "theft"  "is  now  used  in  the  criminal  codes  of  most States," 

Taylor,  495  U. S.,  at  598,  covers  such  "aiders  and abettors"  as  well  as  principals.  And  the  criminal  activities 

of  these  aiders  and  abettors  of  a  generic  theft  must  them-selves  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  term  "theft"  in  the  fed-
eral statute.  A 

Duenas-Alvarez  does  not  defend  the  Ninth  Circuit's  posi-tion.  He  agrees  with  the  Government  that  generically 
speaking  the  law  treats  aiders  and  abettors  during  and  be-fore the crime the same way it treats principals; and that the 
immigration  statute  must  then  treat  them  similarly  as  well. Instead,  Duenas-Alvarez  argues  that  the  California  Vehicle 
Code  provision  in  other  ways  reaches  beyond  generic  theft to cover certain nongeneric crimes. 

Duenas-Alvarez  points  out  that  California  defines  "aiding and  abetting"  such  that  an  aider  and  abettor  is  criminally 
responsible  not  only  for  the  crime  he  intends,  but  also  for 
any crime that "naturally and probably" results from his in-tended  crime. 

People  v.  Durham,  70  Cal.  2d  171,  181,  449 
P.  2d  198,  204  (1969)  (" `aider  and  abettor  .  .  .  liable  for  the natural  and  reasonable  or  probable  consequences  of  any  act 

that  he  knowingly  aided  or  encouraged' "  (quoting  People  v. 
Villa,  156  Cal.  App.  2d  128,  134  (1957);  emphasis  deleted)). 
This fact alone does not  show that  the statute covers  a non-generic  theft  crime,  for  relatively  few  jurisdictions  (only  10 

in  Duenas-Alvarez's  own  view)  have  expressly  rejected  the

Opinion of the Court 
"natural  and  probable  consequences"  doctrine.  See  Brief 
for Respondent 21-22; Appendix B, infra.  Moreover, many 
States and the Federal Government apply some form or vari-
ation  of  that  doctrine,  or  permit  jury  inferences  of  intent  in 
circumstances  similar  to  those  in  which  California  has  ap-
plied  the  doctrine,  as  explained  below.  See  Appendix  C, 
infra.  To  succeed,  Duenas-Alvarez  must  show  something 
special about California's version of the doctrine--for exam-
ple,  that  California  in  applying  it  criminalizes  conduct  that 
most other States would not consider "theft." 

Duenas-Alvarez  attempts  to  make  just  such  a  showing. 
In  particular,  he  says  that  California's  doctrine,  unlike  that 
of most other States, makes a defendant criminally liable for 
conduct  that  the  defendant  did  not  intend,  not  even  as  a 
known or almost certain byproduct of the defendant's inten-
tional  acts.  See  1  LaFave  $ 5.2(a),  at  341  (person  intends 
that  which  he  knows  "is  practically  certain  to  follow  from 
his  conduct").  At  oral  argument,  Duenas-Alvarez's  counsel 
suggested that California's doctrine, for example, might hold 
an  individual  who  wrongly  bought  liquor  for  an  underage 
drinker criminally responsible for that young drinker's later 
(unforeseen)  reckless  driving.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  44. 
And  Duenas-Alvarez  refers  to  several  California  cases  in 
order to prove his point.  See Brief for Respondent 19. 

We  have  reviewed  those  cases,  however,  and  we  cannot 
agree  that  they  show  that  California's  law  is  somehow  spe-
cial.  In  the  first  case,  People  v.  Nguyen,  21  Cal.  App.  4th 
518, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 323 (1993), the Third Appellate District 
in  California  upheld  the  jury  conviction  of  individuals  who 
had aided several robberies at houses of prostitution, for aid-
ing and abetting a sexual assault used by one of the individu-
als  to  convince  a  proprietor,  by  frightening  her,  to  give  up 
property.  Id., at 528, 533-534, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 329, 333. 
The  court,  in  upholding  the  verdict,  wrote  that  "knowledge 
of  another's  criminal  purpose  is  not  sufficient  for  aiding  and

Opinion of the Court 
abetting;  the  defendant must also  share that purpose or in-tend  to  commit,  encourage,  or  facilitate  the  commission  of 

the  crime."  Id.,  at  530,  26  Cal.  Rptr.  2d,  at  330  (emphasis added).  The  court  added  that  "[w]hile  the  defendants  par-
ticipated in the criminal endeavor the foreseeability of sexual assault  went  from  possible  or  likely  to  certain,  yet  defend-
ants  continued  to  lend  their  aid  and  assistance  to  the  en-deavor." 

Id.,  at  534,  26  Cal.  Rptr.  2d,  at  333  (emphasis added).  The  court  said  that  the  jury  could  find  that  the 

defendants' 

"continuing participation in the criminal endeavor aided the  perpetrators  by  providing  the  control  and  security 

they  needed  to  tarry  long  enough  to  commit  the  sexual offense, by helping to convince the victim that resistance 
would  be  useless,  and  by  dissuading  the  victim's  em-ployee from any notion she may have formed of going to 
the victim's assistance." 
And the court concluded: 

"Under these circumstances it will not do for defendants to  assert  that  they  were  concerned  only  with  robbery 

and  bear  no  responsibility  for  the  sexual  assault."  Id., at 533-534, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 333. 

People  v.  Simpson,  66  Cal.  App.  2d  319  (1944),  affirmed  a kidnaping  and  robbery  conviction  on  an  aiding  and  abetting 
theory.  Id.,  at  322.  Although  the  defendant  argued  to  the appeals  court  that  she  and  her  compatriots  had  not  planned 
to  kidnap  the  robbery  victim,  the  record  showed  that  she had  brought  the  gun  used  to  intimidate  the  victim  while  he 
was  tied  up  and  placed  in  a  car,  in  which  she  and  her  co-robbers  rode  with  the  victim  to  another  location  while  they 
robbed him.  Id., at 322-323.  As in Nguyen, the court, not-ing that kidnaping was the 

means by which the robbery was committed,  found  that  the  defendant  had  the  requisite  "mo-

tive,"  or  intent  to  commit  the  kidnaping.  66  Cal.  App.  2d, at 326.

Opinion of the Court 
People  v.  Montes,  74  Cal.  App.  4th  1050,  88  Cal.  Rptr.  2d 
482  (1999),  affirmed  an  attempted  murder  conviction  where 
a  confederate  of  the  defendant  shot  the  victim  after  the  de-
fendant committed armed assault, simple assault, and breach 
of  the  peace.  Id.,  at  1055,  88  Cal.  Rptr.  2d,  at  485.  The 
court  found  that  the  conduct  for  which  the  appellant  was 
charged  with  assault  and  breach  of  the  peace  was  a 
"confrontation . . .  punctuated by threats and weaponry" "in 
the  context  of  an  ongoing  rivalry  between  .  .  .  two  gangs 
[that] acted  violently toward  each  other."  Ibid.  The court 
reasoned  that  the  escalating  violence,  resulting  in  someone 
being shot, was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's 
intended  act  of  participating  in  the  gang  confrontation. 
Ibid. 

Although  the  court  in  Montes  applied  a  more  expansive 
concept  of  "motive"  or  "intent"  than  did  the  courts  in 
Nguyen  and  Simpson,  we  cannot say  that  those  concepts  as 
used  in  any  of  these  cases  extend  significantly  beyond  the 
concept  as  set  forth  in  the  cases  of  other  States.  See  Ap-
pendix C, infra. 

Moreover,  in our  view, to  find  that  a  state  statute  creates 
a  crime  outside  the  generic  definition  of  a  listed  crime  in  a 
federal  statute  requires  more  than  the  application  of  legal 
imagination to a state statute's language.  It requires a real-
istic  probability,  not  a  theoretical  possibility,  that  the  State 
would  apply  its  statute  to  conduct  that  falls  outside  the  ge-
neric  definition  of a  crime.  To  show  that  realistic  probabil-
ity, an offender, of course, may show that the statute was so 
applied  in  his  own  case.  But  he  must  at  least  point  to  his 
own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did 
apply  the  statute  in  the  special  (nongeneric)  manner  for 
which he argues. 

Because Duenas-Alvarez makes no such showing here, we 
cannot  find  that  California's  statute,  through  the  California 
courts' application of a "natural and probable consequences"

Opinion of the Court 
doctrine,  creates  a  subspecies  of  the  Vehicle  Code  section crime that falls outside the generic definition of "theft." 

B 
Duenas-Alvarez  makes  two  additional  claims.  First,  he argues that $ 10851 holds liable accessories after the fact; and 

to  prove  that  an  individual  was  an  accessory  after  the  fact does not require the Government to show that the individual 
committed  a  theft.  Second,  Duenas-Alvarez  argues  that $ 10851  applies,  not  only  to  auto  theft,  but  also  to  joyriding, 
which he argues involves so limited a deprivation of the use of  a  car  that  it  falls  outside  the  generic  "theft"  definition. 
See Van Vechten  v.  American Eagle Fire Ins. Co.,  239 N. Y. 303, 146 N. E. 432 (1925) (Cardozo, J.) (citing cases for propo-
sition that a very temporary use is not theft). We shall not consider these claims.  The question that we 
agreed  to  decide  is  whether  " `theft  offense' "  in  the  federal statute  "includes  aiding  and  abetting  the  commission  of  the 
offense."  See  Brief  for  Petitioner  I.  Context  makes  clear that  "aiding  and  abetting"  in  this  question  referred  to  the 
use  of  that  term  in  Penuliar,  i. e.,  to  the  second  and  third common-law  categories  (principal  in  the  second  degree,  ac-
cessory before the fact), see supra, at 189, see also Brief for Petitioner  13,  and  not  to  "accessory  after  the  fact."  Thus 
neither  this  claim  nor  the  "joyriding"  claim  falls  within  the terms  of  the  question  presented.  Regardless,  the  lower 
court  did  not  consider  the  claims,  and  we  decline  to  reach them in the first instance.  See National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn.  v.  Smith,  525  U. S.  459,  469-470  (1999);  Roberts  v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1999) (per curiam); 
United States v.  Bestfoods, 524 U. S. 51, 72-73 (1998). For these reasons we vacate the Ninth Circuit's judgment 
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

cedures  make  no  mention  of  naming  particular  officials,  the  Sixth  Cir-
cuit's rule imposing such a  prerequisite to proper exhaustion is unwar-
ranted.  The Circuit's rule may promote early notice to those who might 
later  be  sued,  but  that  has  not  been  thought  to  be  one  of  the  leading 
purposes  of  the  exhaustion  requirement.  The  court  below  should  de-
termine in  the first  instance  whether petitioners' grievances  otherwise 
satisfied the exhaustion requirement.  Pp. 217-219. 

(c)  The PLRA does not require dismissal of the entire complaint when 
a prisoner has failed to exhaust some, but not all, of the claims included 
in  the  complaint.  Respondents  argue  that  had  Congress  intended 
courts  to  dismiss  only  unexhausted  claims  while  retaining  the  balance 
of  the lawsuit,  it would  have  used  the word  "claim" instead of  "action" 
in  $ 1997e(a),  which  provides  that  "[n]o  action  shall  be  brought"  unless 
administrative procedures are exhausted.  That boilerplate language is 
used  in  many  instances  in  the  Federal  Code,  and  statutory  references 
to  an  "action"  have  not  typically  been  read  to  mean  that  every  claim 
included in the action  must meet  the pertinent requirement before the 
"action"  may  proceed.  If  a  complaint  contains  both  good  and  bad 
claims, the court proceeds with the good and leaves the bad.  Respond-
ents note that the total  exhaustion requirement in  habeas corpus is  an 
exception  to  this  general  rule,  but  a  court  presented  with  a  mixed  ha-
beas petition typically "allow[s] the petitioner to delete the unexhausted 
claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims," Rhines

ment  this  exhaustion  requirement  and  facilitate  early  judi-cial screening.  These rules require a prisoner to allege and 

demonstrate  exhaustion  in  his  complaint,  permit  suit  only against  defendants  who  were  identified  by  the  prisoner  in 
his grievance, and require courts to dismiss the entire action if  the  prisoner  fails  to  satisfy  the  exhaustion  requirement 
as to  any single  claim in  his complaint.  Other  lower courts declined  to  adopt  such  rules.  We  granted  certiorari  to  re-
solve  the  conflict  and  now  conclude  that  these  rules  are  not required by the PLRA, and that crafting and imposing them 
exceeds the proper limits on the judicial role.

Sixth  Circuit,  adopting  the  former  view,  requires  prisoners 
to  attach  proof  of  exhaustion--typically  copies  of  the  griev-
ances--to their complaints to avoid dismissal.  If no written 
record  of  the  grievance  is  available,  the  inmate  must  plead 
with  specificity  how  and  when  he  exhausted  the  grievance 
procedures.  Knuckles

Opinion of the Court 
We  have  identified  the  benefits  of  exhaustion  to  include allowing  a  prison  to  address  complaints  about  the  program 

it administers before being subjected to suit, reducing litiga-tion to the extent complaints are satisfactorily resolved, and 
improving litigation that does occur by leading to the prepa-ration of a useful record.  See id.,

Opinion of the Court 
countered Osborn's allegations by certifying that Haley "was 
acting within the scope of his employment . . . at the  time  of  
the  conduct  alleged  in  [Osborn's]  complaint."  App. to Brief 
in  Opposition  23  (hereinafter  Luber  App.).  Based  on  this 
certification,  the  case  was  removed  to  the  United  States 
District  Court  for  the  Western  District  of  Kentucky,  as 

$ 2679(d)(2) instructs. 

In  the  federal  forum,  the  United  States  Attorney  denied 
the  tortious  conduct  Osborn  attributed  to  Haley,  asserting 
that the wrongdoing she alleged never occurred.  Accepting 
Osborn's  allegations  as  true,  the  District  Court  entered  an 
order that rejected the Attorney General's Westfall Act cer-
tification,  denied  the  Government's  motion  to  substitute  the 
United States  as defendant in  place of Haley, and remanded 
the  case  to  the  state  court.  On  appeal,  the  Sixth  Circuit 
vacated the District Court's order, and instructed that court 
to retain jurisdiction over the case. 

We  affirm  the  Court  of  Appeals'  judgment.  On  the  mer-
its, we  agree with  the  Sixth Circuit  that the  District  Court, 
in denying substitution of the United States as defendant in 
lieu  of  Haley,  misconstrued  the  Westfall  Act.  Substitution 
of the United States is not improper simply because the At-
torney  General's  certification  rests  on  an  understanding  of 
the  facts  that  differs  from  the  plaintiff 's  allegations.  The 
United  States,  we  hold,  must  remain  the  federal  defendant 
in  the  action  unless  and until  the  District  Court  determines 
that  the  employee,  in

tification  and  denied  substitution.  Under  this  ruling,  the United  States  was  no  longer  before  the  court.  Further-

more, the parties were not of diverse citizenship and no fed-eral  law  was  at  issue.  The  District  Court  therefore  held 
that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.4  In-voking  $ 1447(c),

5  the  court  concluded  that  the  case  must  be 

remanded to the state court. The United States moved for reconsideration, urging that, 

contrary to the District Court's impression, the Government did  contest  Osborn's  factual  allegations.  Recalling  that  it 
had  denied  Osborn's  allegations  in  its  answer  to  her  com-plaint, the United States submitted sworn declarations from 
Haley and Luber.  Haley's stated that he was not in commu-nication with Luber between the time of Kuenzli's investiga-
tion  and  Osborn's  firing.  Luber's  declaration  stated  that Osborn's request for an investigation regarding her veterans' 
preference  points  could  not  have  had  any  bearing  on  Os-born's termination, for Luber was unaware of the request at 
the  relevant  time.  Absent  contrary  evidence,  the  Govern-ment  maintained,  these  declarations  sufficed  to  support  the 
certification and the continuance of the United States as de-fendant  in  place  of  Haley.  In  the  alternative,  the  Govern-
ment sought discovery.6

The  maximum  penalty  for  Blakely's  offense,  under  Washington's  Re-
form  Act,  was  ten  years'  imprisonment,  but  if  no  facts  beyond  those 
reflected  in  the  jury's  verdict  were  found  by  the  trial  judge,  Blakely 
could not receive a sentence above a standard range of 49 to 53 months. 
Blakely  was  sentenced  to  90  months,  more  than  three  years  above  the 
standard  range,  based  on  the  judge's  finding  of  deliberate  cruelty. 
Applying Apprendi, this Court held the sentence unconstitutional.  The 
State  in  Blakely  endeavored  to  distinguish  Apprendi,  contending  that 
Blakely's sentence was within the judge's discretion based solely on the 
guilty verdict.  The Court dismissed that argument.  Blakely could not 
have been sentenced above the standard range absent an additional fact. 
Consequently, that fact was subject to the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial 
guarantee.  It  did  not  matter  that  Blakely's  sentence,  though  outside 
the  standard  range,  was  within  the  10-year  maximum.  Because  the 
judge  could  not  have  imposed  a  sentence  outside  the  standard  range 
without  finding  an  additional  fact,  the  top  of  that  range--53  months, 
not  10  years--was  the  relevant  statutory  maximum.  The  Court  also 
rejected the State's arguments that Apprendi was satisfied because the 
Reform  Act  did  not  specify  an  exclusive  catalog  of  facts  on  which  a 
judge  might  base  a  departure  from  the  standard  range,  and  because  it 
ultimately  left  the  decision  whether  or  not  to  depart  to  the  judge's 
discretion. 

Booker  was  sentenced  under  the  Federal  Sentencing  Guidelines. 
The  facts  found  by  the  jury  yielded  a  base  Guidelines  range  of  210  to 
262 months' imprisonment, a range the judge could not exceed without 
undertaking additional factfinding.  The judge did so, making a finding 
that  boosted  Booker  into  a  higher  Guidelines  range.  This  Court  held 
Booker's  sentence  impermissible  under  the  Sixth  Amendment.  There 
was  "no  distinction  of  constitutional  significance  between  the  Federal 
Sentencing  Guidelines  and  the  Washington  procedures  at  issue  in 
[Blakely]."  543  U. S.,  at  233.  Both  were  "mandatory  and  impose[d] 
binding  requirements  on  all  sentencing  judges."  Ibid.  All  Members 
of  the  Court  agreed,  however,  that  the  Guidelines  would  not  implicate 
the Sixth  Amendment if  they were  advisory.  Ibid.  Facing the  reme-
dial  question,  the  Court  concluded  that  rendering  the  Guidelines  advi-
sory came closest to what Congress would have intended had it known 
that  the  Guidelines  were  vulnerable  to  a  Sixth  Amendment  challenge. 
Under  the  advisory  Guidelines  system  described  in  Booker,  judges 
would  no  longer  be  confined  to  the  sentencing  range  dictated  by  the 
Guidelines, but  would be  obliged  to "take  account" of  that  range along 
with  the  sentencing  goals  enumerated  in  the  Sentencing  Reform  Act 
(SRA).  Id., at 259, 264.  In place of the SRA provision governing ap-
pellate review of sentences under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, the

Court  installed  a  "reasonableness"  standard  of  review.  Id.,  at  261. 
Pp. 281-288. 

(b)  In all  material respects,  California's  DSL  resembles the sentenc-
ing systems invalidated in Blakely and Booker.  Following the reason-
ing in those cases, the middle term prescribed under California law, not 
the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum.  Because aggravat-
ing facts that authorize the upper term are found by the judge, and need 
only  be  established  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  DSL  vio-
lates the rule of Apprendi. 

While  "that  should  be  the  end  of  the  matter,"  Blakely,  542  U. S.,  at 
313, in People v.  Black, the California Supreme Court insisted that the 
DSL  survives  inspection  under  our  precedents.  The  Black  court  rea-
soned  that, given  the ample  discretion  afforded trial  judges to  identify 
aggravating facts warranting an upper term sentence, the DSL did "not 
represent  a  legislative  effort  to  shift  the  proof  of particular  facts  from 
elements of a crime (to be proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be 
decided  by  a  judge),"  35  Cal.  4th,  at  1255-1256,  113  P.  3d,  at  543-544. 
This Court  cautioned  in  Blakely,  however, that  broad  discretion  to de-
cide  what  facts  may  support  an  enhanced  sentence,  or  to  determine 
whether  an  enhanced  sentence  is  warranted  in  a  particular  case,  does 
not shield a sentencing system from the force of this  Court's decisions. 
The  Black  court  also  urged  that  the  DSL  is  not  cause  for  concern  be-
cause it reduced the penalties for most crimes over the prior indetermi-
nate  sentencing  scheme;  because  the  system  is  fair  to  defendants;  and 
because  the  DSL  requires  statutory  sentence  enhancements  (as  distin-
guished from  aggravators) to  be  charged in  the indictment  and proved 
to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Black court's examination, in 
short, satisfied it that California's sentencing system does not implicate 
significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth  Amendment's jury-trial 
guarantee.  This Court's decisions, however, leave no room for such an 
examination.  Asking  whether  a  defendant's  basic  jury-trial  right  is 
preserved,  though  some  facts  essential  to  punishment  are reserved  for 
determination  by  the  judge,  is  the  very  inquiry  Apprendi's  bright-line 
rule was designed to exclude. 

Ultimately, the Black court relied on an equation of California's DSL 
to  the  post-Booker  federal  system.  That  attempted  comparison  is  un-
availing.  The  Booker  Court  held  the  Federal  Guidelines  incompatible 
with  the  Sixth  Amendment  because  they  were  "mandatory  and  im-
pose[d]  binding  requirements  on  all  sentencing  judges,"  543  U. S.,  at 
233.  To  remedy  the  constitutional  infirmity,  the  Court  excised  provi-
sions  that  rendered  the  system  mandatory,  leaving  the  Guidelines  in 
place as advisory only.  The DSL, however, does not resemble the advi-
sory system the Court  in Booker  had in view.  Under California's  sys-

Syllabus 
tem, judges are not free to exercise their "discretion to select a specific 
sentence  within  a  defined  range."  Ibid.  California's  Legislature  has 
adopted sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between 
them.  Cunningham's sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sen-
tence within a range of 6 to 16 years, but had to impose 12 years, noth-
ing less and nothing more, unless the judge found facts allowing a sen-
tence of 6 or 16 years.  Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 
years, this Court's decisions make plain, falls within the province of the 
jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick 
of  a  judge  determining  where  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  lies. 

The  Black  court  attempted  to  rescue  the  DSL's  judicial  factfinding 
authority  by  typing  it  a  reasonableness  constraint,  equivalent  to  the 
constraint  operative  in  the  post-Booker  federal  system.  Reasonable-
ness, however, is not the touchstone of Sixth Amendment analysis.  The 
reasonableness  requirement  Booker  anticipated  for  the  federal  system 
operates within the constitutional constraints delineated in this Court's 
precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints.  Because the DSL 
allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permitting the imposition 
of  an  upper  term  sentence,  the  system  violates  the  Sixth  Amendment. 
Booker's remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, is not a recipe for 
rendering  this  Court's  Sixth  Amendment  case  law  toothless.  Further 
elaboration here on the federal  reasonableness standard is neither nec-
essary nor proper.  The Court has granted review in two cases--to be 
argued  and  decided  later  this  Term--raising  questions  trained  on  that 
matter.  Claiborne v.  United States, No. 06-5618; Rita v.  United States, 
No. 06-5754.  Pp. 288-293. 

(c)  As to the adjustment of California's sentencing system in light of 
the  Court's  ruling,  "[t]he  ball  .  .  .  lies  in  [California's]  court."  Booker, 
543  U. S.,  at  265.  Several  States  have  modified  their  systems  in  the 
wake  of  Apprendi  and  Blakely  to  retain  determinate  sentencing,  by 
calling  upon the jury to find any fact necessary to  the imposition of an 
elevated  sentence.  Other  States  have  chosen  to  permit  judges  genu-
inely "to exercise broad discretion . . . within a statutory range," which, 
"everyone  agrees,"  encounters  no  Sixth  Amendment  shoal.  543  U. S., 
at  233.  California  may  follow  the  paths  taken  by  its  sister  States  or 
otherwise  alter  its  system,  so  long  as  it  observes  Sixth  Amendment 
limitations declared in this Court's decisions.  Pp. 293-294.

found by a jury or admitted by the defendant.  Apprendi v. New  Jersey,  530  U. S.  466  (2000);  Ring v.  Arizona, 536  U. S. 
584  (2002);  Blakely  v.  Washington,  542  U. S.  296  (2004); United  States  v.  Booker,  543  U. S.  220  (2005).  "[T]he  rele-
vant  `statutory  maximum,' "  this  Court  has  clarified,  "is  not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding ad-
ditional facts, but the maximum he may impose without any additional findings." 

Blakely, 542 U. S., at 303-304 (empha-sis in original).  In petitioner's case, the jury's verdict alone 

limited  the  permissible  sentence  to  12  years.  Additional factfinding  by  the  trial  judge,  however,  yielded  an  upper 
term sentence  of 16 years.  The  California  Court  of Appeal affirmed  the  harsher  sentence.  We  granted  certiorari,  546 
U. S.  1169  (2006),  and  now  reverse  that  disposition  because the  four-year  elevation  based  on  judicial  factfinding  denied 
petitioner his right to a jury trial.

A  

Petitioner  John  Cunningham  was  tried  and  convicted  of continuous  sexual  abuse  of  a  child  under  the  age  of  14. 

Under  the  DSL,  that offense is  punishable  by  imprisonment for a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term sentence 
of  12  years,  or  an  upper  term  sentence  of  16  years.  Cal. Penal  Code  Ann.  $ 288.5(a)  (West  1999)  (hereinafter  Penal 
Code).  As  further  explained  below,  see  infra,  at  277-281, the  DSL  obliged  the  trial  judge  to  sentence  Cunningham  to 
the 12-year middle term unless the judge found one or more additional  facts  in  aggravation.  Based  on  a  post-trial  sen-
tencing  hearing,  the  trial  judge  found  by  a  preponderance of the evidence  six aggravating circumstances, among them, 
the  particular  vulnerability  of  Cunningham's  victim,  and Cunningham's  violent  conduct,  which  indicated  a  serious 
danger  to  the  community.  Tr.  of  Sentencing  (Aug.  1,  2003),

years.  Id., at 23. A  panel  of  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  affirmed  the

Enacted  in  1977,  the  DSL  replaced  an  indeterminate  sen-tencing regime in force in California for some 60 years.  See 

id., at 1246, 113 P. 3d, at 537; Cassou & Taugher, Determinate Sentencing  in  California:  The  New  Numbers  Game,  9  Pac.

1 The particular vulnerability of the victim is listed in Cal. Rule of Court 
4.421(a)(3)  (Criminal  Cases) (West 2006)  (hereinafter Rule), as  a fact "re-
lating to the crime."  Violent conduct indicating a serious danger to soci-
ety is listed in Rule 4.421(b)(1) as a fact "relating to the defendant." 

2 In addition to a Sixth Amendment challenge, Cunningham disputed the 

substance of  five of the  six findings made  by the trial judge.  The appel-
late panel affirmed the trial judge's vulnerable victim and violent conduct 
findings,  but  rejected  the  finding  that  Cunningham  abused  a  position  of 
trust (because that finding overlapped with the vulnerable victim finding). 
The  panel  did  not  decide  whether  the  judge's  other  findings  were  war-
ranted,  concluding  that  she  properly  relied  on  at  least  two  aggravating 
facts  in  imposing  the  upper  term,  and  that  it  was  not  "reasonably  prob-
able"  that  a  different  sentence  would  have  been  imposed  absent  any 
improper  findings.  App.  43-46;  id.,  at  51  (May  4,  2005,  order  modifying

the  prior  regime,  courts  imposed  open-ended  prison  terms 
(often one year to life), and the parole board--the Adult Au-
thority--determined  the  amount  of  time  a  felon  would  ulti-
mately  spend  in  prison.  Black,  35  Cal.  4th,  at  1246,  1256, 
113 P. 3d, at 537, 544; In re Roberts, 36 Cal. 4th 575, 588, n. 6, 
115 P. 3d 1121, 1129, n. 6 (2005); Cassou & Taugher 5-9.  In 
contrast, the  DSL fixed the terms  of imprisonment for most 
offenses,  and  eliminated  the  possibility  of  early  release  on 
parole.  See  Penal  Code  $ 3000  et  seq.  (West  Supp.  2006);  3

For  most  offenses,  including  Cunningham's,  the  DSL  re-
gime  is  implemented  in  the  following  manner.  The  statute 
defining the offense prescribes three precise terms of impris-
onment--a  lower,  middle,  and  upper  term  sentence.  E. g., 
Penal Code $ 288.5(a) (West 1999) (a person convicted of con-
tinuous sexual abuse of a child "shall be punished by impris-
onment in the state prison for a term of 6, 12, or 16 years"). 
See also Black, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1247, 113 P. 3d, at 538.  Penal 
Code  $ 1170(b)  (West  Supp.  2006)  controls  the  trial  judge's 
choice;  it  provides  that  "the  court  shall  order  imposition  of 
the middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggrava-
tion or mitigation of the crime."  "[C]ircumstances in aggra-
vation or mitigation" are to be determined by the court after 
consideration of several items: the trial record; the probation 
officer's report; statements in aggravation or mitigation sub-
mitted by the parties, the victim, or the victim's family; "and 
any further  evidence  introduced  at the  sentencing hearing."

278  CUNNINGHAM  v.  CALIFORNIA 

Opinion of the Court 
The  DSL  directed  the  State's  Judicial  Council 4  to  adopt Rules  guiding  the  sentencing  judge's  decision  whether  to 

"[i]mpose  the  lower  or  upper  prison  term."  Penal  Code $ 1170.3(a)(2)  (West  2004).

5  Restating  $ 1170(b),  the  Coun-

cil's  Rules  provide  that  "[t]he  middle  term  shall  be  selected unless  imposition  of  the  upper  or  lower  term  is  justified  by 

circumstances in aggravation  or mitigation."  Rule  4.420(a). "Circumstances in aggravation," as crisply defined by the Ju-
dicial  Council,  means  "facts  which  justify  the  imposition  of the  upper  prison  term."  Rule  4.405(d)  (emphasis  added). 
Facts  aggravating  an  offense,  the  Rules  instruct,  "shall  be established  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,"  Rule 
4.420(b),6  and  must  be  "stated  orally  on  the  record,"  Rule 4.420(e). 

The Rules provide a nonexhaustive list of aggravating cir-cumstances,  including  "[f]acts  relating  to  the  crime,"  Rule 
4.421(a),7  "[f]acts  relating  to  the  defendant,"  Rule  4.421(b),8 and  "[a]ny  other  facts  statutorily  declared  to  be  circum-
stances in aggravation," Rule 4.421(c).  Beyond the enumer-ated  circumstances,  "the  judge  is  free  to  consider  any  `ad-

4 The  Judicial  Council  includes  the  chief  justice  and  another  justice  of 
the  California  Supreme  Court,  three  judges  sitting  on  the  Courts  of  Ap-
peal, ten judges from the Superior Courts, and other nonvoting members. 
Cal. Const., Art. 6, $ 6(a) (West Supp. 2006).  The California Constitution 
grants the Council authority, inter alia, to "adopt rules for court adminis-
tration,  practice  and  procedure,  and  perform  other  functions  prescribed 
by statute."  Ibid., $ 6(d). 

5 The  Rules  were  amended  on  January  1,  2007.  Those  amendments 

made technical changes, none of them material to the constitutional ques-
tion  before  us.  We  refer  in  this  opinion  to  the  prior  text  of  the  Rules, 
upon which the parties and principal authorities rely. 

6 The  judge  must  provide  a  statement  of  reasons  for  a  sentence  only 

when a lower or upper term sentence is imposed.  Rules 4.406(b), 4.420(e). 

7 E. g.,  Rule  4.421(a)(1)  ("[T]he  fact  that . . . [t]he  crime involved  great 

violence,  great  bodily  harm,  threat  of  great  bodily  harm,  or  other  acts 
disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness."). 

8 E. g.,  Rule 4.421(b)(1) ("[T]he fact that . . . [t]he defendant has engaged 

in violent conduct which indicates a serious danger to society.").

ing Rule 4.408(a)).  "A fact that is an element of the crime," however,  "shall  not  be  used  to  impose  the  upper  term." 
Rule 4.420(d).  In sum, California's DSL, and the Rules gov-erning  its  application,  direct  the  sentencing  court  to  start 
with the middle term, and to move from that term only when the court itself finds and places on the record facts--whether 
related  to  the  offense  or the  offender--beyond  the  elements of the charged offense.

sentence.  The  Rules  also  state  that "[t]he  enumeration . . .  of  some  criteria  for  the  making  of  discretionary  sentencing 

decisions does not prohibit the application of additional crite-ria  reasonably  related  to  the  decision  being  made."  Rule 
4.408(a).  California  courts  have  not  read  this  language  to unmoor  "circumstances  in  aggravation"  from  any  factfind-
ing anchor. 

In  line  with  the  Rules,  the  California  Supreme  Court  has repeatedly referred to circumstances in aggravation as facts. 

See, e. g., Black, 35 Cal. 4th,  at 1256, 113 P. 3d,  at 544  ("The Legislature  did  not  identify  all  of  the  particular 

facts  that 
could  justify  the  upper  term."  (emphasis  added));  People  v. 
Wiley, 9  Cal. 4th  580, 587,  889  P. 2d  541, 545  (1995)  ("[T]rial 
courts  are  assigned  the  task  of  deciding  whether  to  impose 
an  upper  or  lower  term  of  imprisonment  based  upon  their 
determination  whether  there  are  circumstances  in  aggrava-
tion or mitigation of the crime, a determination that invari-
ably  requires  numerous  factual  findings."  (emphasis  added 
and internal quotation marks omitted)). 

It is  unsurprising, then, that State's counsel, at oral  argu-
ment, acknowledged that he knew of no case in which a Cali-
fornia  trial  judge  had  gone  beyond  the  middle  term  based 
not  on  any  fact  the  judge  found,  but  solely  on  the  basis  of  a 
policy  judgment  or  subjective  belief.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg. 
49-50. 

Notably,  the  Penal  Code  permits  elevation  of  a  sentence 
above  the  upper  term  based on  specified statutory  enhance-
ments relating to the defendant's criminal history or circum-
stances  of  the  crime.  See,  e. g.,  Penal  Code  $ 667  et  seq. 
(West 1999); $ 12022 et seq. (West 2000 and Supp. 2006).  See 
also  Black,  35  Cal.  4th,  at  1257,  113  P.  3d,  at  545.  Unlike 
aggravating circumstances, statutory enhancements must be 
charged in the indictment, and the underlying facts must be 
proved  to  the  jury  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  Penal  Code 

$ 1170.1(e) (West 2004); Black, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1257, 113 P. 3d, 
at 545.  A fact underlying an enhancement cannot do double

Opinion of the Court 
duty;  it  cannot  be  used  to  impose  an  upper  term  sentence and, on top of that, an enhanced term.  Penal Code $ 1170(b). 

Where  permitted  by  statute,  however,  a  judge  may  use  a fact  qualifying  as  an  enhancer  to  impose  an  upper  term 
rather than an enhanced sentence.  Ibid.; Rule 4.420(c). 

II 
This  Court  has  repeatedly  held  that,  under  the  Sixth Amendment,  any  fact  that  exposes  a  defendant  to  a  greater 

potential sentence must be found by a jury, not a judge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a pre-
ponderance  of  the  evidence.  While  this  rule  is  rooted  in longstanding  common-law  practice,  its  explicit  statement  in 
our decisions is recent.  In Jones v.  United States, 526 U. S. 227  (1999),  we  examined  the  Sixth  Amendment's  historical 
and  doctrinal  foundations,  and  recognized  that  judicial  fact-finding  operating  to  increase  a  defendant's  otherwise  maxi-
mum punishment posed a grave constitutional question.  Id., at 239-252.  While the Court construed the statute at issue 
to  avoid  the  question,  the  Jones  opinion  presaged  our  deci-sion,  some  15  months  later,  in  Apprendi  v.  New  Jersey,  530 
U. S. 466 (2000). Charles Apprendi was convicted of possession of a firearm 
for an unlawful purpose, a second-degree offense under New Jersey  law  punishable  by  five  to  ten  years'  imprisonment. 
Id.,  at  468.  A  separate  "hate  crime"  statute  authorized  an "extended term" of imprisonment: Ten to twenty years could 
be  imposed  if  the  trial  judge  found,  by  a  preponderance  of the evidence, that " `[t]he defendant in committing the crime 
acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, 
sexual  orientation  or  ethnicity.' "  Id.,  at  468-469  (quoting N.  J.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 2C:44-3(e)  (West  Supp.  1999-2000)).  The 
judge  in  Apprendi's  case  so  found,  and  therefore  sentenced the  defendant  to  12  years'  imprisonment.  This  Court  held 
that  the  Sixth  Amendment  proscribed  the  enhanced  sen-

tence.  530 U. S., at 471.  Other than a prior conviction, see 
Almendarez-Torres  v.  United  States,  523  U. S.  224,  239-247 
(1998), we held in Apprendi, "any fact that increases the pen-alty  for  a  crime  beyond  the  prescribed  statutory  maximum 

must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt."  530 U. S., at 490.  See also 

Harris v.  United States, 
536  U. S.  545,  557-566  (2002)  (plurality  opinion)  ("Apprendi 
said that any fact extending the defendant's sentence beyond the  maximum  authorized  by  the  jury's  verdict  would  have 

been  considered  an  element  of  an  aggravated  crime--and thus  the  domain  of  the  jury--by  those  who  framed  the  Bill 
of Rights."). 

We  have  since  reaffirmed  the  rule  of  Apprendi,  applying 
it to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty, Ring, 
536  U. S.,  at  602,  609,  facts  permitting  a  sentence  in  excess 
of the  "standard  range" under  Washington's Sentencing Re-
form Act, Blakely, 542 U. S., at 304-305, and facts triggering 
a  sentence  range  elevation  under  the  then-mandatory  Fed-
eral  Sentencing  Guidelines,  Booker,  543  U. S.,  at  243-244. 
Blakely  and  Booker  bear  most  closely  on  the  question  pre-
sented in this case. 

Ralph  Howard  Blakely  was  convicted  of  second-degree 
kidnaping  with  a  firearm,  a  class  B  felony  under  Washing-
ton  law.  Blakely,  542  U. S.,  at  298-299.  While  the  overall 
statutory  maximum  for  a  class  B  felony  was  ten  years,  the 
State's  Sentencing  Reform  Act  (Reform  Act)  added  an  im-
portant  qualification:  If  no  facts  beyond  those  reflected  in 
the jury's verdict were found by the trial judge, a defendant 
could  not  receive  a  sentence  above  a  "standard range"  of 49 
to 53  months.  Id.,  at  299-300.  The Reform  Act permitted 
but did  not require a judge to exceed that  standard range if 
she found " `substantial and compelling reasons justifying an 
exceptional  sentence.' "  Ibid.  (quoting  Wash.  Rev.  Code 
Ann.  $ 9.94A.120(2)  (2000)).  The  Reform  Act  set  out  a  non-
exhaustive list of aggravating facts on which such a sentence 
elevation  could  be  based.  It  also  clarified  that  a  fact  taken

Opinion of the Court 
into  account  in  fixing  the  standard  range--i. e.,  any  fact 
found  by  the  jury--could  under  no  circumstances  count  in 
the  determination  whether  to  impose  an  exceptional  sen-
tence.  542  U. S.,  at  299-300.  Blakely  was  sentenced  to  90 
months'  imprisonment,  more  than  three  years  above  the 
standard range, based on the trial judge's finding that he had 
acted with deliberate cruelty.  Id., at 300. 

Applying  the  rule  of  Apprendi,  this  Court  held  Blakely's 
sentence  unconstitutional.  The  State  in  Blakely  had  en-
deavored  to  distinguish  Apprendi  on  the  ground  that 
"[u]nder the Washington guidelines, an exceptional sentence 
is within the court's discretion as a result of a guilty verdict." 
Brief  for  Respondent  in  Blakely  v.  Washington,  O.  T.  2003, 
No. 02-1632, p. 15.  We rejected that argument.  The judge 
could  not  have  sentenced  Blakely  above  the  standard  range 
without  finding  the  additional  fact  of  deliberate  cruelty. 
Consequently,  that  fact  was  subject  to  the  Sixth  Amend-
ment's  jury-trial  guarantee.  542  U. S.,  at  304-314.  It  did 
not  matter,  we  explained,  that  Blakely's  sentence,  though 
outside  the  standard  range,  was  within  the  10-year  maxi-
mum for class B felonies: 

"Our precedents make clear . . .  that the `statutory maxi-
mum'  for  Apprendi  purposes  is  the  maximum  sentence 
a  judge  may  impose  solely  on  the  basis  of  the  facts 
reflected  in  the  jury  verdict  or  admitted  by  the 
defendant . . . .  In other words, the relevant `statutory 
maximum'  is  not  the  maximum  sentence  a  judge  may 
impose  after  finding  additional  facts,  but  the  maximum 
he  may  impose  without any  additional  findings.  When 
a judge inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone 
does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts `which 
the law makes essential to the punishment,' . . .  and  the  
judge  exceeds  his  proper  authority."  Id.,  at  303-304

ed. 1872); emphasis in original).

284  CUNNINGHAM  v.  CALIFORNIA 

Opinion of the Court 
Because the judge in Blakely's case could not have imposed a  sentence  outside  the  standard  range  without  finding  an 

additional  fact,  the  top  of  that  range--53  months,  and  not 10  years--was  the  relevant  statutory  maximum.  542  U. S., 
at 304. The  State  had  additionally  argued  in 

Blakely  that  Ap-
prendi's rule was satisfied because Washington's Reform Act 
did  not  specify  an  exclusive  catalog  of  potential  facts  on which  a  judge  might  base  a  departure  from  the  standard 

range.  This  Court  re jected  that  argument  as  well. "Whether  the  judge's  authority  to  impose  an  enhanced  sen-
tence depends on finding  a specified fact  . . . , one of several 
specified  facts  .  .  .  ,  or  any  aggravating  fact  (as  here),"  we 
observed,  "it  remains  the  case  that  the  jury's  verdict  alone 
does  not  authorize  the  sentence."  542  U. S.,  at  305  (em-
phasis  in  original).  Further,  we  held  it  irrelevant  that  the 
Reform  Act  ultimately  left  the  decision  whether  or  not  to 
depart  to  the  judge's  discretion:  "Whether  the  judicially 
determined facts require  a sentence enhancement or merely 
allow  it,"  we  noted,  "the  verdict  alone  does  not  authorize 
the sentence."  Ibid., n. 8 (emphasis in original). 

Freddie Booker was convicted of possession with intent to 
distribute  crack  cocaine  and  was  sentenced  under  the  Fed-
eral  Sentencing  Guidelines.  The  facts  found  by  Booker's 
jury  yielded  a  base  Guidelines  range  of  210  to  262  months' 
imprisonment,  a  range  the  judge  could  not  exceed  without 
undertaking  additional  factfinding.  Booker,  543  U. S.,  at 
227, 233-234.  The judge did so, finding by a preponderance 
of the evidence that Booker possessed an amount of drugs in 
excess  of  the  amount  determined  by  the  jury's  verdict. 
That  finding  boosted  Booker into  a  higher Guidelines  range. 
Booker  was sentenced  at the  bottom  of  the  higher  range, to

Opinion of the Court 
emphasized  the  provisional  character of the  Booker remedy. Recognizing  that  authority  to  speak "the  last  word"  resides 

in Congress, the Court said: 

"The  ball  now  lies  in  Congress'  court.  The  National Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long term, 

the  sentencing  system,  compatible  with  the  Constitu-tion,  that  Congress  judges  best  for  the  federal  system 
of justice."  Id., at 265. 
We  turn  now  to  the  instant  case  in  light  of  both  parts  of the Court's Booker opinion, and our earlier decisions in point. 

III 
Under  California's  DSL,  an  upper  term  sentence  may  be imposed  only  when  the  trial  judge  finds  an  aggravating  cir-

cumstance.  See  supra,  at  277-278.  An  element  of  the charged  offense,  essential  to  a  jury's  determination  of  guilt, 
or  admitted  in  a  defendant's  guilty  plea,  does  not  qualify  as such  a  circumstance.  See 

supra,  at  278-279.  Instead,  ag-gravating  circumstances  depend  on  facts  found  discretely 

and solely by the  judge.  In accord  with Blakely, therefore, the  middle  term  prescribed  in  California's  statutes,  not  the 
upper  term,  is  the  relevant  statutory  maximum.  542  U. S., at  303  ("[T]he  `statutory  maximum'  for  Apprendi  purposes 
is  the  maximum  sentence  a  judge  may  impose  solely  on  the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by 
the  defendant."  (emphasis  in  original)).  Because  circum-stances  in  aggravation  are  found  by  the  judge,  not  the  jury, 
and need  only be  established by a  preponderance of the evi-dence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, see 

supra, at 278, the DSL violates Apprendi's bright-line rule: Except for a prior 

conviction,  "any  fact  that  increases  the  penalty  for  a  crime beyond  the  prescribed  statutory  maximum  must  be  submit-

or argument, how "reasonableness review," post-Booker, works.  Post, at 
310-311.  It  is  neither  necessary  nor  proper  now  to  join  issue  with  Jus-

ted  to  a  jury,  and  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,"  530 U. S., at 490. 

While  "[t]hat  should  be  the  end  of  the  matter,"  Blakely, 542 U. S., at 313, in  People  v.  Black, the California Supreme 
Court  held  otherwise.  In  that  court's  view,  the  DSL  sur-vived  examination  under  our  precedent  intact.  See  35  Cal. 
4th,  at  1254-1261,  113  P.  3d,  at  543-548.  The  Black  court acknowledged that California's system appears on surface in-
spection  to  be  in  tension  with  the  rule  of  Apprendi.  But in  "operation  and  effect,"  the  court  said,  the  DSL  "simply 
authorize[s] a sentencing court to engage in the type of fact-finding that traditionally has been incident to the judge's se-
lection  of  an  appropriate  sentence  within  a  statutorily  pre-scribed  sentencing  range."  35  Cal.  4th,  at  1254,  113  P.  3d, 
at  543.  Therefore,  the  court  concluded,  "the  upper  term  is the  `statutory  maximum'  and  a  trial  court's  imposition  of  an 
upper  term  sentence  does  not  violate  a  defendant's  right  to a  jury  trial  under  the  principles  set  forth  in 

Apprendi, 
Blakely, and Booker."  Ibid.  But see id., at 1270, 113 P. 3d, at  554  (Kennard,  J.,  concurring  and  dissenting)  ("Nothing  in 

the high court's majority opinions in Apprendi, Blakely, and Booker  suggests  that  the  constitutionality  of  a  state's  sen-
tencing scheme turns on whether, in the words of the major-ity here, it involves the type of factfinding `that traditionally 
has  been  performed  by  a  judge.' "  (quoting  id.,  at  1253,  113 P. 3d, at 542)). 

The Black court's conclusion that the upper term, and not the  middle  term,  qualifies  as  the  relevant  statutory  maxi-
mum, rested on several considerations.  First, the court rea-soned  that,  given  the  ample  discretion  afforded  trial  judges 
to identify aggravating facts warranting an upper term sen-tence, the DSL 

"does not represent a legislative effort to shift the proof of  particular  facts  from  elements  of  a  crime  (to  be 
proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be decided by a  judge).  .  .  .  Instead,  it  afforded  the  sentencing  judge

Opinion of the Court 
the  discretion  to  decide,  with  the  guidance  of  rules  and statutes,  whether  the  facts  of  the  case  and  the  history 

of  the  defendant  justify  the  higher  sentence.  Such  a system  does  not  diminish  the  traditional  power  of  the 
jury."  Id.,  at 1256, 113  P. 3d, at  544 (footnote omitted). 
We  cautioned  in  Blakely,  however,  that  broad  discretion to  decide  what  facts  may  support  an  enhanced  sentence,  or 

to determine whether an enhanced sentence is warranted in any particular case, does not shield a sentencing system from 
the  force  of  our  decisions.  If  the  jury's  verdict  alone  does not  authorize  the  sentence,  if,  instead,  the  judge  must  find 
an  additional  fact  to  impose  the  longer  term,  the  Sixth Amendment  requirement  is  not  satisfied.  542  U. S.,  at  305, 
and n. 8. The  Black  court  also  urged  that  the  DSL  is  not  cause  for 
concern  because  it  reduced  the  penalties  for  most  crimes over  the  prior  indeterminate  sentencing  regime.  35  Cal. 
4th,  at  1256-1258,  113  P.  3d,  at  544-545.  But  see  id.,  at 1271-1272, 113 P. 3d, at 555 (Kennard, J., concurring and dis-
senting)  ("This  aspect  of  our  sentencing  law  does  not  differ significantly  from  the  Washington  sentencing  scheme  [the 
high  court  invalidated  in  Blakely.]");  supra,  at  283-284. Furthermore, California's system is not unfair to defendants, 
for  they  "cannot  reasonably  expect  a  guarantee  that  the upper term will not be imposed" given judges' broad discre-
tion to impose an upper term sentence or to keep their pun-ishment  at  the  middle  term.  35  Cal.  4th,  at  1258-1259,  113 
P.  3d,  at  545-546.  The  Black  court  additionally  noted  that the  DSL  requires  statutory  enhancements  (as  distinguished 
from  aggravators)--e. g.,  the  use  of  a  firearm  or  other  dan-gerous  weapon,  infliction  of  great  bodily  injury,  Penal  Code 

$$ 12022,  12022.7-.8  (West  2000  and  Supp.  2006)--to  be charged  in  the  indictment  and  proved  to  a  jury  beyond  a 
reasonable doubt.  35 Cal. 4th, at 1257, 113 P. 3d, at 545. The 

Black court's examination of the DSL, in short, satis-fied it that California's sentencing system does not implicate

Opinion of the Court 
significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee.  Our decisions, however, leave no room 

for  such  an  examination.  Asking  whether  a  defendant's basic  jury-trial  right  is  preserved,  though  some  facts  essen-
tial  to  punishment  are  reserved  for  determination  by  the judge, we have  said,  is  the 

very inquiry  Apprendi's  "bright-
line  rule"  was  designed  to  exclude.  See  Blakely,  542  U. S., 
at  307-308.  But  see  Black,  35  Cal.  4th,  at  1260,  113  P.  3d, at 547 (stating, remarkably, that "[t]he high court precedents 

do not draw a bright line").14 Ultimately,  the 

Black  court  relied  on  an  equation  of  Cali-
fornia's  DSL  system  to  the  post-Booker  federal  system. "The level of discretion available to a California judge in se-

lecting  which  of  the  three  available  terms  to  impose,"  the court said, "appears comparable to the level of discretion that 
the  high  court  has  chosen  to  permit  federal  judges  in  postBooker  sentencing."  35  Cal.  4th,  at  1261,  113  P.  3d,  at  548.

Opinion of the Court 
tences in response to differing sets of facts," all Members of the  Court  agreed,  "would  not  implicate  the  Sixth  Amend-

ment."  Ibid.  To remedy the constitutional infirmity found in 

Booker,  the  Court's  majority  excised  provisions  that  ren-
dered the system mandatory, leaving the Guidelines in place as  advisory  only. 

Id.,  at  245-246.  See  also  supra,  at 
286-287. 

California's  DSL  does  not  resemble  the  advisory  system the 

Booker  Court  had  in  view.  Under  California's  system, 
judges  are  not  free  to  exercise  their  "discretion  to  select  a specific sentence within a defined range." 

Booker, 543 U. S., 
at 233.  California's Legislature has adopted sentencing tri-ads,  three  fixed  sentences  with  no  ranges  between  them. 

Cunningham's sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence  within  a  range  of  6  to  16  years.  Her  instruction 
was to select 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless she found facts allowing the imposition of a sentence of 6 or 
16  years.  Factfinding  to  elevate  a  sentence  from  12  to  16 years,  our  decisions  make  plain,  falls  within  the  province  of 
the  jury  employing  a  beyond-a-reasonable-doubt  standard, 
not  the  bailiwick  of  a  judge  determining  where  the  prepon-derance of the evidence lies. 

Nevertheless,  the  Black  court  attempted  to  rescue  the 
DSL's judicial factfinding authority by typing it simply a rea-
sonableness  constraint,  equivalent  to  the  constraint  opera-
tive  in  the  federal  system  post-Booker.  See  35  Cal.  4th,  at 
1261, 113 P. 3d, at 548 ("Because an aggravating factor under 
California law may include any factor that the judge reason-
ably  deems  relevant,  the  [DSL's]  requirement  that  an  upper 
term  sentence  be  imposed  only  if  an  aggravating  factor  ex-
ists  is  comparable  to  Booker's  requirement  that  a  federal 
judge's sentencing decision not be unreasonable.").  Reason-
ableness,  however,  is  not,  as  the  Black  court  would  have 
it,  the  touchstone  of  Sixth  Amendment  analysis.  The  rea-
sonableness  requirement  Booker  anticipated  for  the  federal 
system  operates  within  the  Sixth  Amendment  constraints 
delineated  in  our  precedent,  not  as  a  substitute  for  those

Opinion of the Court 
constraints.  Because  the  DSL  allocates  to  judges  sole  au-thority  to  find  facts  permitting  the  imposition  of  an  upper 

term  sentence,  the  system  violates  the  Sixth  Amendment. It  is  comforting,  but  beside  the  point,  that  California's  sys-
tem requires judge-determined DSL sentences to be reason-able.  Booker's remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, 
is  not  a  recipe  for  rendering  our  Sixth  Amendment  case law toothless.

15 

To  summarize:  Contrary  to  the  Black  court's  holding,  our decisions from 

Apprendi to Booker point to the middle term specified  in  California's  statutes,  not  the  upper  term,  as  the 

relevant  statutory  maximum.  Because  the  DSL  authorizes the judge, not the jury, to find the facts permitting an upper 
term  sentence,  the  system  cannot  withstand  measurement against our Sixth Amendment precedent.

court."  Booker, 543 U. S., at 265; cf. supra, at 288.  We note that several States have modified their systems  in the wake 

of  Apprendi  and  Blakely  to  retain  determinate  sentencing. They  have  done  so  by  calling  upon  the  jury--either  at  trial 
or in a separate sentencing proceeding--to find any fact nec-essary  to  the  imposition  of  an  elevated  sentence.

17  As  ear-

lier  noted,  California  already  employs  juries  in  this  manner to determine statutory  sentencing  enhancements.  See 

supra,  at  280,  290.  Other  States  have  chosen  to  permit judges  genuinely  "to  exercise  broad  discretion  .  .  .  within  a 
statutory range," 18  which, "everyone agrees," encounters no Sixth  Amendment  shoal. 

Booker,  543  U. S.,  at  233.  Cali-fornia may follow the paths taken by its sister States or oth-

erwise  alter  its  system,  so  long  as  the  State  observes  Sixth Amendment limitations declared in this Court's decisions.

For  the  reasons  stated,  the  judgment  of  the  California Court of Appeal is reversed in part, and the case is remanded 

for  further  proceedings  not  inconsistent  with  this  opinion.

competing buyers to exit the market, it will attempt to drive down input 
prices to reap supracompetitive profits that will at least offset the losses 
it suffered in bidding up input prices.  Pp. 320-321. 

(c)  Predatory-pricing  and  predatory-bidding  claims  are  analytically 
similar.  And  the  close  theoretical  connection  between  monopoly  and 
monopsony  suggests  that  similar  legal  standards  should  apply  to  both 
sorts  of  claims.  Both  involve  the  deliberate  use  of  unilateral  pricing 
measures  for  anticompetitive  purposes  and  both  require  firms  to  incur 
certain short-term losses on the chance that they might later make su-
pracompetitive  profits.  More  importantly,  predatory  bidding  mirrors 
predatory pricing in respects deemed significant in Brooke Group.  Be-
cause  rational  businesses  will  rarely  suffer  short-term  losses  in  hopes 
of  reaping  supracompetitive  profits,  Brooke  Group's  conclusion  that 
" `predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely suc-
cessful,' " 509 U. S., at 226, applies with equal force to predatory-bidding 
schemes.  And  like  the  predatory  conduct  in  Brooke  Group,  actions 
taken  in  a  predatory-bidding  scheme  are  often  " ` "the  very  essence  of 
competition," ' " ibid., because a failed predatory-bidding scheme can be 
a "boon to consumers," see id., at 224.  Predatory bidding also presents 
less of a direct  threat of  consumer harm than predatory pricing, which 
achieves  ultimate  success  by  charging  higher  prices  to  consumers,  be-
cause  a  predatory  bidder  does  not  necessarily  rely  on  raising  prices  in 
the output market to recoup its losses.  Pp. 321-325. 

(d)  Given these similarities, Brooke Group's two-pronged test should 
apply to predatory-bidding claims.  A predatory-bidding plaintiff must 
prove that the predator's bidding on the buy side caused the cost of the 
relevant output to rise above the revenues generated in the sale of those 
outputs.  Because the risk of chilling procompetitive behavior with too 
lax  a  liability  standard  is  as  serious  here  as  it  was  in  Brooke  Group, 
only higher bidding that leads to below-cost pricing in the relevant out-
put  market  will  suffice  as  a  basis  for  predatory-bidding  liability.  A 
predatory-bidding  plaintiff  also  must  prove  that  the  defendant  has  a 
dangerous  probability  of  recouping  the  losses  incurred  in  bidding  up 
input prices through the exercise of monopsony power.  Making such a 
showing will require "a close analysis of both the scheme alleged by the 
plaintiff and the [relevant market's] structure and conditions," 509 U. S., 
at 226.  Pp. 325-326. 

(e)  Because  Ross-Simmons  has  conceded  that it  has  not  satisfied  the 
Brooke Group standard, its predatory-bidding theory of liability cannot 
support the jury's verdict.  P. 326.

business  by  bidding  up  the  price  of  sawlogs  to  a  level  that prevented  Ross-Simmons  from  being  profitable.  A  jury  re-

turned  a  verdict  in  favor  of  Ross-Simmons  on  its  monopo-lization  claim,  and  the  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed.  We  granted 
certiorari to decide whether the test we applied to claims of predatory  pricing  in  Brooke  Group  Ltd.  v.  Brown  &  Wil-
liamson  Tobacco  Corp.,  509  U. S.  209  (1993),  also  applies  to claims of predatory bidding.  We hold that it does.  Accord-
ingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 

I 
This  antitrust  case  concerns  the  acquisition  of  red  alder sawlogs  by  the  mills  that  process  those  logs  in  the  Pacific 

Northwest.  These  hardwood-lumber  mills  usually  acquire logs  in  one  of  three  ways.  Some  logs  are  purchased  on  the 
open bidding market.  Some come to the mill through stand-ing  short- and  long-term  agreements  with  timberland  own-
ers.  And  others  are  harvested  from  timberland  owned  by the  sawmills  themselves.  The  allegations  relevant  to  our 
decision in this case relate to the bidding market. Ross-Simmons  began  operating  a  hardwood-lumber  saw-
mill  in  Longview,  Washington,  in  1962.  Weyerhaeuser  en-tered the Northwestern hardwood-lumber market in 1980 by 
acquiring an existing lumber company.  Weyerhaeuser grad-ually  increased  the  scope  of  its  hardwood-lumber  operation, 
and  it  now  owns  six  hardwood  sawmills  in  the  region.  By 2001, Weyerhaeuser's mills were acquiring approximately 65 
percent  of  the  alder  logs  available  for  sale  in  the  region. App. 754a, 341a. 

From  1990  to  2000,  Weyerhaeuser  made  more  than  $75 million  in  capital  investments  in  its  hardwood  mills  in  the 
Pacific  Northwest.  Id.,  at  159a.  During  this  period,  pro-duction increased at every Northwestern hardwood mill that 
Weyerhaeuser owned.  Id., at 160a.  In addition to increas-ing  production,  Weyerhaeuser  used  "state-of-the-art  tech-
nology," id., at 500a, including sawing equipment, to increase the amount of lumber recovered from every log, id., at 500a,

Opinion of the Court 

549a.  By contrast, Ross-Simmons appears to have engaged in  little  efficiency-enhancing  investment.  See 

id.,  at  438a- 
441a. Logs represent up to 75 percent of a sawmill's total costs. 

See  id.,  at  169a.  And  from  1998  to  2001,  the  price  of  alder sawlogs increased while prices for finished hardwood lumber 
fell.  These  divergent  trends  in  input  and  output  prices  cut 
into  the  mills'  profit  margins,  and  Ross-Simmons  suffered heavy  losses  during  this  time.  See 

id.,  at  155a  (showing  a 
negative  net  income  from  1998  to  2000).  Saddled  with  sev-eral million dollars in debt, Ross-Simmons shut down its mill 

completely in May 2001.  Id., at 156a. 

Ross-Simmons  blamed  Weyerhaeuser  for  driving  it  out  of 
business  by  bidding  up  input  costs,  and  it  filed  an  antitrust 
suit against Weyerhaeuser for monopolization and attempted 
monopolization  under  $ 2  of  the  Sherman  Act.  See  26  Stat. 
209,  as  amended,  15  U. S. C.  $ 2  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV).  RossSimmons  alleged  that,  among  other  anticompetitive  acts, 
Weyerhaeuser  had  used  "its  dominant  position  in  the  alder 
sawlog  market  to  drive  up  the  prices  for  alder  sawlogs  to 
levels that severely reduced or eliminated the profit margins 
of  Weyerhaeuser's  alder  sawmill  competition."  App.  135a. 
Proceeding  in  part  on  this  "predatory-bidding"  theory, 
Ross-Simmons  argued  that  Weyerhaeuser  had  overpaid  for 
alder  sawlogs  to  cause  sawlog  prices  to  rise  to  artificially 
high  levels  as  part  of  a  plan  to  drive  Ross-Simmons  out  of 
business.  As  proof  that  this  practice  had  occurred,  RossSimmons pointed to Weyerhaeuser's large share of the alder 
purchasing market, rising alder sawlog prices during the al-
leged predation period, and Weyerhaeuser's declining profits 
during that same period. 

Prior  to  trial,  Weyerhaeuser  moved  for  summary  judg-
ment  on  Ross-Simmons'  predatory-bidding  theory.  Id.,  at 
6a-24a.  The District Court denied the motion.  Id., at 58a- 
69a.  At  the  close  of  the  9-day  trial,  Weyerhaeuser  moved 
for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law,  or  alternatively,  for  a  new

Opinion of the Court 
trial.  The  motions  were  based  in  part  on  Weyerhaeuser's argument that Ross-Simmons had not satisfied the standard 

this  Court  set  forth  in  Brooke  Group,  supra.  App.  940a- 942a.  The  District  Court  denied  Weyerhaeuser's  motion. 
Id.,  at  720a,  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  46a.  The  District  Court also  rejected  proposed  predatory-bidding  jury  instructions 
that incorporated elements of the Brooke Group test.  App. 
725a-730a,  978a.  Ultimately,  the  District  Court  instructed the  jury  that  Ross-Simmons  could  prove  that  Weyerhaeus-

er's  bidding  practices  were  anticompetitive  acts  if  the  jury concluded  that  Weyerhaeuser  "purchased  more  logs  than  it 
needed,  or  paid  a  higher  price  for  logs  than  necessary,  in 
order  to  prevent  [Ross-Simmons]  from  obtaining  the  logs 
they  needed  at  a  fair  price."  Id.,  at  978a.  Finding  that 
Ross-Simmons  had  proved  its  claim  for  monopolization,  the 
jury  returned  a  $26  million  verdict  against  Weyerhaeuser. 
Id.,  at  967a.  The  verdict  was  trebled  to  approximately  $79 
million. 

Weyerhaeuser  appealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 
Ninth  Circuit.  There,  Weyerhaeuser  argued  that  Brooke 
Group's standard for claims of predatory pricing should also 
apply  to  claims  of  predatory  bidding.  The  Ninth  Circuit 
disagreed  and  affirmed  the  verdict  against  Weyerhaeuser. 
Confederated  Tribes  of  Siletz  Indians  of  Ore.  v.  Weyer-
haeuser Co., 411 F. 3d 1030, 1035-1036 (2005). 

The  Court  of  Appeals  reasoned  that  "buy-side  predatory 
bidding"  and  "sell-side  predatory  pricing,"  though  similar, 
are  materially  different  in  that  predatory  bidding  does  not 
necessarily benefit consumers or stimulate competition in the 
way that  predatory pricing does.  Id.,  at 1037.  Concluding 
that "the concerns that led the Brooke Group Court to estab-
lish a high standard of liability in the predatory pricing con-
text do not carry over to this predatory bidding context with 
the  same  force,"  the  Court  of  Appeals  declined  to  apply 
Brooke Group to Ross-Simmons' claims of predatory bidding.

clude  that  substantial  evidence  supported  a  finding  of  lia-bility  on  the  predatory-bidding  theory.  Id.,  at  1045.  We 

granted  certiorari  to  decide  whether  Brooke  Group  applies to  claims  of  predatory  bidding.  548  U. S.  903  (2006).  We

In  Brooke  Group,  we  considered  what  a  plaintiff  must show  in  order  to  succeed  on  a  claim  of  predatory  pricing 

under  $ 2  of  the  Sherman  Act.1  In  a  typical  predatory-pricing  scheme,  the  predator  reduces  the  sale  price  of  its 
product  (its  output)  to  below  cost,  hoping  to  drive  competi-tors  out  of  business.  Then,  with  competition  vanquished, 
the predator raises output prices to a supracompetitive level. See  Matsushita  Elec.  Industrial  Co.  v.  Zenith  Radio  Corp., 
475 U. S. 574, 584-585, n. 8 (1986) (describing predatory pric-ing).  For  the  scheme  to  make  economic  sense,  the  losses 
suffered  from  pricing  goods  below  cost  must  be  recouped (with  interest)  during  the  supracompetitive-pricing  stage  of 
the  scheme.  Id.,  at  588-589;  Cargill,  Inc.  v.  Monfort  of Colo.,  Inc.,  479  U. S.  104,  121-122,  n.  17  (1986);  see  also  R. 
Bork,  The  Antitrust  Paradox  145  (1978).  Recognizing  this economic  reality,  we  established  two  prerequisites  to  recov-
ery  on  claims  of  predatory  pricing.  "First,  a  plaintiff  seek-ing  to  establish  competitive  injury  resulting  from  a  rival's 
low  prices  must  prove  that  the  prices  complained  of  are below  an  appropriate  measure  of  its  rival's  costs." 

Brooke Group,  509  U. S.,  at  222.  Second,  a  plaintiff  must  demon-

strate that "the competitor had . . .  a  dangerous probabilit[y] 

1 Brooke Group dealt with a claim under the Robinson-Patman Act, but 
as  we  observed,  "primary-line  competitive  injury  under  the  RobinsonPatman  Act  is  of  the  same  general  character  as  the  injury  inflicted  by 
predatory pricing schemes actionable under $ 2 of the Sherman Act."  509 
U. S., at 221.  Because of  this similarity, the standard adopted in Brooke 
Group applies  to  predatory-pricing  claims  under  $ 2  of  the  Sherman  Act.

Opinion of the Court 
of  recouping  its  investment  in  below-cost  prices."  Id., at 224. 

The first prong of the test--requiring that prices be below cost--is necessary because "[a]s a general rule, the exclusion-
ary  effect  of  prices  above  a  relevant  measure  of  cost  either reflects the lower cost structure of the alleged predator, and 
so  represents  competition  on  the  merits,  or  is  beyond  the 
practical ability of a judicial tribunal to control."  Id., at 223. We  were  particularly  wary  of  allowing  recovery  for  above-

cost  price  cutting  because  allowing  such  claims  could,  per-versely, "chil[l] legitimate price cutting," which directly ben-
efits consumers.  See id., at 223-224; Atlantic Richfield Co. 
v.  USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328, 340 (1990) ("Low prices 
benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and 
so  long  as  they  are  above  predatory  levels,  they  do  not 
threaten  competition").  Thus,  we  specifically  declined  to 
allow  plaintiffs  to  recover  for  above-cost  price  cutting,  con-
cluding that "discouraging a price cut and . . . depriving con-
sumers of the benefits of lower prices . . .  does not constitute 
sound antitrust policy."  Brooke Group, supra, at 224. 

The  second  prong  of  the  Brooke  Group  test--requiring 
that  there  be  a  dangerous  probability  of  recoupment  of 
losses--is  necessary  because,  without  a  dangerous  probabil-
ity  of  recoupment,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  a  firm  would 
engage  in  predatory  pricing.  As  the  Court  explained  in 
Matsushita,  a  firm  engaged  in  a  predatory-pricing  scheme 
makes  an  investment--the  losses  suffered  plus  the  profits 
that  would  have  been  realized  absent  the  scheme--at  the 
initial, below-cost-selling phase.  475 U. S., at 588-589.  For 
that investment to be rational, a firm must reasonably expect 
to recoup in the long run at least its original investment with 
supracompetitive profits.  Ibid.; Brooke Group, 509 U. S., at 
224.  Without such a reasonable expectation, a rational firm 
would not willingly suffer definite, short-run losses.  Recog-
nizing  the  centrality  of  recoupment  to  a  predatory-pricing 
scheme,  we required  predatory-pricing  plaintiffs to  "demon-

strate  that  there  is  a  likelihood  that  the  predatory  scheme alleged would cause a rise in prices above a competitive level 

that  would  be  sufficient  to  compensate  for  the  amounts  ex-pended  on  the  predation,  including  the  time  value  of  the 
money invested in it."  Id., at 225. We  described  the  two  parts  of  the  Brooke  Group  test  as 
"essential components of real market injury" that were "not easy to establish." 

Id., at 226.  We also reiterated that the costs of erroneous findings of predatory-pricing liability were 

quite  high  because  " `[t]he  mechanism  by  which  a  firm  en-gages  in  predatory  pricing--lowering  prices--is  the  same 
mechanism  by  which  a  firm  stimulates  competition,' "  and, therefore,  mistaken  findings  of  liability  would  " ` "chill  the 
very  conduct  the  antitrust  laws  are  designed  to  protect." ' " Ibid. (quoting Cargill, supra, at 122, n. 17).

Predatory  bidding,  which  Ross-Simmons  alleges  in  this case,  involves  the  exercise  of  market  power  on  the  buy  side 

or input side of a market.  In a predatory-bidding scheme, a purchaser  of  inputs  "bids  up  the  market  price  of  a  critical 
input to such high levels that rival buyers cannot survive (or compete as vigorously) and, as a result, the predating buyer 
acquires  (or  maintains  or  increases  its)  monopsony  power." Kirkwood, Buyer Power and Exclusionary Conduct, 72 Anti-
trust  L.  J.  625,  652  (2005)  (hereinafter  Kirkwood).  Monop-sony  power  is  market  power  on  the  buy  side  of  the  market. 
Blair  &  Harrison,  Antitrust  Policy  and  Monopsony,  76  Cor-nell L. Rev. 297 (1991).  As such, a monopsony is to the buy 
side of the market what a monopoly is to the sell side and is sometimes colloquially called a "buyer's monopoly."  See 

id., at 301, 320; Piraino, A Proposed Antitrust Approach to Buy-

ers' Competitive Conduct, 56 Hastings L. J. 1121, 1125 (2005). A predatory bidder ultimately aims to exercise the monop-
sony  power  gained  from  bidding  up  input  prices.  To  that end, once the predatory bidder has caused competing buyers

Opinion of the Court 
to exit the  market for  purchasing  inputs,  it  will seek  to "re-strict  its  input  purchases  below  the  competitive  level,"  thus 

"reduc[ing]  the  unit  price  for  the  remaining  input[s]  it  pur-chases. "  Salop, Anticompetitive Overbuying by Power 
Buyers, 72 Antitrust L. J. 669, 672 (2005) (hereinafter Salop). The  reduction  in  input  prices  will  lead  to  "a  significant  cost 
saving  that  more  than  offsets  the  profit[s]  that  would  have been  earned  on  the  output." 

Ibid.  If  all  goes  as  planned, the predatory bidder will reap monopsonistic profits that will 

offset  any  losses  suffered  in  bidding  up  input  prices.2  (In this  case,  the  plaintiff was  the  defendant's competitor  in  the 
input-purchasing  market.  Thus,  this  case  does  not  present a situation  of suppliers suing  a monopsonist  buyer under  $ 2 
of the Sherman Act, nor does it present a risk of significantly increased concentration in the market in which the monopso-
nist sells, i. e., the market for finished lumber.)

A  

Predatory-pricing  and  predatory-bidding  claims  are  ana-lytically similar.  See Hovenkamp, The Law of Exclusionary 

Pricing,  2  Competition  Policy  Int'l,  No.  1,  pp.  21,  35  (Spring 2006).  This similarity results from the close theoretical con-
nection  between  monopoly  and  monopsony.  See  Kirkwood 653  (describing  monopsony  as  the  "mirror  image"  of  monop-
oly);  Khan  v.  State  Oil  Co.,  93  F.  3d  1358,  1361  (CA7  1996) ("[M]onopsony pricing . . . is  analytically the same as monop-
oly or cartel pricing and [is] so treated by the law"), vacated and  remanded  on  other  grounds,  522  U. S.  3  (1997); 

Vogel  v. 

2 If the predatory firm's competitors in the input market and the output 
market are the same, then predatory bidding can also lead to the bidder's 
acquisition of monopoly power in the output market.  In that case, which 
does not appear to be present here, the monopsonist could, under certain 
market conditions, also recoup its losses by raising output prices to monop-
olistic  levels.  See  Salop  679-682  (describing  a  monopsonist's  predatory 
strategy that depends upon raising prices in the output market).

LUMBER  CO. 

Opinion of the Court 

American Soc. of Appraisers, 744  F.  2d  598, 601  (CA7  1984) ("[M]onopoly  and  monopsony  are  symmetrical  distortions  of 

competition from an economic standpoint"); see also Hearing on Monopsony Issues in Agriculture: Buying Power of Proc-
essors in Our Nation's Agricultural Markets before the Sen-ate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary,  108th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  13 
(2004).  The kinship between monopoly and monopsony sug-gests  that  similar  legal  standards  should  apply  to  claims  of 
monopolization  and  to  claims  of  monopsonization.  Cf.  Noll, "Buyer  Power"  and  Economic  Policy,  72  Antitrust  L.  J.  589, 
591  (2005)  ("[A]symmetric  treatment  of  monopoly  and  mo-nopsony has no basis in economic analysis"). 

Tracking  the  economic  similarity  between  monopoly  and monopsony, predatory-pricing plaintiffs and predatory-
bidding  plaintiffs  make  strikingly  similar  allegations.  A predatory-pricing  plaintiff alleges that a  predator cut  prices 
to  drive  the  plaintiff  out  of  business  and,  thereby,  to  reap monopoly  profits  from  the  output  market.  In  parallel  fash-
ion,  a  predatory-bidding  plaintiff  alleges  that  a  predator raised prices for a key input to drive the plaintiff out of busi-
ness  and,  thereby,  to  reap  monopsony  profits  in  the  input market.  Both claims involve the deliberate use of unilateral 
pricing  measures  for  anticompetitive  purposes.3  And  both claims  logically  require  firms  to  incur  short-term  losses  on 
the  chance  that  they  might  reap  supracompetitive  profits  in the future. 

3 Predatory  bidding  on  inputs  is  not  analytically  different  from  preda-
tory overbuying of inputs.  Both practices fall under the rubric of monop-
sony predation and involve  an input purchaser's use of input prices in  an 
attempt  to  exclude  rival  input  purchasers.  The  economic  effect  of  the 
practices  is  identical:  Input  prices  rise.  In  a  predatory-bidding  scheme, 
the purchaser causes prices to rise by offering to pay more for inputs.  In 
a  predatory-overbuying  scheme,  the  purchaser  causes  prices  to  rise  by 
demanding  more  of  the  input.  Either  way,  input  prices  increase.  Our 
use of the term "predatory bidding" is not meant to suggest that different 
legal  treatment  is  appropriate  for  the  economically  identical  practice  of 
"predatory overbuying."

More  importantly,  predatory  bidding  mirrors  predatory pricing in respects that we deemed significant to our analysis 

in Brooke Group.  In Brooke Group, we noted that " `preda-tory  pricing  schemes  are  rarely  tried,  and  even  more  rarely 
successful.' "  509  U. S.,  at  226  (quoting  Matsushita,  475 U. S.,  at  589).  Predatory  pricing  requires  a  firm  to  suffer 
certain  losses  in  the  short  term  on  the  chance  of  reaping supracompetitive  profits  in  the  future. 

Id.,  at  588-589.  A rational business will rarely make this sacrifice.  Ibid.  The 

same reasoning applies  to predatory bidding.  A predatory-bidding  scheme  requires  a  buyer  of  inputs  to  suffer  losses 
today on the chance that it will reap supracompetitive profits in the future.  For this reason, "[s]uccessful monopsony pre-
dation is probably as unlikely as successful monopoly preda-tion."  R. Blair & J. Harrison, Monopsony 66 (1993). 

And  like  the  predatory  conduct  alleged  in  Brooke  Group, actions taken in a predatory-bidding scheme are often " ` "the 
very  essence  of  competition." ' "  509  U. S.,  at  226  (quoting 
Cargill, 479  U. S.,  at 122, n. 17,  in  turn  quoting Matsushita, supra, at 594).  Just as sellers use output prices to compete 

for  purchasers,  buyers  use  bid  prices  to  compete  for  scarce inputs.  There are myriad legitimate reasons--ranging from 
benign  to  affirmatively  procompetitive--why  a  buyer  might bid  up  input  prices.  A  firm  might  bid  up inputs as  a  result 
of  miscalculation  of  its  input  needs  or  as  a  response  to  in-creased  consumer  demand  for  its  outputs.  A  more  efficient 
firm  might  bid  up  input  prices  to  acquire  more  inputs  as  a part of a procompetitive strategy to gain market share in the 
output  market.  A  firm  that  has  adopted  an  input-intensive production process might bid up inputs to acquire the inputs 
necessary  for  its  process.  Or  a  firm  might  bid  up  input prices to acquire excess inputs as a hedge against the risk of 
future  rises  in  input  costs  or  future  input  shortages.  See Salop 682-683; Kirkwood 655.  There is nothing illicit about 
these bidding decisions.  Indeed, this sort of high bidding is

essential  to  competition  and  innovation  on  the  buy  side  of 
the market.4 

Brooke  Group  also  noted  that  a  failed  predatory-pricing 
scheme  may  benefit  consumers.  509  U. S., at  224.  The  po-
tential benefit results from the difficulty an aspiring predator 
faces  in  recouping  losses  suffered  from  below-cost  pricing. 
Without successful recoupment, "predatory pricing produces 
lower aggregate prices in the market, and consumer welfare 
is enhanced."  Ibid.  Failed predatory-bidding schemes can 
also, but will not  necessarily,  benefit consumers.  See Salop 
677-678.  In  the  first  stage  of  a  predatory-bidding  scheme, 
the  predator's high  bidding  will  likely lead  to its  acquisition 
of  more  inputs.  Usually,  the  acquisition  of  more  inputs 
leads to the manufacture of more outputs.  And increases in 
output  generally  result  in  lower  prices  to  consumers.5  Id., 
at  677;  Blair  &  Harrison,  supra,  at  66-67.  Thus,  a  failed 
predatory-bidding  scheme  can  be  a  "boon  to  consumers"  in 
the same way that we considered a predatory-pricing scheme 
to be.  See Brooke Group, supra, at 224. 

In  addition,  predatory  bidding  presents  less  of  a  direct 
threat  of  consumer  harm  than  predatory  pricing.  A 
predatory-pricing  scheme  ultimately  achieves  success  by 
charg ing  higher  prices  to  consumers.  By  contrast,  a 
predatory-bidding scheme could succeed with little or no ef-
fect on consumer prices because a predatory bidder does not 
necessarily  rely  on  raising  prices  in  the  output  market  to 
recoup its losses.  Salop 676.  Even if output prices remain 
constant,  a  predatory  bidder  can  use  its  power  as  the  pre-

4 Higher prices for inputs obviously benefit existing sellers of inputs and 
encourage new firms to enter the market for input sales as well. 

5 Consumer benefit does not necessarily result at the first stage because 

the  predator  might  not  use  its  excess  inputs  to  manufacture  additional 
outputs.  It  might  instead  destroy  the  excess  inputs.  See  Salop  677, 
n.  22.  Also,  if  the  same  firms  compete  in  the  input  and  output  markets, 
any  increase  in  outputs  by  the  predator  could  be  offset  by  decreases  in 
outputs from the predator's struggling competitors.

C 
The  general  theoretical  similarities  of  monopoly  and  mo-nopsony combined with the theoretical and practical similari-

ties  of  predatory  pricing  and  predatory  bidding  convince  us that  our  two-pronged  Brooke  Group  test  should  apply  to 
predatory-bidding claims. The first prong of Brooke Group's test requires little adap-
tation  for  the  predatory-bidding  context.  A  plaintiff  must prove  that  the  alleged  predatory  bidding  led  to  below-cost 
pricing  of  the  predator's  outputs.  That  is,  the  predator's bidding  on  the  buy  side  must  have  caused  the  cost  of  the 
relevant  output to  rise  above  the  revenues  generated  in  the sale of those outputs.  As with predatory pricing, the exclu-
sionary  effect  of  higher  bidding  that  does  not  result  in below-cost  output  pricing  "is  beyond  the  practical  ability  of 
a  judicial  tribunal  to  control  without  courting  intolerable risks  of  chilling  legitimate"  procompetitive  conduct.  509 
U. S.,  at  223.  Given  the  multitude  of  procompetitive  ends served by higher bidding for  inputs, the risk of chilling pro-
competitive  behavior  with  too  lax  a  liability  standard  is  as serious here as it was in 

Brooke Group.  Consequently, only higher  bidding  that  leads  to  below-cost  pricing  in  the  rele-

vant  output  market  will  suffice  as  a  basis  for  liability  for predatory bidding. 

A predatory-bidding plaintiff also must prove that the de-fendant  has  a  dangerous  probability  of  recouping  the  losses 
incurred  in  bidding  up  input  prices  through  the  exercise  of monopsony  power.  Absent  proof  of  likely  recoupment,  a 
strategy  of  predatory  bidding  makes  no  economic  sense  be-cause  it  would  involve  short-term  losses  with  no  likelihood 
of  offsetting  long-term  gains.  Cf.  id.,  at  224  (citing  Matsu-
shita,  supra,  at  588-589).  As  with  predatory  pricing, making  a  showing  on  the  recoupment  prong  will  require

Opinion of the Court 
Respondent argues that she is free to show harm to other victims because it is relevant to a different part of the puni-

tive  damages  constitutional  equation,  namely,  reprehensibil-ity.  That is to say, harm to others shows more reprehensible 
conduct.  Philip Morris, in turn, does  not deny that  a plain-tiff may show harm to others in order to demonstrate repre-
hensibility.  Nor do we.  Evidence of actual harm to nonpar-ties  can  help  to  show  that  the  conduct  that  harmed  the 
plaintiff also posed a substantial risk of harm to the general public,  and  so  was  particularly  reprehensible--although 
counsel may argue in a particular case that conduct resulting in  no  harm  to  others  nonetheless  posed  a  grave  risk  to  the 
public,  or  the  converse.  Yet  for  the  reasons  given  above,  a jury may not go further than this and use a punitive damages 
verdict to punish a defendant directly on account of harms it is alleged to have visited on nonparties. 

Given the risks of unfairness that we have mentioned, it is constitutionally  important  for  a  court  to  provide  assurance 
that the jury will ask the right question, not the wrong one. And  given  the  risks  of  arbitrariness,  the  concern  for  ade-
quate notice, and the risk that punitive damages awards can, in  practice,  impose  one  State's  (or  one  jury's)  policies  (e.

conduct  that  risks  harm  to  only  a  few.  And  a  jury  conse-quently may take this fact into account in determining repre-

of Conversion to Chapter 13."  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy  Procedure  1017(f)(2),  the  notice  of  conversion 

was treated as a motion to convert, to which both the trustee and the Bank filed objec ti ons.  Rely ing pr i mari ly on 
Marrama's  attempt  to  conceal  the  Maine  property  from  his creditors,

3  the trustee contended that the request to convert 

was  made  in  bad  faith  and  would  constitute  an  abuse  of  the bankruptcy  process.  The  Bank  opposed  the  conversion  on 

similar grounds. At the hearing on the conversion issue, Marrama explained 
through  counsel  that  his  misstatements  about  the  Maine property  were  attributable  to  "scrivener's  error,"  that  he 
had originally filed under  Chapter  7  rather than  Chapter 13 because  he  was  then  unemployed,  and  that  he  had  recently 
become  employed  and  was  therefore  eligible  to  proceed under  Chapter  13.

the latter provision, $ 1307(c), provides that a Chapter 13 pro-
ceeding  may  be  either  dismissed  or  converted  to  a  Chapter 
7  proceeding  "for  cause"  and  includes  a  nonexclusive  list 
of  10  causes  justifying  that  relief.8  None  of  the  specified 
causes  mentions  prepetition  bad-faith  conduct  (although 
paragraph  (10)  does  identify  one  form  of  Chapter  7  error-- 
which is necessarily prepetition conduct--that would justify 
dismissal of a  Chapter 13 case).9  Bankruptcy courts never-

public  streets;  and  when  a  man  is  lawfully  in  a  house,  it  is imprisonment to prevent him from leaving the room in which 
he is."  M. Newell, Law of Malicious Prosecution, False Im-prisonment,  and  Abuse  of  Legal  Process  $ 2,  p.  57  (1892)

A.  Gans,  American  Law  of  Torts  $ 27:2,  pp.  940-942  (1990). We shall thus refer to the two torts together as false impris-

onment.  That tort provides the proper analogy to the cause of  action  asserted  against  the  present  respondents  for  the 
following  reason:  The  sort  of  unlawful  detention  remediable 
by  the  tort  of false  imprisonment is  detention without

Opinion of the Court 
Petitioner asserts that the date of his release from custody 
must be the relevant date in the circumstances of the present 
suit, since he is  seeking damages up  to that time.  The the-
ory  of  his  complaint  is  that  the  initial  Fourth  Amendment 
violation set the wheels in motion for his subsequent convic-
tion  and  detention:  The  unlawful  arrest  led  to  the  coerced 
confession,  which  was  introduced  at  his  trial,  producing  his 
conviction and incarceration.  As we have just explained, at 
common law damages for detention after issuance of process 
or  arraignment  would  be  attributable  to  a  tort  other  than 
the  unlawful  arrest  alleged  in  petitioner's  complaint--and 
probably  a  tort  chargeable  to  defendants  other  than  the  re-
spondents here.  Even assuming, however, that all damages 
for detention pursuant to legal process could be regarded as 
consequential  damages  attributable  to  the  unlawful  arrest, 
that would not alter the commencement date for the statute 
of limitations.  "Under the traditional rule of accrual . . . the 
tort  cause  of  action  accrues,  and  the  statute  of  limitations 
commences to run, when the wrongful act or omission results 
in  damages.  The  cause  of  action  accrues  even  though  the 
full  extent  of  the  injury  is  not  then  known  or  predictable." 
1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 7.4.1, pp. 526-527 (1991) 
(footnote omitted); see also 54 C. J. S., Limitations of Actions 

$ 112,  p.  150  (2005).  Were  it  otherwise,  the  statute  would 
begin  to  run  only  after  a  plaintiff  became  satisfied  that  he 
had  been  harmed  enough,  placing  the  supposed  statute  of 
repose in the sole hands of the party seeking relief. 

We conclude that  the  statute of limitations  on petitioner's 

$ 1983 claim commenced to run when he appeared before the 
examining  magistrate  and  was  bound  over  for  trial.  Since 
more than two years elapsed between that date and the filing 

and  was  entitled  to  bring  suit  at  that  time.  See  Adler

tion,  but  Travelers  and  PG&E  ultimately  resolved  the  dis-
pute  by  entering  into  a  stipulation  that  was  later  approved 
by  the  Bankruptcy  Court.  In  addition  to  accommodating 
Travelers'  substantive  concerns,  the  stipulation  stated  that 
Travelers  " `may  assert  its  claim  for  attorneys'  fees  under 
the  [i]ndemnity  [a]greements' "  (subject  to  PG&E's  right  to

seeking  to  recover  the  attorney's  fees  it  incurred  in  con-
nection  with  PG&E's  bankruptcy  proceedings.  PG&E  ob-
jected,  arguing  that  Travelers  could  not  recover  attorney's 
fees incurred while litigating issues of bankruptcy law.

|| 506.04[3][a],  p.  506-118  (rev.  15th  ed.  2006)  (hereinafter

This case requires us to consider whether the Bankruptcy 
Code  disallows  contract-based  claims  for  attorney's  fees 
based solely  on the  fact that the  fees  at issue were incurred 
litigating  issues  of  bankruptcy  law.  We  conclude  that  it 
does not.

igating  issues  of  federal  bankruptcy  law  overcomes  that presumption. 

Section 502(b)(4) is instructive on this point.  That provi-sion  expressly  disallows  claims  for  a  particular  category  of 
attorney's fees--those "for services of an . . .  attorney of the debtor," to the extent the claimed fees "excee[d] the reason-
able value of such services."  The existence of that provision 
suggests  that,  in  its  absence,  a  claim  for  such  fees  would  be allowed in bankruptcy to the extent enforceable under state 

law.  The  absence  of  an  analogous  provision  excluding  the category  of  fees  covered  by  the

458  ROCKWELL  INT'L  CORP.  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Syllabus 
Held: 

1.  Section  3730(e)(4)'s  original-source  requirement  is  jurisdictional. 
Thus, regardless  of whether  Rockwell  conceded Stone's original-source 
status,  this  Court  must  decide  whether  Stone  meets  this  jurisdictional 
requirement.  Pp. 467-470. 

2.  Because  Stone  does  not  meet  $ 3730(e)(4)(B)'s  requirement  that  a 
relator  have  "direct  and  independent  knowledge  of  the  information 
on  which  the  allegations  are  based,"  he  is  not  an  original  source. 
Pp. 470-476. 

(a)  The  "information"  to  which  subparagraph  (B)  speaks  is  the  in-
formation  on  which  the  relator's  allegations  are  based  rather  than  the 
information  on  which  the  publicly  disclosed  allegations  that  triggered 
the public-disclosure bar are based.  The subparagraph standing on its 
own  suggests  that  disposition.  And  those  "allegations"  are  not  the 
same  as  the  allegations  referred  to  in  subparagraph  (A),  which  bars 
actions  based  on  the  "public  disclosure  of  allegations  or  transactions" 
with an exception for cases brought by "an original source of the infor-
mation."  Had Congress wanted to link original-source status to infor-
mation  underlying  public  disclosure  it  would  have  used  the  identical 
phrase, "allegations or transactions."  Furthermore, it is difficult to un-
derstand why Congress  would  care  whether a relator  knows about  the 
information underlying a publicly disclosed allegation when the relator 
has direct and independent knowledge of different information support-
ing the same allegation.  Pp. 470-472. 

(b)  In  determining  which  "allegations"  are  relevant,  that  term  is 
not  limited  to  "allegations"  in  the  original  complaint,  but  includes 
the  allegations  as  amended.  The  statute  speaks  of  the  relator's  "alle-
gations"  simpliciter.  Absent  some  limitation  of  $ 3730(e)(4)'s  re-
quirement to the initial complaint, this Court will not infer one.  Here, 
where  the  final  pretrial  order  superseded  prior  pleadings,  this  Court 
looks  to  the  final  pretrial  order  to  determine  original-source  status.

(c)  Judged  according  to  these  principles,  Stone's  knowledge  falls 
short.  The  only  false  claims  found  by  the  jury  involved  insolid  pond-
crete  discovered  after  Stone  left  his  employment.  Thus,  he  did  not 
know that the pondcrete had failed; he predicted it.  And his prediction 
was  a  failed  one,  for  Stone  believed  the  piping  system  was  defective 
when,  in  fact,  the  pondcrete  problem  would  be  caused  by  a  foreman's 
actions  after  Stone  had  left  the  plant.  Stone's  original-source  status 
with respect to a separate, spray-irrigation claim did not provide juris-
diction over all of his claims.  Section 3730(e)(4) does not permit juris-

tion  ponds  at  the  facility,  by  mixing  it  with  cement.  The idea  was  to  pour  the  mixture  into  large  rectangular  boxes, 

where it would solidify into "pondcrete" blocks that could be stored onsite or transported to other sites for disposal. 

Stone  reviewed  a  proposed  manufacturing  process  for pondcrete  in  1982.  He  concluded  that  the  proposal  "would 
not  work,"  App.  175,  and  communicated  that  conclusion  to 
Rockwell  management  in  a  written  "Engineering  Order." As  Stone  would  later  explain,  he  believed  "the  suggested 

process would result in an unstable mixture that would later deteriorate  and  cause  unwanted  release  of  toxic  wastes  to 
the  environment."  Ibid.  He  believed  this  because  he 
"foresaw that the piping system" that extracted sludge from 
the  solar  ponds  "would  not  properly  remove  the  sludge  and 
would  lead  to  an  inadequate  mixture  of  sludge/waste  and 
cement  such  that  the  `pond  crete'  blocks  would  rapidly  dis-
integrate  thus  creating  additional  contamination  problems." 
Id., at 290. 

Notwithstanding  Stone's  prediction,  Rockwell  proceeded 
with  its  pondcrete  project  and  successfully  manufactured 
"concrete  hard"  pondcrete  during  the  period  of  Stone's  em-
ployment  at  Rocky  Flats.  It  was  only  after  Stone  was  laid 
off in March 1986 that what the parties have called "insolid" 
pondcrete  blocks  were  discovered.  According  to  respond-
ents, Rockwell knew by October 1986 that a substantial num-
ber  of  pondcrete  blocks  were  insolid,  but  DOE  did  not  be-
come  aware  of  the  problem  until  May  1988,  when  several 
pondcrete  blocks  began  to  leak,  leading  to  the  discovery  of 
thousands of other insolid blocks.  The media reported these 
discoveries,  3  Appellants'  App.  in  No.  99-1351  etc.  (CA10), 
pp.  889-38  to  889-39,  and  attributed  the  malfunction  to 
Rockwell's  reduction  of  the  ratio  of  concrete  to  sludge  in 
the mixture. 

In June 1987, more than a year after he had left Rockwell's 
employ,  Stone  went  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation 
(FBI)  with  allegations  of  environmental  crimes  at  Rocky

Opinion of the Court 
Flats during the  time of his employment.  According to the court below, Stone alleged that 

"contrary  to  public  knowledge,  Rocky  Flats  accepted hazardous  and  nuclear  waste  from  other  DOE  facilities; 
that  Rockwell  employees  were  `forbidden  from  discuss-ing any controversies in front of a DOE employee'; that 
although  Rocky  Flats'  fluid  bed  incinerators  failed  test-ing  in  1981,  the  pilot  incinerator  remained  on  line  and 
was used to incinerate wastes daily since 1981, including plutonium  wastes  which  were  then  sent  out  for  burial; 
that Rockwell distilled and fractionated various oils and solvents  although  the  wastes  were  geared  for  incin-
eration;  that  Stone  believed  that  the  ground  water  was contaminated  from  previous  waste  burial  and  land  ap-
plication,  and  that  hazardous  waste  lagoons  tended  to overflow  during  and after  `a good  rain,' causing hazard-
ous wastes to be discharged without first being treated." App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. 

Stone provided the FBI with 2,300 pages of documents, bur-ied among which was his 1982 engineering report predicting 
that  the  pondcrete-system  design  would  not  work.  Stone did  not  discuss  his  pondcrete  allegations  with  the  FBI  in 
their conversations.1 Based in part on information allegedly learned from Stone, 
the Government obtained a search warrant for Rocky Flats, and  on  June  6,  1989,  75  FBI  and  Environmental  Protection 
Agency  agents  raided  the  facility.  The  affidavit  in  support of the warrant included allegations (1) that pondcrete blocks 
were insolid "due to an inadequate waste-concrete mixture," App. 429, (2) that Rockwell obtained award fees based on its 
alleged  " `excellent' " management  of  Rocky  Flats,  id., at  98, and  (3)  that  Rockwell  made  false  statements  and  concealed 
material facts in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 90 Stat. 2811, as amended, 42 

1 Stone  claimed  the  contrary,  but  the  District  Court  found  that  he  had 
failed to establish that fact.

U. S. C.  $ 6928,  and  18  U. S. C.  $ 1001.  Newspapers  pub-lished  these  allegations.  In  March  1992,  Rockwell  pleaded 

guilty to 10 environmental violations, including the knowing storage  of  insolid  pondcrete  blocks  in  violation  of  RCRA. 
Rockwell agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines. 

B 
In  July  1989,  Stone  filed  a  qui  tam  suit  under  the  False Claims  Act.

2  That  Act  prohibits  false  or  fraudulent  claims 

for  payment  to  the  United  States,  31  U. S. C.  $ 3729(a),  and authorizes  civil  actions  to  remedy  such  fraud  to  be  brought 

by the Attorney General, $ 3730(a), or by private individuals in  the  Government's  name,  $ 3730(b)(1).  The  Act  provides, 
however,  that  "[n]o  court  shall  have  jurisdiction  over  an  ac-tion  under  this  section  based  upon  the  public  disclosure  of 
allegations  or  transactions  .  .  .  from  the  news  media,  unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person 
bringing the action is an original source of the information." $ 3730(e)(4)(A).  An  "original  source"  is  "an  individual  who 
has  direct  and  independent  knowledge  of  the  information on  which  the  allegations  are  based  and  has  voluntarily  pro-
vided the information to the Government before filing an ac-tion  under  this  section  which  is  based  on  the  information." 

$ 3730(e)(4)(B). Stone's  complaint  alleged  that  Rockwell  was  required  to 
comply  with  certain  federal  and  state  environmental  laws and  regulations,  including  RCRA;  that  Rockwell  committed 
numerous  violations  of  these  laws  and  regulations  through-out the 1980's;

464  ROCKWELL  INT'L  CORP.  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
to  make  payments  or  approvals  under  Rockwell's  contract, Rockwell knowingly presented false and fraudulent claims to 

the  Government  in  violation  of  the  False  Claims  Act,  31 U. S. C. $ 3729(a).  As required under the Act, Stone filed his 
complaint  under  seal  and  simultaneously  delivered  to  the Government  a  confidential  disclosure  statement  describing 
"substantially  all  material  evidence  and  information"  in  his possession,  $ 3730(b)(2).  The  statement  identified  26  envi-
ronmental  and  safety  issues,  only  one  of  which  involved pondcrete.  With  respect  to  that  issue,  Stone  explained  in 
his statement that he had reviewed the design for the pond-crete  system  and  had  foreseen  that  the  piping  mechanism 
would  not  properly  remove  the  sludge,  which  in  turn  would lead to an inadequate mixture of sludge and cement. 

In  December  1992,  Rockwell moved  to dismiss  Stone's  ac-tion  for  lack  of  subject-matter  jurisdiction,  arguing  that  the 
action  was  based  on  publicly  disclosed  allegations  and  that Stone was not an original source.  The District Court denied 
the  motion  because,  in  its  view,  "Stone  had  direct  and  inde-pendent knowledge that Rockwell's compensation was linked 
to its compliance with environmental, health and safety regu-lations  and  that  it  allegedly  concealed  its  deficient  perform-
ance  so  that  it  would  continue  to  receive  payments."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. 

The  Government  initially  declined  to  intervene  in  Stone's action,  but  later  reversed  course,  and  in  November  1996, 
the  District  Court  granted  the  Government's  intervention. Several weeks later, at the suggestion of the District Court,

Opinion of the Court 
the  Government  and  Stone  filed  a  joint  amended  complaint. As relevant here, the amended complaint alleged that Rock-

well  violated  RCRA  by  storing  leaky  pondcrete  blocks,  but did  not  allege  that  any  defect  in  the  piping  system  (as  pre-
dicted  by  Stone)  caused  insolid  pondcrete.4  Respondents clarified  their  allegations  even  further  in  a  statement  of 
claims  which  became  part  of  the  final  pretrial  order  and which superseded their earlier pleadings.  This said that the 
pondcrete's insolidity was due to "an incorrect cement/sludge ratio  used  in  pondcrete  operations,  as  well  as  due  to  in-
adequate  process  controls  and  inadequate  inspection  proce-dures."  App. 470.  It continued: 

"During  the  winter  of  1986,  Rockwell  replaced  its  then pondcrete  foreman,  Norman  Fryback,  with  Ron  Teel. 
Teel  increased  pondcrete  production  rates  in  part  by, among  other  things,  reducing  the  amount  of  cement 
added  to  the  blocks.  Following  the  May  23,  1988  spill, Rockwell  acknowledged  that  this  reduced  cement-to-
sludge  ratio  was  a  major  contributor  to  the  existence of  insufficiently  solid  pondcrete  blocks  on  the  storage 
pads."  Id., at 476-477. 
The  statement  of  claims  again  did  not  mention  the  piping problem asserted by Stone years earlier. 

Respondents'  False  Claims  Act  claims  went  to  trial  in 1999.  None  of  the  witnesses  Stone  had  identified  during 
discovery  as  having  relevant  knowledge  testified  at  trial. And  none  of  the  documents  Stone  provided  to  the  Govern-
ment  with  his  confidential  disclosure  statement  was  intro-duced  in  evidence  at  trial.  Nor  did  respondents  allege  at 
trial  that  the  defect  in  the  piping  system  predicted  by Stone  caused  insolid  pondcrete.  To  the  contrary,  during 

4 In addition to the pondcrete allegations, respondents charged Rockwell 
with  concealing  problems  with  "saltcrete"  (a  mixture  of  cement  and  salt 
from  liquid  waste  treatment  processes)  and  "spray  irrigation"  (a  method 
of  disposing  of  waste  water  generated  by  the  sewage  treatment  plant  at 
Rocky Flats).

466  ROCKWELL  INT'L  CORP.  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
closing  arguments  both  Stone's  counsel  and  the  Govern-
ment's  counsel  repeatedly  explained  to  the  jury  that  the 
pondcrete failed because Rockwell's new foreman used an in-
sufficient  cement-to-sludge  ratio  in  an  effort  to  increase 
pondcrete production. 

The  verdict  form  divided  the  False  Claims  Act  count  into 
several different claims corresponding to different award-fee 
periods.  The  jury  found  in  favor  of  respondents  for  the 
three  periods  covering  the  pondcrete  allegations  (April  1, 
1987,  to  September  30,  1988),  and  found  for  Rockwell  as 
to  the  remaining  periods.  The  jury  awarded  damages  of 
$1,390,775.80,  which  the  District  Court  trebled  pursuant  to 
31 U. S. C. $ 3729(a). 

Rockwell  filed  a  postverdict  motion  to  dismiss  Stone's 
claims under $ 3730(e)(4), arguing that the claims were based 
on  publicly  disclosed  allegations  and  that  Stone  was  not  an 
original  source.  In  response,  Stone  acknowledged  that  his 
successful  claims  were  based  on  publicly  disclosed  allega-
tions,  but  asserted  original-source  status.  The  District 
Court  agreed  with  Stone.  The  United  States  Court  of  Ap-
peals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, but re-
manded the case for the District Court to determine whether 
Stone  had  disclosed  his  information  to  the  Government  be-
fore filing his qui tam action, as $ 3730(e)(4)(B) required.  On 
remand,  the  District  Court  found  that  Stone  had  produced 
the 1982 engineering order to the Government, but that the 
order  was  insufficient  to  communicate  Stone's  allegations. 
The District Court also found that Stone had not carried his 
burden of proving that he orally informed the FBI about his 
allegations  before  filing  suit.  On  appeal,  the  Tenth  Circuit 
disagreed with the District Court's conclusion and held (over 
the dissent of Judge Briscoe) that the 1982 engineering order 
sufficed  to  carry  Stone's  burden  of  persuasion.  92  Fed. 
Appx.  708.  We  granted  certiorari,  548  U. S.  941  (2006),  to 
decide whether Stone was an original source.

Opinion of the Court 

II 
Section 3730(e)(4)(A) provides: 

"No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this  section  based  upon  the  public  disclosure  of  allega-

tions  or  transactions  in  a  criminal,  civil,  or  adminis-trative  hearing,  in  a  congressional,  administrative,  or 
Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action 
is brought by the Attorney General or the person bring-ing  the  action  is  an  original  source  of  the  information." 
(Footnote omitted.) 
As  discussed  above,  $ 3730(e)(4)(B)  defines  "original  source" as "an  individual who  [1] has direct and  independent  knowl-

edge  of  the  information  on  which  the  allegations  are  based and [2] has voluntarily provided the information to the Gov-
ernment  before  filing  an  action  under  this  section  which  is based on the information."  As this case comes to the Court, 
it is conceded that the claims on which Stone prevailed were based upon publicly disclosed allegations within the meaning 
of  $ 3730(e)(4)(A).  The  question  is  whether  Stone  qualified under  the  original-source  exception  to  the  public-disclosure 
bar. We  begin  with  the  possibility  that  little  analysis  is  re-
quired in this case, for Stone asserts that Rockwell conceded his  original-source  status.  Rockwell  responds  that  it  con-
ceded  no  such  thing  and  that,  even  had  it  done  so,  the  con-cession  would  have  been  irrelevant  because  $ 3730(e)(4)  is 
jurisdictional.  We  agree  with  the  latter  proposition.  It  is true  enough  that  the  word  "jurisdiction"  does  not  in  every 
context  connote  subject-matter  jurisdiction.  Noting  that "jurisdiction" is " `a word of many, too many, meanings,' " we 
concluded  in  Steel  Co.  v.  Citizens  for  Better  Environment, 523  U. S.  83  (1998),  that  establishing  the  elements  of  an  of-
fense  was  not  made  a  jurisdictional  matter  merely  because

468  ROCKWELL  INT'L  CORP.  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
the  statute creating  the  cause of  action  was phrased  as pro-
viding for "jurisdiction" over such suits.  Id.,  at 90 (quoting 
United  States  v.  Vanness,  85  F.  3d  661,  663,  n.  2  (CADC 
1996)).  Here, however, the issue is not whether casting the 
creation of a cause of action in jurisdictional terms somehow 
limits  the  general  grant  of  jurisdiction  under  which  that 
cause  of  action  would  normally  be  brought,  but  rather 
whether a clear and explicit withdrawal of jurisdiction with-
draws jurisdiction.  It undoubtedly does so.  Just last Term 
we  stated  that,  "[i]f  the  Legislature  clearly  states  that  a 
threshold limitation on a statute's scope shall count as juris-
dictional,  then  courts  and  litigants  will  be  duly  instructed 
and  will  not  be  left  to  wrestle  with  the  issue."  Arbaugh  v. 
Y & H Corp.,  546 U. S. 500, 515-516 (2006) (footnote omitted). 
Here the jurisdictional nature of the original-source require-
ment  is  clear  ex  visceribus  verborum.  Indeed,  we  have 
already  stated  that  $ 3730(e)(4)  speaks  to  "the  power  of 
a  particular  court"  as  well  as  "the  substantive  rights  of 

the  parties."  Hughes  Aircraft  Co.  v.  United  States  ex  rel. 
Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 951 (1997). 

Stone's  contrary  position  rests  entirely  on  dicta  from  a 
single  Court  of  Appeals  decision,  see  United  States  ex  rel. 
Fallon v.  Accudyne Corp., 97 F. 3d 937, 940-941 (CA7 1996). 
Accudyne  thought  it  significant  that  jurisdiction  over  False 
Claims Act cases is conferred by 28 U. S. C. $$ 1331 and 1345 
(the  federal-question  and  United-States-as-plaintiff  provi-
sions  of the Judicial Code) and 31 U. S. C. $ 3732(a) (the pro-
vision  of  the  False  Claims  Act  establishing  federal-court 
venue  and  conferring  federal-court  jurisdiction  over  related 
state-law  claims),  rather  than  $ 3730,  which  is  the  "section" 
referenced  in  $ 3730(e)(4).  To  eliminate  jurisdiction,  the 
court  believed,  it  is  those  jurisdiction-conferring  sections 
that  would  have  to  be  referenced.  We  know  of  nothing 

in  logic  or  authority  to  support  this.  The  jurisdiction-
removing  provision  here  does  not  say  "no  court  shall  have

Opinion of the Court 
jurisdiction  under  this  section,"  but  rather  "no  court  shall 
have  jurisdiction  over  an  action  under  this  section."  That 
is surely  the  most  natural way  to  achieve  the  desired result 
of  eliminating  jurisdiction  over  a  category  of  False  Claims 
Act  actions--rather  than  listing  all  the  conceivable  provi-
sions  of  the  United  States  Code  whose  conferral  of  juris-
diction  is  being  eliminated.  (In  addition  to  the  provisions 
cited by the Accudyne court, one might also have to mention 
the  diversity-jurisdiction  provision,  28  U. S. C.  $ 1332,  and 
the  supplemental-jurisdiction  provision,  $ 1367.)  Accudyne 
next observed  that  the public-disclosure  bar  limits only  who 
may  speak  for  the  United  States  on  a  subject  and  who  if 
anyone  gets  a  financial  reward,  not  the  "categories  of  dis-
putes that may be resolved (a real `jurisdictional' limit)."  97 
F.  3d,  at  941.  But  this  is  a  classic  begging  of  the  question, 
which is precisely whether there has been removed from the 
courts'  jurisdiction  that  category  of  disputes  consisting  of 
False  Claims  Act  qui  tam  suits  based  on  publicly  disclosed 
allegations  as  to  which  the  relator  is  not  an  original  source 
of  the  information.  Nothing  prevents Congress  from  defin-
ing the "category" of excluded suits in any manner it wishes. 
See,  e. g.,  28  U. S. C.  $ 1500  (no  jurisdiction  over  "any  claim 
for or in respect to which the plaintiff . . .  has  pending in any 
other court any suit . . . against the United States").  Lastly, 
Accudyne  asserted  that  "the  Supreme  Court  had  held  that 
a  similar  reference  to  jurisdiction  in  the  Norris-LaGuardia 
Act,  29  U. S. C.  $$ 101,  104,  limits  remedies  rather  than 
subject-matter  jurisdiction."  97  F.  3d,  at  941  (citing  Bur-
lington  Northern  R. Co. v.  Maintenance  of  Way  Employes, 
481  U. S.  429,  444-446  (1987)).  But  the  language  of  the 
Norris-LaGuardia Act is in fact not similar.  It provides that 
"[n]o  court  of  the  United  States  shall  have  jurisdiction  to 
issue any  restraining  order or  temporary or permanent in-

Opinion of the Court 
cially a limitation upon the relief that can be accorded, not a removal  of  jurisdiction  over  "any  case  involving  or  growing 

out  of  a  labor  dispute."  Here,  by  contrast,  the  text  says "[n]o  court  shall  have  jurisdiction  over  an  action  under  this 
section." Whether the point was conceded or not, therefore, we may, 
and  indeed  must,  decide  whether  Stone  met  the  jurisdic-tional requirement of being an original source. 

III 
We turn to the first requirement of original-source status, that  the  relator  have  "direct  and  independent  knowledge  of 

the  information  on  which  the  allegations  are  based."  31 U. S. C. $ 3730(e)(4)(B).  Because we have not previously ad-
dressed this provision, several preliminary questions require our attention. 

A 
First,  does  the  phrase  "information  on  which  the  allega-tions  are  based"  refer  to  the  information  on  which  the  rela-

tor's  allegations  are  based  or  the  information  on  which  the publicly  disclosed  allegations  that  triggered  the  public-
disclosure bar are based?  The parties agree it is the former. See  Brief  for  Petitioners  26,  n.  13;  Brief  for  United  States 
24, and n. 8; Brief for Respondent Stone 15, 21.  But in view of  our  conclusion  that  $ 3730(e)(4)  is  jurisdictional,  we  must 
satisfy ourselves that the parties' position is correct. Though  the  question  is  hardly  free  from  doubt,

5  we  agree 

that  the  "information"  to  which  subparagraph  (B)  speaks  is the  information  upon  which  the  relators'  allegations  are 

5 The  Courts  of  Appeals  have  divided  over  the  question.  See  United 
States ex rel. Laird v.  Lockheed Martin Eng. & Science Servs. Co., 336 F. 
3d  346,  353-355  (CA5  2003)  (describing  the  Courts  of  Appeals'  divergent 
approaches).  Only  by  demoting  the  actual  text  of  $ 3730(e)(4)  to  a  foot-
note  and  then  paraphrasing  the  statute  in  a  way  that  assumes  his  con-
clusion  can  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
based.  To begin with, subparagraph (B) standing on its own suggests  that  disposition.  The  relator  must  have  "direct 

and independent knowledge of the  information on which the allegations  are  based,"  and  he  must  "provid[e]  the  informa-
tion  to  the  Government  before  filing  an  action  under  this section  which  is  based  on  the  information."  Surely  the  in-
formation one would expect a relator to "provide to the Gov-
ernment before filing an action . . . based on the information" is the information underlying the relator's claims. 

Subparagraph (A)  complicates  matters.  As  described earlier, it bars actions based on the "public disclosure of alle-
gations or transactions" and provides an exception for cases 
brought  by  "an  original  source  of  the  information."  If  the 
allegations  referred  to  in  subparagraph  (B)'s  phrase  requir-
ing "direct and independent knowledge of the information on 
which  the  allegations  are  based"  are  the  same  "allegations" 
referred  to  in  subparagraph  (A),  then  original-source  status 
would  depend  on  knowledge  of  information  underlying  the 
publicly  disclosed  allegations.  The  principal  textual  diffi-
culty with that interpretation is that subparagraph (A) does 
not  speak  simply  of  "allegations,"  but  of  "allegations  or 
transactions."  Had Congress wanted to link original-source 
status  to  information  underlying  the  public  disclosure,  it 
would  surely  have  used  the  identical  phrase,  "allegations  or 
transactions"; there is no conceivable reason to require direct 
and  independent  knowledge  of  publicly  disclosed  allegations 
but not of publicly disclosed transactions. 

The  sense  of  the  matter  offers  strong  additional  support 
for  this  interpretation.  Section  3730(e)(4)(A)  bars  actions 
based  on  publicly  disclosed  allegations  whether  or  not  the 
information  on  which  those  allegations  are  based  has  been 
made  public.  It  is  difficult  to  understand  why  Congress 
would  care  whether  a  relator  knows  about  the  information 
underlying  a  publicly  disclosed  allegation  (e. g.,  what  a  con-
fidential  source  told  a  newspaper  reporter  about  insolid 
pondcrete)  when  the  relator  has  direct  and  independent

Opinion of the Court 
knowledge of different information supporting the same alle-gation (

e. g., that a defective process would inevitably lead to 
insolid pondcrete).  Not only would that make little sense, it would  raise  nettlesome  procedural  problems,  placing  courts 

in  the  position  of  comparing  the  relator's  information  with the often 

unknowable information on which the public disclo-
sure was based.  Where that latter information has not been 
disclosed  (by  reason,  for  example,  of  a  reporter's  desire  to protect  his  source),  the  relator  would  presumably  be  out  of 

court.  To bar a relator with direct and independent knowl-edge  of  information  underlying  his  allegations  just  because 
no one can know what information underlies the similar alle-
gations of some other person simply makes no sense. 

The contrary conclusion of some lower courts rests on the 
following logic: The term "information" in subparagraph (B) 
must be read in tandem with the term "information" in sub-
paragraph  (A),  and  the  term  "information"  in  subparagraph 
(A) refers to the information on which the publicly disclosed 
allegations are based.  See, e. g., United States ex rel. Laird 
v.  Lockheed Martin Eng. & Science Servs. Co., 336 F. 3d 346, 
354 (CA5 2003).  The major premise of this reasoning seems 
true  enough:  "information"  in  (A)  and  (B)  means  the  same 
thing.  The  minor  premise,  however--that  "information"  in 
(A)  refers  to  the  information  underlying  the  publicly  dis-
closed  allegations  or  transactions--is  highly  questionable. 
The complete phrase at issue is "unless . . . the person bring-
ing  the  action  is  an  original  source  of  the  information."  It 
seems  to  us  more  likely  (in  light  of  the  analysis  set  forth 
above)  that  the  information  in  question  is  the  information 
underlying the action referred to a few words earlier, to wit, 
the action "based upon the public disclosure of allegations or 
transactions"  referred  to  at  the  beginning  of  the  provision. 
On  this  interpretation,  "information"  in  subparagraph  (A) 
and "information on which the allegations are based" in sub-
paragraph (B) are one and the same, viz., information under-
lying the allegations of the relator's action.

Opinion of the Court 

B 
Having determined that the phrase "information on which the  allegations  are  based"  refers  to  the  relator's  allegations 

and  not  the  publicly  disclosed  allegations,  we  confront  more textual  ambiguity: 

Which  of  the  relator's  allegations  are the  relevant  ones?  Stone's  allegations  changed  during  the 

course  of  the  litigation,  yet  he  asks  that  we  look  only  to  his original  complaint.  Rockwell  argues  that  Stone  must  sat-
isfy  the  original-source  exception  through  all  stages  of  the litigation. 

In  our  view,  the  term  "allegations"  is  not  limited  to  the allegations of the original complaint.  It includes (at a mini-
mum)  the  allegations  in  the  original  complaint  as  amended. The  statute  speaks  not  of  the  allegations  in  the  "original 
complaint"  (or  even  the  allegations  in  the  "complaint"),  but of the relator's "allegations" 

simpliciter.  Absent some limi-tation  of  $ 3730(e)(4)'s  requirement  to  the  relator's  initial 

complaint,  we  will  not  infer  one.  Such  a  limitation  would leave  the  relator  free  to  plead  a  trivial  theory  of  fraud  for 
which  he  had  some  direct  and  independent  knowledge  and later  amend  the  complaint  to  include  theories  copied  from 
the public domain or from materials in the Government's pos-session.  Even  the  Government  concedes  that  new  allega-
tions regarding a fundamentally different fraudulent scheme require  reevaluation  of  the  court's  jurisdiction.  See  Brief 
for United States 40; Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. The  rule  that  subject-matter  jurisdiction  "depends  on  the 
state of things at the time of the action brought," Mollan v. 
Torrance,  9  Wheat.  537,  539  (1824),  does  not  suggest  a  dif-ferent interpretation.  The state of things and the originally 

alleged  state  of  things  are  not  synonymous;  demonstration that  the  original  allegations  were  false  will  defeat  jurisdic-
tion.  Anderson v.  Watt,  138 U. S. 694, 701 (1891); Morris v. Gilmer,  129  U. S.  315,  326  (1889).  So  also  will  the  with-
drawal of those allegations, unless they are replaced by oth-ers that establish jurisdiction.  Thus, when a plaintiff files a

Opinion of the Court 
complaint  in  federal  court  and  then  voluntarily  amends  the 
complaint,  courts  look  to  the  amended  complaint  to  deter-
mine  jurisdiction.  See  Wellness  Community-Nat.  v.  Well-
ness  House,  70  F.  3d  46,  49  (CA7  1995);  Boelens  v.  Redman 
Homes, Inc., 759 F. 2d 504, 508 (CA5 1985).6 

Here, we  have  not  only  an  amended complaint,  but  a final 
pretrial  order  that  superseded  all  prior  pleadings  and  "con-
troll[ed] the subsequent course of the action," Fed. Rule Civ. 
Proc.  16(e).  See  Curtis  v.  Loether,  415  U. S.  189,  190,  n.  1 
(1974) (where a  claim was not included in the complaint, but 
was  included  in  the  pretrial  order,  "it  is  irrelevant  that  the 
pleadings  were  never  formally  amended"  (citing  Fed.  Rules 
Civ.  Proc.  15(b),  16));  Wilson  v.  Muckala,  303  F.  3d  1207, 
1215  (CA10  2002)  ("[C]laims,  issues,  defenses,  or  theories  of 
damages  not  included  in  the  pretrial  order  are  waived  even 
if  they  appeared  in  the  complaint  and,  conversely,  the  inclu-
sion of a claim in the pretrial order is deemed to amend any 
previous  pleadings which  did  not  include that  claim");  Syrie 
v.  Knoll Int'l, 748 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA5 1984) ("[I]ncorporation 
of a [new] claim into the pre-trial order . . .  amends the previ-
ous  pleadings  to  state  [the  new]  claim").  In  these  circum-
stances,  we  look  to  the  allegations  as  amended--here,  the 
statement of claims in the final pretrial order--to determine 
original-source status. 

The  Government  objects  that  this  approach  risks  driving 
a  wedge between  the  Government  and  relators.  It  worries 
that future relators might decline to "acquiesc[e]" in the Gov-
ernment's  tactical  decision  to  narrow  the  claims  in  a  case  if 

6 It is true that, when a defendant removes a case to federal court based 
on the presence of a federal claim, an amendment eliminating the original 
basis  for  federal  jurisdiction  generally  does  not  defeat  jurisdiction.  See 
Carnegie-Mellon  Univ.  v.  Cohill,  484  U. S.  343,  346,  357  (1988);  St.  Paul 
Mercury  Indemnity  Co.  v.  Red  Cab  Co.,  303  U. S.  283,  293  (1938).  But 
removal cases raise forum-manipulation concerns that simply do not exist 
when it is the plaintiff who chooses a federal forum and then pleads away 
jurisdiction through amendment.

Opinion of the Court 
that would eliminate jurisdiction with respect to the relator. Brief for United States 44.  Even if this policy concern were 

valid, it would not induce us to determine jurisdiction on the basis of whether the relator is an original source of informa-
tion underlying allegations that he no longer makes. 

IV 
Judged according to the principles set forth above, Stone's knowledge  falls  short.  The  only  false  claims  ultimately 

found  by  the  jury  (and  hence  the  only  ones  to  which  our jurisdictional  inquiry  is  pertinent  to  the  outcome)  involved 
false  statements  with  respect  to  environmental,  safety,  and health  compliance  over  a  1

1/2-year  period  between  April  1, 

1987,  and  September  30,  1988.  As  described  by  Stone and  the  Government  in  the  final  pretrial  order,  the  only 

pertinent  problem  with  respect  to  this  period  of  time  for which  Stone  claimed  to  have  direct  and  independent  knowl-
edge  was  insolid  pondcrete.  Because  Stone  was  no  longer employed  by  Rockwell  at  the  time,  he  did  not  know  that 
the  pondcrete  was  insolid;  he  did  not  know  that  pondcrete storage  was  even  subject  to  RCRA;  he  did  not  know  that 
Rockwell  would  fail  to  remedy  the  defect;  he  did  not  know that  the  insolid  pondcrete  leaked  while  being  stored  on-
site;  and,  of  course,  he  did  not  know  that  Rockwell  made false  statements  to  the  Government  regarding  pondcrete 
storage. Stone's prediction that  the  pondcrete  would be insolid be-
cause  of  a  flaw  in  the  piping  system  does  not  qualify  as  "di-rect  and  independent  knowledge"  of  the  pondcrete  defect. 
Of course a qui tam relator's misunderstanding of why a con-cealed defect occurred would normally be immaterial as long 
as he knew the defect actually existed.  But  here Stone did not 

know that the pondcrete failed; he predicted it.  Even if a prediction can qualify as direct and independent knowledge 

in  some  cases  (a  point  we  need  not  address),  it  assuredly does not do so when its premise of cause and effect is wrong.

476  ROCKWELL  INT'L  CORP.  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
Stone's  prediction  was  a  failed  prediction,  disproved  by Stone's  own allegations.  As Stone  acknowledged, Rockwell 

was able to produce "concrete hard" pondcrete using the ma-chinery  Stone  said  was  defective.  According  to  respond-
ents'  allegations  in  the  final  pretrial  order,  the  insolidity problem  was  caused  by  a  new  foreman's  reduction  of  the 
cement-to-sludge ratio in the winter of 1986, long after Stone had left Rocky Flats. 

Stone counters that his original-source status with respect to  his  spray-irrigation  claim  (which  related  to  a  time  period 
different  from  that  for  his  pondcrete  claim,  App.  492)  pro-vided  jurisdiction  with  respect to  all  of his  claims.  We  dis-
agree.  Section  3730(e)(4)  does  not  permit  jurisdiction  in gross just because a relator is an original source with respect 
to  some  claim.  We,  along  with  every  court  to  have  ad-dressed the question, conclude that $ 3730(e)(4) does not per-
mit such claim smuggling.  See United States ex rel. Merena v. 

SmithKline  Beecham Corp.,  205  F.  3d 97,  102  (CA3  2000); 
Hays  v.  Hoffman,  325  F.  3d  982,  990  (CA8  2003);  Wang  ex rel.  United  States  v.  FMC  Corp.,  975  F.  2d  1412,  1415-1416, 

1420  (CA9  1992).  As  then-Judge  Alito  explained,  "[t]he plaintiff 's  decision  to  join  all  of  his  or  her  claims  in  a  single 
lawsuit  should  not  rescue  claims  that  would  have  been doomed by section (e)(4) if they had been asserted in a sepa-
rate  action.  And  likewise,  this  joinder  should  not  result  in the dismissal of claims that would have otherwise survived." 
SmithKline Beecham, supra, at 102. Because Stone did not have direct and independent knowl-
edge  of  the  information  upon  which  his  allegations  were based,  we  need  not  decide  whether  Stone  met  the  second 
requirement of original-source status, that he have voluntar-ily provided the information to the Government before filing 
his action.  V 

Respondents  contend  that  even  if  Stone  failed  the original-source test as to his pondcrete allegations, the Gov-

Opinion of the Court 
ernment's  intervention  in  his  case  provided  an  independent 
basis of jurisdiction.  Section 3730(e)(4)(A) permits jurisdic-
tion  over  an  action  based  on  publicly  disclosed  allegations 
or  transactions  if  the  action  is  "brought  by  the  Attorney 
General."  Respondents  say  that  any  inquiry  into  Stone's 
original-source  status  with  respect  to  amendments  to  the 
complaint was unnecessary because the Government had in-
tervened,  making  this  an  "action  brought  by  the  Attorney 
General." 7  Even  assuming  that  Stone  was  an  original 
source  of  allegations  in  his  initial  complaint,  we  reject  re-
spondents' "intervention" argument. 

The  False  Claims  Act  contemplates  two  types  of  actions. 
First, under $ 3730(a), "[i]f the Attorney General finds that a 
person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney 
General  may  bring  a  civil  action  under  this  section  against 
the person."  Second, under $ 3730(b), "[a] person may bring 
an  action  for  a  violation  of  section  3729  for  the  person  and 
for the United States Government."  When a private person 
brings  an  action  under  $ 3730(b),  the  Government  may  elect 
to  "proceed  with  the  action,"  $ 3730(b)(4)(A),  or  it  may  "de-
clin[e]  to  take  over  the  action,  in  which  case  the  person 
bringing  the  action  shall  have  the  right  to  conduct  the  ac-
tion,"  $ 3730(b)(4)(B).  The  statute  thus  draws  a  sharp  dis-
tinction  between  actions  brought  by  the  Attorney  General 
under  $ 3730(a)  and  actions  brought  by  a  private  person 
under $ 3730(b).  An action brought by a private person does 
not become one brought by the Government just because the 
Government  intervenes  and  elects  to  "proceed  with  the  ac-
tion."  Section  3730  elsewhere  refers  to  the  Government's 
"proceed[ing]  with  an  action  brought  by  a  person  under 
subsection  (b)"--which  makes  crystal  clear  the  distinction 
between  actions  brought  by  the  Government  and  actions 

7 The Government includes a significant caveat: In its view, intervention 
does not cure any pre-existing defects in Stone's initial complaint; it only 
cures defects resulting from amendments to the pleadings.

Opinion of the Court 
brought  by  a  relator  where  the  Government  intervenes  but 
does not oust the relator.  $ 3730(d). 

Does  this  conclusion  cast  into  doubt  the  courts'  jurisdic-
tion  with  respect  to  the  Government  as  well?  After  all, 

$ 3730(e)(4)(A)  bars  jurisdiction  over  any  action  brought 
under $ 3730, as this one was, unless the action is brought (1) 
by the Attorney General or (2) by an original source; and we 
have  concluded  that  this  is  brought  by  neither.  Not  even 
petitioners  have  suggested  the  bizarre  result  that  the  Gov-
ernment's judgment must be set aside.  It is readily enough 
avoided,  as  common  sense  suggests  it  must  be,  by  holding 
that an action originally brought by a private person, which 
the Attorney General has joined, becomes an action brought 
by  the  Attorney  General  once  the  private  person  has  been 
determined  to  lack  the  jurisdictional  prerequisites  for  suit. 
The outcome would be similar to that frequently produced in 
diversity-jurisdiction cases, where the "courts of appeals . . . 
have the authority to cure a jurisdictional defect by dismiss-
ing  a  dispensable  nondiverse  party."  Grupo  Dataflux  v.

tion  .  .  .  if  there  are  independent  grounds  for  jurisdiction  of

dictional  ruling  regarding  Stone's  claim, is  the  characteriza-
tion of the action as one brought by an original source.  The 
elimination  of  Stone  leaves  in  place  an  action  pursued  only 
by the Attorney General, that can reasonably be regarded as 
being "brought" by him for purposes of $ 3730(e)(4)(A).

of  valuations.  An  appraised  valuation  is  the  market  value of  property.  See

Opinion of the Court 
this  context,  Congress'  rejection  of  "assessed"  tells  us  no more than does its rejection of "actual" or "appraised." 

Our interpretation comports with most States' practice of tying the debt limitations of municipalities to assessed valua-
tion.  See  15  E.  McQuillin,  Law  of  Municipal  Corporations $ 41:7,  p.  422  (3d  ed.  rev.  2005)  ("Most  of  the  constitutional 
and statutory provisions make the assessed value of the tax-
able  property  of  the  municipality  the  basis  for  ascertaining the  amount  of  indebtedness  which  may  be  incurred  .  .  .  "). 

States that depart from the majority approach use clear lan-guage  to  do  so.  See

Syllabus 

$ 7521(a)(1),  could  be  based  on  scientific  uncertainty  as  well  as  other 
factors,  including the concern that unilateral  U. S. regulation  of motor-
vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce other countries' green-
house  gas  emissions.  The  second  judge  opined  that  petitioners  had 
failed to demonstrate the particularized injury to them that is necessary 
to establish standing under Article III, but accepted the contrary view 
as  the  law  of  the  case  and  joined  the  judgment  on  the  merits  as  the 
closest to that which he preferred.  The court therefore denied review. 

Held: 

1.  Petitioners  have  standing  to  challenge  EPA's  denial  of  their  rule-
making petition.  Pp. 516-526. 

(a)  This  case  suffers  from  none  of  the  defects  that would  preclude 
it  from  being  a  justiciable  Article  III  "Controvers[y]."  See,  e. g., 
Luther  v.  Borden,  7  How.  1.  Moreover,  the  proper  construction  of  a 
congressional statute is an eminently suitable question for federal-court 
resolution, and Congress has authorized precisely this type of challenge 
to  EPA  action,  see  42  U. S. C.  $ 7607(b)(1).  Contrary  to  EPA's  argu-
ment, standing doctrine  presents no insuperable jurisdictional  obstacle 
here.  To  demonstrate  standing,  a  litigant  must  show  that  it  has  suf-
fered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or immi-
nent,  that  the  injury  is  fairly  traceable  to  the  defendant,  and  that  a 
favorable decision will likely redress that injury.  See Lujan v.  Defend-
ers  of  Wildlife,  504  U. S.  555,  560-561.  However,  a  litigant  to  whom 
Congress has "accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete inter-
ests," id., at 573, n. 7--here, the right to challenge agency action unlaw-
fully  withheld,  $ 7607(b)(1)--"can  assert  that  right  without  meeting  all 
the normal standards for redressability and immediacy," ibid.  Only one 
petitioner  needs  to  have  standing  to  authorize  review.  See  Rumsfeld 
v.  Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 52, 
n.  2.  Massachusetts  has  a  special  position  and  interest  here.  It  is  a 
sovereign State and not, as in Lujan, a private individual, and it actually 
owns a great deal of the territory alleged to be affected.  The sovereign 
prerogatives to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, to negoti-
ate  emissions  treaties  with  developing  countries,  and  (in  some  circum-
stances) to exercise the police power to reduce motor-vehicle emissions 
are now lodged in the Federal Government.  Because Congress has or-
dered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing ap-
plicable standards, $ 7521(a)(1), and has given Massachusetts a concomi-
tant  procedural  right  to  challenge  the  rejection  of  its  rulemaking 
petition  as  arbitrary  and  capricious,  $ 7607(b)(1),  petitioners'  submis-
sions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the most demand-
ing  standards  of  the  adversarial  process.  EPA's  steadfast  refusal  to

Syllabus 
regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachu-
setts that is both "actual" and "imminent," Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560, and 
there is a "substantial likelihood that the judicial  relief requested" will 
prompt EPA to take steps to reduce that risk, Duke Power Co. v.  Caro-
lina Environmental Study Group, Inc.,  438 U. S. 59, 79.  Pp. 516-521. 

(b)  The harms associated with climate change are serious and well 
recognized.  The  Government's  own  objective  assessment  of  the  rele-
vant  science  and  a  strong  consensus  among  qualified  experts  indicate 
that global  warming threatens, inter alia, a precipitate rise in sea lev-
els, severe and irreversible changes to natural ecosystems, a significant 
reduction in winter snowpack with direct and  important economic con-
sequences,  and  increases  in  the  spread  of  disease  and  the  ferocity  of 
weather events.  That  these changes are widely shared does  not mini-
mize Massachusetts' interest in the outcome of this litigation.  See Fed-
eral Election Comm'n v.  Akins, 524 U. S. 11, 24.  According to petition-
ers'  uncontested  affidavits,  global  sea  levels  rose  between  10  and  20 
centimeters  over  the  20th  century  as  a  result  of  global  warming  and 
have already begun to swallow Massachusetts' coastal land.  Remedia-
tion  costs  alone,  moreover,  could  reach  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars. 
Pp. 521-523. 

(c)  Given EPA's failure to dispute the existence of a causal connec-
tion  between  manmade  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  global  warming, 
its  refusal  to  regulate  such  emissions,  at  a  minimum,  "contributes"  to 
Massachusetts'  injuries.  EPA  overstates  its  case  in  arguing  that  its 
decision not to regulate contributes so insignificantly to petitioners' in-
juries  that  it  cannot  be  haled  into  federal  court,  and  that  there  is  no 
realistic possibility that the relief sought would mitigate global climate 
change  and  remedy  petitioners'  injuries,  especially  since  predicted  in-
creases  in  emissions  from  China,  India,  and  other  developing  nations 
will likely offset any marginal domestic decrease EPA regulation could 
bring about.  Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve mas-
sive problems in one fell swoop, see Williamson v.  Lee Optical of Okla., 
Inc.,  348  U. S.  483,  489,  but  instead  whittle  away  over  time,  refining 
their  approach  as  circumstances  change  and  they  develop  a  more  nu-
anced understanding of how best to proceed, cf. SEC v.  Chenery Corp., 
332 U. S. 194, 202-203.  That a first step might be tentative does not by 
itself negate federal-court jurisdiction.  And reducing domestic automo-
bile emissions is hardly tentative.  Leaving aside the other greenhouse 
gases, the record indicates that the U. S. transportation sector emits an 
enormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Pp. 523-525. 

(d)  While regulating  motor-vehicle  emissions  may not  by itself  re-
verse global warming, it does not follow that the Court lacks jurisdiction 
to  decide  whether  EPA  has  a  duty  to  take  steps  to  slow  or  reduce  it.

500  MASSACHUSETTS  v.  EPA 

Syllabus 
See  Larson  v.  Valente, 456  U. S.  228,  243,  n.  15.  Because  of  the  enor-
mous  potential  consequences,  the  fact  that  a  remedy's  effectiveness 
might  be  delayed  during  the  (relatively  short)  time  it  takes  for  a  new 
motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant.  Nor 
is  it  dispositive  that  developing  countries  are  poised  to  substantially 
increase  greenhouse  gas  emissions:  A  reduction  in  domestic  emissions 
would  slow  the  pace  of  global  emissions  increases,  no  matter  what 
happens  elsewhere.  The  Court  attaches  considerable  significance  to 
EPA's  espoused  belief  that  global  climate  change  must  be  addressed. 
Pp. 525-526. 

2.  The  scope  of  the  Court's  review  of  the  merits  of  the  statutory  is-
sues  is  narrow.  Although  an  agency's  refusal  to  initiate  enforcement 
proceedings  is  not  ordinarily  subject  to  judicial  review,  Heckler  v. 
Chaney,  470  U. S.  821,  there  are  key  differences  between  nonenforce-
ment  and  denials  of  rulemaking  petitions  that  are,  as  in  the  present 
circumstances,  expressly  authorized.  EPA  concluded  alternatively  in 
its petition denial that it lacked authority under $ 7521(a)(1) to regulate 
new  vehicle  emissions  because  carbon  dioxide  is  not  an  "air  pollutant" 
under $ 7602, and that, even if it possessed authority, it would decline to 
exercise  it  because  regulation  would  conflict  with  other  administration 
priorities.  Because the Act expressly permits review of such an action, 

$ 7607(b)(1),  this  Court  "may  reverse  [it  if  it  finds  it  to  be]  arbitrary, 
capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with 
law," $ 7607(d)(9).  Pp. 527-528. 

3.  Because greenhouse  gases  fit well  within  the Act's  capacious defi-
nition of "air pollutant," EPA has statutory authority to regulate emis-
sion  of  such  gases  from  new  motor  vehicles.  That  definition--which 
includes  "any  air  pollution  agent  .  .  .  ,  including  any  physical, 
chemical,  .  .  .  substance  .  .  .  emitted  into  .  .  .  the  ambient  air  .  .  .  ," 

$ 7602(g) (emphasis  added)--embraces  all  airborne compounds  of what-
ever stripe.  Moreover, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are 
undoubtedly  "physical  [and]  chemical  .  .  .  substance[s]."  Ibid.  EPA's 
reliance  on  postenactment  congressional  actions  and  deliberations  it 
views  as  tantamount  to  a  command  to  refrain  from  regulating  green-
house  gas  emissions  is  unavailing.  Even  if  postenactment  legislative 
history  could  shed  light  on  the  meaning  of  an  otherwise-unambiguous 
statute, EPA identifies nothing suggesting that Congress meant to cur-
tail  EPA's  power  to  treat  greenhouse  gases  as  air  pollutants.  The 
Court has no difficulty reconciling Congress' various efforts to promote 
interagency  collaboration  and  research  to  better  understand  climate 
change with the Agency's pre-existing mandate to regulate "any air pol-
lutant"  that  may  endanger  the  public  welfare.  FDA  v.  Brown  & Wil-
liamson  Tobacco  Corp.,  529  U. S.  120,  133,  distinguished.  Also  unper-

suasive  is  EPA's  argument  that  its  regulation  of  motor-vehicle  carbon 
dioxide  emissions  would  require  it  to  tighten  mileage  standards,  a  job 
(according  to  EPA)  that  Congress  has  assigned  to  the  Department  of 
Transportation.  The fact  that DOT's mandate to promote  energy  effi-
ciency  by  setting  mileage  standards  may  overlap  with  EPA's  envi-
ronmental  responsibilities  in  no  way  licenses  EPA  to  shirk  its  duty  to 
protect the public "health" and "welfare," $ 7521(a)(1).  Pp. 528-532. 

4.  EPA's  alternative  basis  for  its  decision--that  even  if  it  has  statu-
tory  authority  to  regulate  greenhouse  gases,  it  would  be  unwise  to  do 
so  at  this  time--rests  on  reasoning  divorced  from  the  statutory  text. 
While  the  statute  conditions  EPA  action  on  its  formation  of  a  "judg-
ment," that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant "cause[s], 
or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to 
endanger public health or welfare."  $ 7601(a)(1).  Under the Act's clear 
terms,  EPA  can  avoid  promulgating  regulations  only  if  it  determines 
that  greenhouse  gases  do  not  contribute  to  climate  change  or  if  it  pro-
vides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exer-
cise its discretion to  determine  whether  they do.  It has  refused to do 
so,  offering  instead  a  laundry  list  of  reasons  not  to  regulate,  including 
the  existence  of  voluntary  Executive  Branch  programs  providing  a  re-
sponse  to  global  warming  and  impairment  of  the  President's  ability  to 
negotiate  with  developing  nations  to  reduce  emissions.  These  policy 
judgments  have  nothing  to  do  with  whether  greenhouse  gas  emissions 
contribute to climate change and do not amount to a reasoned justifica-
tion  for  declining  to  form  a  scientific  judgment.  Nor  can  EPA  avoid 
its  statutory  obligation  by  noting  the  uncertainty  surrounding  various 
features  of  climate  change  and  concluding  that  it  would  therefore  be 
better  not  to  regulate  at  this  time.  If  the  scientific  uncertainty  is  so 
profound  that  it  precludes  EPA  from  making  a  reasoned  judgment,  it 
must  say  so.  The  statutory  question  is  whether sufficient  information 
exists for it to make an endangerment finding.  Instead, EPA rejected 
the rulemaking petition based on impermissible considerations.  Its ac-
tion was therefore "arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance 
with  law,"  $ 7607(d)(9).  On  remand,  EPA  must  ground  its  reasons  for 
action or inaction in the statute.  Pp. 532-535.

Opinion of the Court 
bon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Respected scientists believe the  two trends  are  related.  For when  carbon  dioxide is  re-

leased into the atmosphere, it acts like the ceiling of a green-house, trapping solar energy and retarding the escape of re-
flected  heat.  It  is  therefore  a  species--the  most  important species--of a "greenhouse gas." 

Calling global warming "the most pressing environmental challenge  of  our  time," 

1  a  group  of  States,2  local  govern-

ments,3  and  private  organizations 4  alleged  in  a  petition  for certiorari that  the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) 

has  abdicated  its  responsibility  under  the  Clean  Air  Act  to regulate  the  emissions  of  four  greenhouse  gases,  including 
carbon dioxide.  Specifically, petitioners asked us to answer two  questions  concerning  the  meaning  of  $ 202(a)(1)  of  the 
Act:  whether  EPA  has  the  statutory  authority  to  regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles; and if so, 
whether  its  stated  reasons  for  refusing  to  do  so  are  consist-ent with the statute. 

In  response,  EPA,  supported  by  10  intervening  States 5 and six trade associations,

6  correctly argued that we may not 

address  those  two  questions  unless  at  least  one  petitioner has  standing  to  invoke  our  jurisdiction  under  Article  III  of 

the Constitution.  Notwithstanding the serious character of

Opinion of the Court 
that jurisdictional argument and the absence of any conflict-ing  decisions  construing  $ 202(a)(1),  the  unusual  importance 

of the underlying issue persuaded us to grant the writ.  548 U. S. 903 (2006).

Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as added by Pub. L. 
89-272, $ 101(8), 79 Stat. 992, and as amended by, inter alia, 84  Stat.  1690  and  91  Stat.  791,  42  U. S. C.  $ 7521(a)(1), 

provides: 

"The  [EPA]  Administrator  shall  by  regulation  pre-
scribe (and from time to time revise) in accordance with the provisions of this section, standards applicable to the 

emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which 
in  his  judgment  cause,  or  contribute  to,  air  pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public 
health or welfare . . . ."  7 
The  Act  defines  "air  pollutant"  to  include  "any  air  pollution 
agent or combination  of such agents,  including  any physical,

sonably  be  anticipated  to  endanger  public  health  or  welfare."  See  $ 6(a) 
of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1690.  Congress amended

EPA,  541  F.  2d  1,  25  (CADC  1976)  (en  banc),  which  held  that  the  Clean 
Air Act "and common sense . . . demand regulatory action to prevent harm, 
even  if  the  regulator  is  less  than  certain  that  harm  is  otherwise  inevita-
ble."  See $ 401(d)(1)  of  the Clean  Air Act  Amendments of 1977,  91 Stat.

Opinion of the Court 
When Congress enacted these provisions, the study of cli-mate  change  was  in  its  infancy.

8  In  1959,  shortly  after  the 

U. S. Weather Bureau began monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide  levels,  an  observatory  in  Mauna  Loa,  Hawaii,  re-

corded a mean level of 316 parts per million.  This was well above  the  highest  carbon  dioxide  concentration--no  more 
than 300  parts per  million--revealed in  the  420,000-year-old ice-core  record.

9  By  the  time  Congress  drafted  $ 202(a)(1) 

in  1970,  carbon  dioxide  levels  had  reached  325  parts  per million.

10 

In the late 1970's, the Federal Government began devoting serious attention to the possibility that carbon dioxide emis-

sions  associated  with  human  activity  could  provoke  climate change.  In  1978,  Congress  enacted  the  National  Climate 
Program  Act,  92  Stat.  601,  which  required  the  President  to establish  a  program  to  "assist  the  Nation  and  the  world  to

cluding that "[m]an may be changing his weather."  Environmental Qual-
ity:  The  First  Annual  Report  93.  Considerable  uncertainty  remained  in 
those early years, and the issue went largely unmentioned in the congres-
sional debate over the enactment of the Clean Air Act.  But see 116 Cong. 
Rec.  32914  (1970)  (statement  of  Sen.  Boggs  referring  to  Council's  conclu-
sion that "[a]ir pollution alters the climate and may produce global changes 
in temperature"). 

9 See  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change,  Climate  Change 

2001:  Synthesis  Report,  pp.  202-203  (2001).  By  drilling  through  thick 
Antarctic  ice  sheets  and  extracting  "cores,"  scientists  can  examine  ice 
from long ago and extract small samples of ancient air.  That air can then 
be analyzed, yielding estimates of carbon dioxide levels.  Ibid. 

10 A more dramatic rise was yet to come: In 2006, carbon dioxide levels 

reached 382 parts per million, see Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic &

processes and their implications," id., $ 3.  President Carter, 
in  turn,  asked  the  National  Research  Council,  the  working 
arm of the National Academy  of Sciences, to investigate the 
subject.  The Council's response was unequivocal: "If carbon 
dioxide  continues  to  increase,  the  study  group  finds  no  rea-
son  to  doubt  that  climate  changes  will  result  and  no  reason 
to  believe  that  these  changes  will  be  negligible.  .  .  .  A  wait-
and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late." 11 

Congress next addressed the issue in 1987, when it enacted 
the  Global  Climate  Protection  Act,  Title  XI  of  Pub.  L.  100- 
204,  101  Stat.  1407,  note  following  15  U. S. C.  $ 2901.  Find-
ing  that  "manmade  pollution--the  release  of carbon dioxide, 
chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and other trace gases into the 
atmosphere--may  be  producing  a  long-term  and  substantial 
increase in the average temperature on Earth," $ 1102(1), 101 
Stat.  1408,  Congress  directed  EPA  to  propose  to  Congress 
a  "coordinated  national  policy  on  global  climate  change," 

$ 1103(b),  and  ordered  the  Secretary  of  State  to  work 
"through the channels of multilateral diplomacy" and coordi-
nate  diplomatic  efforts  to  combat  global  warming,  $ 1103(c). 
Congress emphasized that "ongoing pollution and deforesta-
tion may be contributing now to an irreversible process" and 
that "[n]ecessary actions must be identified and implemented 
in time to protect the climate."  $ 1102(4). 

Meanwhile,  the  scientific  understanding  of climate  change 
progressed.  In  1990,  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Cli-
mate  Change  (IPCC),  a  multinational  scientific  body  orga-
nized under the auspices of the United Nations, published its 
first comprehensive report on the topic.  Drawing on expert 
opinions  from  across  the  globe,  the  IPCC  concluded  that

Responding  to  the  IPCC  report,  the  United  Nations  con-vened  the  "Earth  Summit"  in  1992  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The 

first President Bush attended and signed the United Nations Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  a 
nonbinding  agreement  among  154  nations  to  reduce  atmos-pheric  concentrations  of  carbon  dioxide  and  other  green-
house  gases  for  the  purpose  of  "prevent[ing]  dangerous  an-thropogenic  [

of  evidence  suggests  there  is  a  discernible  human  influence on  global  climate" 

14--the  UNFCCC  signatories  met  in 

Kyoto,  Japan,  and  adopted  a  protocol  that  assigned  manda-tory targets  for  industrialized  nations  to  reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions.  Because those targets did not apply to devel-oping and heavily polluting nations such as China and India, 
the  Senate  unanimously  passed  a  resolution  expressing  its sense that the United States should not enter into the Kyoto 
Protocol.  See  S.  Res.  98,  105th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  (July  25, 1997) (as passed).  President Clinton did not submit the pro-
tocol to the Senate for ratification.

Opinion of the Court 

II 
On October 20, 1999, a group of 19 private organizations 15 
filed  a  rulemaking  petition  asking  EPA  to  regulate  "green-
house gas  emissions  from  new motor  vehicles  under  $ 202  of 
the  Clean  Air  Act."  App.  5.  Petitioners  maintained  that 
1998 was the "warmest year on record"; that carbon dioxide, 
methane,  nitrous  oxide,  and  hydrofluorocarbons  are  "heat 
trapping  greenhouse  gases";  that  greenhouse  gas  emissions 
have  significantly  accelerated  climate  change;  and  that  the 
IPCC's 1995 report warned that "carbon dioxide remains the 
most  important  contributor  to  [manmade]  forcing  of  climate 
change."  Id.,  at  13  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted). 
The  petition  further  alleged  that  climate  change  will  have 
serious  adverse  effects  on  human  health  and  the  environ-
ment.  Id.,  at  22-35.  As  to  EPA's  statutory  authority,  the 
petition  observed  that  the  Agency  itself  had  already  con-
firmed  that  it  had  the  power  to  regulate  carbon  dioxide. 
See  id.,  at  18,  n.  21.  In  1998,  Jonathan  Z.  Cannon,  then 
EPA's  general  counsel,  prepared  a  legal  opinion  concluding 
that "CO2 emissions  are  within the  scope  of EPA's authority 
to regulate,"  even as he recognized that EPA had so far de-
clined to exercise that authority.  Id., at 54 (memorandum to 
Carol M. Browner, Administrator (Apr. 10, 1998) (hereinafter 
Cannon  memorandum)).  Cannon's  successor,  Gary  S.  Guzy, 
reiterated that opinion before a congressional committee just

Opinion of the Court 
two  weeks  before  the  rulemaking  petition  was  filed.  See 
id., at 61. 

Fifteen  months  after  the  petition's  submission,  EPA  re-quested public comment on "all the issues raised in [the] peti-

tion,"  adding  a  "particular"  request  for  comments  on  "any scientific,  technical,  legal,  economic  or  other  aspect  of  these 
issues  that  may  be  relevant  to  EPA's  consideration  of  this 
petition."  66  Fed.  Reg.  7486,  7487  (2001).  EPA  received more than 50,000 comments over the next five months.  See 

68 Fed. Reg. 52924 (2003). Before  the  close  of  the  comment  period,  the  White  House 
sought  "assistance  in  identifying  the  areas  in  the  science  of 
climate change where  there are  the greatest certainties and 
uncertainties"  from  the  National  Research  Council,  asking 
for a  response "as soon as possible."  App. 213.  The result 
was a 2001 report titled Climate Change Science: An Analy-
sis  of  Some  Key  Questions  (NRC  Report),  which,  drawing 
heavily  on  the  1995  IPCC  report,  concluded  that  "[g]reen-
house gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a re-
sult  of  human  activities,  causing  surface  air  temperatures 
and  subsurface  ocean  temperatures  to  rise.  Temperatures 
are, in fact, rising."  NRC Report 1. 

On September 8, 2003, EPA entered an order denying the 
rulemaking  petition.  68  Fed.  Reg.  52922.  The  Agency 
gave  two  reasons  for  its  decision:  (1)  that  contrary  to  the 
opinions  of  its  former  general  counsels,  the  Clean  Air  Act 
does  not  authorize  EPA  to  issue  mandatory  regulations  to 
address  global  climate  change,  see  id.,  at  52925-52929;  and 
(2)  that  even  if  the  Agency  had  the  authority  to  set  green-
house gas emission standards, it would be unwise to do so at 
this time, id., at 52929-52931. 

In  concluding  that  it  lacked  statutory  authority  over 
greenhouse  gases,  EPA  observed  that  Congress  "was  well 
aware of the global climate change issue when it last compre-
hensively  amended  the  [Clean  Air  Act]  in  1990,"  yet  it  de-
clined  to  adopt  a  proposed  amendment  establishing  binding

Opinion of the Court 
emissions limitations.  Id., at 52926.  Congress instead chose to authorize further investigation into climate change. 

Ibid. (citing $$ 103(g) and 602(e) of the Clean Air Act Amend-ments  of  1990,  104  Stat.  2652,  2703,  42  U. S. C.  $$ 7403(g)(1) 
and  7671a(e)).  EPA  further  reasoned  that  Congress'  "spe-cially  tailored  solutions  to  global  atmospheric  issues,"  68 
Fed. Reg. 52926--in particular, its 1990 enactment of a com-
prehensive  scheme  to  regulate  pollutants  that  depleted  the ozone layer, see Title  VI, 104 Stat.  2649, 42 U. S. C. $$ 7671- 

7671q--counseled  against  reading  the  general  authorization of  $ 202(a)(1)  to  confer  regulatory  authority  over  green-
house gases. 

EPA  stated  that  it  was  "urged  on  in  this  view,"  68  Fed. 
Reg. 52928, by this Court's decision in FDA v.  Brown & Wil-
liamson  Tobacco  Corp.,  529  U. S.  120  (2000).  In  that  case, 
relying  on  "tobacco['s]  unique  political  history,"  id.,  at  159, 
we  invalidated  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration's  reliance 
on  its  general  authority  to  regulate  drugs  as  a  basis  for  as-
serting  jurisdiction  over  an  "industry  constituting  a  signifi-
cant portion of the American economy," ibid. 

EPA  reasoned  that  climate  change  had  its  own  "political 
history":  Congress  designed  the  original  Clean  Air  Act  to 
address local  air  pollutants  rather  than a  substance  that "is 
fairly  consistent  in  its  concentration  throughout  the  world's 
atmosphere,"  68  Fed.  Reg.  52927;  declined  in  1990  to  enact 
proposed  amendments  to  force  EPA  to  set  carbon  dioxide 
emission  standards  for  motor  vehicles,  ibid.  (citing  H.  R. 
5966, 101st  Cong.,  2d Sess.  (1990)); and addressed  global cli-
mate  change  in  other  legislation,  68  Fed.  Reg.  52927.  Be-
cause of this political history, and because imposing emission 
limitations  on  greenhouse  gases  would  have  even  greater 
economic and political repercussions than regulating tobacco, 
EPA  was  persuaded  that  it  lacked  the  power  to  do  so.  Id., 
at  52928.  In  essence,  EPA  concluded  that  climate  change 
was  so  important  that  unless  Congress  spoke  with  exacting 
specificity, it could not have meant the Agency to address it.

Opinion of the Court 
Having  reached  that  conclusion,  EPA  believed  it  followed that  greenhouse  gases  cannot  be  "air  pollutants"  within  the 

meaning of the Act.  See ibid. ("It follows from this  conclu-sion,  that  [greenhouse  gases],  as  such,  are  not  air  pollutants 
under  the  [Clean  Air  Act's]  regulatory  provisions  .  .  .  "). The  Agency  bolstered  this  conclusion  by  explaining  that  if 
carbon  dioxide  were  an  air  pollutant,  the  only  feasible 
method  of  reducing  tailpipe  emissions  would  be  to  improve fuel  economy.  But  because  Congress  has  already  created 

detailed  mandatory  fuel  economy  standards  subject  to  De-partment of Transportation (DOT)  administration, the 
Agency concluded that EPA regulation would either conflict 
with those standards or be superfluous.  Id., at 52929. 

Even  assuming  that  it  had  authority  over  greenhouse 
gases, EPA  explained in detail  why  it would refuse  to exer-
cise  that  authority.  The  Agency  began  by  recognizing  that 
the  concentration  of  greenhouse  gases  has  dramatically  in-
creased  as  a  result  of  human  activities,  and  acknowledged 
the  attendant  increase  in  global  surface  air  temperatures. 
Id.,  at  52930.  EPA  nevertheless  gave  controlling  impor-
tance  to  the  NRC  Report's  statement  that  a  causal  link 
between  the  two  " `cannot  be  unequivocally  established.' " 
Ibid.  (quoting  NRC  Report 17).  Given  that  residual  uncer-
tainty, EPA concluded that regulating greenhouse gas emis-
sions would be unwise.  68 Fed. Reg. 52930. 

The  Agency  furthermore  characterized  any  EPA  regula-
tion  of  motor-vehicle  emissions  as  a  "piecemeal  approach" 
to climate change, id., at 52931, and stated that such regula-
tion  would  conflict  with  the  President's  "comprehensive 
approach"  to  the  problem,  ibid.  That  approach  involves 
additional  support  for  technological  innovation,  the  cre-
ation  of  nonregulatory  programs  to  encourage  voluntary 
private-sector  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and 
further  research  on  climate  change--not  actual  regulation. 
Id., at 52932-52933.  According to EPA, unilateral EPA reg-
ulation of motor-vehicle greenhouse gas emissions might also

Petitioners, now joined by intervenor States and local gov-ernments, sought review of EPA's order in the United States 

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.16  Al-though  each  of  the  three  judges  on  the  panel  wrote  a  sepa-
rate  opinion,  two  judges  agreed  "that  the  EPA  Administra-tor  properly  exercised  his  discretion  under  $ 202(a)(1)  in 
denying  the  petition  for  rule  making."  415  F.  3d  50,  58 (2005).  The  court  therefore  denied  the  petition  for  review. 

In  his  opinion  announcing  the  court's  judgment,  Judge Randolph avoided a definitive ruling as to petitioners' stand-
ing,  id.,  at  56,  reasoning  that  it  was  permissible  to  proceed to  the  merits  because  the  standing  and  the  merits  inquiries 
"overlap[ped],"  ibid.  Assuming  without  deciding  that  the statute authorized the EPA Administrator to regulate green-
house gas emissions that "in his judgment" may "reasonably be  anticipated  to  endanger  public  health  or  welfare,"  42 
U. S. C. $ 7521(a)(1), Judge Randolph concluded that the exer-cise  of  that  judgment  need  not  be  based  solely  on  scientific 
evidence,  but  may  also  be  informed  by  the  sort  of  policy judgments  that  motivate  congressional  action.  415  F.  3d, 
at 58.  Given  that framework, it was reasonable for EPA  to base its decision on scientific uncertainty as well as on other 
factors,  including  the  concern  that  unilateral  regulation  of U. S. motor-vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from other countries.  Ibid. Judge Sentelle  wrote separately  because he believed peti-
tioners failed  to "demonstrat[e]  the  element  of injury neces-

sary  to  establish  standing  under  Article  III."  Id.,  at  59 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in judgment).  In 

his  view,  they  had  alleged  that  global  warming  is  "harmful to  humanity  at  large,"  but  could  not  allege  "particularized

ers  of  Wildlife,  504  U. S.  555,  562  (1992)).  While  he  dis-
sented on  standing, however,  he  accepted  the  contrary view 
as the law of the case and joined Judge Randolph's judgment on the merits as the closest to that which he preferred.  415 

F. 3d, at 60-61. Judge  Tatel  dissented.  Emphasizing  that  EPA  nowhere 
challenged  the  factual  basis  of  petitioners'  affidavits,  id.,  at 
66,  he  concluded  that  at  least  Massachusetts  had  "satisfied 
each  element  of  Article  III  standing--injury,  causation,  and 
redressability," id.,  at 64.  In Judge  Tatel's view,  the  " `sub-
stantial  probability,' "  id.,  at  66,  that  projected  rises  in  sea 
level would lead to serious loss of coastal property was a "far 
cry" from the kind of generalized harm insufficient to ground 
Article III jurisdiction.  Id., at 65.  He found that petition-
ers' affidavits more than adequately supported the conclusion 
that EPA's failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions contrib-
uted to the sea level changes that threatened Massachusetts' 
coastal  property.  Ibid.  As  to  redressability,  he  observed 
that one of petitioners' experts, a former EPA climatologist, 
stated that " `[a]chievable reductions in emissions of CO2  and 
other [greenhouse gases] from U. S. motor vehicles would . . .  
delay  and  moderate  many  of  the  adverse  impacts  of  global 
warming.' "  Ibid.  (quoting  declaration  of  Michael  MacCracken,  former  Executive  Director,  U.  S.  Global  Change

one-time director of EPA's motor-vehicle pollution control ef-
forts  stated  in  an  affidavit  that  enforceable  emission  stand-
ards would lead to the development of new technologies that 
" `would  gradually  be  mandated  by  other  countries  around

Judge Tatel  explained at  length why he  believed the  text of 
the  statute provided EPA with authority to regulate green-
house  gas  emissions,  and  why  its  policy  concerns  did  not 
justify  its  refusal  to  exercise  that  authority.  415  F.  3d,  at

Article III of the Constitution limits federal-court jurisdic-

capable of resolution through the judicial process."  Flast v. 
Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 95 (1968).  It is therefore familiar learn-
ing that no justiciable "controversy" exists when parties seek 
adjudication of a political question, Luther v.  Borden, 7 How. 
1  (1849),  when  they  ask  for  an  advisory  opinion,  Hayburn's 
Case,  2  Dall.  409  (1792),  see  also  Clinton  v.  Jones,  520  U. S. 
681, 700, n. 33 (1997), or when the question sought to be adju-
dicated has been mooted by subsequent developments, Cali-
fornia  v.  San  Pablo  &  Tulare  R.  Co.,  149  U. S.  308  (1893). 
This case suffers from none of these defects. 

The parties' dispute  turns on the  proper construction of a 
congressional statute, a question  eminently suitable  to reso-
lution  in  federal  court.  Congress  has  moreover  authorized 
this  type  of  challenge  to  EPA  action.  See  42  U. S. C. 

$ 7607(b)(1).  That  authorization  is  of  critical  importance  to 
the standing inquiry: "Congress has the power to define inju-
ries  and  articulate  chains  of  causation  that  will  give  rise  to 
a  case  or  controversy  where  none  existed  before."  Lujan,

EPA maintains that because greenhouse gas emissions in-flict  widespread  harm,  the  doctrine  of  standing  presents  an 

insuperable  jurisdictional  obstacle.  We  do  not  agree.  At bottom,  "the  gist  of  the  question  of  standing"  is  whether 
petitioners  have  "such  a  personal  stake  in  the  outcome  of 
the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens  the  presentation of issues upon which  the  court so

some  possibility  that  the  requested  relief  will  prompt  the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly 
harmed  the  litigant.  Ibid.;  see  also  Sugar  Cane  Growers Cooperative of Fla. v.  Veneman, 289 F. 3d 89, 94-95 (CADC 
2002) ("A [litigant] who alleges a deprivation of a procedural protection  to  which  he  is  entitled  never  has  to  prove  that  if 
he  had  received  the  procedure  the  substantive  result  would have been altered.  All that is necessary is to show that the 
procedural  step  was  connected  to  the  substantive  result"). Only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to per-
mit us to consider the petition for review.  See Rumsfeld v. 
Forum  for  Academic  and  Institutional  Rights,  Inc.,  547 U. S. 47,  52,  n. 2  (2006).  We stress  here,  as  did  Judge Tatel 

below, the special position and interest of Massachusetts.  It is  of  considerable  relevance  that  the  party  seeking  review 
here  is  a  sovereign  State  and  not,  as  it  was  in  Lujan,  a pri-vate individual. 

Well  before  the  creation  of  the  modern  administrative state, we recognized that States are not normal litigants for 
the  purposes  of  invoking  federal  jurisdiction.  As  Justice Holmes  explained  in 

Georgia  v.  Tennessee  Copper  Co.,  206 U. S.  230, 237  (1907),  a  case in  which  Georgia  sought  to pro-

tect  its  citizens  from  air  pollution  originating  outside  its borders: 

"The  case  has  been  argued  largely  as  if  it  were  one between  two  private  parties;  but  it  is  not.  The  very 
elements  that  would  be  relied  upon  in  a  suit  between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief are want-
ing  here.  The  State  owns  very  little  of  the  territory alleged  to  be  affected,  and  the  damage  to  it  capable  of 
estimate  in  money,  possibly,  at  least,  is  small.  This  is a  suit  by  a  State  for  an  injury  to  it  in  its  capacity  of 
quasi-sovereign.  In  that  capacity  the  State  has  an  in-terest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens,

in  all  the  earth  and  air  within  its  domain.  It  has  the last  word as  to  whether its  mountains  shall  be  stripped 

of  their  forests  and  its  inhabitants  shall  breathe  pure air." 

Just  as  Georgia's  independent  interest  "in  all  the  earth  and air  within  its  domain"  supported  federal  jurisdiction  a 
century  ago,  so  too  does  Massachusetts'  well-founded  desire to  preserve  its  sovereign  territory  today.  Cf.  Alden  v. 
Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 715 (1999) (observing that in the federal system,  the  States  "are  not  relegated  to  the  role  of  mere 
provinces  or  political  corporations,  but  retain  the  dignity, though not the full authority, of sovereignty").  That Massa-
chusetts  does  in  fact  own  a  great  deal  of  the  "territory  al-leged  to  be  affected"  only  reinforces  the  conclusion  that  its 
stake  in  the  outcome  of  this  case  is  sufficiently  concrete  to warrant the exercise of federal judicial power. 

When a State enters the Union, it surrenders certain sov-ereign  prerogatives.  Massachusetts  cannot  invade  Rhode 
Island  to  force  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  it cannot  negotiate  an  emissions  treaty  with  China  or  India, 
and  in  some  circumstances  the  exercise  of  its  police  powers to  reduce  in-state  motor-vehicle  emissions  might  well  be 
pre-empted.  See  Alfred  L.  Snapp  &  Son,  Inc.  v.  Puerto 
Rico  ex  rel.  Barez,  458  U. S.  592,  607  (1982)  ("One  helpful indication  in  determining  whether  an  alleged  injury  to  the 

health  and  welfare  of  its  citizens  suffices  to  give  the  State standing  to  sue 

parens  patriae  is  whether  the  injury  is  one that  the  State,  if  it  could,  would  likely  attempt  to  address 

through its sovereign lawmaking powers"). These  sovereign  prerogatives  are  now  lodged  in  the  Fed-
eral Government, and Congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts  (among  others)  by  prescribing  standards  ap-
plicable  to  the  "emission  of  any  air  pollutant  from  any  class or classes of new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Admin-
istrator's]  judgment  cause,  or  contribute  to,  air  pollution which  may  reasonably  be  anticipated  to  endanger  public

and  Massachusetts'  stake  in  protecting  its  quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth is entitled to special solicitude 
in our standing analysis.17

Opinion of the Court 
With that in  mind, it is clear  that petitioners' submissions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the most de-

manding standards of the adversarial process.  EPA's stead-fast  refusal  to  regulate  greenhouse  gas  emissions  presents 
a  risk  of  harm  to  Massachusetts  that  is  both  "actual"  and "imminent." 

Lujan,  504  U. S.,  at  560  (internal  quotation 
marks  omitted).  There  is,  moreover,  a  "substantial  likeli-
hood  that  the  judicial  relief  requested"  will  prompt  EPA  to take steps to reduce that risk.

Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 79 (1978). 

The Injury 

The harms associated with climate change are serious and 
well  recognized.  Indeed,  the  NRC  Report  itself--which 
EPA  regards  as  an  "objective  and  independent  assessment 
of  the  relevant  science,"  68  Fed.  Reg.  52930--identifies  a 
number of environmental changes that have already inflicted 
significant  harms,  including  "the  global  retreat  of  mountain 
glaciers,  reduction  in  snow-cover  extent,  the  earlier  spring 
melting of ice on rivers and lakes, [and] the accelerated rate 
of  rise  of  sea  levels  during  the  20th  century  relative  to  the 
past few thousand years . . . ."   NRC  Report 16. 

Petitioners allege that this only hints at the environmental 
damage yet to come.  According to the climate scientist Mi-
chael  MacCracken,  "qualified  scientific  experts  involved  in 
climate change research" have reached a "strong consensus" 
that  global  warming  threatens  (among  other  things)  a  pre-
cipitate  rise  in  sea  levels  by  the  end  of  the  century,  MacCracken  Decl.  || 5,  Stdg.  App.  207,  "severe  and  irreversible 
changes  to natural ecosystems," id.,  || 5(d), at 209, a  "signifi-
cant reduction in water storage in winter snowpack in moun-

That  these  climate-change  risks  are  "widely  shared"  does 
not  minimize  Massachusetts'  interest  in  the  outcome  of  this 
litigation.  See Federal Election Comm'n v.  Akins, 524 U. S. 
11,  24  (1998)  ("[W]here  a  harm  is  concrete,  though  widely 
shared,  the  Court  has  found  `injury  in  fact' ").  According 
to petitioners'  unchallenged affidavits,  global  sea  levels  rose 
somewhere between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th cen-
tury as a result of global warming.  MacCracken Decl. || 5(c), 
Stdg.  App.  208.  These  rising  seas  have  already  begun  to 
swallow Massachusetts' coastal land.  Id., at 196 (declaration 
of  Paul  H.  Kirshen  || 5),  216  (MacCracken  Decl.  || 23).  Be-
cause the Commonwealth "owns a  substantial portion of the 
state's  coastal  property,"  id.,  at  171  (declaration  of  Karst  R.

capacity  as  a  landowner.  The  severity  of  that  injury  will 

18 In this regard, MacCracken's 2004 affidavit--drafted more than a year 
in  advance  of  Hurricane  Katrina--was  eerily  prescient.  Immediately 
after discussing the "particular concern" that climate change might cause 
an  "increase  in  the  wind  speed  and  peak  rate  of  precipitation  of  major 
tropical cyclones (i. e., hurricanes and typhoons)," MacCracken noted that 
"[s]oil  compaction,  sea level rise and recurrent  storms are destroying  ap-
proximately 20-30  square miles  of Louisiana  wetlands each  year.  These 
wetlands serve as a `shock absorber' for storm surges that could inundate 
New  Orleans,  significantly  enhancing  the  risk  to  a  major  urban  popula-
tion."  |||| 24-25, Stdg. App. 217.

Recreation]  owns,  operates and  maintains approximately  53 coastal  state

erates  and  maintains  sporting  and  recreational  facilities  in  coastal  areas, 
including  numerous  pools,  skating  rinks,  playgrounds,  playing  fields,  for-
mer  coastal  fortifications,  public  stages,  museums,  bike  trails,  tennis 
courts,  boathouses  and  boat  ramps  and  landings.  Associated  with  these 
coastal  properties  and  facilities  is  a  significant  amount  of  infrastructure, 
which  the  Commonwealth  also  owns,  operates  and  maintains,  including 
roads, parkways, stormwater pump stations, pier[s], sea wal[l] revetments

Causation 

EPA does not dispute the existence of a causal connection between  manmade  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  global 

warming.  At  a  minimum,  therefore,  EPA's  refusal  to  regu-late such emissions "contributes" to Massachusetts' injuries. 

EPA  nevertheless  maintains that  its decision  not  to regu-late greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles con-
tributes  so  insignificantly  to  petitioners'  injuries  that  the Agency cannot be haled into federal court to answer for them. 
For the same reason, EPA does not believe that any realistic possibility  exists  that the  relief petitioners seek would miti-
gate global climate change and remedy their injuries.  That is  especially  so  because  predicted  increases  in  greenhouse

Opinion of the Court 
gas  emissions  from  developing  nations,  particularly  China 
and  India,  are  likely  to  offset  any  marginal  domestic 
decrease. 

But  EPA  overstates  its  case.  Its  argument  rests  on  the 
erroneous assumption that a small incremental step, because 
it  is  incremental,  can  never  be  attacked  in  a  federal  judicial 
forum.  Yet  accepting  that  premise  would  doom  most  chal-
lenges  to  regulatory  action.  Agencies,  like  legislatures,  do 
not generally resolve massive problems in one fell regulatory 
swoop.  See  Williamson  v.  Lee  Optical  of  Okla.,  Inc.,  348 
U. S. 483, 489 (1955) ("[A] reform may take one step at a time, 
addressing  itself  to  the  phase  of  the  problem  which  seems 
most  acute  to  the  legislative  mind").  They  instead  whittle 
away at them over time, refining their preferred approach as 
circumstances  change  and  as  they  develop  a  more  nuanced 
understanding of how best to proceed.  Cf. SEC v.  Chenery 
Corp.,  332 U. S. 194, 202 (1947) ("Some principles must await 
their  own  development,  while  others  must  be  adjusted  to 
meet  particular,  unforeseeable  situations").  That  a  first 
step might be tentative does not by itself support the notion 
that  federal  courts  lack  jurisdiction  to  determine  whether 
that step conforms to law. 

And  reducing  domestic  automobile  emissions  is  hardly  a 
tentative  step.  Even  leaving  aside  the  other  greenhouse 
gases, the United States transportation sector emits an enor-
mous  quantity  of  carbon  dioxide  into  the  atmosphere--ac-
cording  to  the  MacCracken  affidavit,  more  than  1.7  billion 
metric  tons  in  1999  alone.  || 30,  Stdg.  App.  219.  That  ac-
counts  for  more  than  6%  of  worldwide  carbon  dioxide  emis-
sions.  Id.,  at  232  (Oppenheimer  Decl.  || 3);  see  also  MacCracken  Decl.  || 31,  at  220.  To  put  this  in  perspective: 
Considering  just  emissions  from  the  transportation  sector, 
which  represent  less  than  one-third  of  this  country's  total 
carbon dioxide emissions, the United States would still rank 
as  the  third-largest  emitter  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  world,

Opinion of the Court 
outpaced only  by the  European Union and China.22  Judged by any standard, U. S. motor-vehicle emissions make a mean-

ingful  contribution  to  greenhouse  gas  concentrations  and hence, according to petitioners, to global warming. 

The Remedy 

While  it  may  be  true  that  regulating  motor-vehicle  emis-sions  will  not  by  itself 

reverse  global  warming,  it  by  no means  follows  that  we  lack  jurisdiction  to  decide  whether 

EPA has a duty to take steps to slow or reduce it.  See also Larson v.  Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244, n. 15 (1982) ("[A] plain-
tiff  satisfies  the  redressability  requirement  when  he  shows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury to him-
self.  He need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his every injury").  Because of the enormity of the potential 
consequences  associated  with  manmade  climate  change,  the fact that the effectiveness of a remedy might be delayed dur-
ing  the  (relatively  short)  time  it  takes  for  a  new  motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant.

Nor is it dispositive that developing countries such as China and  India  are  poised  to  increase  greenhouse  gas  emissions

Opinion of the Court 
substantially over the next century: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, 

no matter what happens elsewhere. We  moreover  attach  considerable  significance  to  EPA's 
"agree[ment]  with  the  President  that  `we  must  address  the issue of global climate change,' " 68 Fed. Reg. 52929 (quoting 
remarks  announcing  Clear  Skies  and  Global  Climate  Initia-tives,  2002  Public  Papers  of  George  W.  Bush,  Vol.  1,  Feb. 
14,  p.  227  (2004)),  and  to  EPA's  ardent  support  for  various voluntary  emission-reduction  programs,  68  Fed.  Reg.  52932. 
As Judge Tatel observed  in  dissent below, "EPA  would pre-sumably not  bother with such efforts if it  thought emissions 
reductions  would  have  no  discernable  impact  on  future global warming."  415 F. 3d, at 66. 

In  sum--at  least  according  to  petitioners'  uncontested  af-fidavits--the  rise  in  sea  levels  associated with  global warm-
ing has already harmed and will continue to harm Massachu-setts.  The  risk  of  catastrophic  harm,  though  remote,  is 
nevertheless  real.  That  risk  would  be  reduced  to  some  ex-tent  if  petitioners  received  the  relief  they  seek.  We  there-
fore  hold  that  petitioners  have  standing  to  challenge  EPA's denial of their rulemaking petition.

Opinion of the Court 

V 
The  scope  of  our  review  of  the  merits  of  the  statutory  is-sues  is  narrow.  As  we  have  repeated  time  and  again,  an 

agency  has  broad  discretion  to  choose  how  best  to  marshal its limited resources and personnel to carry out its delegated 
responsibilities.  See  Chevron  U.  S.  A.  Inc.  v.  Natural  Re-
sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984). That  discretion  is  at  its  height  when  the  agency decides  not 

to  bring  an  enforcement  action.  Therefore,  in  Heckler  v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821 (1985), we held that an agency's refusal 
to initiate enforcement  proceedings  is  not  ordinarily subject to judicial review.  Some debate remains, however, as to the 
rigor  with  which  we  review  an  agency's  denial  of  a  petition for rulemaking. 

There  are  key  differences  between  a  denial  of  a  petition for  rulemaking  and  an  agency's  decision  not  to  initiate  an 
enforcement action.  See American Horse Protection Assn., 
Inc.  v.  Lyng,  812  F.  2d  1,  3-4  (CADC  1987).  In  contrast  to nonenforcement  decisions,  agency  refusals  to  initiate  rule-

making  "are  less  frequent,  more  apt  to  involve  legal  as  op-posed  to  factual  analysis,  and  subject  to  special  formalities, 
including a public explanation."  Id., at 4; see also 5 U. S. C. $ 555(e).  They moreover arise out of denials of petitions for 
rulemaking  which  (at  least  in  the  circumstances  here)  the affected  party  had  an  undoubted  procedural  right  to  file  in 
the  first  instance.  Refusals  to  promulgate  rules  are  thus susceptible  to  judicial  review,  though  such  review  is  "ex-

major  governmental  actions.  To  deny  standing  to  persons  who  are  in 
fact  injured  simply  because  many  others  are  also  injured,  would  mean 
that  the  most  injurious  and  widespread  Government  actions  could  be 
questioned  by  nobody.  We  cannot  accept  that  conclusion."  Ibid.  (cita-
tions omitted and emphasis added). 

It is moreover quite wrong to analogize the legal claim advanced by Mas-
sachusetts and the  other public and private entities who challenge  EPA's 
parsimonious construction of the Clean Air Act to a mere "lawyer's game."

"air  pollutant"  as  that  term  is  defined  in  $ 7602.  In  the  al-ternative,  it  concluded  that  even  if  it  possessed authority,  it 
would decline to do so because regulation would conflict with other  administration  priorities.  As  discussed  earlier,  the 
Clean  Air  Act  expressly  permits  review  of  such  an  action. $ 7607(b)(1).  We  therefore  "may  reverse  any  such  action 
found  to  be  .  .  .  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."  $ 7607(d)(9). 

VI 
On  the  merits,  the  first  question  is  whether  $ 202(a)(1)  of the  Clean  Air  Act  authorizes  EPA  to  regulate  greenhouse 

gas  emissions  from  new  motor  vehicles  in  the  event  that  it forms a "judgment" that such emissions contribute to climate 
change.  We  have  little  trouble  concluding  that  it  does.  In relevant part, $ 202(a)(1) provides that EPA "shall by regula-
tion prescribe . . . standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles 
or new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator's] judgment  cause,  or  contribute  to,  air  pollution  which  may 
reasonably  be  anticipated  to  endanger  public  health  or  wel-fare."  42  U. S. C.  $ 7521(a)(1).  Because  EPA  believes  that 
Congress  did  not  intend  it  to  regulate  substances  that  con-tribute  to  climate  change,  the  agency  maintains  that  carbon 
dioxide  is  not  an  "air  pollutant"  within  the  meaning  of  the provision. 

The  statutory  text  forecloses  EPA's  reading.  The  Clean Air Act's sweeping definition of "air pollutant" includes "any 
air  pollution  agent  or  combination  of  such  agents,  including 
any physical, chemical . . . substance or matter which is emit-

Opinion of the Court 
ted into or otherwise enters the ambient air . . . ."   $  7602(g) 
(emphasis  added).  On  its  face,  the  definition  embraces  all 
airborne compounds of whatever stripe, and underscores that 
intent  through  the  repeated  use  of  the  word  "any." 25  Car-
bon dioxide, methane, nitrous  oxide,  and hydrofluorocarbons 
are without a doubt "physical [and] chemical . . .  substance[s] 
which  [are]  emitted  into  .  .  .  the  ambient  air."  The  statute 
is unambiguous.26 

Rather  than  relying  on  statutory  text,  EPA  invokes  post-
enactment  congressional  actions  and  deliberations  it  views 
as  tantamount  to  a  congressional  command  to  refrain  from 
regulating  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Even  if  such  post-
enactment  legislative  history  could  shed  light  on  the  mean-
ing of an otherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA never identi-
fies  any  action  remotely  suggesting  that  Congress  meant  to 
curtail its power to treat greenhouse gases as air pollutants.

ing  emissions  limitations  to  combat  global  warming  tells  us nothing  about  what  Congress  meant  when  it  amended 

$ 202(a)(1) in 1970 and 1977.27  And unlike EPA, we have no difficulty reconciling Congress' various efforts to promote in-
teragency  collaboration  and  research  to  better  understand climate  change 

28  with  the  Agency's  pre-existing  mandate  to 

regulate  "any  air  pollutant"  that  may  endanger  the  public welfare.  See 42 U. S. C. $ 7601(a)(1).  Collaboration and re-

search do  not  conflict with  any thoughtful  regulatory effort; they complement it.

29 

EPA's  reliance  on  Brown  &  Williamson  Tobacco  Corp., 529 U. S. 120, is similarly misplaced.  In holding that tobacco 

products  are  not  "drugs"  or  "devices"  subject  to  Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation pursuant to the Food, 
Drug  and  Cosmetic  Act  (FDCA),  see  529  U. S.,  at  133,  we 

27 See United States v.  Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960) (holding that "the 
views  of  a  subsequent  Congress  form  a  hazardous  basis  for inferring  the 
intent  of  an  earlier  one");  see  also  Cobell  v.  Norton, 428  F.  3d  1070,  1075 
(CADC 2005) ("[P]ost-enactment legislative history is not only oxymoronic 
but inherently entitled to little weight").

$ 2901 et seq. (calling for the establishment of a National Climate Program 
and for additional climate-change research); Global Climate Protection Act

recting EPA and the Secretary of State to "jointly" develop a "coordinated

2938 (establishing for the "development and coordination of a comprehen-

climate  change  on  forestry  and  agriculture);  Energy  Policy  Act  of  1992,

retary of  Energy  to report  on  information pertaining  to  climate  change). 

29 We are moreover puzzled by EPA's roundabout argument that because 

later  Congresses  chose  to  address  stratospheric  ozone  pollution  in  a  spe-
cific legislative provision, it somehow follows that greenhouse gases cannot 
be air pollutants within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.

Opinion of the Court 
found  critical  at  least  two considerations  that  have  no  coun-terpart in this case. 

First,  we  thought  it  unlikely  that  Congress  meant  to  ban tobacco products, which the FDCA would have required had 
such  products  been  classified  as  "drugs"  or  "devices."  Id., at  135-137.  Here,  in  contrast,  EPA  jurisdiction  would  lead 
to  no  such  extreme  measures.  EPA  would  only  regulate 
emissions,  and  even  then,  it  would  have  to  delay  any  action "to  permit  the  development  and  application  of  the  requisite 

technology,  giving  appropriate  consideration  to  the  cost  of compliance,"  $ 7521(a)(2).  However  much  a  ban  on  tobacco 
products  clashed  with  the  "common  sense"  intuition  that 
Congress never meant to remove those products from circu-
lation, Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 133, there is noth-
ing  counterintuitive  to  the  notion  that  EPA  can  curtail  the 
emission  of  substances  that  are  putting  the  global  climate 
out of kilter. 

Second,  in  Brown & Williamson we  pointed  to  an  unbro-
ken series of congressional enactments that made sense only 
if adopted "against the backdrop of the FDA's consistent and 
repeated  statements  that  it  lacked  authority  under  the 
FDCA  to  regulate  tobacco."  Id.,  at  144.  We  can  point  to 
no  such  enactments  here:  EPA  has  not  identified  any  con-
gressional  action  that  conflicts  in  any  way  with  the  regula-
tion of greenhouse gases from  new  motor vehicles.  Even if 
it  had,  Congress  could  not  have  acted  against  a  regulatory 
"backdrop"  of disclaimers  of  regulatory  authority.  Prior  to 
the order that provoked this litigation, EPA had never disa-
vowed  the  authority  to  regulate  greenhouse  gases,  and  in 
1998 it in fact affirmed that it had such authority.  See App. 
54 (Cannon  memorandum).  There is no reason, much less a 
compelling  reason,  to  accept  EPA's  invitation  to  read  ambi-
guity into a clear statute. 

EPA  finally  argues  that  it cannot  regulate  carbon  dioxide 
emissions  from  motor  vehicles  because  doing  so  would  re-
quire  it  to  tighten  mileage  standards,  a  job  (according  to 

549US2 Unit: $U26 [04-07-10 15:12:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
532  MASSACHUSETTS  v.  EPA 

Opinion of the Court 
EPA) that Congress has assigned to DOT.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 52929.  But  that  DOT  sets  mileage  standards  in  no  way 

licenses  EPA  to  shirk  its  environmental  responsibilities. EPA  has been  charged with protecting  the public's  "health" 
and  "welfare,"  42  U. S. C.  $ 7521(a)(1),  a  statutory  obliga-tion  wholly  independent  of  DOT's  mandate  to  promote  en-
ergy  efficiency.  See  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act, $ 2(5), 89 Stat. 874, 42 U. S. C. $ 6201(5).  The two obligations 
may overlap, but there is no reason to think the two agencies cannot  both  administer  their  obligations  and  yet  avoid 
inconsistency. While  the  Congresses  that  drafted  $ 202(a)(1)  might  not 
have  appreciated  the  possibility  that  burning  fossil  fuels could lead to global warming, they did understand that with-
out  regulatory  flexibility,  changing  circumstances  and  sci-entific  developments  would  soon  render  the  Clean  Air  Act 
obsolete.  The broad language of $ 202(a)(1) reflects an inten-tional  effort  to  confer  the  flexibility  necessary  to  forestall 
such obsolescence.  See Pennsylvania  Dept. of Corrections v.  Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) ("[T]he fact that a statute 
can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Con-gress  does  not  demonstrate  ambiguity.  It  demonstrates 
breadth" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Because greenhouse  gases  fit  well  within  the  Clean  Air  Act's  capa-
cious  definition of "air pollutant," we  hold that EPA  has  the statutory  authority  to  regulate  the  emission  of  such  gases 
from new motor vehicles.  VII 

The  alternative  basis  for  EPA's  decision--that  even  if  it does have statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases, 
it would be unwise to do so at this time--rests on reasoning divorced  from  the  statutory  text.  While  the  statute  does 
condition the exercise of EPA's authority on its formation of a  "judgment,"  42  U. S. C.  $ 7521(a)(1),  that  judgment  must 
relate  to  whether  an  air  pollutant  "cause[s],  or  contribute[s] to,  air  pollution  which  may  reasonably  be  anticipated  to  en-

Opinion of the Court 
danger public health or welfare," ibid.  Put another way, the use of the word "judgment" is not a roving license to ignore 

the  statutory  text.  It  is  but  a  direction  to  exercise  discre-tion within defined statutory limits. 

If  EPA  makes  a  finding  of  endangerment,  the  Clean  Air Act requires the Agency to regulate emissions of the delete-
rious pollutant from new motor vehicles.  Ibid. (stating that 
"[EPA] shall by regulation prescribe . . . standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes 

of new motor vehicles").  EPA no doubt has significant lati-tude  as  to  the  manner,  timing,  content,  and  coordination  of 
its regulations with those of other agencies.  But once EPA 
has  responded  to  a  petition  for  rulemaking,  its  reasons  for 
action  or  inaction  must  conform  to  the  authorizing  statute. 
Under  the  clear  terms  of  the  Clean  Air  Act,  EPA  can  avoid 
taking  further  action  only  if  it  determines  that  greenhouse 
gases  do  not  contribute  to  climate  change  or  if  it  provides 
some  reasonable  explanation  as  to  why  it  cannot  or  will  not 
exercise its  discretion to  determine whether  they do.  Ibid. 
To  the  extent  that  this  constrains  agency  discretion  to  pur-
sue  other  priorities  of  the  Administrator  or  the  President, 
this is the congressional design. 

EPA has refused  to comply with this  clear statutory com-
mand.  Instead,  it  has  offered  a  laundry  list  of  reasons  not 
to regulate.  For example, EPA said that a number of volun-
tary  Executive  Branch  programs  already  provide  an  effec-
tive  response  to  the  threat  of  global  warming,  68  Fed.  Reg. 
52932,  that  regulating  greenhouse  gases  might  impair  the 
President's  ability  to  negotiate  with  "key  developing  na-
tions"  to  reduce  emissions,  id.,  at  52931,  and  that  curtailing 
motor-vehicle  emissions  would  reflect  "an  inefficient,  piece-
meal approach to address the climate change issue," ibid. 

Although we  have neither the expertise nor the authority 
to  evaluate  these  policy  judgments,  it  is  evident  they  have 
nothing  to  do  with  whether  greenhouse  gas  emissions  con-
tribute  to  climate  change.  Still  less  do  they  amount  to  a

reasoned  justification  for  declining  to  form  a  scientific  judg-ment.  In  particular,  while  the  President  has  broad  author-

ity  in  foreign  affairs,  that  authority  does  not  extend  to  the refusal  to  execute  domestic  laws.  In  the  Global  Climate 
Protection  Act  of  1987,  Congress  authorized  the  State  De-partment--not  EPA--to  formulate  United  States  foreign 
policy  with  reference  to  environmental  matters  relating  to 
climate.  See  $ 1103(c),  101  Stat.  1409.  EPA  has  made  no showing that it issued the ruling in question here after con-

sultation  with  the  State  Department.  Congress  did  direct EPA to consult with other agencies in the formulation of its 
policies  and  rules,  but  the  State  Department  is  absent  from 
that list.  $ 1103(b). 

Nor  can  EPA  avoid  its  statutory  obligation  by  noting  the 
uncertainty  surrounding  various  features  of  climate  change 
and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regu-
late at this time.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 52930-52931.  If the sci-
entific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from 
making  a  reasoned  judgment  as  to  whether  greenhouse 
gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so.  That 
EPA would prefer not to regulate greenhouse gases because 
of  some  residual  uncertainty--which,  contrary  to  Justice

(2006), both in newly constructed sources and those undergo-ing "modification," 42 U. S. C. $ 7411(a)(2).  Section 111(a) of 

the  1970  amendments  defined  this  term  within  the  NSPS scheme as "any  physical change in, or  change in the  method 
of  operation  of,  a  stationary  source  which  increases  the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which 
results  in  the  emission  of  any  air  pollutant  not  previously 
emitted," 42 U. S. C. $ 7411(a)(4). EPA's 1975 regulations implementing NSPS provided gen-

erally that "any physical or operational change to an existing facility  which  results  in  an  increase  in  the  emission  rate  to 
the atmosphere of any pollutant to which a standard applies shall  be  considered  a  modification  within  the  meaning  of 
section  111."  40  CFR  $ 60.14(a)  (1976).  Especially  signifi-cant  here  is  the  identification  of  an  NSPS  "modification"  as 
a  change  that  "increase[s]  .  .  .  the  emission  rate,"  which "shall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant discharged into 
the atmosphere."  $ 60.14(b).1 NSPS,  however,  did  too  little  to  "achiev[e]  the  ambitious 
goals  of the  1970 Amendments,"  R.  Belden, Clean  Air  Act  7 
(2001)  (hereinafter  Belden),  and  the  Clean  Air  Act  Amend-ments  of  1977,  91  Stat.  685,  included  the  PSD  provisions, 

which aimed at giving added protection to air quality in cer-tain  parts  of  the  country  "notwithstanding  attainment  and

maximum  rate  possible  for  the  technology,  see  40  CFR  $$ 60.14(a)-(b)

change  would  not  amount  to  a  "modification"  as  the  Act  de-fines  it.  Second,  the  PSD  regulations  defined  a  "net  emis-

sions  increase" as  "[a]ny  increase  in  actual  emissions  from  a particular physical change or change in the method of opera-
tion,"  net  of  other  contemporaneous  "increases  and  de-creases  in  actual  emissions  at  the  source."  $ 51.166(b)(3)(i). 
"Actual  emissions"  were  defined  to  "equal  the  average  rate, in  tons  per  year,  at  which  the  unit  actually  emitted  the  pol-
lutant during a two-year period which precedes the particu-lar date and which is representative of normal source opera-
tion."  $ 51.166(b)(21)(ii).  "[A]ctual  emissions"  were  to  be "calculated using the unit's actual operating hours [and] pro-
duction rates."  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
The  United  States  filed  this  action  in  2000,  claiming, among  other  things,  that  Duke  violated  the  PSD  provisions 

by  doing  this  work  without  permits.  Environmental  De-fense, North Carolina Sierra Club, and North Carolina Public 
Interest  Research  Group  Citizen  Lobby/Education  Fund  in-tervened  as  plaintiffs  and  filed  a  complaint  charging  similar 
violations. 

Duke  moved  for  summary  judgment,  one  of  its  positions being  that  none  of  the  projects  was  a  "major  modification" 

requiring a PSD permit because none increased hourly rates of  emissions.  The  District  Court  agreed  with  Duke's  read-
ing of the 1980 PSD regulations.  It reasoned that their ex-
press exclusion of " `[a]n increase in the hours of operation' " 
from  the  definition  of  a  " `physical  change  or  change  in  the 
method  of  operation' "  implied  that  "post-project  emissions 
levels  must  be  calculated  assuming"  preproject  hours  of  op-
eration.  278 F. Supp. 2d 619, 640-641 (MDNC 2003).  Con-
sequently,  the  District  Court  said,  a  PSD  "major  modifica-
tion" can occur "only if the project increases the hourly rate 
of  emissions."  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 
Act,  they  said,  judicial  review  for  validity  can  be  obtained only by a petition to the Court of Appeals for the District of 

Columbia  Circuit,  generally  within  60  days  of  EPA's  rule-making.  42 U. S. C. $ 7607(b). 

The Court of Appeals re jected this argument.  "Our choice  of  this  interpretation  of  the  PSD  regulations  .  .  .  is 
not  an  invalidation  of  those  regulations,"  it  said,  because "the  PSD  regulations  can  be  interpreted"  to  require  an  in-
crease in the hourly emissions rate as an element of a major "modification" triggering the permit requirement.  411 
F.  3d,  at  549,  n.  7.  To  show  that  the  1980  PSD  regulations are open to this construction, the Court of Appeals cited the 
conclusions of the District Court and the Reich opinions. We  granted  the  petition  for  certi orari  brought  by 

intervenor-plaintiffs,  547  U. S.  1127  (2006),  and  now  vacate. 

III 
The  Court  of  Appeals  understood  that  it  was  simply  con-struing  EPA's  1980  PSD  regulations  in  a  permissible  way 

that left them in harmony with their NSPS counterpart and, hence,  the  Act's  single  definition  of  "modification."  The 
plaintiffs  say  that  the  Court  of  Appeals  was  rewriting  the PSD  regulations  in  a  way  neither  required  by  the  Act  nor 
consistent with their own text. It  is  true  that  no  precise  line  runs  between  a  purposeful 
but permissible reading of the regulation adopted to bring it into  harmony  with  the  Court  of  Appeals's  view  of  the  stat-
ute,  and  a  determination  that  the  regulation  as  written  is invalid.  But  the  latter  occurred  here,  for  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals's  efforts  to  trim  the  PSD  regulations  to  match  their different NSPS  counterparts can  only be seen as an  implicit 
declaration that the PSD regulations were invalid as written. 

A 
In  applying  the  1980  PSD  regulations  to  Duke's  conduct, the  Court  of  Appeals  thought  that,  by  defining  the  term

Opinion of the Court 

B 
The Court of Appeals's reasoning that the PSD regulations 
must  conform  to  their  NSPS  counterparts  led  the  court  to read  those  PSD  regulations  in  a  way  that  seems  to  us  too 

far  a  stretch  for  the  language  used.  The  1980  PSD  regula-tions  on  "modification"  simply  cannot  be  taken  to  track  the 
Agency's regulatory definition under the NSPS. True,  the  1980  PSD  regulations  may  be  no  seamless  nar-
rative,  but  they  clearly  do  not  define  a  "major  modification" in  terms  of  an  increase  in  the  "hourly  emissions  rate."  On 
its  face,  the  definition  in  the  PSD  regulations  specifies  no 
rate  at  all,  hourly  or  annual,  merely  requiring  a  physical  or 
operational  change  "that  would  result  in  a  significant  net 
emissions  increase  of  any"  regulated  pollutant.  40  CFR 

$ 51.166(b)(2)(i).  But  even  when  a  rate  is  mentioned,  as  in 
the regulatory definitions of the two terms, "significant" and 
"net  emissions  increase,"  the  rate  is  annual,  not  hourly. 
Each  of  the  thresholds  that  quantify  "significant"  is  de-
scribed in "tons per year," $ 51.166(b)(23)(i), and a "net emis-
sions increase" is an "increase in actual emissions" measured 
against  an  "average"  prior  emissions  rate  of  so  many  "tons 

for  this  argument  in  the  statutory  text,  which  refers  to  the  statutory 
NSPS  definition  rather  than  the  regulatory  PSD  definition.  Although 
Duke  correctly  points out  that  "Congress  instructed  that the  bulk  of  the 
pre-existing rules `shall remain in effect,' " Brief for Respondent Duke 44 
(quoting  42  U. S. C.  $ 7478(a)),  this  instruction  was  a  temporary  measure 
"[u]ntil  such  time  as  an  applicable  implementation  plan  is  in  effect," 

$ 7478(a).  We  therefore  do  not  read  this  language  as  a  restriction  on 
EPA's  authority  to  interpret  the  statutory  PSD  provisions  reasonably  in 
a  manner  that  departs  from  the  1974  regulations.  Duke  also  invokes

Opinion of the Court 
an agency official does not authorize a court to read a regula-tion inconsistently with its language.

8 

In sum, the text of the 1980 PSD regulations on "modifica-tion" doomed the Court of Appeals's attempt to equate those 

regulations  with  their  NSPS  counterpart.  As  a  conse-quence,  we  have  to  see  the  Court  of  Appeals's  construction 
of  the  1980  PSD  regulations  as  an  implicit  invalidation  of those  regulations,  a  form  of  judicial  review  implicating  the 
provisions  of  $ 307(b)  of  the  Act,  which  limit  challenges  to the  validity  of  a  regulation  during  enforcement  proceedings 
when  such  review  "could  have  been  obtained"  in  the  Court of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  within  60 
days of EPA rulemaking.  See 42 U. S. C. $ 7607(b); see also

not  be  corrected  by  review  under  the  DTA  which  provides  for  no augmentation  of  the  record  on  appeal  and,  as  noted  above,  will 
provide  no  remedy  for  any  constitutional  violation.  See  DTA $ 1005(e)(2)(C),  119  Stat.  2742;  476  F.  3d,  at  1005  (Rogers,  J.,  dis-
senting).  Here,  as  in  Hamdan,  supra,  at  589-590,  petitioners have  a  compelling  interest  in  assuring  in  advance  that  the  proce-
dures  to  which  they  are  subject  are  lawful.  And  here,  unlike Hamdan,  the  military  tribunals  in  Guantanamo  have  completed 
their  work;  all  that  remains  are  the  appeals.  For  all  these  rea-sons,  I  would  grant  the  petitions. 

II 
Moreover, I would expedite our consideration.  In the past, this Court  has  expedited  other  cases  where  important  issues  and  a 

need  for  speedy  consideration  were  at  stake.  In  Ex  parte Quirin,  317  U. S.  1  (1942),  the  Court  decided  that  it  should  grant 
expedited  consideration, 

"[i]n view of the public importance of the questions  raised by [the]  petitions  and  of  the  duty  which  rests  on  the  courts,  in 

time  of  war  as  well  as  in  time  of  peace,  to  preserve  unim-paired  the  constitutional  safeguards  of  civil  liberty,  and  be-
cause  in  our  opinion  the  public  interest  required  that  we consider  and  decide  those  questions  without  any  avoidable 
delay."  Id.,  at  19. 
See  also  Felker  v.  Turpin,  518  U. S.  651  (1996);  New  York  Times Co.  v.  United  States,  403  U. S.  713  (1971)  (per  curiam);  Youngs-

town  Sheet  &  Tube  Co.  v.  Sawyer,  343  U. S.  579  (1952). For  these  reasons,  I  would  grant  the  petitions  for  certio-
rari  and  the  motions  to  expedite  the  cases  in  accordance  with the  schedule  deemed  acceptable  (in  the  alternative)  by  the 
Government.
